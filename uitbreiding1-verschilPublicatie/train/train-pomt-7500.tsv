pomt-04763	Says Republicans supported legislation on early voting and in-person voting in 2005.	true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/28/teresa-fedor/teresa-fedor-says-republicans-supported-ohios-earl/	With the presidential election hanging on a handful of states including Ohio, Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over the election rules and regulations governing November's election. Ohio Democrats aren't happy with Republican efforts to limit early voting, and one of the main points of contention is a GOP-backed law that eliminated in-person early voting over the final weekend before Election Day. Democrats sued in federal court to stop the law from taking effect, and held a news conference Aug. 15, 2012, outside the courthouse following an initial hearing. A key argument Democrats raised is that Republicans are attempting to trim the early voting period because they are upset that President Barack Obama used early voting to help win a key victory in Ohio in 2008. They offer as proof the fact that GOP lawmakers supported the early voting period when it was approved by state lawmakers before Obama's victory. State Rep. Teresa Fedor, a Toledo Democrat, made that very point: "Republicans voted for early voting and in-person voting back in 2005, signed 2006," Fedor told reporters. "It seems as though they are clawing back now that we've had 95,000 or more vote in 2008." Did Republicans support the early voting and in-person voting when it was passed into law before the 2008 election? PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the record. For the record, Republicans have said they merely are trying to rein in the costs of early voting and in-person voting for local boards of elections. They also point out that for the first time ever all Ohio voters will get an absentee ballot request form sent to them in the mail so having early voting just prior to Election Day isn't as needed as it used to be. But for purposes of this fact check, the question is who supported the initial law changes that enacted the early voting provisions. We turned to the office of Secretary of State Jon Husted, Ohio's chief elections official, and asked for information about when the early voting and in-person voting provisions became Ohio law. Matt McClellan, a Husted spokesman, told PolitiFact Ohio that the General Assembly passed in-person voting and early voting as part of House Bill 234. The bill establishes "no-fault" absentee voting -- meaning that those requesting absentee ballots no longer needed to give for the request -- but "also provides the option of voting in person at a Board of Elections or other site designated by the Board of Elections prior to Election Day," McClellan said in an email. The actual language for this is found in Ohio Revised Code Sec. 3509.03. It states that "when absent voter's ballots are delivered to an elector at the office of the board, the elective may retire to a voting compartment provided by the board and there mark the ballots." The bill initially passed the Ohio House on June 21, 2005. The Senate approved legislation on Oct. 18, 2005. However, the Senate substantially altered the bill in its session -- including adding the in-person early voting. The House voted to accept those changes on Oct. 19, 2005. Gov. Bob Taft signed the bill and it became law on Jan. 27, 2006. Official accounts of each chamber's vote are kept in the Ohio House and Senate Journals and they show that the Senate vote was a party-line vote of 22-10 with all 22 Senate Republicans voting for the bill and all 10 Democrats present voting against it. The second House vote -- after the early voting language had been added to the bill -- was 60 to 36. All Republicans were in support. All Democrats were opposed. News accounts of the debate show that while Democrats agreed with the legislation, they were upset that the no-fault absentee provision was being passed by GOP lawmakers just weeks before Ohioans were going to the polls to vote on a proposal to expand absentee voting opportunities. It appears as though there was no debate at the time over the provision which swung open the doors to early in-person voting. So where does this leave us? Fedor’s claim was that early voting and that Republicans have sought to limit was originally supported by Republicans. That contention is backed by records from the secretary of state's office and legislative voting records. Votes in the House and Senate were cast along party lines with Republicans supporting the measure. Democrats were in opposition, citing what they said were concerns over the timing of the measure. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates True.	None	Teresa Fedor	None	None	None	2012-08-28T06:00:00	2012-08-15	['None']
pomt-14969	HIV/AIDS is "dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/19/elton-john/elton-john-right-south-focus-hiv-alarm/	Celebrity just keeps elbowing its way into the 2016 presidential race. It could be argued that it started with Donald Trump. The man known best to many Americans as the star of the long-running "Apprentice" reality TV show jumped into the presidential race in June and into first place in the crowded field of Republican contenders. And it continued last week in advance of the first Democratic debate. That’s when CNN decided to ask some of the rich and famous what question they’d like to put to candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. Celebrities Katy Perry and Margaret Cho said they’d pose questions about LGBT rights and the abortion/Planned Parenthood funding flap. Other headliners said they would press the candidates on the hot-button issues of gun control, jobs for the middle class and medical marijuana. Atlanta’s own part-time celebrity-in-residence -- Sir Elton John -- said his question to the candidates would be about his personal passion, the fight against HIV/AIDS. "In spite of great progress, HIV/AIDS is actually dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South. What would you do as president to help stop this epidemic, particularly among minority communities?" John said he’d ask. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, about 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and about 12.8 percent of them don’t know they’re infected. HIV/AIDS didn’t wind up a discussion point in the first Democratic debate. But PolitiFact Georgia decided John had a point worth checking. Is HIV/AIDS dramatically on the rise in the South? We began our fact-check by contacting the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York City, asking for evidence backing up John’s statement. The foundation was quick to respond, sending us, among other things, a link to a story that appeared in The Washington Post in September 2014 under the headline "Southern States are now epicenter of HIV/AIDS in the U.S." The article quoted Rainey Campbell, then-executive director of the nonprofit Southern AIDS Coalition, as saying Southern states now have the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses, the largest percentage of people living with the disease and the most people dying from it. The foundation also sent a link to a report by the Southern HIV/AIDS Strategy Initiative (SASI) from November 2012, examining HIV epidemiology in the South using 2010 data from the CDC and other government agencies. The report focused on nine states in the South that were identified as "particularly affected by HIV" -- Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The targeted states had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States -- 23.8 per 100,000 -- according to the CDC data, the report found. The South, the report said, makes up a third of the country’s population, but is home to more than half of the new HIV diagnoses. Nine of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest HIV incidence rates, and seven of the 10 with the highest AIDS incidence rates, were in the targeted states, according to the report. We decided to check in ourselves with the Atlanta-based CDC to see if we could learn more. Ranking regions by the rate of new HIV diagnoses, the South is highest with 24,323 new cases, or a ratio of 20.5 per 100,00 population, based on the latest data available from 2013. Next highest is the Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont), with 8,908 new HIV diagnoses, or 15.9 per 100,000 population. The West (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) is next with 8,013 new diagnoses, or 10.8 per 100,000 population. And the last is the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) with 6,109 new diagnosis, 9 per 100,000 population, according to the CDC. So clearly the South has a big problem. But we still weren’t sure whether any of this proved that HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the South. Couldn’t it be that other regions are doing a better job with education/treatment? Nic Carlisle, executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition, said it’s likely "a combination of both." The most recent CDC surveillance report shows the country was making moderate progress until 2011, when the number of new diagnosis started moving in the wrong direction again -- with only the West showing a decrease in 2012-2013, Carlisle said. The increases were 3.4 percent in the Midwest, 3.2 percent in the Northeast, but substantially greater -- 7.5 percent for the South in 2012-2013, he said. "True, we’ve have made remarkable progress in addressing the HIV epidemic in the United States. Treatment advances have transformed what was once a fatal diagnosis into a chronic disease for many," Carlisle said. "Unfortunately, while the rest of the country reaps the benefits of this progress, the South is in danger of being left behind." Even the Obama administration recognizes the need to stem the widening HIV-related health disparities that plague the South. In its update to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), the administration set a goal of reducing disparities in the rate of new diagnoses by at least 15 percent among persons living in the Southern United States, Carlisle said. Patrick Sullivan, a professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who has spent much of his career on HIV/AIDS research, said it’s true that the Southern U.S. is disproportionately impacted by HIV. The increases in new diagnoses in the South are occurring only in specific subgroups, Sullivan said. "When we look more specifically at HIV diagnoses among young, 13-24 year old, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the South, the story is different: according to CDC data, there was a 25 percent increase in new HIV diagnoses in young gay men in the South between 2008 and 2013. For epidemiologists, this is indeed a dramatic increase," he said. "Finally, even when considering the lack of increases in HIV diagnoses in the South overall, it’s important to note that new HIV infections and new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. have both been stubbornly stable at around 45,000 to 50,000 cases each year," Sullivan said. "And in this context, the lack of substantial decreases in new HIV infections is also a dramatic public health problem." The Elton John AIDS Foundation has made 31 grants worth a combined $1.4 million aimed at addressing the South's HIV/AIDS epidemic. These includes grants worth $315,000 given out earlier this year, in partnership with The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, to six organizations. The Equality Foundation of Georgia and the Racial Justice Action Center, both in Atlanta, were among the latest grant recipients Our ruling CDC data support the claim of superstar and part-time Atlanta resident Elton John that the South is the region most dramatically affected by the HIV epidemic. Whether that’s because cases are rising in the South or declining in other regions, or a combination of both, is not entirely a clear. Data from 2012-13 shows new HIV diagnoses on the rise in most parts of the country, with the largest -- a 7.5 percent increase -- in the South. John’s overarching point is that the South has seen an increase in AIDS/HIV, greater than any other region in the nation. The data supports that. You can quibble about whether there is enough of a trend line to term this a dramatic jump in cases. That takes his statement down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate John’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08406	"You worked hard for your money and you paid your taxes when you earned it. Now, (Indiana Republican congressional candidate) Todd Young wants to tax it again when you spend it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/21/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/seiu-blasts-indiana-gop-challenger-todd-young-over/	We've written before about a conservative proposal called the "Fair Tax," which would eliminate the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes and replace them with a 23 percent national sales tax. Supporters say it would reduce the cost of compliance and close loopholes. Critics counter that it would be regressive and would actually require a higher rate than the advertised 23 percent. Whatever the truth of these claims, Democrats clearly consider it a winning issue: They've used the Fair Tax as the basis for many ads against Republicans this year, one of which we recently rated Half True. We noticed the issue crop up once again in a close House contest between incumbent Democratic Rep. Baron Hill and Republican attorney Todd Young to represent a swing district in southern Indiana. Here's what caught our eye in an Oct. 20, 2010, ad placed by the political arm of the Service Employees International Union. The ad says Young, "supports a 23 percent national sales tax on everything you buy -- food and clothing, even medicine. You worked hard for your money and you paid your taxes when you earned it. Now, Todd Young wants to tax it again when you spend it. Attacking Social Security and taxing seniors twice? Indiana can't afford Todd Young." Let's start by exploring the evidence that Young supports the Fair Tax, or something like it. The issues page of Young's campaign website urges Congress to "immediately simplify our complicated tax code — and reward work, savings, and investment — by replacing the current code with either a consumption-based tax or a flatter tax." Democrats have also pointed to instances in which Young cited the Fair Tax by name, including in a North Vernon Republican debate on April 10, 2010. When we asked the Young campaign for his official position, they pointed us to an Oct. 21, 2010, article in the Jeffersonville News and Tribune in which Young said he is flexible on which tax system to use. "Young said a better approach than the Fair Tax would be a system that would give options where people could choose to stay with what they’re familiar with or go for a simpler tax code," the newspaper reported. "Whatever tax reform proposal we move towards, I have to ensure in order to get my support that it doesn’t involve raising taxes." Still, even if Young is backing off specific support for the Fair Tax, we do think there's enough evidence that he once supported it, or supported something very similar to it, to make it fair game for the SEIU. Now to the substance of the ad's charges. One issue is the ad's reference to taxing "food and clothing, even medicine." This statement is largely correct, but there's an important caveat. While the Fair Tax would indeed tax such items, it would also include a "prebate" -- an advance refund intended to cover the costs of such basic purposes. Still, the prebate would be a flat amount pegged to family size, and would not directly exempt purchases of food, clothing or medicine but would rather compensate families indirectly for a portion of the sales tax they pay. So we think the SEIU's wording is justified. But the issue in the ad that most intrigued us is the notion of double taxation. After watching a variety of ads about the Fair Tax, we had yet to see one that explicitly called the Fair Tax double taxation. And that set off alarm bells for us, since the Fair Tax, whatever you think of it as a policy, is definitely not designed to be layered on top of the current tax code. It is explicitly designed to replace the current tax code. Both PolitiFact and our friends at FactCheck.org have criticized ads that gloss over the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the current tax code. In a previous Truth-O-Meter item, we said that the absence of such context in an ad by Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., amounted to "a very deceptive omission." But not even Lincoln's ad went so far as to say, pure and simple, that the 23 percent sales tax amounted to double taxation. So we approached this ad thinking it might earn a Pants on Fire. Then we checked with the SEIU. They acknowledged that the Fair Tax would be a replacement for the current tax system. But they made an interesting point -- that for seniors, the explicit target audience for the ad, there is something that you might call double taxation. For many years, seniors paid taxes on their income when they earned it. Whatever they didn't spend, they saved, and in their retirement years, when they aren't earning fresh income that would be tax-free under the Fair Tax, those accumulated savings would be spent -- and thus taxed at 23 percent. Voila -- double taxation. To see whether this argument holds any water, we checked in with an ideological cross-section of economists. In general, they agreed that SEIU had a point. When we contacted Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, he referred us to a 2007 article he wrote in the journal Tax Notes titled, "Why the Fair Tax Won't Work." Bartlett said the proposal "penalizes those who are older who have saved for their retirement during an era when saving was heavily penalized by the income tax. But rather than being able to spend their savings tax free, as they anticipated, they will now have to pay sales taxes on everything they buy, including health care. It will be hard for them to avoid seeing this as a double tax. Bob Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed that the Fair Tax double-taxes savings. "It's a transition issue that would disappear in time, once all savings held at the time of transition have been spent," Williams said. "The ad is clearly aimed at seniors, for whom the issue is definitely valid." Williams added that seniors would also fail to get much of a benefit from the Fair Tax's elimination of income tax because "most Social Security income is not subject to income tax." Dan Mitchell, a tax policy specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized the ad for leaving out the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the income tax. But he acknowledged that "there is potentially an element of truth to the secondary point about taxing seniors who earned money while young, paid income tax, saved some of the after-tax money, and now want to spend that money." Mitchell added that not all seniors would be affected equally -- it would more heavily affect seniors who had substantial savings outside of 401(k)s or other plans in which income is not taxed initially. So where does this leave us? We think SEIU makes a legitimate point that seniors -- the group that is specifically singled out for mentions in the ad's narration and in its visuals -- would face what amounts to double taxation of their savings if the Fair Tax were to pass. But we're also wary of giving this a full True rating, because we think that most viewers watching the ad would assume that the 23 percent tax would be levied on top of the existing income tax (which, we'll point out, is referenced at one point by a visual of someone filling out an IRS Form 1040). And it's simply not part of the plan for Americans to be hit by both the current tax code and the Fair Tax simultaneously. On balance, we give the ad a rating of Half True.

pomt-14575	Ohio’s credit rating is "as high as you can get, AA+."	false	/ohio/statements/2016/feb/08/john-kasich/john-kasich-wrongly-says-ohios-credit-rating-aa-to/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich is using the economic turnaround in Ohio to help make his case for president. In a recent interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Kasich touted the state’s credit rating as part of his success story. "Guess what, our credit -- up. Think about our pensions -- solid," Kasich said. "What’s your credit rating?" Hannity asked. "It’s as high as you can get, AA+," Kasich responded. "What about AAA?" Hannity asked. "I don’t think you can really get to AAA," Kasich said, Is AA+ the highest credit rating a state could receive? That sounded dubious to us, so we wanted to investigate. For this analysis, we’re focusing on the state’s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state’s ability to pay its debts.This rating, which is kind of like a person’s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Neither Kasich’s campaign nor the governor’s office responded to us by our deadline. Standard and Poor’s sent PolitiFact Ohio its entire history of U.S. state ratings. The history shows when Ohio was first rated, in 1984, it earned AA, and it held there until upgrading to AA+ in 1996. S&P has an additional, forward-looking catagory for ratings which include "negative," "stable," and positive," and while Ohio has cycled through "stable" to "negative" twice in recent history (the outlook was "negative" in 2002 and again in 2009), the AA+ rating has remained unchanged for 20 years. Critical to Kasich’s claim, S&P indeed has a AAA credit rating. And several states have the highest mark. Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming -- are all rated AAA, according to S&P. Three of those states -- Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia -- have held their perfect scores for 50 years or more. For the record, Moody’s and Fitch also issues AAA ratings. Don Chance, a professor of finance at Louisiana State University, said it’s impressive for a state government to maintain a positive credit rating in difficult economic times. But, on the merits of the claim, Kasich is clearly mistaken. "I think he probably got caught up in the moment, caught up reeling off the bullet points," Chance said, noting that Kasich previously worked at Lehman Brothers. Our ruling Kasich said on Fox News that his state of Ohio earned the highest possible credit rating, at AA+. When host Hannity asked about a AAA rating, Kasich said, "I don’t think you can really get to AAA." In fact, you can, and 15 other states currently hold a AAA credit rating, according to S&P. We rate this statement False.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2016-02-08T09:58:29	2016-01-29	['Ohio']
pomt-14094	Says Katie McGinty "actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/16/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-katie-mcginty-agrees-hillary-clint/	Correction appended During a recent broadcast of Dom Giordano’s Philadelphia talk radio show on 1210AM, as Buzzfeed reported, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., called it outrageous that Democratic nominee Katie McGinty tied him to GOP Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. The two have wasted no time battling it out ever since McGinty won the Democratic primary April 26 to take on Toomey in the general election. As a comeback, Toomey compared McGinty’s campaign stances to those of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. "She actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything," said Toomey. We reached out to Toomey’s campaign for more background. "The only times McGinty has publicly deviated from the Obama and Clinton agenda are when she's gone even further to the left, like embracing Bernie Sanders-style single-payer healthcare and defending sanctuary cities," Communications Director Ted Kwong said to PolitiFact PA in an email statement. Many observers would dispute aligning Clinton with party’s most liberal faction. Nevertheless, we looked through issues backed by two candidates, and we found that Toomey’s claim doesn’t hold up entirely. Sure, there are plenty of things McGinty and Clinton agree on. Both cite a need for good-paying jobs and strengthening America’s clean energy economy — just two examples out of many. But, we haven’t found evidence to prove that Clinton and McGinty agree on each issue. Actually, we were able to find a couple on which their views don’t align. One of Clinton’s big campaign issues is that "climate change is an urgent threat," and she says we need to "invest in clean energy innovations." McGinty has the same stance. However, when you look at fracking, McGinty’s views set her apart from much of the party. Clinton’s position has evolved some, but at present she believes fracking should only be permitted if the local residents approve. McGinty on the other hand thinks, with proper taxation and regulation, fracking should get the green light. The two democratic nominees also have had very different histories with free trade. Clinton’s position on NAFTA is complicated, to say the least. When Bill Clinton first signed the agreement into law in 1993, Hillary Clinton publicly supported it, but that support has waned over time. She most recently publicly backed NAFTA in her autobiography written in 2003 and in a teleconference that took place in 2004. Since that time, Clinton has not made public statements defending the free trade agreement. In fact, in 2008 Clinton called herself a "critic of NAFTA from the very beginning." In reality, Clinton’s public position on NAFTA has certainly shifted over the past few years. McGinty’s stance on NAFTA has also evolved, but her present position is much less convoluted. In a democratic debate live from the University Park campus of Penn State last month, McGinty called NAFTA "something that hasn’t worked in 30 years." So, it’s not the case to say that the two candidates agree on everything. It would be more accurate to say they share the vast majority of issues that they’ve endorse publicly. This is pretty common in Democratic races. In the lead-up to the primary, polling expert G. Terry Madonna told TribLive that McGinty differed little in stances from her fellow Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Joe Sestak. "This campaign is about personalities and style," Madonna said. "On 100 issues in the Senate, these candidates would probably vote the same way on 98 of them. I don't think the issues are as defining as who these candidates are." Richardson Dilworth, director of the Center for Public Policy at Drexel University, argued that campaign stances aren’t always directly representative of a candidate’s personal beliefs, but of the campaign’s stakeholders, of the constituencies the politician is aiming to attract. Looking beyond established platforms, two candidates can differ on more than their common planks would suggest. "There’s a distinction between [Clinton’s] personal opinions and what she promises as a candidate. Those two things don’t have to agree. There’s no reason to expect that she’s going to have the same personal opinions as she would have about positions she publicly takes because the positions she has to take as a candidate are going to be negotiations among many stakeholders," Dilworth said. Dilworth thinks McGinty’s and Clinton’s strong similarities are no coincidence, though. "Pennsylvania is, to a certain extent, representative of the country, more so than many other states," said Dilworth. "In that respect, McGinty will be making a lot of the same pitches as Hillary Clinton because she’s going for the same kinds of voters." Our ruling Senator Pat Toomey stated that Katie McGinty agrees with Hillary Clinton on everything. After closer inspection, it has become clear that although McGinty and Clinton share similar positions on many issues, there are a couple of significant instances where their opinions differ. Furthermore, many of their shared opinions can be attributed to the similarities in their intended audiences. McGinty and Clinton have expressed similar public opinions on many issues, but it wouldn’t be wholly accurate to say that they agree with each other on everything. We rate the claim Half True. An earlier version of this story characterized Katie McGinty's views on fracking as in line with Bernie Sanders. This is inaccurate. As the article describes, she is pro-fracking, provided taxes and fair regulation are in place. Sanders is decidedly anti-fracking.

pomt-00428	Says the "South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers" and alleges a "large scale killing of farmers" in the country.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/24/donald-trump/trump-tweets-incorrect-south-african-land-seizures/	Fox News host Tucker Carlson and President Donald Trump are among a group of U.S. conservatives raising alarm bells about something happening half a world away in South Africa. "The president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, has begun ... seizing land from his own citizens without compensation because they are the wrong skin color," Tucker began his show Aug. 22. "That is literally the definition of racism." Trump chimed in soon thereafter on Twitter, tagging accounts for both Carlson and Fox News and going even further to decry murders of farmers. Trump said that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate "the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s statement that the South African government is "seizing land from white farmers" is misleading. As for his claim that there is "large scale killing of farmers" in the country, that is flat-out wrong. A brief history of South African reparations South Africa is a country marred by its long history of racial discrimination. From 1948 until 1994, the country lived under apartheid rule; members of different races were forbidden from interacting, and black South Africans were forced under law to live in much worse conditions than white citizens. In 1959, the government required many black landowners to give up their property and rent homes with white landlords. Over the course of apartheid, non-white families lost their homes and lands. When apartheid ended in the mid 1990s, the government passed measures to help black South Africans to recover from decades of discrimination and abuse. The effects of apartheid still reverberate through the country, especially when it comes to a distribution of land: 72 percent of farmland in South Africa is owned by white people, while whites make up about 9 percent of the population. Selling or seizing? One of the reparations, first passed in 1994, is the Restitution of Land Rights Act. Under this law, black families and communities who had property taken from them before or during apartheid can file a claim for it. The government and current landowners negotiate for the area. If they cannot reach a compromise, the government can use expropriation -- the power of the state to take land for the public good. On Aug. 19, South Africa’s restitutions policy made headlines when the government moved ahead with plans to buy a hunting retreat. The current owners, the Akkerland Boerdery company, say that the government offered them only 10 percent of the market value for their property. In the Restitution of Land Rights Act, the land reform minister is given the right to expropriate land that rightfully belongs to another group. However, the act also says that the compensation for that land is to be determined "either by agreement or by the Court." The owners of Akkerland, who did not agree to the government’s offer, said they had been denied the opportunity to argue in court. The ruling party in South Africa, the African National Congress, has been working to make land expropriation easier for the government. Most notably, they plan to begin allowing the government to take land without offering compensation to speed up the restitution of land ownership to black South Africans. A leading ANC chairman also created controversy in July, when he said that farmers with more than 25,000 acres should have land taken from them. Back to Trump Trump’s framing about the South African government "seizing land from white farmers" omits critical context and leaves the wrong impression. The South African government is not seizing land of white farmers. Instead, they are negotiating with white farmers to buy back land that had been wrongfully taken from black communities during apartheid. The government is considering changing the constitution so they can acquire the land without paying the current owners. However, in every exchange made so far, they have paid current owners for their property loss. The government has not taken steps to limit farmers to 25,000 acres. Farmer danger Now to the second part of Trump’s tweet: the "large-scale killing" of South African farmers. The statistics on this are nebulous. Our partner Africa Check concluded in May that there were significant roadblocks to identifying the rate of farm murders. To calculate a rate, one would need the number of murders, and divide that by the total number of farmers. However, the murder rate could include anyone visiting or working on a farm, not just farm owners. Additionally, there are no accurate estimates of farms or farmers in the country. Africa Check determined that it is "near impossible" to determine an accurate murder rate for farmers. Calculated based solely on a 2007 commercial agriculture census, the rate is about 100 per 100,000 farmers. But when all farm-related personnel are accounted for, rather than just full-time commercial farmers, the rate is much lower: only 5.6 murders per 100,000 farmers. If you count every person involved in agriculture, even those who don’t live on farms, the rate would drop even further, to 0.4 murders per 100,000. That being said, the police in South Africa have been tracking the number of farm attacks and murders over the last two decades. According to their statistics, there were 47 farm murders in the 2017-18 financial year. According to Africa Check, the South African police did not collect statistics on attacks and murders on farms and smallholdings prior to 1997. So, there is not conclusive evidence to say that farmers are more likely to be killed than anyone else in the country. There is also no way to determine how many recent murders were motivated by racial tensions. Dr. Johan Burger, a researcher for South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies, told the Australian Broadcasting Company fact-checkers that farm attacks may be partially motivated by the isolation of farmers; because their land is further away from neighbors and police stations, they may be easier to rob. It’s hard to say what Trump meant by "large-scale killing." However, based on the limited amount of information we have, it is inaccurate. Farm murders have been declining over time, according to police reports. Our ruling Trump tweeted that the "South African government is seizing land from white farmers" and that there has been a "large scale killing of farmers" in the country. The government of South Africa is pursuing reparations more aggressively. When black communities file a claim for stolen land, the government has been offering fair market value to encourage white owners to sell. Now, the government is considering taking land without compensating current owners. Only land which had been unfairly taken from black communities through discriminatory laws is considered for redistribution. What’s more wrong in Trump’s observation is that South African farmers are not being killed systematically due to their race or profession. There is not enough data to say whether the rate of farmer deaths has increased significantly, and nothing tying that directly to government reparations initiatives. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction (Aug. 28, 2018): The South African police did not collect statistics on attacks and murders on farms and smallholdings prior to 1997. A previous version of this story included incorrect information on this point.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-08-24T16:56:56	2018-08-22	['None']
pomt-12669	"I remember years ago looking at a CBO report that in 1964 predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion at that point."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/mar/20/jack-kingston/did-cbo-exist-1964-no/	House Republicans have been moving on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. One of the big controversies surrounding the repeal concerns how many people will lose health insurance coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently issued a forecast that 24 million fewer people would have coverage by 2024. Repeal supporters, though, have focused on how difficult it is to estimate a concrete number involving the replacement for Obamacare. Former U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia made that case on CNN on March 12. "Well, a CBO in 2010 said that 24 million people would be covered by exchanges by now under Obamacare. That number is 10 million. They were 14 million people off," Kingston said. "I remember years ago looking at the CBO report that in 1964, it was predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion at that point." Kingston claimed that he saw a 1964 CBO report that got Medicare wrong, but there’s a major flaw in this statement: The CBO wasn’t formed until 1974. According to the agency’s own history, the CBO began operating on Feb. 24, 1975, with Alice Rivlin appointed as the first director. Its mission was and is to provide carefully researched, independent budget and economic information to Congress. The CBO was created by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which was sparked by conflict between the legislative and executive branches. Back then, members of Congress objected to President Richard Nixon’s threats of impoundment. In this case, Nixon had refused to spend money on projects he opposed, even though Congress had appropriated the money. The 1974 law affirmed Congress’ constitutional control over the budget by establishing new procedures for controlling impoundments. The law also created new legislative institutions to implement the new congressional budget process: the House and Senate Budget Committees to oversee execution of the budget process, and the Congressional Budget Office to provide the budget committees and Congress with objective, impartial information about budgetary and economic issues. So Kingston was wrong about the CBO. In response to our questions, Kingston acknowledged the error but said he was thinking of a different source. He provided a 2009 article from the Washington Times about the U.S. health plans having a history of cost overruns. "In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee estimated that the hospital insurance program of Medicare - the federal health care program for the elderly and disabled - would cost $9 billion by 1990. The actual cost that year was $67 billion," the article said. A 1965 New York Times article explained the new Medicare plan. The new version would include doctors’ fees and drugs, as well as hospitalization. The Washington Post Fact Checker has looked in depth at the old estimates about Medicare. It found that Medicare’s costs were underestimated back in the 1960s, but that nominal dollar figures aren't the best way to look at the program, due to inflation in the 1970s. Our ruling Kingston said, "I remember years ago looking at a CBO report that in 1964 predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion." But the CBO wasn't established until 1974. There were estimates, but they were actually made by the House Ways and Means Committee. Comparing the original figures to today is more complicated than just citing the numbers. And the sources for the figures -- the CBO vs. a House committee -- are very different. When we asked about the misstatement, Kingston acknowledged the error. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08121	In the case of a catastrophic event, the Atlanta-area offices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will self-destruct.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/10/walking-dead/hit-series-shows-cdc-blows-after-zombie-apocalypse/	OK, OK, enough of that political stuff. The winter holidays approach. State politicians are hibernating. Now PolitiFact Georgia' staff can investigate what's really important. Is there a doomsday plan for Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention? "Huh?" you ask. And "Why?" Because of AMC's hit series "The Walking Dead." Flesh-eating zombies take over Atlanta, and in Sunday's season finale, survivors who take refuge at the CDC find out things are even worse than they thought: The building is locked down and rigged to explode. When the CDC's generators run out of fuel, a two-stage device more powerful than anything known to mankind short of a nuclear bomb will blow it to kingdom come. "It sets the air on fire," fictional CDC scientist Dr. Edwin Jenner said. "No pain. An end to sorrow, grief, regret. Everything." Thirty minutes later, KAAABOOOOM!!!! No more CDC. Really? Don't laugh. PolitiFact Georgia readers and more than a few Atlanta Journal-Constitution staffers asked PolitiFact to check whether the CDC has an endgame plan. "The Walking Dead" follows survivors of a plague that turns people into zombies. In the show's post-apocalypse Atlanta, the undead lurch down Marietta Street and through the countryside hungry for human innards. The Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre stands in as the CDC's stunt double. "The Walking Dead" is by far the most popular show shot in Atlanta, according to ajc.com's Radio & TV Talk blog. It averaged 5 million viewers during the fall season, which is 2 million more than second-place Bravo's "The Real Housewives of Atlanta." This makes it the most popular drama in basic-cable history among the coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic. And when a show this popular turns a major DeKalb County employer into a smoldering pit of rubble, AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers take notice. We called the CDC. Officials there said the agency was not consulted during production of the show. While the agency does have safeguards in case generators fail, a subnuclear blast is not one of them, spokeswoman Karen Hunter said. "We do have systems in place, but none of them involve explosives," Hunter said. The CDC has safeguards for a variety of emergencies, but they don't specifically address the possibility of the end of humanity. "We do not have a doomsday scenario at the CDC," Hunter said. If for some reason the CDC were unable to operate from its main campus, designated employees would travel to another location and work from there, Hunter said. Backup generators have failed at least twice in recent years. In June 2007, lightning knocked out power at the CDC's $214 million infectious disease building -- including the agency's six high-tech labs designed to contain Ebola, smallpox, avian influenza and other killer bugs. In July 2008, a bird shorted out a Georgia Power transformer, cutting off power to part of the CDC's main campus. Critics worried the generator failures showed the lab was unsafe. The Government Accountability Office investigated. While "The Walking Dead's" CDC seemed to use fire as a kind of disinfectant, the real CDC typically uses other cleaning methods. In the second-to-last episode, Jenner accidentally spills a caustic chemical as he works in a lab, which automatically decontaminates by setting itself on fire. In reality, CDC scientists disinfect spills with some very uncinematic household products, said Tom Skinner, another CDC spokesman. "Lysol and bleach," Skinner said. Materials used to clean the spill are burned, but not by a self-immolating lab. They use incinerators. Scientists work with dangerous pathogens in rooms with negative airflow to prevent germs from leaking outside. Air entering and leaving those rooms is scrubbed with filters. Scientists wear protective suits. While we are disappointed to find that real life is not nearly as cinematic as fiction, we walk away from our effort heartened. We are pleased to reassure the CDC's neighbors that they do not need to install flame-proof siding. The CDC said none of its emergency plans involve blowing up its campus. Plus, the AJC reported two cases in which the CDC emergency generator failures did not coincide with subnuclear explosions. We rule "The Walking Dead" claim Pants On Fire. And by the way, we can't wait for Season 2.	None	The Walking Dead	None	None	None	2010-12-10T06:00:00	2010-12-05	['Atlanta_metropolitan_area']
pomt-00415	Says Beto O’Rourke "voted against" Hurricane Harvey "tax relief."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-beto-orourke-voted-against-tax-relie/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz says in an online video ad that he voted for tax relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 as his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, ridiculously voted "no." The narrator of Cruz’s August 2018 ad, which features photos of water rescues and Cruz on the scene of the devastating hurricane, says: "Congressman O’Rourke is so irresponsible that he even voted against hurricane tax relief." A House roll call shows that O’Rourke, a congressman since 2013, was among 155 representatives to vote against the House’s Sept. 28, 2017, passage of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, for which 264 members, including 43 Democrats, cast "yea" votes. The same day, the House concurred with a Senate amendment to the proposal and two days later President Donald Trump signed that into law. The measure folded in tax relief for hurricane victims. A September 2017 Houston Chronicle news story on the action, crediting Cruz with leading the effort to pass the legislation, said key provisions--approved two weeks after Congress advanced more than $15 billion in aid to Harvey victims--would permit Harvey victims to access their retirement funds penalty-free, allow victims to easily write off hurricane losses and provide a tax credit of up to $6,000 for employers who hire in a declared disaster area like Harris County, home to hard-hit Houston. Also, the story said, charitable giving might be spurred by the measure's waiving of deduction limits. Also, the proposal included language allowing taxpayers to use income from the past year to determine the Earned Income Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit, the story said. O'Rourke voted for direct aid When we asked O’Rourke’s campaign about his "no" vote, spokesman Chris Evans replied by email that O’Rourke, who otherwise voted for direct hurricane relief, voted against the measure singled out by Cruz "because it dramatically shortchanged Harvey victims by providing significantly smaller tax breaks than those given after Hurricane Sandy," which slammed the East Coast in 2012. Hold that comparison: The American Institute of CPAs put us in touch with a Louisiana expert, CPA Jerry Schreiber, who told us by phone that Congress didn’t provide tax breaks to victims of Hurricane Sandy. Another congressional roll-call vote shows that earlier, on Sept. 25, 2017, O’Rourke joined a sufficient number of House members to keep the act from being immediately considered and passed by the House. O'Rourke's explanation for opposition to tax-relief legislation After that vote, O’Rourke posted a statement saying that he supported the measure’s main thrust--reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration and programs set to expire that week--but voted against the House moving along because "other initiatives that are critical to the livelihood of our families and neighbors in El Paso were excluded." O’Rourke’s statement went on: "Without returning this legislation for further improvement, I am not confident Congress would have reauthorized these programs. "For example, H.R. 3823 left out reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers only days before their funding is set to expire. The recent debate on health care in our country has only reinforced the need for quality, affordable care. That simply will not be possible without these two programs that so many children and families in El Paso rely on. "Additionally, the bill would have left victims of recent natural disasters — including Hurricane Harvey — without sufficient assistance as they work to recover and rebuild. The bill provided help in the form of tax breaks at a much lower rate than those provided to victims of both Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina. "Ultimately, H.R. 3823 failed to pass the House. With less than a week remaining to reauthorize the FAA, CHIP, and Community Health Centers, I urge my colleagues to pass an improved version of this legislation that extends these programs while ensuring that we continue to aid those recovering from Harvey and other recent natural disasters." Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke irresponsibly voted against tax relief for Hurricane Harvey victims. O’Rourke voted against the proposal delivering tax relief though Cruz's statement, suggesting a didn't-care attitude, leaves unsaid that O’Rourke offered some reasons for his opposition and had voted for direct aid to victims.

pomt-01166	"The city of San Antonio reuses almost 40 percent of its water. You know how much the city of Austin reuses? About 5 percent. And that's not right. We can do better."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/dec/11/steve-adler/steve-adler-says-san-antonio-recycles-40-percent-w/	An Austin mayoral candidate suggested the Texas capital greatly lags the Alamo City in a wet way. In a Nov. 19, 2014, Time Warner Cable News debate with his Dec. 16, 2014, runoff opponent, Mike Martinez, Steve Adler said: "The city of San Antonio reuses almost 40 percent of its water. You know how much the city of Austin reuses? About 5 percent. And that's not right. We can do better." Adler has talked up San Antonio before; in his September 2014 water agenda, he pointed out San Antonio’s wide lead in water reuse, and advocated reforming Austin’s "purple pipe" system (state law requires pipes carrying non-potable treated wastewater be colored purple). It’s no light topic. Texas’ 2012 State Water Plan, a 50-year strategy for keeping water supply up with demand, says the state must quadruple its use of reused (or recycled) water, adding over 300 billion gallons to yearly supply by 2060. To clarify: Water reuse doesn’t necessarily mean sending purified toilet water to the tap (as Wichita Falls does). Cities normally discharge treated wastewater, not fit to drink, into a local river, but some reuse it for irrigation or industry. San Antonio is recognized as an innovator in water conservation, but in looking into Adler’s statement, we found his comparison doesn’t match apples to apples. That is, San Antonio uses most of its recycled water in ways that Austin cannot: It fills its urban rivers with recycled water and sends recycled water to power plants just a few miles downriver. The comparison also is flawed because the cities already pipe about the same percentage of recycled water through purple pipes to city customers for irrigation and industry. Adler’s data To launch this check, we queried Jim Wick, Adler’s campaign manager, on the candidate’s statistics. He provided information received on April 11, 2014 by an Adler supporter, William Moriarty, who is also a member of Austin’s Water and Wastewater Commission. Moriarty had requested water recycling statistics from the Austin Water Utility, which serves more than 890,000 customers in Austin and surrounding communities, and the San Antonio Water System, which serves more than 1.6 million customers in Bexar and surrounding counties. -Austin Water division manager Raj Bhattarai said Austin’s wastewater treatment plants treated 33.84 billion gallons in 2013, of which 1.47 billion gallons, or 4.3 percent, were reused. -SAWS senior resource analyst Gregg Eckhardt said San Antonio’s wastewater treatment plants treated 45.22 billion gallons in 2013, of which 16.2 billion gallons, or about 35 percent, were reused. Eckhardt said 75 percent of the reused water was sent via the San Antonio River to power plants downstream, 15 percent was piped to city customers and 10 percent was added to urban waterways to boost flows. But a July 2014 email, also provided by Wick, threw up a flag; Eckhardt told the Adler campaign that the state, unlike SAWS, doesn’t consider water pumped to boost streamflow to be reused. Put another way, not counting flow augmentation, San Antonio reuses about 32 percent of its wastewater. This turn made us wonder: what else are the cities reporting as reused water? It was here that we learned about water delivered both via big rivers and purple pipes. Purple pipes Daryl Slusher, an Austin Water Utility administrator, said by phone Austin’s reuse tally only includes water piped from wastewater treatment plants to customers. Austin’s 48 miles of purple pipes serve 69 customers for recycled water including golf courses, city parks and Austin Energy, according to a utility spokesman, Jason Hill, who also said the number of customers the utility could serve was capped by "infrastructure limitations." Meaning? The city has to build more purple pipes. The Austin American-Statesman reported in December 2009 that Austin then planned to spend $180 million expanding the purple pipe system -- over three decades. Adler’s web-posted water agenda says city policies make it costly for irrigation customers currently using drinking water to switch to recycled water. By email, Wick told us Adler supports an exemption to the purple-color requirement for irrigators who already have underground networks of white-colored pipes and want to use recycled water. Then again, we realized, the Austin City Council on Nov. 14, 2014, adopted an ordinance doing just that: allowing irrigators to use recycled water without replacing existing pipe networks. So, is Adler’s plan already moot? Not quite, Wick said by email, adding that Adler believes the city’s already-approved expansion of purple pipes should be completed more quickly than planned. San Antonio also sends recycled water through purple pipes. In fact, a 2013 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report called San Antonio’s 110 miles of purple pipe "the nation’s largest direct recycled water delivery system." Eckhardt told us customers include golf courses, conference center air-conditioning cooling towers, computer server-farm cooling systems, Trinity University and factories like a Toyota truck plant. Map of San Antonio’s recycled water system, including purple pipe, taken with permission from Eckhardt’s The Edwards Aquifer Website. CPS Energy pumps water from its station on the San Antonio River to fill Braunig and Calaveras lakes, cooling reservoirs for power plants. According to Eckhardt, 5 percent of San Antonio’s treated wastewater was pumped to city customers through purple pipes in 2013. According to Hill, about 4 percent of Austin’s treated water was pumped back through the purple pipes that year. So if San Antonio hardly outperforms Austin in getting recycled water to city customers, how does San Antonio lay claim to recycling so much more wastewater The difference is almost all about whether water put in a river should be counted as recycled. Power plants In 2013, SAWS sent 12.2 billion gallons of recycled water--83 percent of the utility’s total reported water reuse--about four miles down the San Antonio River to three Bexar County CPS Energy power plants, which are not linked to the purple pipe, according to SAWS communications manager Anne Hayden. Eckhardt said San Antonio was the world’s first city to fill power plant cooling reservoirs with treated wastewater. Previously, he said, the plants were cooled with drinking-quality water. Austin likewise dumps its treated wastewater into the Colorado River. And likewise, a multitude of downstream users pump water from the river, including the Fayette Power Project 83 miles downstream and the South Texas Nuclear Project about 150 miles downstream. But unlike in San Antonio, the plants don’t exclusively use treated wastewater; The Lower Colorado River Authority also sends water from the Highland Lakes, upstream reservoirs that also supply Austin, said LCRA spokeswoman Clara Tuma by email. She said treated wastewater discharged by Austin "is available for use by all senior water rights holders downstream who may need the water," including cities and irrigation districts. Downstream users consume enough that not much water from Austin actually even makes it to the coast at Matagorda Bay, where river flow has dwindled to record lows. But Slusher said the Austin utility doesn’t count downstream use as reuse because unlike SAWS, Austin loses ownership of water it releases into the river, which becomes property of the LCRA. Robert Mace, executive administrator at the Texas Water Development Board, said SAWS’ transfer of water to CPS counts as reuse because the San Antonio utility has a contract to provide the water. He said: "Water that's put back into river without some sort of formal agreement is referred to in the reuse subculture as ‘de facto reuse'" and is not credited to any utility. Another key detail: San Antonio lives on groundwater, and SAWS pumps aquifer water to fill the San Antonio River, unlike Austin which gets water from upstream. Absent SAWS’ treated wastewater, Eckhardt said the power plants would have to use drinking-quality aquifer water. Filling streams and rivers As it turns out, indeed, most of San Antonio’s creeks and rivers would run dry without the city’s treated wastewater, including the waterways along the downtown Riverwalk, said Hayen with SAWS. Hayden said San Antonio pumps about 5 million gallons of treated wastewater a day to keep the San Antonio River flowing, supporting tourism downtown and ecosystems downstream. Eckhardt said he considers flow augmentation reuse because before treated wastewater ran through San Antonio rivers, they were fed by wells pumping drinking-quality water from the Edwards Aquifer, which of late no longer need to pump. State water authority By phone, Mace said there were no statewide guidelines regulating what a utility could or could not report as water reuse. However, he said a 2013 TWDB water reuse survey did not count water used for streamflow boosts in San Antonio. The survey, which only reports recycled water customers within city limits, found Austin reused 3-3.5 percent of its wastewater that year while San Antonio reused 19-24 percent. However, Mace said, excluding recycled water sent to CPS power plants, San Antonio reused 3-3.8 percent of its wastewater. Our ruling Adler said San Antonio reuses 40 percent of its water while Austin reuses just 5 percent, indicating that the capital should catch up to its sprawling southern neighbor. Those percentages are offered by the respective local water utilities. However, both cities have been piping about the same share of treated water to local industrial and irrigation customers. This statement failed to acknowledge that San Antonio lays claim to even more recycling in ways Austin cannot match. This is mainly because, unlike San Antonio, Austin doesn’t own any of the treated wastewater it pours into its major river (while SAWS owns the water it puts into the San Antonio River). We rate this comparison Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-02182	"Over 20 percent of the electorate is Hispanic" in Florida.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/28/annette-taddeo-goldstein/rick-scott-and-charlie-crist-battle-hispanic-vote-/	As Republican Gov. Rick Scott and his rival, Democrat Charlie Crist, battle for the support of Hispanic voters, they have attacked each other over everything from in-state tuition for young people who came to the United States illegally to the longstanding embargo of Cuba to what was, or wasn’t, said by certain Scott campaign staffers en route to a Chipotle. Such politicking shows how important both candidates believe Hispanics to be in this year’s campaign for Florida’s governor. One key battleground is Miami-Dade County, home to the largest number of Hispanic voters in the state, as well as Scott’s running mate, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera. Miami-Dade Democratic chair Annette Taddeo-Goldstein, who was born in Colombia, boasted about the size of the Hispanic vote in Florida in an April 21 interview with MSNBC Ed Schultz. Taddeo-Goldstein: "I’m not surprised (Scott is) trying to pander to the Hispanic community, because our vote is actually, in my opinion, going to decide this election." Schultz: "You believe that the Latino vote will decide the gubernatorial election here in Florida?" Taddeo-Goldstein: "Now the Hispanics in Florida account for one in four of every resident in Florida. It is actually the largest in the country when it comes to the percentages. Over 20 percent of the electorate is Hispanic. So it’s going to be decided by Hispanics." We can’t fact-check her prediction that Hispanic voters will decide the race, but we can fact-check her claim about the size of the Hispanic electorate. First, we’ll offer some background about why the Hispanic vote in Florida is in play. According to party registration statistics, Hispanics lean Democratic, but in actual voting patterns, the Hispanic vote is more competitive between the parties. While President Barack Obama overwhelmingly won the state’s Hispanic vote in 2012, Hispanics narrowly backed Scott in 2010, according to exit polls, though there was a large margin of error. Even Miami-Dade’s Cuban-American vote, historically a reliable base for GOP candidates, is becoming more competitive over time. Florida’s Hispanic electorate Taddeo-Goldstein was correct in her recitation of statistics about the Hispanic population in Florida and nationally. However, she was wrong on the percentage of registered voters who are Hispanic in Florida. As of October 2012, there were about 1.66 million registered Hispanic voters out of 11.9 million voters total, or 13.9 percent, according to the Florida Division of Elections. Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, obtained more recent data from the state and shared the totals with PolitiFact Florida. As of the end of 2013, she said, about 14.2 percent of the state’s electorate was Hispanic. This data comes with some caveats. The state added "Hispanic" to voter registration in 1995, so it doesn’t reflect Hispanic voters who registered before that date. And the field is optional on voter registration forms. Such factors do raise uncertainties, said Dario Moreno, a pollster and Florida International University political science professor. Moreno said he’s not convinced that the state’s data fully captures the Hispanic share of the electorate. He said that since voters have to self-report their heritage on the forms, some may be reluctant to share the information or be confused about race versus ethnicity. He thinks it could be at least 15 percent. Political organizations, campaigns and other entities purchase data from firms that collect voter registration data also found higher figures for Florida’s Hispanic electorate, though still less than 20 percent. Univision reports that 18 percent of Florida’s electorate is Hispanic as of November 2013, based on data from the firm Aristotle, which compiles data from elections offices. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said their information shows Florida’s Hispanic electorate at 15 percent of the state's voters as of November 2013. When PolitiFact Florida contacted Taddeo-Goldstein for this fact check, she acknowledged that she should have said "residents," rather than "electorate." "Thanks for checking on this and for correcting me," she said. Our ruling Taddeo-Goldstein said that "over 20 percent of the (Florida) electorate is Hispanic." While more than 20 percent of the state’s population is Hispanic -- 23 percent to be exact -- the percentage of Hispanic registered voters is lower. State data shows that 13.9 percent of the state’s registered voters were Hispanic as of October 2012, a number that had climbed to 14.2 percent by the end of 2013. If adjustments are made for the fact that the data is self-reported and doesn't include some voter registrations made years ago, the figure likely approaches 20 percent, but doesn't necessarily get all the way there.

pomt-12804	"Food waste is the 3rd largest contributor" of greenhouse gas emissions.	false	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/14/world-food-program/no-food-waste-not-third-biggest-source-greenhouse-/	As it struggles to feed the hungry, the U.N. World Food Program often reminds the public that in the face of great need, there is also great waste. Right now, the U.N. relief agency is active in about 75 nations, including conflict zones in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan. In a tweet, the World Food Program connected the loss of food to global climate change. "Food waste is the 3rd largest contributor of GHGs (greenhouse gases) to our climate," the organization tweeted Feb. 5, 2017. The tweet no longer exists. The program deleted it after we raised some questions, so kudos for that. Here’s why it was inaccurate. World Food Program senior spokesman Steve Taravella told us they relied on a report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. That article included a chart that said, "If food wastage were a country, it would be the third largest emitting country in the world." FAO researchers estimated that a third of all food never makes it to the kitchen table and calculated the emissions that went in to growing and transporting those wasted tons. The problem is, agriculture is an activity, not a place. It makes sense to compare its emissions to other activities, and no sense to rank it against countries. "It's comparing apples to oranges," researcher Brian Lipinski at the World Resources Institute told us. "The number for food loss and waste is comprised of numbers from individual countries, and so the data isn't mutually exclusive. So while the comparison to countries helps to establish the scale, flat-out labeling food loss and waste as the world's third largest emitter is missing necessary context." When we raised this issue with Taravella, he agreed. "In our effort to illustrate the scale of the problem, it seems we inadvertently mistook the metaphor in the graphic — a mythical country — for an actual source of waste," Taravella said. He deleted the tweet to "avoid giving our Twitter followers inaccurate data," and told us he would take this up with his colleagues to find other ways to draw attention to food waste. So how do emissions from food lost and wasted stack up against other human activities? The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated total greenhouse gas emissions to be equal to 49.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Out of that, agriculture, forestry and other productive uses of land account for about 25 percent. Food waste is about 9 percent, but that’s not a separate piece all by itself. Emissions tied to industry (the production of fertilizer), transportation (moving food around), buildings (to store food), energy (to refrigerate it), and agriculture all contribute a bit to the food waste total. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The current research doesn’t tease out emissions due to food waste separate from other activities, so there’s no way to rank it by itself. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that food loss and waste accounted for about 4.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide each year. That’s a little bit less than emissions from road transportation. A research group at Potsdam University in Germany used very different methods and reached a similar conclusion on the total emissions tied to wasted food. Our ruling The World Food Program tweeted that food waste is the third largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. That is based on a comparison to the emissions of other countries, but food waste is an activity, not a place. The World Food Programme acknowledged that it took a point used for rhetorical effect and treated it literally. The organization deleted the tweet.

pomt-01077	Polls on legalizing same-sex marriage "are not dramatically changing."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/16/julaine-appling/julaine-appling-says-views-same-sex-marriage-arent/	Julaine Appling thinks advocates of same-sex marriage should put the issue to another statewide referendum if they’re so confident public opinion has shifted to their side. "They argue all the time, ‘the polls are changing,’ " Appling said to guest host Mike Siegel on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM (620) on Jan. 6, 2015. "Well, the truth is, the polls are not dramatically changing." Appling was a key figure in the 2006 passage of a statewide referendum that effectively banned same-sex marriage in Wisconsin until a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb in June 2014. Appling leads Wisconsin Family Council and Wisconsin Family Action, which describe themselves as advocating for Judeo-Christian values. In that 2006 referendum, 59 percent of voters in the fall general election endorsed rewriting the state constitution in a way that legally recognizes marriage only as "between one man and one woman." The referendum language also prohibited the state from recognizing "a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals." The U.S. Supreme Court in October 2014 rejected appeals from Wisconsin and four other states seeking to preserve their same-sex marriage bans. Nationally, it’s well documented that attitudes toward gay marriage have become more much more accepting in recent years. Thirty-six states have legalized gay marriage. But what about in Wisconsin? Asked to provide backup for her claim of no dramatic change, Appling pointed in part to two polls from 2014. Neither, however, broke out any Wisconsin data. One surveyed only Republicans or GOP-leaning independents and found large majorities favoring a traditional definition of marriage. The other was from surveys of people as they exited polling places across the country; it showed voters evenly split on gay marriage nationally. But Appling cited public opinion in Wisconsin, not nationwide. She did point us to a Wisconsin statewide poll conducted by St. Norbert College in 2014 -- but it doesn’t entirely back her point. It found a slim majority (52 percent) in favor of the 2006 amendment’s language regarding marriage for "one man" and "one woman." Remember, it passed with 59 percent support, so that’s a substantial drop. When we looked ourselves, we found a fairly small number of Wisconsin polls that were on point, but they document relatively large changes in opinion. The St. Norbert "Wisconsin Survey" sampled opinion on the "one man-one woman" language even before the referendum went to voters, and has continued to do so. From that poll, here are the percentages in favor of the "one man-one woman" approach advocated 2006 referendum. Spring 2004: 66 percent Spring 2006: 61 percent Spring 2012: 56 percent Spring 2014: 52 percent. So, while a bare majority in this survey still backed the traditional view, support for it has fallen 14 percentage points in a decade. Other polls The Marquette University Law School Poll tested the issue three times in 2014, and its findings were at odds with the St. Norbert poll. That poll found between 55 percent and 64 percent support for "allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally." The portion against legal marriage for such couples ranged in size from 30 percent to 37 percent. That suggests an even bigger change in opinion and suggests a reversal from the 2006 referendum vote. Such comparisons are imperfect, though, due to factors such as the unpredictability of who shows up to vote and the impact of the wording of survey questions. The MU Law Poll was launched just three years ago, so it does not have a long history on this question. But we found a couple other sources. In an August 2011 poll, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning firm, found exactly half of respondents thought same-sex marriage should be illegal, with 39 percent saying legal. By spring 2014, the firm for the first time found more in favor of legalizing than against: 47 to 45 percent, though the two-point gap is smaller than the poll’s margin of error. Exit polls provide more evidence. Surveys taken in November 2014 as voters left polling places asked if Wisconsin should legally recognize same-sex marriage. Yes, said 52 percent. No, said 45 percent. One more finding before we close. Pollsters sometimes throw in other options when asking about how to handle the marriage question. They will ask respondents what is closer to their own view: legalizing same-sex marriage, giving civil recognition to such unions, or giving no legal recognition to them. These results also show major changes in opinion, though support for same-sex marriage comes in lower. In 2009, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank, found 27 percent support for same-sex marriage, 32 percent for civil unions but not same-sex marriage, and 35 percent for no legal recognition. In May 2014, five years later, the Marquette poll posed the same question using the exact same language. It found 49 percent support for same-sex marriage, 25 percent for civil unions and 19 percent for no recognition. That’s a change of 22 points for same-sex marriage. Our rating In saying a do-over of the state’s 2006 referendum legalizing only opposite-sex marriages would again pass, Appling said public opinion polls on gay marriage "are not dramatically changing." Her remarks were squarely in a Wisconsin context, and surveys here have shown major change in favor of legalizing same-sex marriages. We rate her claim False.

pomt-05692	"Seven out of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates (have) Republican governors … That approach that Republicans are using is working."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/12/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-7-10-states-lowest-unemployment-rat/	Gov. Bob McDonnell says nobody creates a better environment for jobs than Republican governors. "Seven out of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates (have) Republican governors," McDonnell said at Politico’s Feb. 24 State Solutions Conference. "So I’d just like to say, on an empirical basis, that approach that Republicans are using is working. And I’d certainly compare that to what Democratic governors are doing." McDonnell, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, made the claim during a debate with Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. He defined the Republican approach as keeping a lid on taxes, spending, regulations and unionization. We wanted to see if GOP governors really do lead most states with the nation’s lowest unemployment rates and, if they do, whether that means Republican chief executives are better at creating and protecting jobs than their Democratic colleagues. Let’s start with some basic math: Twenty-nine governors are Republicans, 20 are Democrats and one is an Independent. So under the law of averages, about six of the top 10 states should be run by GOP governors. Now, let’s turn to the unemployment rates. Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s director of communications, said his boss’s figures came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics listing of state unemployment rates in December 2011, the latest month for which statistics were available. Of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates, North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Utah and Virginia have Republican governors. New Hampshire, Vermont and Minnesota have Democratic governors. We found that the Top 10 list includes three states where the GOP tenure has been fairly short. In Iowa, a Republican governor took office in January 2011 after 12 years of Democratic governorships. In Wyoming, a GOP governor took office in January 2011 after eight years of a Democratic governorship. Both states were also on the list of 10 lowest unemployment rates in December 2010, when a Democrat was governor. And in Virginia, McDonnell came to office in January 2010 after eight years of Democratic governors. Virginia had the nation’s 10th lowest unemployment rate in December 2009, its last full month under Gov. Tim Kaine. Virginia still ranks 10th today. Conversely, we looked at the 10 states that had the worst unemployment rates in December 2011. Under McDonnell’s logic, there should be few Republicans and many Democrats in this tier. Six states in the Bottom 10 have Republican governors: Michigan, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and Nevada. Three have Democratic governors: Illinois, North Carolina and California. One state, Rhode Island, has an an independent governor. Economists have told us time and again that governors have marginal effects on economies of their states. Anne Alexander, an economist at the University of Wyoming, largely credited her state’s 5.6 percent unemployment rate to oil and natural gas exploration and tourists visiting Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Tetons. And because more than half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the federal or state government, she said there are many public jobs managing the land and wildlife. "Generally speaking, as an economist, I tend to think that any particular executive has less influence over the state of the economy than we might like to give them credit for -- either for good or for bad," Alexander said. North Dakota has the nation’s lowest unemployment rate, at 3.3 percent. Stan Herren, a economist at North Dakota State University, attributed the prosperity to a solid state economy based on energy exploration and agriculture. Politicians, he said, have provided some help by adopting supportive business policies. "If you want to put a number on it, it (the economy) is probably 90 percent of it and 10 percent is the policies," he said. Our ruling McDonnell said Republican governors head seven out of 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates, providing proof that the GOP has a better record on jobs than Democrats. He’s right on the numbers, but on shaky ground when he insists Republican stewardship has brought those results. The fact that seven of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates are led by Republicans is hardly evidence that GOP governors trump Democrats in creating jobs. Three of those seven states, including Virginia, were also in the Top 10 when they were were headed by Democrats a year or two ago. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03812	"Nearly 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of all new permanent residents obtained that status by virtue of their family status."	true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/22/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-immigration-determined-family-ties-n/	Jeb Bush’s new book Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution has put a spotlight on the former Florida governor and potential 2016 Republican presidential contender. In the book, Bush makes the point that our immigration policy prioritizes family reunification -- not the needs of employers. Bush proposed limiting guaranteed admissions to spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens. By 2011, of the one million immigrants granted permanent legal residence, "nearly 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of all new permanent residents obtained that status by virtue of their family status." We wanted to check Bush’s numbers: Are almost two-thirds of new legal permanent residents here based on their family status? The numbers Bush obtained information from a January 2011 policy brief from the Brookings Institution. The author, Brookings vice president Darrell West, called for immigration reform that in the short term would allow employers to hire workers with scientific and technological skills. West’s number drew from a group known as legal permanent residents, commonly referred to as green card holders. In 2011, about one million people became legal permanent residents, according to the federal government’s yearbook of immigration statistics. Those who entered based on family ties accounted for about 65 percent. That included about 235,000 who were family-sponsored preferences and about 453,000 who were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Immediate relatives include spouses, children under the age of 21 or parents of U.S. citizens. If approved, the U.S. government immediately grants those visas for relatives, and there isn’t a quota. Family sponsored immigrants includes spouses and children of legal permanent residents as well as other relatives of citizens such as siblings. The U.S. government grants up to 226,000 family sponsored visas per year, and 140,000 employment-based visas per year. In addition, there are limits to the percentage of visas that can be allotted to each country. (Notice that the quota of 226,000 family sponsored visa cap was slightly lower than the 235,000 number of those admitted in 2011. That’s because the quota refers to the number of visas -- valid for six months -- issued in a year, while the immigration statistics yearbook number refers to the actual admissions. So someone can be issued a visa in 2010 but may not travel until 2011.) There are a few important exceptions within the different categories, though. Jeffrey Passel, at Pew Research Hispanic Center, said in an email that most immigrants come for work even if they came here under a family or relative category. And not all of the employment-visas are for workers, since the "employment-based" category also includes visas for spouses and children of the workers. The current debate about overhauling the U.S. immigration system pits those who want to protect family reunification against those who say our economy would benefit from a heavier focus on letting in immigrants based on needed job skills. In his book, Bush argues the focus on family reunification leads to "crowding out most others, including immigrants who would contribute greatly to economic growth." If the U.S. wants to increase work-based immigrants without increasing immigration overall, it will have to narrow the definition of "family," Bush wrote. Our ruling Bush said that by 2011, of the one million immigrants granted permanent legal residence, "nearly 65 percent -- almost two-thirds -- of all new permanent residents obtained that status by virtue of their family status." Bush correctly cites the numbers, and his broader point is correct, too -- our system favors family reunification. We rate this claim True.

pomt-11365	Says caravans of people are coming to cross the Mexico-U.S. border.	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/apr/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-caravans-people-coming-through-m/	In a tweet, President Donald Trump ruled out a deal to restore a program protecting certain young immigrants from deportation in part by warning that the Mexico-U.S. border could soon be besieged by a pile of people. Trump said April 1, 2018: "Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!" The tweet folded in familiar terms. "Catch and release" refers to the practice of releasing immigrants apprehended at or near the border, expecting them to appear later before a U.S. immigration judge. DACA stands for the Trump-rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created on President Barack Obama's watch to shield hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. We focused this fact-check on Trump’s fresh statement that "caravans" are coming our way, presumably from south of the Texas-Mexico border. To our inquiry, a White House spokesman, Steven Cheung, said by email that there have been such caravans in the past and estimates indicate there are 1,000 individuals participating in the caravan Trump had in mind. A Fox News discussion Cheung didn't provide more detail. But before the president tweeted, a Fox News program the same morning featured a discussion of a caravan headed toward the U.S. through Mexico. CNN reported April 1, 2018: "Trump appears to be referring to a migrant caravan assembled by the group Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People without Borders), which was discussed on Fox News' ‘Fox & Friends’ shortly before he published his tweet. It's not known if the President watched the specific segment, but he indirectly referenced claims mentioned in an on-air interview with a Border Patrol union representative." Similarly, a news story in The Washington Post pointed to the described caravan as the likely basis of Trump’s concern. The Post story took note that a leader of the National Border Patrol Council, which says it represents some 18,000 Border Patrol agents and support personnel, had been interviewed on the Fox News program. Afterward, the council asserted in a web post that Trump’s tweet was referring to a large group of immigrants making their way to the U.S. border. In the Fox News segment, the council’s president, Brandon Judd, was asked how the Border Patrol would react to the group eventually arriving at the border. Judd responded that a Mexican government entity was helping the group proceed and Pueblos Sin Fronteras, a U.S. group, also was helping. Judd said that once the people made it across the border, each one could request political asylum before getting released by authorities and then not showing up later for an immigration hearing. News stories confirm caravan entered Mexico Fox News’s report was accompanied by a photo tweeted by Adolfo Flores, national security correspondent for BuzzFeed News, who reported from Mexico March 30, 2018, that hundreds of men, women and children had crossed into Mexico from Central America and were moving north--1,200 as of the group’s first night in Mexico, the story said. BuzzFeed’s story said: "For five days now hundreds of Central Americans — children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras — have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them. "Organized by a group of volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, the caravan is intended to help migrants safely reach the United States, bypassing not only authorities who would seek to deport them, but gangs and cartels who are known to assault vulnerable migrants." As of March 30, the story said, the caravan had made it to the southern Mexico state of Oaxaca but it wasn’t immediately successful getting participants onto a freight train heading north. Oaxaca, the state’s capital, is more than 900 miles from Laredo, Texas on the border. Buzzfeed’s story also said: "While there are organizers from Pueblos Sin Fronteras leading the way, much of the effort to get to the U.S. border is in the hands of the migrants themselves." Also, the story says that according to organizers, about two-thirds of people are planning on crossing into the U.S. "undetected or asking for some type of protection like asylum." Caravan spokesman: Not everyone will cross U.S. border That's not what we heard from Irineo Mujica Arzate, a Pueblos Sin Fronteras press contact who told us he was speaking to us from the caravan itself. Arzate said in a phone interview April 2, 2018 that the group helped organize two caravans in 2017 but, he said, there’s only the existing caravan planned for 2018. Arzate said that he doesn’t expect every member of the caravan to cross the U.S. border. Most will try to stay in Mexico, Arzate said, with about 200 to 300 individuals ultimately crossing the U.S. border to seek asylum--a forecast that we found to be far short of published forecasts. "We’re trying to do it in a sensible way," Arzate said. Pueblos Sin Fronteras says on its website that for 15 years, "members have been reaching out to the most vulnerable immigrants in the United States and to migrants and refugees on the move." Members, the group says, "accompany migrants and refugees in their journey of hope." On its site, Pueblo Sin Fronteras calls the caravan the "Via Crucis," or Stations of the Cross, march. Our search of the Nexis news database yielded an April 2015 news story from the Malaysian national news service, Bernama, of a march that year from Mexico's southern border to Mexico City. According to the story, the "Via Crucis" name draws a parallel between the suffering Jesus endured and the ordeal experienced by migrants. News stories indicate a planned 2018 stop in Central Mexico Our search of the Nexis database for other news stories about the caravan turned up another account of the 2018 arrivals into Mexico. Noticias Financieras said in a March 26, 2018, story that nearly 1,500 people fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala had entered Mexico--with the majority hoping to reach the U.S. border to be considered as refugees. Also, a March 26, 2018, story posted on SplinterNews.com, which describes itself as news and opinions that get under your skin, specified that the 1,500 people who entered Mexico would seek asylum in the U.S. after a month-long journey. The story quoted Rodrigo Abeja, described as a Mexico-based organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, expressing surprise at the turnout. Abeja said the group’s caravans in 2017 drew about 450 migrants, the story said. Then again, several accounts mentioned plans for caravan members to seek legal advice at a gathering in Puebla, in central Mexico. According to a fact-check from the Associated Press, posted the day after Trump tweeted, the caravan was scheduled to end later in April in Puebla, which is some 650 miles from the U.S. border. "After the formal caravans end," the AP story said, "some migrants do try to reach the U.S. border, but often just to turn themselves in and request asylum." Our ruling President Trump tweeted that caravans of immigrants are coming to the Mexico-U.S. border. We confirmed that a caravan of 1,200 to 1,500 people from Central America--not caravans--was in southern Mexico, about 900 miles from the Rio Grande, when Trump tweeted. Also, accounts vary on whether all participants are bound to enter the U.S. An organizer estimated that most of the people intend to remain in Mexico. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06948	"The State Election Board has issued nearly $275,000 in fines to violators of absentee ballot laws."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/19/brian-kemp/kemp-claim-fines-money/	Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp wasn’t fond of a recent column critical of the state’s voter identification requirements. Kemp wrote a letter to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution criticizing the newspaper’s columnist Cynthia Tucker’s take on Georgia’s law. She argued Republicans like Kemp support requirements to have voters to show ID at the polls as a covert effort to suppress some traditionally Democratic-leaning groups. That’s nonsense, Kemp wrote. He said there’s plenty of evidence of voter fraud in Georgia. Kemp’s detailed response included a statistic that a couple of PolitiFact readers asked us to check out. "The State Election Board has issued nearly $275,000 in fines to violators of absentee ballot laws," he wrote. The number seemed high, considering that most fines are typically in the $500 range. So what did we find? First, let’s review how absentee voting works in Georgia. In response to complaints about waiting hours in line to vote, the Georgia Legislature voted in 2005 to make voting by absentee ballot much easier. Voters no longer were required to explain why they wouldn’t be around on Election Day and could vote by absentee ballot. Georgia law allows someone to fill out an absentee ballot for a physically-disabled person or a family member who is temporarily not in the county where he or she is registered to vote. Still, there are cases of absentee ballot fraud and they have put election officials and state leaders on the defensive. Those officials still insist there are enough safeguards to spot fraud. "You have a signature record, a paper trail that can be tracked back," then Gov. Sonny Perdue was quoted in a 2006 Atlanta Journal-Constitution article. Kemp didn’t say over what time span his claim covered, which we worried could be a stumbling block in fact-checking his statement. But Matt Carrothers, media relations director for the office, forwarded us a spreadsheet he put together with a breakdown of each fine for 59 violators of absentee ballot law since 2007. We thought four years was a reasonable time frame to fact-check Kemp’s numbers. The total was actually higher than Kemp’s claim, $329,200. Kemp, by the way, was appointed to the position in January 2010 after the prior officeholder, Karen Handel, resigned to run for governor. Nearly half of that total came from one case, resulting in what Carrothers believes is the largest fine against one person that the board has even issued. In 2007, Jackson City Council candidate Larry Pickett filed a complaint with the Secretary of State’s office that his opponent Tommy Raney and campaign worker Debra Brown committed voter fraud in the November 2006 election. The state’s investigation found Raney helped 50 people file absentee ballots and voter registration applications and didn’t inform election officials, as state law requires. Raney also mailed 27 absentee ballots, a felony, the state said. Brown, the officials said, mishandled 20 ballots in various ways, along with filling out and signing an absentee ballot for a man. The state found 47 ballots were improperly handled in Raney’s race. He won the election by 27 votes. "I think this is so egregious," Handel said during an August 2009 hearing on the matter. "Here is an individual who was the candidate and...full well knew what the law was." Raney’s fine -- $158,000. Brown was fined $20,000. Raney later resigned his council seat. He and Brown pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit absentee ballot fraud and sentenced to two years probation. Another case that contributed significantly to the number that Kemp used in his letter was an $80,000 fine the board approved in 2007 on Jerry Metts, who investigators say helped a handful of illegal immigrants cast absentee ballots in Atkinson County in South Georgia during a 2004 county commission race. Those three fines alone total $255,000, which is close to Kemp’s claim. We were able to match some cases on Carrothers’ spreadsheet with meeting minutes involving cases of absentee ballot fraud. One case involved wrongly filing ballots for nursing home patients. Another case involved a woman who faxed previously used absentee ballots for members of a church to election officials in DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. The woman said she was unaware her efforts violated Georgia election law. There were several cases of people who voted in elections in one county, although they lived in another county. These cases and others we found put the total over the $275,000 mark that Kemp mentioned. We rate his statement as True.	None	Brian Kemp	None	None	None	2011-07-19T06:00:00	2011-06-20	['None']
pomt-11217	Says Heidi Heitkamp "cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/10/kevin-cramer/heidi-heitkamp-deciding-vote-flaring-blm/	North Dakota Senate hopeful Kevin Cramer called out incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp for targeting North Dakota’s energy industry. Cramer, a Republican in the U.S. House, told Hugh Hewitt during a radio interview that Heitkamp, a Democrat, "cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota." Cramer was referring to a vote to repeal a rule from former President Barack Obama’s Bureau of Land Management that places limits on the amount of methane gas that can be burned off or flared at drilling sites. (When oil is extracted, raw natural gas is also brought to the surface, so plants without the technology to harness the gas flare it.) We wondered whether Heitkamp had indeed cast the deciding vote for a rule targeting North Dakota’s oil industry. It’s hard to say there is ever such a thing as "the deciding vote" with close calls in Congress. And Cramer is overplaying the rule’s impact on North Dakota. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Heitkamp’s no vote The Methane and Waste Production Rule was put in place in Obama's tenure and had not yet been implemented when President Donald Trump took office. The vehicle for repeal was the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to overturn regulations by federal agencies with a simply majority within 60 legislative days of their issue dates. Republicans held a 52-48 edge in the Senate, and needed only a majority to repeal the rule. But the motion was defeated 49-51 on May 10, 2017. Every independent and Democrat (including Heitkamp) opposed it, joined by three Republicans —Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and John McCain of Arizona. Heitkamp's vote indeed was pivotal. She and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., were still publicly undecided on the morning of the vote. There’s no doubt that Heitkamp’s vote was crucial. But as we have concluded in fact-checks of similar attacks, the "deciding vote" label could just as easily be applied to other lawmakers who voted no — making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the narrowly passed Affordable Care Act, for example.) Heitkamp’s campaign argued there was a deciding vote, however, and it was McCain. "One person surprised everybody," Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Roll Call of McCain’s vote against the CRA. "I was very certain the votes were there because we wouldn’t bring it up if the votes weren’t there." "In talking to folks, they were kind of going back and forth, undecided and then lean yes," John Hoeven, North Dakota’s Republican senator, told Roll Call. "And so we actually thought we had just enough. But as it turns out, we lost three, and we didn’t get any help from the Democrats." 'Designed just for North Dakota' Cramer said the rule was designed just for North Dakota. It was not. It targets flaring on all federal lands. The idea is that because the federal government receives royalties on federally owned fossil fuels, wasted methane equals lost government revenue. Republicans worried the rule was an unfair burden that would disincentivize producers. Tim Rasmussen, Cramer’s spokesman, clarified the senator was referring to the rule’s disproportionate effect on the state. "I would say it's designed for North Dakota because North Dakota has, over the course of this energy renaissance, the highest rates of flared natural gas in the country, BLM mineral ownership in the state making it applicable (unlike, say Texas), and just simply a widely reported on and discussed topic in the state (just like the Waters of the U.S. and Clean Power Plan)," Rasmussen said. The law indeed impacts North Dakota for these reasons. But Alexandra Teitz, one of the rule’s architects, said the rule’s flaring requirements were modeled after and designed to defer to rules in place in North Dakota, which unlike other states, was already addressing the issue. Both the existing North Dakota state regulations and the bureau's rule required operators to submit gas capture plans with their applications to drill, meet monthly gas capture targets, and allowed them to exclude some flaring from the gas capture targets. In addition, the rule included a key provision that allowed state requirements to substitute for the rule's requirements, if a state showed that their requirements would perform just as well in reducing waste. The bureau included this provision to avoid overlapping regulations in states that were already effectively addressing the issue. As the only state with detailed flaring requirements similar to the federal department, North Dakota would have been the ideal candidate for this provision. Other bureau requirements to reduce leaks and venting would likely have stayed in place, as North Dakota has few requirements targeting those sources of waste. Teitz said that the rule would have also helped clarify regulation of flaring on tribal lands, which has been subject to some confusion. Heitkamp did express concern with the legislation and suggested alongside Manchin in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke that it be reviewed. They wrote that the rule included some Indian lands that were not federal lands and had the potential to provide more royalties without declining oil production. Our ruling Cramer said Heitkamp "cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota." There’s no question that Heitkamp’s vote on the repeal of the Methane and Waste Production Rule was crucial, but saying hers was the deciding vote goes too far. McCain was a last-minute holdout who bucked the majority of his party. As for its impact on North Dakota, oil is a big industry and flaring a big issue, but the rule doesn’t only target North Dakota. In fact, it mirrors already existing regulations with regards to flaring, while adding related provisions and strengthening oversight. It’s also possible that North Dakota’s own rules on flaring could supercede the federal regulations. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-05931	"Studies show that if we opened one reserve in Alaska now, in five years, gas prices could be at $2 a gallon."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/29/stephen-fincher/congressman-says-if-one-alaskan-reserve-was-opened/	Nobody likes high gas prices, especially politicians looking to score political points with average, cash-strapped Joes and Janes fed up with prices at the pump. More than one lawmaker has suggested gas prices would drop sharply if the United States would just open up more of its oil reserves to drilling. U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher, the 8th Congressional District Republican farmer from Frog Jump, is the latest to make such a claim. "Studies show that if we opened one reserve in Alaska now, in five years, gas prices could be at $2 a gallon," he said in an interview with the Union City Daily Messenger published on Dec. 30, 2011. Fincher’s assertion sounded suspect to us, so we asked his office multiple times -- in phone calls and email -- which study or studies he was citing. The congressman’s staff never responded to our requests. We could find no evidence of any study like that mentioned by Fincher, so we asked three energy experts if the first-term congressman representing most of Northwest Tennessee and parts of Shelby County could be correct. All three said they are not aware of the existence of any such study. "That certainly wasn’t something that came from us," said Jonathan Cogan, spokesman for the Energy Information Administration, the government agency that collects and analyses data on energy and its impact on the economy and the environment. "I don’t know what he’s referring to," Cogan said. Neither did Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service. "You can probably find a study out there that might indicate that the Kardashians would be better professors at Yale than some of the professors there," Kloza said. "But I wouldn’t give much credence to it." A bouillabaisse of factors leads to higher or lower gas prices, Kloza said, but "there’s no one out there suggesting anything like that, other than the suggestion that if we have a great recession like we did in 2008 or 2009, we could see prices below $2 a gallon." Rayola Dougher, senior economic adviser for the American Petroleum Institute, made the same point. "When people look at forecasts," she said, "they are looking at a lot of different assumptions. Nobody has a crystal ball." The average price of a gallon of regular was $3.26 in December 2011, according to AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Report. The day Fincher’s interview was published, the average price was $3.27. The lion’s share of the price of gasoline is the cost of crude oil itself. Another $1 or so goes for taxes and the cost of refining, marketing and distributing the fuel, Dougher said. For gasoline to fall below $2 a gallon, the price of crude oil would have to fall to about $42 a barrel -- far below crude’s current market rate of roughly $101 per barrel, Dougher said. (Her calculation is based on the fact that, once the $1 in taxes and other costs is deducted from $2-a-gallon gas, that would mean the per-gallon cost of crude would have to be about $1. There are 42 gallons in a barrel of crude, so the price of a barrel would have to fall to $42 before $2 gas would be possible.) Fincher is "conceptually right" in one sense: If more supply is brought into the market, "we’ll have more stable security, and bringing in more supplies is always a plus," Dougher said. "But," she said, "how that would influence the market would be in question. I haven’t seen any studies saying $2." One of the principles of our Truth-O-Meter is that elected officials are accountable for what they say. But in this case, Fincher failed to provide evidence of his enticing claim. And to the contrary, experts told us that they know of no such study, and even if one were to pop up, it would still be misleading to isolate just one of the many variables that can impact the price of a gallon of gas. We rate his claim False.	None	Stephen Fincher	None	None	None	2012-01-29T04:00:00	2011-12-30	['Alaska']
pomt-12986	"California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/dec/19/jerry-brown/are-jobs-california-growing-hell-lot-faster-texas/	Stoking their long-running feud, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently jabbed at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying Golden State is "growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas." Brown made this claim in the middle of an impassioned defense of climate change science at the American Geophysical Union conference on Dec. 14, 2016 in San Francisco. "We’ve proved in California that the economy grows. And it grows in part because of the climate rules that we’ve adopted," Brown said. Perry, a climate change skeptic, was recently selected U.S. energy secretary by President-elect Trump. While Texas governor, he repeatedly visited California in an attempt to lure jobs to the Lone Star State, with the promise of less regulation and lower costs. In his speech, Brown said Perry’s critiques about California’s job-killing red tape don’t hold up. "Now remember our new secretary of energy, he was coming to California to say: ‘Come to Texas because we have all the jobs in Texas." "Well, Rick: I got some news for you, California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas, and we have more sun than you have oil!" Gov. Jerry Brown makes his claim about California "growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas" at about the 13:00 minute mark in the video above. With Brown’s reference of Perry, we took his "faster than Texas" claim to mean faster economic growth with a focus on jobs. We decided to zero-in on job growth rates in California and Texas, while also weighing GDP and unemployment trends in the states. We’ll leave the fun comparison of sunshine to oil for Brown and Perry to wrestle with another day. Our research We concede there’s no definition for what "a hell of a lot faster" growth looks like. Still, we’ll do our best to sort out the governor’s claim. Brown’s spokeswoman pointed us to several news articles detailing California’s recent economic improvements. Looking solely at 2015 job growth rates, Brown’s claim appears to hold up. In that year, California added 483,000 jobs, posting a jobs growth rate of 3 percent, based on data we crunched from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That pace was twice as fast as Texas’ 1.5 percent job growth rate. California’s rapid employment gains have slowed somewhat to about 2 percent this year through November. That may not qualify as "a hell of a lot faster," but it’s still greater than Texas’ roughly 1.6 percent job growth rate so far this year. The business website Kiplinger.com forecast California would rank 10th in the nation among states for fastest job growth in 2016. It noted that Texas was not on its Top 10 list. It wasn’t long ago, however, that Texas outpaced California. In 2014, Texas recorded a 3.7 percent job growth rate, ahead of California’s 2.9 percent pace. Looking to the future, California’s job gains may slow. The closely watched UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts jobs to grow by only 1.5 percent in the state during 2017 and just 0.8 percent in 2018. Because Brown used the phrase "is growing," we’ll judge him on the most recent figures, not future forecasts. Overall economy While the pace of job growth is important, it’s not the only measurement of a state’s economic health. And Brown’s claim could be interpreted as California’s overall economy, not just jobs, is growing much faster than the economy in Texas. In August, PolitiFact Texas took a deep look at the economies of both California and Texas to evaluate a June claim by Julián Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that "Today, California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas." It rated the claim True, citing greater jobs, per capita income and GDP growth rates in California. It noted Texas had a lower jobless rate. Building on that fact check, we looked at the most recent economic figures for both states to see if the assessment still holds. We found that California’s GDP grew faster than Texas’ in the first two quarters of this year, at rates of 2 percent and most recently 2.2 percent compared with Texas’ 1.3 percent and its most recent quarter, a negative 0.8 percent, according to a news release in December by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. It was a different story in 2015 when Texas’ GDP expanded by 4.8 percent (a figure that was recently revised upward) compared with California’s 3.8 percent GDP expansion. Comparing unemployment rates, Texas, at 4.6 percent in November, has consistently fared better than California, where the rate was 5.3 percent in November, and has hovered well above 5 percent this year. California had one more economic bright spot in 2015: Per capita personal income grew at twice the rate as in Texas, 5.4 percent to 2.6 percent, according to federal data. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed "California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas." We took this to mean economic growth with a focus on the pace of job creation. California’s 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas’ pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful claim. But California’s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas’ 1.6 job growth rate. Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California’s GDP expanded faster than Texas’ GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown’s statement. Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years. Brown, like the state’s economy in recent years, is on the right track. And while California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily "a hell of a lot faster." We rate Brown’s statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/158c502a-4b3e-463d-906f-529da13e2451	None	Jerry Brown	None	None	None	2016-12-19T13:37:57	2016-12-14	['Texas', 'California']
pomt-14216	"Tax dodging costs developing countries $200 billion every year."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/19/actionaid-k/tax-dodgers-cost-developing-countries-billions/	The massive leak of financial and legal files known collectively as the Panama Papers has fueled demands for new rules to govern international taxation. While we still don’t know how many of the secretive deals actually broke any laws, ActionAid UK, an anti-poverty advocacy group, argued that these maneuvers starve struggling nations of much needed tax revenues. It asked the public to demand action from British lawmakers. "Tax dodging costs developing countries $200 billion every year," it posted on its website. We were curious where ActionAid got that number. The source was a 2015 report written by three researchers at the International Monetary Fund. Titled "Base Erosion, Profit Shifting and Developing Countries," it used data from 120 countries to estimate the impact of lost revenues due to a couple of factors. One driver was companies shifting profits to avoid taxes. If a multinational corporation creates a paper trail that leaves more profits in a low-tax rate country, it trims its overall tax bill.The authors noted that aggressive tax strategies involving tax haven nations have grown over the past two decades. The other factor was competition among nations. That happens when Country A lowers its corporate tax rate because it saw Country B do the same. You can see this dynamic as setting up the conditions that make profit shifting more likely. If you invest in a multinational corporation, the trends on tax rates work in your favor. If you are in a country that needs tax revenues, your view might be different. The report assessed three kinds of countries: members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, non-OECD members, and tax haven nations. In general, OECD members are advanced industrialized economies. This chart from the report shows how tax rates have fallen over the years. Corporate Income Tax Rates, 1980–2013 When companies pay less taxes because nations aim to attract investment by reducing their corporate tax rates, that isn’t precisely tax dodging. But the IMF team was able to tease out the impact of aggressive tax avoidance by itself. They came up with two estimates, short and long run. The first captures the hit on tax revenues at some hypothetical point when a country changes its tax rates. The immediate loss would be in the neighborhood of $28 billion across the non-OECD group. But over a span of several years, researchers say corporations adapt and work the angles more. They start setting up subsidiaries in certain places not because it makes sense for reasons of production, distribution or sales, but simply because it’s a way to funnel profits into a lower tax jurisdiction. Over time, the total tax loss balloons to $200 billion each year, in line with the number ActionAid UK cited. Vetting the IMF study We asked a number of international tax experts what they thought about the IMF estimate. To be sure, the IMF authors themselves called their approach "highly speculative" and presented their long-run estimate as the midpoint between a low of about $100 billion and a high of $300 billion. Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, has written extensively on how companies shift profits to cut their tax obligations. "I think that IMF study is about as good as we are going to get," Clausing said. "They are using the best data we have available and pretty careful methods. I've read their paper quite carefully." Dhammika Dharmapala, a law professor at the University of Chicago, called the report "a helpful step forward," but added, "I don’t know of an estimate of the tax revenue losses from base erosion and profit shifting for developing countries that has achieved wide consensus in the scholarly community." Nadine Riedel, an economist in public finance at Ruhr University-Bochum in Germany, said the IMF work was a valuable addition to the research, but she emphasized that the words of caution from the authors "should be taken very seriously by the reader." "There is considerable uncertainty related to the revenue loss estimate the authors present, which they make very clear themselves," Riedel told PolitiFact. In particular, Riedel noted that the IMF economists used a high-end estimate to calculate how quickly corporations would move to exploit lower tax rates. (The technical term is elasticity.) The combination of the cautionary words from the IMF researchers themselves and the weight of opinion from outside experts puts the $200 billion estimate on shaky ground. Analytically, it is a tenuous figure. But there’s another wrinkle. Many of the countries ActionAid focuses on, the poorer nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America, are lumped in with much more affluent nations in the IMF analysis. Defining a developing country The IMF study had data on 74 non-OECD nations. That group included many low-income countries, such as Malawi, Cambodia and Uganda. But it also included those that the World Bank considers just one step below high-income, such as China, Mexico and Brazil. The IMF report called all of them developing countries, and with some justification. For the most part, that is the category the United Nations applies to them. Still, it is important to note that some very large economies, such as those of China and India, would account for many of the dollars in that $200 billion estimate. Alex Cobham is a board member of ActionAid UK and director of research at a related advocacy group, the Tax Justice Network. Cobham agreed that a country like Brazil is not in the same boat as one like Malawi. But Cobham said the IMF results suggest that the impact of tax avoidance is even greater for a place like Malawi. "In low income countries, the GDP is low, but so are their tax revenues," Cobham said. "If you take Malawi, it starts with such a low tax base, that even if it loses money at the same rate as all the others based on its GDP, the relative hit on revenues is probably even harder to absorb." The IMF report supports that point. It notes that the ratio of tax revenue to GDP in low income countries is around 15 percent, compared to about 35 percent in the OECD. Our ruling ActionAid UK said "tax dodging costs developing countries $200 billion every year." Even the IMF report that provided the figure called the estimate "highly speculative." For the most part, the outside experts we reached were even more cautious. ActionAid didn’t reflect any of that uncertainty. In addition, the total includes taxes lost by countries that are doing much better than low income nations. The statement is partially correct but the core figure comes with many caveats. We rate this claim Half True. Update, April 20, 2016: After we published, Charlie Matthews who spearheads ActionAid UK's global tax advocacy work sent us this note: "We use 'estimated' in reports etc, but it seems that's been lost as report text is turned into website copy.

pomt-13237	Says the U.S. Attorney’s Office said "that neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on" regarding my father's illegal campaign contributions. "And that’s why they closed this case."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/oct/19/ami-bera/ami-beras-mostly-true-claim-feds-cleared-me-electi/	Babulal Bera, the father of Rep. Ami Bera, D-Elk Grove, was sentenced to a year in prison this summer for making illegal contributions to his son’s campaigns for Congress in 2010 and 2012. Rep. Bera, during a debate this week in Sacramento against Republican Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones, his opponent in the race for the 7th Congressional District, said federal investigators found he had no prior knowledge of his father’s illegal activity. "The U.S. Attorney was pretty clear. They did a thorough investigation. They were consistent that I was never the target of this investigation," Bera said. "They were consistent that neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that’s why they closed this case." Rep. Bera makes his claim at about the 6:20 minute mark in the video above. Moments later, Jones took issue with Bera’s statement: "I disagree with the statement that the U.S. Attorney said they didn’t know anything about it. I think what they said was they couldn’t find any evidence to suggest Congressman Bera or his staff knew about it. And that’s a difference." Had Bera taken statements by federal investigators out of context? We decided to check the facts, with a focus on the portion of Bera’s statement that the U.S. Attorney’s Office said "neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on. And that’s why they closed this case." Our research To back up the congressman’s claim, the Bera campaign pointed to statements by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in May and September. Here’s what acting U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in a May news conference in Sacramento after Bera’s father pleaded guilty to election fraud: "To date, there is no indication from what we’ve learned in the investigation that either the congressman or his campaign staff knew of, or participated in," the crimes by Bera’s father. In September, Talbert’s office released a prepared statement saying "no other charges will be sought in this matter" and that it had concluded its investigation into the illegal contributions. It did not elaborate further on why it closed the case. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to address that question this week. Our ruling Rep. Bera’s statement that federal investigators said he and his campaign "had no idea what was going on" mostly matches with Talbert’s May comments. Still, it’s not entirely clear why the case was closed. We don’t know for sure without an explanation from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which declined to elaborate on the subject. What we do know is Bera was investigated and no charges were brought against him. Bera’s statement is not far from the mark. It would have been completely correct, however, if Bera had repeated what the U.S. attorney said that there was "no indication" he or his campaign had any connection to the crime. His statement could have benefited from this key clarification. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-13689	"Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/jul/29/bike-austin/bike-austin-says-bike-lanes-sidewalks-reduce-austi/	CLARIFICATION, 3:46 p.m., Sept. 9, 2016: Shortly after this fact check posted, we revised a sentence to say that we didn't find research tying the addition of simple bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. We'd originally said we didn't see research generally tying bike lanes to crash reductions. Our rating of the group's claim didn't change. After a 14-year-old bicyclist was hit by a car and killed in Austin in June 2016, local nonprofit Bike Austin called on the city to make streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. In a statement, the group’s executive director, Mercedes Feris, said: "Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets." Does that hold up? Group cites city report To our inquiry, Feris cited a 2015 City of Austin report, "Redesigning the Street: A Report on Right-Sizing Projects in Austin, TX 1999-2014," analyzing the effects of a certain kind of project, called a road diet, designed to make streets safer by shrinking opportunities to drive too fast. In what the Federal Highway Administration calls the classic example of a road diet, lane lines on a four-lane road that has two lanes in each direction are repainted to create a three-lane road, leaving a single lane in each direction and a center lane solely for left turns. A 2014 agency guide to road diets says the concept developed decades ago in response to the expansion-minded road construction of the 1950s and 1960s, when two-lane roads were frequently upgraded to four lanes. One of the first road diets, the guide says, was applied in 1979 to a four-lane road in Billings, Montana. On that road, where about 10,000 cars drove every day, the shrinkage to three lanes was found to reduce crashes without increasing delays. We dug into Austin’s more recent report and checked with experts on road diets and bicycle transportation. From that, we found that such projects often incorporate new bike lanes -- but they don’t typically add sidewalks. Generally, too, the highway administration has found that crashes in which a car hits a pedestrian walking on the side of the road consistently fall by more than 50 percent when sidewalks are installed. We failed to identify research tying the addition of simple, striped bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. The cited city report covers 37 local road diets completed from 1999 through 2014, including the one that Feris pointed out, on a 1.6-mile stretch of Manor Road in Northeast Austin. It resulted, the report says, in a 38 percent drop in crashes. A city spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, responded to our inquiry about the research, saying by email the 38 percent reduction in any kind of crash ties to nearly six years of data collected by the Austin Police Department before and after the road diet took place on the stretch of Manor Road between Theo Drive and East 51st Street in November 2010. A close-up aerial view from along the noted 1.6-mile segment of Manor Road after the road diet was completed. The road includes bike lanes and the hallmark of a road diet project: a center two-way left-turn lane. SOURCE: Google Earth. Monroy told us that in the three years before the project, from November 2007 through October 2010, the to-be-reconfigured section had 39 crashes involving any combination of motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians--adding up to one pedestrian death and 16 injury crashes involving motor vehicles. In the three years after the project, from December 2010 through November 2013, she said, the stretch had 24 crashes -- or 38.5 percent fewer -- with no fatalities and 14 injury crashes, one involving a pedestrian, two affecting bicyclists. It’s also worth mentioning, as the city report says, that bike traffic on the segment increased 180 percent, from 54 bikes tallied in a 24-hour period before the project (and its bike lanes) was completed with 151 bikes in a similar period after. The full report presents general crash-reduction analyses for five of the 37 projects. Among the five, it sums up, "right-sizing projects," or road diets, contributed to at least 22 percent fewer crashes, on Amherst Drive, up to the nearly 39 percent reduction on the Manor Road stretch. We calculated the average of the five: 28.8 percent fewer crashes. Expert: Road diets reduce accidents For outside perspective, we reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, hearing back about road diets, bike lanes and sidewalks from Joan Hudson, an associate research engineer. Hudson advised that the noted 38 percent reduction in crashes falls in line with national research she’s reviewed, also pointing us to the highway administration and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program -- a division of the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Each agency highlights the same two studies finding "the road-diet treatment had a significant effect" in reducing crashes, as the cooperative research program said in a 2008 report. The reductions ranged from 19 to 47 percent, with an average of 29 percent. Hudson said road diets make roads safer for a few reasons: additional space improves reaction time, and a narrower roadway tends to reduce how fast drivers go, making crashes less severe. Road diets also make bicyclists more comfortable, she said, because they have dedicated space instead of sharing lanes with cars. The city’s report also reflected these points. Hudson confirmed that most road diets include bike lanes, but said sidewalks -- posing greater costs than what it takes to revise lane lines -- are hardly ever included. (It looks to us like a sidewalk may have been installed on the Manor Road stretch. To our query, Monroy said she couldn’t confirm it was part of the related road-diet project.) And by phone, Hudson told us that determining how much road diets reduce crashes involving bicyclists or pedestrians is hard because there’s not much data measuring bicycle and pedestrian traffic before and after roads are relined. It may be, for instance, she said, that bike accidents escalate after a project is completed largely because more bicyclists use the added bike lanes. That looks to us like what happened on the on the Manor Road stretch, where bike traffic more than doubled with bike crashes only slightly going up. Bike lanes alone? We wondered if perhaps bike lanes alone result in double-digit crash reductions. To our inquiry, a University of Wisconsin urban planning professor, Robert Schneider, said by email that "it is difficult to make a specific statement" about how a particular bike lane reduces crashes, because that’s not what researches examine. Schneider, who teaches about pedestrian and bike safety, said research tends to be broader, looking at what experts call "networks" -- routes through whole cities or significant parts of cities -- to determine how easy and safe it is to get around on a bike. Research examining those networks, Schneider said, shows that bike-friendly cities help drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians stay safe. He cited a 2011 study from two engineers at the University of Colorado-Denver finding that when intersections and roads are easier for cyclists to navigate and more cyclists hit the road, drivers tend to slow down and be more aware of their surroundings. A Bike Austin leader, Miller Nuttle, informed of our findings, said its claim wasn’t worded as precisely as it should have been. Our ruling Bike Austin said: "Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets." Research suggests big drops in pedestrian-vehicle accidents when sidewalks are introduced. But Bike Austin didn’t offer nor did we find research showing the addition of bike lanes in themselves or bike lanes plus sidewalks resulted in any percentage plummet in crashes. Instead, the city analysis states that reconfiguring lanes on part of one road, which also gained bike lanes, preceded 38 percent fewer crashes--with crash reductions averaging 29 percent among five road-diet projects.

Rick Perry was courting businesses in a bluer state — Washington. The Seattle Times reported Oct. 21 that Perry had sent letters to about 90 "top employers and a few business associations in Washington" urging companies worried about taxes in the Evergreen State to relocate. In Tuesday's elections, Washingtonians rejected a proposal to levy a graduated income tax on the state's wealthiest residents — a 5 percent tax rate on annual taxable earnings exceeding $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for couples, according to the Times. Individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earnings more than $1 million would have faced a 9 percent tax rate. In an Oct. 20 letter to the the president and chief executive officer of Inrix Inc., a tech company based in Kirkland, Washington, Perry wrote: "As the State of Washington considers a multibillion-dollar tax increase for citizens and businesses... I invite you to consider your future in America's new land of opportunity: the State of Texas." And to sweeten the deal: "If Washington doesn't want your business, Texas does. Texas has no personal income tax and no interest in getting one." According to the Times, Gov. Chris Gregoire's office sent the newspaper this response to its query about Perry's invitation: "We're proud of Inrix and proud they call Washington home. I told them that when I visited their headquarters in May. We're serious about keeping businesses here and attracting new ones to the state. We've consistently ranked in the top five in the Forbes list of best states to do business — ahead of Texas." Touché. We couldn't resist checking Gregoire's claim that Washington has consistently beat out Texas on the Forbes list. In its fifth annual ranking of the best states for business, Forbes named Washington the fifth best state, following Utah, Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado. Texas trudged in seventh. Forbes says it bases state-by-state rankings on relevant indicators topped by business costs, which take into account labor expenses and the impact of utilities and taxes. Lesser factors include labor supply and the state's regulatory environment and economic climate, its growth prospects and general quality of life, according to the magazine's article on the 2010 rankings. In 2009, Washington placed second with Texas landing eighth. In 2008, Washington ranked third, Texas ninth. However, Washington hasn't always trumped Texas. In 2007, Texas ranked fourth and Washington fifth. And in 2006, Texas was No. 2, while Washington was Number 12. So has Washington consistently come ahead of Texas on the Forbes list? Washington has ranked in the top five states to do business in four of the five years the publication has been in the ranking business. Texas has landed on that list twice, besting Washington both times. Since 2007 Washington has "consistently" ranked in the top five states business-wise, pushing ahead of Texas for three of the past four years. We rate Gregoire's statement as Half True.

pomt-12050	"The governor’s cuts would kick over 8,000 people out of their homes."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/10/crystal-quade/claim-about-home-care-cuts-mostly-false/	After Eric Greitens vetoed a bill in late June that would have created a possible mechanism for funding in-home care for Medicaid eligible seniors, veterans and people with disabilities, Rep. Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, and Rep. Peter Merideth, D-St. Louis City, wrote an open letter condemning the governor. In the letter published on Aug. 9, 2017, and picked up by several other newspapers, Quade and Merideth tried to rally support for a veto-override. The letter said, "The governor’s cuts would kick over 8,000 people out of their homes." But is the governor solely responsible for this outcome? And 8,000 people losing funding seems plausible, but physically kicked out of house and home? After talking to the chief of the public information office at the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, we found the representatives’ claim is not actually the case. (PolitiFact's database only allows us to check one speaker at a time, so we will check Quade here. The rating would also apply to the co-author, Merideth.) The governor’s cuts To start, Quade and Merideth put responsibility for the loss of funding squarely on the shoulders of the governor. In a literal sense, that’s true: Greitens’ veto means there will be no funding in place once the budget cuts go into effect. In early February, Greitens presented the annual budget proposal, which included cuts to Medicaid coverage for in-home care and nursing home services. Legislators scrambled to come up with a way to keep funding for vulnerable seniors in the budget. In the last minutes of the 2017 session, a bill was passed that authorized the government to divert funds from other boards and commissions to senior services. But Greitens called it a "budget gimmick." Because the bill failed to specify which funds were to be diverted, there was no guarantee there would be enough money to make up the difference. Greitens proposed the original cuts. Legislators tried to make up the difference, and they got a bill over the finish line. Greitens vetoed that bill. While legislators could have considered other methods of funding, the cuts to the budget ultimately fall on the shoulders of the governor, and a significant number of people will lose funding for in-home care as a result of them. Those 8,000 people We talked to Carol Hudspeth, director of the Missouri Alliance for In-Home Care, to get a better understanding of who these 8,000 people are that would supposedly be kicked out of their homes. State funding allows senior citizens, veterans and people with disabilities to receive care in their own homes instead of being moved to a nursing home facility. Hudspeth said eligibility for in-home care is assessed on a points system. The number of points given to a Medicaid-eligible senior is based on things like the number of medications taken, a state-issued health assessment and other needs. Currently, those assessed at and above 21 points are eligible for state funding for care. But budget cuts mean that now only those assessed at and above 24 points are eligible. When we reached out to Quade and Merideth about where they found the 8,000 figure, they directed us to several different sources, but those sources ultimately pointed us back to the Department of Health and Senior Services. Sara O’Connor, chief public information officer at the Department of Health and Senior Services, said people are rated on a scale with intervals of three, which means no one can be assessed at 22 or 23 points. The exact number of people currently assessed at 21 points, and effectively the amount of people currently eligible for funding that won’t be once these changes go into effect, is 7,913, according to the department. That’s pretty close to 8,000, but that’s 8,000 people losing state funding, not 8,000 people losing their homes. Kicked out of house and home? When a senior is assessed by the state as being eligible for assistance with care, families can opt for a variety of ways to obtain it. Hudspeth said some families move loved ones into assisted care facilities, but others hire in-home care providers who help, often on an hourly basis, with cooking, cleaning and bathing. When cuts go into effect, certain seniors, veterans and people with disabilities will lose the funds to hire in-home care providers, and Hudspeth said that means they will also lose funding to receive care at nursing homes or assisted-care facilities. When these individuals are assessed as to whether they are eligible for state funding, that assessment applies to both in-home care and nursing home care. So when funding is cut, they may only get care at the hospital in emergent situations. There are cases when these seniors, veterans and people with disabilities were initially assessed that they opted for their state-funded care providers to be family members. Though spouses are not eligible to receive state funding, children and other family members can be paid by the state to provide care. In fact, Hudspeth said that is a "very common" arrangement. In cases like this, it is likely some families would be able to continue to care for the senior in their home without the funding. Other community organizations also make that kind of care possible. The point is, without funding, vulnerable seniors, veterans and people with disabilities will certainly have to make adjustments that might put significant strain on families. Those adjustments don’t necessarily dictate loss of home. Our ruling Quade and Merideth said that the governor’s cuts would cause 8,000 people to lose their homes. Greitens proposed the original budget cuts to in-home care and nursing home services for qualified seniors, veterans and people with disabilities. Legislators tried to come up with another way to fund these services, but Greitens vetoed that bill. The numbers suggest that just about 8,000 people will lose their funding when the budget cuts go into effect, but that doesn’t mean these people will lose their homes. These seniors, veterans and people with disabilities will lose the funding for both in-home care and nursing home services. But in some cases, they may employ other mechanisms to receive care, or depend more heavily on family-provided care that is not funded by the state. We rate this claim Mostly False. CORRECTION, Sept. 13, 2017: This article has been changed to reflect that when seniors, veterans and people with disabilities lose funding for in-home care, they also lose funding to go to a nursing home (or state-assisted living facilities) to receive care. An earlier version had said that the affected group would be forced to move into state-assisted living facilities.	None	Crystal Quade	None	None	None	2017-09-10T14:20:32	2017-08-09	['None']
pomt-01065	Over the past five years, the American automobile industry has "created about 500,000 new jobs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-auto-industry-has-created-abo/	During a recent visit to an automobile assembly plant in Wayne, Mich., President Barack Obama took a bit of a victory lap when he discussed the comeback of the American automobile industry. "Over the past five years, this industry created about 500,000 new jobs," Obama said. "Last year, American autoworkers churned out cars faster than any year since 2005. Ford has brought jobs back from Mexico, created nearly 24,000 new jobs across this country, including 1,800 new jobs right here in this plant. And after more than a century since Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line, you’re reinventing it -- one production line for gas, electric, hybrid, plug-in vehicles. That’s the first in the world, right here in Wayne, Mich." That’s a lot of statistics to chew over, but we decided to look at Obama’s first claim -- that "over the past five years, (the automobile) industry created about 500,000 new jobs. We looked at this question back in 2012, when United Auto Workers president Bob King said at the Democratic National Convention that since June 2009, the auto industry "has added a quarter of a million jobs." We rated that claim True. So has the increase in auto-related jobs really doubled since two and a half years ago? Actually, it has. To determine job creation in the auto sector, we need to combine the figures for two separate categories of jobs. One is "motor vehicles and parts manufacturing," and the other is "motor vehicle and parts dealers." Between December 2009 and December 2014, the number of jobs in the manufacturing category rose by 230,700 (from 653,300 to 884,000). Over the same period, the number of jobs in the dealer category rose by 272,200 (from 1,616,800 to 1,889,000). When you put those two categories together, the total increase in jobs over the past five years is 502,900 -- almost exactly what Obama said. It’s worth noting that this comeback hasn’t brought automotive-industry employment back to its pre-recession levels. The recent pre-recession peak for these two job categories -- in February 2005 -- was 3.03 million. So despite the gains over the past five years, employment in the automotive industry is still down 9 percent from where it was a decade ago. We’ll also note that PolitiFact’s policy is to consider not just whether a statement is statistically accurate, but also whether the politician or party in question seems to be claiming credit or assigning blame, and if so, whether that credit or blame is deserved. In this case, it’s unclear whether Obama is taking credit for the automotive-industry job growth, but even if he is, experts have told us that Obama’s leadership was crucial, along with help from some Republicans, in helping get the industry back on its feet. So we won’t be downgrading the accuracy of this comment on that basis. Our ruling Obama said that over the past five years, the American automobile industry has "created about 500,000 new jobs." During the period in question, the actual number of job gains in the car industry is strikingly close to what Obama said -- 502,900 -- and we don’t find any significant omissions in his claim. So we rate it True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-20T17:18:30	2015-01-07	['United_States']

"Starbucks just placed Trump’s photo on floor so every customer have to step on it," reads the headline on a Feb. 16, 2017, post on AMPosts.com. It shows three men opening a Starbucks door to reveal what appears to be Shepard Fairey-style images of Trump as the welcome mat (the site added an arrow to point it out). The post redirects from a DepartedMedia.com address that Facebook flagged as potentially being made up, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to identify fake news. DepartedMedia.com is a site known for sharing fake news. The site is registered to an address in Chesterbrook, Pa. The image has been doctored, with Trump’s photo added after the fact. It comes from a Twitter account called @TrumpThe45th, which is associated with the websites. The account tweeted out the photo the same day as the Internet post. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com There has been a strong conservative backlash against the Seattle-based coffee purveyor recently, especially after the company announced it would hire 10,000 refugees over five years following Trump’s controversial travel ban. But despite being picked up by several other websites across the Internet, the image and its implications are a Trenta-sized fabrication. The picture is of a Starbucks, all right, but it was taken in March 2014, when a THIRD Starbucks opened in Downtown Disney at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. Trump hadn’t even announced his presidential campaign at the time. There are no photos on the floor, of Trump or anyone else. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The original image came from a photo of a Starbucks opening in March 2014 at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, Calif., as posted on InsideTheMagic.net. Judging by the comments on the tweet and the Internet ubiquity of the photo, plenty of people were fooled by the visual chicanery.

pomt-05888	Says New Jersey is "down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak" and with Gov. Chris Christie "New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment" for 12 consecutive months.	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/07/one-new-jersey/one-new-jersey-chris-christie-view-states-jobs-sit/	In Gov. Chris Christie’s eyes, New Jersey is on a path to prosperity. But a political advocacy group says the governor’s view is muddled. One New Jersey, a 501(c)(4) organization that opposes the governor, criticized him in a recent news release for a lackluster record on spurring employment growth. "Time and time again, Governor Christie uses big talk to overcompensate for limp action. In his State of the State last week, Christie repeated the catchphrase ‘Jersey Comeback.’ Rather than sprinkling the sound bite throughout his remarks and on the national television circuit, Governor Christie instead should come back to New Jersey and do his job. Because far too many residents are without a job – as the state is down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak," a Jan. 26 post on the group’s website states. "And for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment. "Governor Christie is more focused on creating additional wealth for his friends and backers in the One Percent than he is creating jobs for New Jersey residents." Federal data mostly supports One New Jersey’s numbers. But the statistics need clarification: more recent figures show job growth and the state’s unemployment rate -- at the time One New Jersey put out its news release -- was not statistically different than the national rate. The last recession started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. New Jersey hit a prerecession peak of more than 4.08 million jobs in October 2007. The state had about 3.88 million jobs in December, the most recent data available. That’s a loss of more than 205,000 jobs. Most of that job loss occurred while Jon Corzine was governor. Since Christie took office the state has gained jobs, adding more than 38,000 jobs since February 2010, Christie’s first full month in office. With that job growth, is One New Jersey right to claim that "for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment?" That’s a reference to the difference between state and national unemployment rates, according to One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne. "Since February 2011, for every past month for which numbers are available for both NJ and US, New Jersey has been behind the national rate every month," Henne wrote in an email. New Jersey’s unemployment rate decreased slightly from 9.1 percent in December 2010 to 9 percent last December. During the same time frame the national unemployment rate dropped from 9.4 percent to 8.5 percent. In January 2011, both rates were at 9.1 percent. So the group’s claim is right for 11 consecutive months, not 12. Still, those differences are not statistically significant, said Ken LeVasseur, a senior economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. LeVasseur said New Jersey’s rate may be slightly higher than the nation’s, but "it’s effectively not different." To unemployed New Jerseyans, "the difference in unemployment rates is a heckuva lot more than a question of ‘statistical significance,’" Henne said. "Also, a fact is a fact. Plain and simple, New Jersey lags the nation when it comes to unemployment." On Feb. 3, after One New Jersey made the statement on New Jersey’s jobs situation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the national unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent in January. Updated figures for New Jersey won’t be released until March. It’s also worth noting, as we’ve found previously, that it’s just as unreasonable to blame a state’s governor for job loss as it would be to give him or her credit for job growth. There are too many other factors at work. Our ruling One New Jersey said the state is "down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak" and "for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment." It’s true the state shed more than 200,000 jobs since its prerecession peak in 2007, but the governor didn’t take office until 2010 and since then that trend has reversed. New Jersey's unemployment rate has trailed the national rate for 11 consecutive months, not 12, the difference was never statistically significant and it’s wrong to pin blame for the state’s unemployment problem squarely on Christie. The numbers are mostly right, but they need clarification. So, we rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10816	"Mayor Giuliani made New York City what's known as a 'sanctuary city,' where illegal aliens were allowed to come. And he instructed the leaders of the city not to enforce the law, not to enforce immigration law."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/24/mitt-romney/a-misleading-account-of-nyc-policy/	Romney is referring to a policy in New York and many other cities that directs municipal workers not to tell federal authorities about someone who might be an illegal immigrant unless the person is suspected of a crime or the federal government specifically requires such a report. The policy, which began in 1989 under Mayor Ed Koch and was continued by Giuliani, is still in effect. It is based on the belief that undocumented immigrants are reluctant to report crimes, fires and seek medical care for fear of being deported. The idea is that they will be more likely to do so if they are reassured that city workers won't report them to the feds. Immigration enforcement is primarily a federal obligation and local police haven't played much of a role, unless they have found that a suspected criminal is an illegal immigrant. And the local rules have no effect on federal authorities, who can still arrest and deport illegal immigrants. But opponents of illegal immigration have dubbed municipalities with these policies as "sanctuary cities," a term that conveys broader protection than the policies actually give. This is where Romney and Giuliani's attacks on each other are misleading. Now Romney is correct that Giuliani was welcoming to immigrants and accurately quotes Giuliani's remarks from 1994. The comments come from a New York Times article that said Giuliani gave a "spirited defense of illegal immigrants, virtually urging them to settle in New York City." The article said he "criticized the growing hostility toward illegal immigrants across the country as simplistic and unsophisticated." But Romney's claim that Giuliani "made New York City what's known as a 'sanctuary city,' where illegal aliens were allowed to come" suggests that the Big Apple was a unique safe haven where they would be free from deportation. That's not true. Federal authorities could always enforce the law in New York. And Romney's claim that Giuliani "instructed the leaders of the city not to enforce the law, not to enforce immigration law" is also misleading. City workers had no role in enforcing federal law. That's the feds' job. So we rate Romney's attack on Giuliani as Half True because it exaggerates the real effect of New York City's policies and makes it seem like more of a "sanctuary" than it really was.

pomt-04113	Says 11 states have more people on welfare than employed.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/jan/11/chain-email/chain-email-says-11-states-have-more-people-welfar/	"Death Spiral," proclaims a chain mail that an Austin reader brought to our attention Dec. 21, 2012. That’s the headline on a U.S. map with 11 states highlighted and accompanying text that says, "These 11 states now have more people on welfare than they do employed." We found the same message and map posted on blogs, discussion groups and Facebook. Even Texas’ attorney general tweeted about it Jan. 7. Is it true? The "death spiral" phrase and the 11 highlighted states -- Alabama, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and South Carolina -- appear in a Nov. 25, 2012, Forbes column, and the map appears onscreen during a Nov. 29 Fox Business "Varney and Co." report on the commentary piece. But the criteria used to identify Forbes’ "death spiral" states were not as simple as welfare and employment. Forbes investment strategies editor Bill Baldwin wrote that those 11 states were "at high risk of a fiscal tailspin" because they had many people who received money from the government but maintained policies that "chase out the private-sector jobs that support all that spending." Baldwin reached his conclusion by comparing "makers" and "takers." For this purpose, he wrote, "a taker is someone who draws money from the government, as an employee, pensioner or welfare recipient. A maker is someone gainfully employed in the private sector." Then he factored in an index that downgrades states for "large debts, an uncompetitive business climate, weak home prices and bad trends in employment." The results, he said, showed states that were "danger spots for investors." We’re not sold on designating government workers or pensioners as takers. Regardless, we wondered: Was there any way the email’s claim could be true? Not so much, we learned. First, it depends on what you call employment. Baldwin, as we saw, used private-sector jobs in his measure because he classed government employees as "takers" (a term he acknowledged was "tendentious" in a Dec. 3, 2012, followup interview on Fox Business). But since the chain email discards that nuance, we decided to count up as many people as we could find with a job, government or private. That, we thought, would get to the heart of the viral message: welfare recipients outnumbering people who have jobs. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates many employment numbers, and Cheryl Abbot of the bureau’s Dallas office helped us locate its broadest head count of individuals who have a job. By phone, Abbot guided us to 2011 averages per state in the bureau’s household survey, which wraps in most private-sector workers, civilian government employees and self-employed people. Then, it depends on what you call welfare. We spoke by phone with Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the liberal Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who said that when welfare comes up in public discourse -- talk of "welfare reform" or "ending welfare as we know it" -- people are often referring to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, a cash assistance program created in 1996 to replace an older welfare system. TANF goes only to families with children or to children directly, and other programs that provide cash aid to help with basic needs could reasonably be called welfare too, Schott said. An example she gave was the federal Supplemental Security Income program, which gives money to elderly and disabled people. But in terms of trying to answer our question, she said, TANF data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services could serve as a "good proxy" for welfare. The department’s numbers are broken down by state -- and also by age, which Schott pointed out was relevant to our comparison because most TANF recipients are children. Children don’t vote, of course, and most of them don’t hold jobs. So if you’re making a point about welfare recipients outvoting wage-earners — a common conservative theme that we thought was probably implied in the chain email — kids don’t factor in neatly. According to April 4, 2012, data from Health and Human Services, children accounted for 74 percent of TANF recipients in 2011. Averages for the calendar year showed 4.6 million recipients, of whom 3.4 million were children. With that in mind, we pulled 2011 state-by-state counts of adult TANF recipients and charted them alongside the employment data. Nowhere in any of the 50 states did the TANF adults equal more than 3 percent of the employed workers. The highest percentage was in Maine, where 13,821 adults on TANF equaled 2.1 percent of the 643,000 employed workers. In most states, the group of TANF adults was equal to less than 1 percent of the number of people with jobs. Separately, senior research fellow Robert Rector of the conservative Heritage Foundation gave us a broader definition of welfare -- 79 federal programs -- though even by that measure, he told us by phone, "Welfare recipients do not outnumber workers." The programs Rector cited in May 3, 2012, testimony to the U.S. House Budget Committee were all means-tested (meaning beneficiaries qualified at least in part due to their income levels) and provided cash, food, housing, medical care, social services, training and certain education aid. Some programs that recipients had contributed to, such as Social Security and Medicare, were excluded. On the list are major initiatives such as food stamps and the Supplemental Security Income program Schott mentioned, but also the Earned Income Tax Credit, which by definition goes to people with jobs, and smaller efforts such as helping to weatherize houses and educate migrants. We sought to compare the data state by state, and counting adults only, as we did with the TANF numbers. But Rector said Heritage didn’t have the recipients broken down by states or by age. Nationally in 2011, Rector said, the average number of recipients was approximately 100 million -- nearly a third of the U.S. population, he noted. According to the bureau’s employment data, 140 million people had a job that year. Upshot: There were three employed people for every two "welfare" recipients, including children, as defined by the Heritage Foundation. Because Schott had pointed out to us that the percentage of TANF recipients varied a lot from state to state, we asked Rector if he thought any of the states individually would have more welfare recipients (by Heritage’s standard) than employed residents. "No, I don’t think that would be true," Rector said. "That’s a pretty extreme statement. … That would be very, very large levels of dependency." Our ruling Ripping off a map that was created for a different fiscal comparison, the chain email said 11 states had more residents on welfare than employed. By either a broad definition of welfare or a narrow one, experts told us that’s a false and even "extreme" statement. Pants on Fire!

pomt-12214	Says President Donald Trump "has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any president in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/21/mike-pence/did-donald-trump-cut-18-billion-worth-red-tape-mik/	Vice President Mike Pence says that when it comes to deregulation, President Donald Trump’s record is historic. Trump "has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any president in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year," Pence said in a speech at the National Retail Federation's Annual Retail Advocates Summit on July 18, 2017. Looking at the first half of the statement, we wondered, has Trump surpassed his predecessors in deregulation? And, is the savings $18 billion? It’s not so easy to quantify laws that cut red tape. Experts we spoke with said that other presidents have cut through more red tape than Trump so far, citing the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, as well as President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan’s deregulation of such previously heavily regulated industries as air travel, trucking, banking and telecommunications. However, many of these measures were taken through federal agencies, or constituted a single law, whereas Pence cited a record number of laws passed. " ‘Laws cutting red tape’ is a sufficiently ambiguous phrase that it is nearly impossible to say who has cut the most," said Jon Schaff, a professor of political science at Northern University. "If you were going to judge Pence’s claim, you’d have to go through all laws for all presidents and then decide whether each law was deregulatory in some manner and then how much did it deregulate. How does one judge such a thing? How much ‘red tape’ was saved through welfare reform in the 1990s? Or simply getting rid of federal controls on speed limits on highways? Or tax reform in 1986?" When we asked Pence’s office for clarification, spokesperson Marc Lotter said that Trump had signed 14 Congressional Review Act measures compared with one previously. He’s right. President Bill Clinton signed the Congressional Review Act in 1994, and it allows lawmakers to overturn regulations by federal agencies within 60 legislative days of their issue dates. It mainly applies when a new administration is aligned with the new Congress, and both oppose a certain set of last-minute regulations from the previous president. Unlike executive authority -- which requires notice to the public and hearings, and produces outcomes that are often challenged in court -- Congressional Review Act measures only require an up-or-down majority vote in Congress. "Pence’s office is clearly, unambiguously correct when it comes to Trump signing 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions to just one for all previous presidents — though do note that it is called the Congressional Review Act, and really it would be more fair to say that Congress initiated those actions, and Trump was in a position to ratify their choices," said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution. Savings through the Congressional Review Act Has Trump already saved Americans $18 billion with his deregulatory measures? Lotter directed us to research by the right-leaning policy group American Action Forum to back up the talking point. The AAF calculated $1.1 billion in savings, using the Federal Register’s estimated costs of regulations issued by the Obama administration that were repealed by Congressional Review Act measures. "In addition, President Trump has formally delayed and signaled an intention to amend several other major rules. Combined, these actions could generate more than $18 billion in annual regulatory savings for businesses, investors, and consumers," the AAF said in the cited report. An updated AAF post places this estimate closer to $21.8 billion. We first parsed through the $1.1 billion saved by the historic CRA measures, which checks out with the Federal Register data. What doesn’t check out is Pence’s statement that these dollars have already been saved. The reason it was possible for Trump to roll back these rules was that they had been put in place at the end of the previous administration, which also means that many of them hadn’t yet taken effect. Take the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, a rule that would require energy companies to report to the Federal Exchange Committee payments made to foreign governments. The AAF calculated its rollback would save $590.7 million annually, but those savings would only begin on Sept. 30, 2018, the rule’s required compliance date. The rollback of the Stream Protection Rule, calculated to save $81 million annually, would only start in 2020. With compliance dates months or years in the future, businesses were unlikely to have sunk costs to comply with these rules according to Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a left-leaning government watchdog group. The calculation of costs also ignores the benefits of these rules and industry innovation that may reduce the cost of compliance. In the Office of Management and Budget’s last annual report computing the costs and benefits of the federal regulations that were produced between 2005 and 2015, they found that benefits outweighed costs. "In 2014 dollars, aggregate annual benefits are estimated to be between $269 and $872 billion and costs between $74 and $110 billion," the report said. "These ranges reflect uncertainty in the benefits and costs of each rule at the time that it was evaluated." Arriving at $21.8 billion We then went on to look at the larger chunk of costs the AAF analyzed to come up with total annual savings from executive actions (not just Congressional Act Review measures). These potential savings were calculated using the costs estimated by the Federal Register at the time the legislation was put in place. Taking these cost estimates as full savings assumes that the Trump administration will be able to fully annul rules that experts expect would take years to achieve. For example, the executive action to dismantle the Clean Power Act would theoretically save $8.4 billion annually, but it will take a years-long rulemaking process to complete. The executive order to roll back the Gainful Employment Rule, estimated to save $433 million annually, will be delayed due to a court challenge. The last chunk of the $21.8 billion estimate came from rule delays, which brings us back to our concern with saying the administration has saved the costs from future regulations cut by CRA measures. These costs weren’t straining families and businesses to begin with, because they were not yet in effect, and have simply been pushed further back. The Office of Management and Budget’s latest calculation of the Trump administration’s annualized cost savings estimated these at $22 million, which is significantly lower than Pence’s $18 billion figure. We repeatedly reached out to the OMB for more details on their projections but did not hear back. Our ruling Pence said Trump "has signed more laws cutting through federal red tape than any President in American history and has already saved businesses and families up to $18 billion in red tape costs every year." Whether Trump has signed more laws cutting red tape depends upon how you count legislation. Trump did sign a record number of laws rolling back regulations under the Congressional Review Act, but that’s not the only way to count deregulatory action. Also, Pence is counting eggs before they hatch in using an $18 billion estimate of total savings. The deadlines for compliance for most of the measures he annulled had yet to go into effect, and the fate of many of the executive actions that would back past regulation remains unclear.

pomt-10858	If African-Americans vote their percentage of the population in 2008, "Mississippi is suddenly a Democratic state."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/04/barack-obama/by-itself-black-voter-increase-does-not-flip-missi/	On Aug. 20, 2007, in a bid to convince New Hampshire Democrats that he stands the best chance of beating the Republican nominee next year, Obama said he could be the only candidate to "actually redraw the political map" — especially in the South. "If we just got African-Americans in Mississippi to vote their percentage of the population," he said, "Mississippi is suddenly a Democratic state." He said the same would happen in Georgia, and that South Carolina would be in play as well. His claims about those states don't stand up very well to the math. To begin with, African-Americans in Mississippi and Georgia already come close to voting their percentage of the population. The suggested gains, while they may be welcome, would not be large enough to turn the tide in these red states. In the 2004 presidential election, blacks made up 34 percent of the voters who turned out in Mississippi, where they comprise 37 percent of the population. The numbers are similar in Georgia. In South Carolina, blacks actually made up a slightly larger portion of Election Day voters than they did of the population. Still, the Democratic candidate, John Kerry, went down to defeat in those states. Enter Obama, who says his African-American heritage changes the game in 2008. What if blacks did vote their percentage of the population in the states he mentions? Say he gets every black Mississippi vote that Kerry got in 2004. (about 352,500). Then say he gets the Mississippi white voters who supported Kerry (105,200). Then give him all of the 72,600 black voters who would turn out if Mississippi blacks voted their percentage of the population in 2008. That's about 530,300 total votes for Obama — still short of the 685,000 Mississippi votes that went to George W. Bush in 2004. In sum, he falls short by more than 150,000 votes in Mississippi, about 300,000 votes in Georgia and more than 200,000 votes in South Carolina - even using the most favorable estimates. We did the same analysis on the rest of the Southern states. The math works out the same everywhere but in Florida, where the margin between the parties is so close that an extra 400,000 black voters — all supporting Obama — might buy him a very narrow victory.

pomt-14427	Banks paid Hillary Clinton "over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/09/future45/conservative-pac-attacks-clintons-wall-street-ties/	Before casting a ballot for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, voters deserve to know what she promised the bankers supporting her campaign, says conservative political action committee Future45. A 30-second Future45 television ad, which aired in the San Francisco region in February and March, opens with an actress portraying Clinton opening up a check from financial firm Goldman Sachs. "Hillary Clinton gave speeches to the biggest banks on Wall Street after one of the worst financial crises in American history," the ad’s narrator says. "But Hillary won’t tell us what she said to those banks who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her. So before you promise your vote to Hillary, don’t you deserve to know what she promised them?" One of the most common critiques of Clinton is her connection to Wall Street — though usually from her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders — so we decided to head to the Truth-O-Meter with the ad’s claim that Clinton gave speeches to banks "who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her." It’s worth noting that Future45 has taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals in the financial industry — including a $250,000 donation from Kenneth Griffin, CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and another $250,000 from Paul Singer, founder of hedge fund Elliott Associates. The PAC has spent more than $600,000 against Clinton so far this cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets website. Speaking fees Clinton has delivered several dozen paid speeches for various corporations, professional associations and financial institutions since she left the State Department in 2013, making upwards of $200,000 for nearly every appearance Based on records released by her campaign, we found that she made nearly $4 million speaking to financial services firms. She earned about half of that money speaking to big Wall Street banks like Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs, where she spoke three times in 2013, each appearance raking in $225,000. We don’t have many details regarding what Clinton talked about in those speeches. As the Future45 ad points out, she has declined to release transcripts until other candidates release transcripts from their own paid speeches. In any case, she has earned several million dollars in speaking fees from banks. Now on to her campaign contributions. Campaign contributions Clinton’s campaign and outside groups working on her behalf have received millions of dollars from Wall Street, $23.5 million to be exact, according to her OpenSecrets file. (If you’re browsing the file yourself, we combined donations from securities and investment with miscellaneous finance.) In total, almost $190 million has been raised to support her election, so the amount coming from the financial sector accounts for about 12 percent of all campaign and outside group funds. Most of that money goes to outside groups working on Clinton’s behalf. The top-five organizations contributing to those groups are in the financial sector: Soros Fund Management ($7 million), Euclidian Capital ($3.5 million), Pritzker Group ($2.8 million), Paloma Partners ($2.5 million) and Saban Capital Group ($2.5 million). To be clear: The money doesn’t come from the firms themselves. Rather it comes from individual employees or members of the organizations, or the organizations’ political action committees. The Future45 ad, though, makes it seem like the big banks that paid Clinton for speeches are the same ones that are donating millions to elect her. Not so, at least not yet. OpenSecrets ran some numbers for us and found that donors from these five big Wall Street banks — Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs — have contributed a combined $628,435 to her campaign and allied outside groups so far. That’s far less than "millions." Clinton has received more money from the financial sector than any of the remaining candidates. Candidate Total money raised (campaign and outside groups) Total money raised from the financial sector Clinton $188,192,044 $23,550,697 Sanders $96,356,657 $125,665 Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas $101,388,110 $13,132,821 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. $68,966,558 $12,182,063 Businessman Donald Trump $27,420,828 $294,137 Ohio Gov. John Kasich $15,378,201 $2,367,417 In response to criticisms that she’s beholden to the big banks, Clinton has emphasized that she called for financial regulations early on in the financial crisis. She has also noted that other Democrats have received campaign donations from the financial sector, including President Barack Obama, who in 2008 set a record for most Wall Street donations. Our ruling An ad by conservative PAC Future45 said Clinton gave speeches to banks "who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her." Since 2013, Clinton has received about $4 million in speaking fees from the financial sector. And donors from the financial sector have contributed more than $23 million to her campaign and outside spending groups working on her behalf. However, the ad makes it seem like the same Wall Street banks that paid Clinton’s speaking fees are the same ones spending millions on her election, which is not the case. The major Wall Street banks where Clinton spoke have contributed in the hundreds of thousands, not millions. The statement is partially accurate, but it misconstrues some facts as well, so we rate it Half True.	None	Future45	None	None	None	2016-03-09T21:13:19	2016-03-08	['None']
pomt-03876	"When the president's spokesman was asked about (Anwar) al-Awlaki's son, … he said he should have chosen a more responsible father."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/07/rand-paul/rand-paul-challenges-obama-spokesmans-comment-son-/	Sen. Rand Paul said a lot of things during his 13-hour filibuster of President Barack Obama’s nominee for CIA director. We’ll be checking several of his claims related to the Obama administration’s policy on drones, the unmanned aerial vehicles that can be used to track and kill almost anywhere. One of the comments Paul made during his filibuster concerned the case of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki. He was the 16-year-old son of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida who was killed in a drone strike. The killing of the elder al-Awlaki in September 2011 attracted widespread attention because it was an example of the U.S. government using drones to kill a U.S. citizen overseas. The killing of his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, on Oct. 14, 2011, is a lot less well-known. The younger al-Awlaki was reportedly killed two weeks after his father and was also an American citizen, born in Denver in 1995. Tom Junod of Esquire magazine wrote that "there has been no similar public discussion over the death of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki because there was, until now, no hard information available about the death of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki. … The administration has neither acknowledged his death or acknowledged that it killed him." We won’t address in this article how Abdulrahman al-Awlaki was killed, whether a government drone strike was the cause, and how officials came to the decision to launch the strike, because we can’t independently confirm those facts. Instead, we’ll be looking at this more limited claim by Paul regarding the Obama camp’s discussion of the incident: "When the president's spokesman was asked about al-Awlaki's son, you know what his response was? This I find particularly callous and particularly troubling. The president's response to the killing of al-Awlaki's son -- he said he should have chosen a more responsible father." The episode that Paul, a Kentucky Republican, referenced was a comment by former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs captured on video. At the time, Gibbs was a spokesman for the Obama campaign, and the video was made in the "spin room" that was set up for campaign surrogates of Obama and Mitt Romney to brief reporters following the debate at Hofstra University. In the video, Gibbs says, referring to the younger al-Awlaki, "I would suggest that you should have a far more responsible father if they are truly concerned about the well being of their children. I don't think becoming an al-Qaida jihadist terrorist is the best way to go about doing your business." So Paul has some support for his claim. However, we think it’s worth adding a bit of context. Gibbs did not go out of his way to make this comment; it was elicited by an activist group called We Are Change and two of its members, Luke Rudkowski and Sierra Adamson. The group released the video on YouTube on Oct. 23, 2012. At the start of the three-and-a-half minute video, Rudkowski buttonholes Gibbs, who tries to brush off the inquiries -- four separate times by our count. The video then cuts to a different location in the spin room, as Gibbs is answering questions from a gaggle of reporters. Rudkowski fires a series of questions about how Obama justifies his "secret kill list" and targeting individuals "without due process of law." Gibbs fires back with talking points about the administration’s pledge to "take the fight to al-Qaida." After an exchange of interruptions, Gibbs said, "I think I know where you are on this issue. I’m just trying to answer your questions without you doing it … I’ll go to somebody who might want to listen to what I have to say." The case of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki came up when Adamson posed a question. "Do you think that the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, who was an American citizen, was justifiable?" Gibbs: "I’m not going to get into Anwar al-Awlaki’s son. I know that Anwar al-Awlaki renounced his citizenship -- Adamson: "His son was still an American citizen." Gibbs: "-- and did great harm to people in this country, and was a regional al-Qaida commander hoping to inflict harm and destruction on people that share his religion and others in this country." Adamson: "But who was an American citizen that’s being targeted without due process of law, without trial, and he’s underage. He’s a minor." Only at this point did Gibbs say, "I would suggest that you should have a far more responsible father if they are truly concerned about the well being of their children. I don't think becoming an al-Qaida jihadist terrorist is the best way to go about doing your business." Then the video of Gibbs cuts out. We were unable to reach Gibbs, or Paul, for comment. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told PolitiFact that the comments by Gibbs didn't, and do not, reflect the White House's view. Our ruling Paul said that "when the president's spokesman was asked about (Anwar) al-Awlaki's son, … he said he should have chosen more responsible father." Gibbs did say essentially that. But Paul’s use of Gibbs’ comment leaves out some important context. It was not a carefully crafted statement of White House policy. Rather, it came at the tail end of a contentious exchange with representatives of an activist group, a line of questioning that Gibbs repeatedly tried to brush off. So while Paul is correct to say that Gibbs expressed that sentiment, the senator suggests that it’s more of an expression of White House policy than a full viewing of the video communicates. On balance, we rate Paul’s claim Half True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2013-03-07T16:45:45	2013-03-06	['None']
pomt-05332	"Seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/may/15/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-says-bill-nelson-voted-cut-medicare-500-bi/	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is going after Sen. Bill Nelson’s vote in favor of the federal health care law, saying in a new television ad that the law will "be a nightmare for Florida seniors." The ad includes a statement from Nelson supporting the health care law but interrupts Nelson to suggest his statement is inaccurate. (Watch it here.) The narrator in the ad, among other things, says that "seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare." That’s what we’re fact-checking here -- and have fact-checked many times before. By way of introduction, Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up about 12 percent of the federal budget. Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation. Some of the changes included in the health care law increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, said Tricia Neuman, who is vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation -- a trusted independent source. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap for enrollees purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program (sometimes called the doughnut hole). Other changes reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help pay for coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation, Neuman said. And yet other provisions are designed to improve the delivery and quality of care. (Neuman explains the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen.) The key to this claim is the fact that the health care law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending increases over the next 10 years. In fact, Medicare spending will still increase. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. So while the health care law reduces the amount of projected spending increases in Medicare, the law doesn't cut Medicare. Put simpler, Medicare’s budget will continue to grow -- just at a smaller rate than had originally been projected. The chamber is correct on one point, however: The spending reductions to Medicare are intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the new health care law. On May 14, 2012, lawyers for Nelson wrote to Florida TV stations asking them not to air the ad because of the Medicare claim. "Just last Friday, FactCheck.org, a non-partisan, non-profit consumer advocate project with the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, examined this ad and reported: ‘Chamber Continues To Mislead On Healthcare Law.’ In addition, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, independent non-profit organization PolitiFact has reported a number of times that the claim is ‘false’," lawyers Kendall Coffey and Abigail Parent wrote. In the past, we’ve rated claims about the $500 billion in "cuts" to Medicare anywhere from Half True to Mostly False to False, depending on how they were worded. The U.S. Chamber said that "seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare." That’s largely incorrect. Medicare spending is still set to increase, just not at as high a rate as originally anticipated. The difference, about $500 billion, is being used to help fund other provisions in the new health care law. That’s the small kernel of truth in this claim, which we rate Mostly False.

pomt-15066	"The pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree" on eliminating the "carried-interest" tax break.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/24/tammy-baldwin/do-donald-trump-pope-francis-and-tammy-baldwin-all/	U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin was interviewed on "The Devil's Advocates" radio program on Sept. 23, 2015, the day before Pope Francis made his historic appearance before a joint session of Congress. The hosts of the Madison-based talk show asked Baldwin, a Democrat, about her expectations for the address. Then they shifted to a bill introduced by Baldwin to get rid of "carried interest," which she describes as a tax loophole that unfairly benefits Wall Street investment managers. Host Mike Crute said: "Tammy, I never thought I would find the day where Donald Trump, the pope and you all agree that the carried interest loophole should be closed. This is contributing to the income inequality we have here in our nation." Baldwin replied by asking, with a chuckle: "So which of those three people surprise you the most, in terms of supporting that?" Crute said: "I would say Donald Trump, quite frankly. I think he sort of let out the secret." Then Baldwin said: "I’m teasing you, I’m teasing you," and Crute continued with serious questions about her proposal. A few minutes later, after Baldwin discussed carried interest in detail, host Dominic Salvia asked Baldwin if anyone opposes her proposal. Baldwin said: "Yes, there are people who oppose this change, otherwise it would have probably been law by now. But I do have to just say that I agree with you that when the pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree on an important tax change, maybe it should be getting swifter consideration than it has gotten to date." As one wag put it on Twitter: "That’s one heck of a hot tub." A spokesman in Baldwin’s office told us the senator was not saying that the pope has endorsed the legislation, and that the conversation was about closing the carried interest loophole and the larger issue of income inequality. But she did state that both Trump and the pope agree with her proposal. Do they? "Carried interest" "Carried interest," as described by The Wall Street Journal, is a "much-criticized" tax break that allows investment managers to treat much of their income as capital gains. That means the money typically is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary wage income. The current capital gains rate for high earners is 23.8 percent, while the top ordinary income tax rate is 39.6 percent. Some praise the tax break as a contributor to the growth of the investment management, private equity, real estate and energy industries, and as having had a positive effect on the overall economy and increasing tax revenues. Bills to end, or limit, carried interest have passed the House of Representatives four times, most recently in 2010, but died in the Senate, according to the publication Pensions & Investments. In June 2015, Baldwin and another Democrat, U.S. Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, introduced a bill to end carried interest, with Levin saying it was unfair that such higher-income earners paid lower income tax rates than other Americans. The measure would increase tax collections by $15.6 billion over 10 years, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. The effort for repeal got a boost in September 2015, when Obama called for ending carried interest. But a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee -- where the bill has been referred -- has said the issue should be considered only in the context of comprehensive tax reform. So, Baldwin is among a number of Democrats seeking to repeal carried interest. But what about Trump – and the pope? The Donald and the pontiff It turns out that Trump -- as well as another leading GOP presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – have called for ending carried interest. Indeed, Democrats have celebrated their remarks. In one interview, Trump said: "I would take carried interest out, and I would let people that are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because right now they’re paying very little tax, and I think it’s outrageous." OK. But has Pope Francis stated a position on a tax loophole that most Americans have never heard of? Indeed, it would be rare for the pope to comment on any piece of legislation, much less one dealing with an arcane tax provision. Perhaps Baldwin was assuming his support, based on statements that Francis -- who promotes a Catholic church that "is poor and for the poor" -- has made about economic inequality. For example, in 2013, in the first major work he authored as pope, Francis said: "We can no longer trust in the unseen forces and the invisible hand of the market. Growth in justice requires more than economic growth, while presupposing such growth: it requires decisions, programs, mechanisms and processes specifically geared to a better distribution of income, the creation of sources of employment and an integral promotion of the poor which goes beyond a simple welfare mentality." But we could not find any instances of the pope speaking about carried interest, let alone Baldwin’s specific proposal. Moreover, his practice is to make broad statements, aimed at global audience, not to comment on one bill in one country. Simply put, there is no way to know based on his general statements whether the pontiff would support any particular legislation. Our rating Baldwin said: "The pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree" on eliminating the "carried-interest" tax break. Trump has called for ending the tax break for investment managers that Baldwin is seeking to repeal with a bill she introduced. But while Pope Francis has called for helping the poor and addressing economic inequality, we could not find that has spoken out on this particular tax break. And his practice is to make broad policy statements, not to comment on an individual piece of legislation. If it turns out the pope has spoken about carried interest, we will review this item, but for now we rate Baldwin's statement Half True.

Noting he had been there 26 years, Obama suggested his Republican rival resisted solutions. "Today, we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day Senator McCain took office," Obama told the Democratic National Convention in his featured speech Aug. 28, 2008, in Denver. First, Obama refers to a 26-year period that began after McCain won a U.S. House seat in 1982, taking office in 1983. (McCain joined the Senate in 1987.) Using that 1983 starting point, imports tripled by several measures, according to the Energy Information Administration. Between 1983 and 2007, imports of crude oil — refined to produce products like gasoline — went from 3.3-million barrels a day to 10-million, the EIA reports. During the same time, net imports of all petroleum went from 4.3-million barrels a day to 12-million, the EIA reports. That's a bit below tripling, but pretty close. We rate the charge True.

pomt-04364	Ann McLane Kuster is "for a government takeover of health care more radical than Obamacare. And she supports a $700 billion cut to Medicare for current retirees."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/22/charles-bass/charlie-bass-accuses-ann-mclane-kuster-having-extr/	On the campaign trail, U.S. Rep. Charles Bass has often targeted his opponent Ann McLane Kuster for her support of the Affordable Care Act. But, last month, he took the attack one step further in an ad broadcast on New Hampshire airwaves. Kuster "is for a government takeover of health care more radical than Obamacare," Bass charges in the ad, "Dancing," released September 26. "And she supports a $700 billion cut to Medicare for current retirees," the ad declares. "Annie Kuster: so far left, she’ll never be right for us." We’ve heard this line of attack before. Last month, we gave Bass a False ruling on his charge that Kuster supports a government takeover of health care. But, this claim goes further, accusing Kuster of supporting a plan more extreme than the health care law. So, we decided to take another look. In this ad, Bass cites a Concord Monitor article from 2010, in which Kuster both lauded President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and offered her support for a government-run insurance option to better control costs. "I support the public insurance option to increase competition and bring down costs," she told the paper. "We can't print enough money to have access to healthcare for everyone without addressing costs." In past rulings, including the prior Kuster claim, PolitiFact has disagreed strongly with the classification of the Affordable Care Act as a government takeover of healthcare. A ‘government takeover’ conjures images of the European approach to health care, where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are public employees. In 2010, PolitiFact named the claim its Lie of the Year. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers will continue to provide health insurance to most patients through private insurance companies. This would continue to prove true, even if lawmakers passed a public insurance option, like the one Kuster is talking about, according Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. In that case, private providers would still supply the majority of medical services. But, patients could choose to go with a government-run insurance plan to cover the costs, Oberlander said. "You would still have private physicians and private hospitals, and the government would reimburse them," he said. "But the government would not take over the medical system." Let’s look now at the $700 billion figure Bass mentions in the ad. As in the September claim, Bass is referencing money reportedly taken from Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office revised its estimates to show that the health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $716 billion between 2013-2022. As noted in prior PolitiFact rulings, the reductions do not come in the form of direct cuts, but through changes to Medicare intended to reduce costs. These changes, targeted mainly at insurance companies and hospitals rather than beneficiaries, will not result in immediate cuts to Medicare, but are intended instead to reduce future Medicare spending and to free up savings that will then offset the costs of the health care law. Our ruling: Last month, we chided Bass for referring to the Medicare reductions as a robbery. This time, the Congressman changed his language, speaking instead to a "$700 trillion cut," a claim we deem more accurate. But, he still did not accurately characterize the nature of the cuts, which will be realized over time. Similar statements have been ruled Half True in the past for failing to make these distinctions. Moreover, little has changed that makes Bass’ claim about the "government takeover of healthcare" more true today than it was a month ago. Introducing a public option might welcome the government further into the insurance game. But, it would not bring the U.S. medical system any closer to the European model of government-run hospitals and clinics. This part of the statement remains False. On balance, we rate Bass’ claim Mostly False.	None	Charles Bass	None	None	None	2012-10-22T12:00:00	2012-09-26	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']
pomt-09822	Over the past few months, we've learned that "we just can't count on the media to debunk" lies about health insurance reform.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/02/organizing-america/organizing-america-says-media-wont-check-facts-we-/	Normally, modesty would forbid us factchecking an item about media factchecking. But we couldn't ignore statements in a recent e-mail from Organizing for America, the Democratic advocacy group that emerged from Barack Obama's campaign organization. "Friend," begins a fundraising e-mail from the group signed by director Mitch Stewart. "Over the past few months, two things have become clear about the fight for health insurance reform. "1. Our opponents will create and spread outrageous lies to try to stop President Obama from creating real change. 2. We just can't count on the media to debunk them." The e-mail asks for cash contributions to help Organizing for America fight back. "Stepping in when the media fails is a daunting challenge," Stewart writes, "But this community has already come together and accomplished feats no one thought possible. ... Please donate today to get the truth out." Lest we be accused of tooting our own horn here, we'll confine ourselves to a review of some of the other media coverage of the health reform battle. Factcheck.org has debunked many false claims, including an e-mail analysis of what's in a bill being considered in the House of Representatives, as well as a list of " seven big myths " about health reform. CNN's "Truth Squad" has looked at whether you have to go blind in one eye before getting eye care (wrong!) and many other false claims about health care. The Truth Squad cataloged all their fact-checks on their Political Ticker blog . There's also the Associated Press. They reported several fact-checking pieces, including looking at claims Obama has made , as well as claims about euthanasia and illegal immigrants . CQ Politics reported a story on whether health care would be rationed, whether employees could be automatically enrolled in a public plan, and whether the government would have real-time access to bank accounts, among other things. Nope, nope and nope. We could go on (and on), but you get the picture. There is no shortage of reporting on false claims about health care. We know, based on our own reader e-mail, that there is still a lot of confusion about health care reform and what it entails, including among those who are truly undecided. And we've also heard from readers who have negative, factually incorrect ideas about health care reform and don't want to be argued out of their beliefs. Mitch Stewart of Organizing for America might not like the fact that some Americans remain unconvinced. They also probably don't like it that town halls during August have been packed with people making erroneous claims, or that some pundits think Obama is losing the debate over health care. But for Organizing for America to say that the media isn't debunking false claims about health care is wrong -- demonstrably wrong. In fact, it's laughably delusional.

pomt-04581	Barack Obama "refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/24/republican-jewish-coalition/republican-jewish-coalition-says-obama-refuses-ack/	Editor's note: This item was originally rated Half True. After a panel of editors reconsidered the rating, it was upgraded to Mostly True. The Republican Jewish Coalition -- a group backed by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a few other wealthy GOP donors -- has opened a campaign in battleground states to persuade Jewish voters to turn away from President Obama and support Mitt Romney. The group said its effort, called "My Buyer’s Remorse," includes a $5 million television ad buy in Ohio (specifically Cleveland), South Florida, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) and Nevada (Las Vegas) that will continue through Nov. 5. It also includes a direct-mail brochure to voters saying Obama is "wrong on Israel, wrong on our economy." First among the statements answering its question "Why is Barack Obama wrong for us?" is that he "refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel." Given that the flier is showing up mailboxes in the battleground Buckeye State, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worth looking into the coalition’s claim. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made a similar claim in a 30-second TV ad that aired in early August 2012. PolitiFact national looked at his claim then. We’ve incorporated some of that research here. The United States does not formally recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. In the decades-long conflict between Jews and Palestinians, both sides stake a claim on Jerusalem and consider it their capital and a holy site. So even though Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government and its capital city in every traditional sense, the official position often involves some tip-toeing. The CIA, on its World Factbook website, lists Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with a footnote stating "Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950, but the U.S., like all other countries, maintains its Embassy in Tel Aviv." The U.S. Department of State posts similar language. During the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama declared that "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided." The remark pleased the pro-Israel lobby, which had been somewhat skeptical of him. But it also served as an early lesson in the delicacy of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab groups took offense, and the campaign had to do some damage control. "It's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations," Obama said in the wake. For his part, Republican rival John McCain weighed in, agreeing "Jerusalem is undivided. Jerusalem is the capital." "And," he added, according to the New York Times, "we should move our embassy to Jerusalem," from Tel Aviv, "before anything else happens. The subject of Jerusalem itself will be addressed in negotiations by the Israeli government and people." Therein lies a long-running point of contention: the location of the U.S. embassy. As our peers at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker column noted, the Republican Party platform has long included a pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem. But that’s never happened, even when a Republican was in the White House. How wide is the gap between campaign rhetoric and official policy? During a press briefing on July 26, 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney twice dodged the question when asked directly to name the capital of Israel. He replied only that "our position hasn’t changed" and "you know the answer." State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland parried similarly at a briefing on March 29, 2012. "Jerusalem is a permanent-status issue," she said. "It’s got to be resolved through negotiations." Those briefings are the evidence the Republican Jewish Coalition pointed to when PolitiFact Ohio asked for backup to its brochure. Romney’s campaign cited the Carney briefing. The claim in the RJC brochure is accurate. Obama has not formally acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But the claim needs additional information for clarification. As a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process. The RJC's brochure portrays that position as a betrayal of an ally. But it's a continuation of the position that previous presidents, both Democrat and Republican, have taken. Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA note that Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, with a footnote attached, on their websites. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-12208	Says Adam Putnam "was for amnesty."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/jul/24/tony-fabrizio/was-adam-putnam-running-florida-governor-amnesty/	Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam has largely had the Republican field for governor to himself, but the camp of one potential primary challenger has portrayed Putnam as soft on immigration and undocumented immigrants. Tony Fabrizio, a pollster hired by Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran who may challenge Putnam in the 2018 primary, cast Putnam as not being conservative enough. "He was for amnesty," Fabrizio told Politico July 10, while criticizing Putnam’s positions on a long list of issues. That a-word can be a powerful weapon in a Republican primary. But we found that Putnam’s record on immigration can’t be boiled down to a soundbite. As a member of Congress from 2001 to 2010, Putnam represented a Central Florida district that included agribusiness interests that wanted immigrant labor. Putnam supported legislation that would have benefitted undocumented farm workers, and he supported changing immigration laws which included a path to citizenship. But he also took some stances that didn’t benefit undocumented immigrants, such as opposing the DREAM Act and increasing enforcement. Defining amnesty is tricky The challenge in fact-checking attacks about "amnesty" is that it is a vague term and people with opposing views about immigration may define it differently. Some view amnesty as blanket permission for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, while others view amnesty as any measure that is favorable to any undocumented immigrants, even if it includes a list of tough measures they have to meet. (Dictionary definitions generally view amnesty as a pardon.) However, there is one key piece of legislation that was undoubtedly amnesty, and it was signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. By contrast, the legislation written by eight senators (including Marco Rubio) in 2013 had several hurdles before undocumented immigrants could get legal status and on a path to citizenship. When Rubio said that the bill wasn’t amnesty, we rated his statement Half True. Putnam supported some bills that would benefit undocumented immigrants Fabrizio pointed to stances Putnam took in favor of expanding visas for workers and in favor of changing immigration laws. Here are some examples: Work visas: In 2003, three Arizona Republicans in the House and Senate introduced the Border Security and Immigration Improvement Act, which would have given migrants temporary work visas for three-year terms and then allow them to seek lawful permanent resident status. Those who were already here illegally would get a separate visa and have to wait six years to apply for legal status and pay a $1,500 fine. Critics derided the legislation as amnesty, but sponsors said it wasn’t amnesty because illegal crossers would have to get in the back of the line. Putnam was one of 12 cosponsors of the house. The legislation never reached a vote. AgJobs: Putnam co-sponsored AgJobs bills in 2007 and 2009 that would have provided a "blue card" to undocumented farm workers already in the United States. After paying a fine, they could eventually apply for a green card to get permanent legal status if they continued to work in agriculture. The legislation was also intended to overhaul rules on farm worker visas. These measures died without reaching a vote. In 2009, Putnam defended the legislation as an "effort to have a stable, legal workforce for agriculture, so this country won't be as dependent on others for food as it is for fuel." Path to legal status: During his tenure in Congress and after he left, Putnam made statements in favor of legislation that included a path to legal status and eventual opportunity for citizenship. In June 2013 while he was Florida’s agriculture commissioner, Putnam told reporters that he supported the "Gang of Eight" bill which he saw as a benefit to multiple industries including agriculture. "It makes improvements at the border and employee verification, while also creating a more modern visa program so that jobs in our economy can be filled when there is a shortfall of domestic labor," he told the Lakeland Ledger. "That has been particularly acute in agriculture." Arizona-style law: In 2011, while agriculture commissioner, Putnam was against a proposal in Florida to adopt an Arizona-style law to give police the ability to request immigration documents. He called for a national solution to immigration laws instead and said Florida couldn’t cut and paste legislation from Arizona, a border state. Putnam also supported some measures that wouldn’t benefit immigrants Putnam’s campaign spokeswoman Amanda Bevis pointed to stances Putnam took that showed he was against sanctuary policies created by cities or states that won’t share immigration information with federal officials and votes in favor of securing the border. Sanctuary cities: Putnam voted for measures that would ban federal funding for states and localities that have sanctuary policies in 2006 and 2007. Border security: Putnam took several votes in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement. For example, he was one of multiple cosponsors of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and voted for the legislation. The law signed by President George W. Bush authorized about 700 miles of fencing between the border of the United States and Mexico. Law enforcement: Putnam supported measures to empower state and local law officials to help enforce federal immigration laws in 2006 and 2007. Dreamers: In 2010, Putnam voted against a Senate amendment on a bill that included a DREAM Act provision, which would have allowed children brought illegally to the United States as minors to stay. Against other benefits: In 2008, Putnam voted that undocumented immigrants should be ineligible for federal housing assistance. After meeting with President Barack Obama and lawmakers at the White House in 2009, Putnam said in a statement that he was in favor of securing borders and making reforms to help draw workers to the country. But he stressed that one option is off the table: "Immigration is a complex issue, so there are any number of reforms possible, but granting amnesty to people who are here illegally must not be one of them." On his campaign website video about immigration, Putnam makes no mention of a path to citizenship and speaks of supporting President Donald Trump’s policies. "As governor we will work with President Trump to cut funding for sanctuary cities, we will support tighter border security and vetting for refugees from Muslim countries," he said. Our ruling Fabrizio said that Putnam "was for amnesty." While in Congress, Putnam supported legislation that would have expanded work visa categories for undocumented immigrants and put them on a path to legal permanent status. After leaving Congress, he supported the 2013 immigration legislation, which wasn’t blanket legal residency but did include a path, albeit a long one, to legal status. Putnam’s campaign points to examples of legislation he supported that weren’t favorable to undocumented immigrants such as toughening up border security and opposing the Dream Act. The claim is partially accurate, but lacks important context. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-05769	"The biggest contribution" behind a decrease in U.S. unemployment "was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce"	false	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/29/newt-gingrich/gingrich-main-reason-unemployment-decline-shrinkin/	A visit to the Atlanta-based Neal Boortz radio show gave Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich a chance to partake in three of his favorite pastimes with a single sentence. The former U.S. House speaker railed against President Barack Obama. He took a swing at the media. He tackled the economy, which some see as the president’s Achilles’ heel in this year’s election. Gingrich said the media won’t report news that dents Obama’s reputation. He gave the nation’s improving unemployment rate as an example. "That’s why on Friday when the unemployment numbers came out you didn’t get anybody in the news media pointing out that the biggest contribution to the unemployment number was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce," Gingrich said. We at PolitiFact Georgia felt obliged to address the media’s alleged lack of due diligence by deploying our Truth-O-Meter. We contacted the Gingrich campaign, but it did not respond. We took a closer look at the data ourselves. Lately, it’s popular among Republicans to question whether the economy is truly recovering. We often hear claims that the improving unemployment rate doesn’t tell the whole story or somehow underplays the nation’s economic troubles. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official keeper of employment data. The numbers it issued Feb. 3, the day Gingrich mentioned on the Boortz show, said that the unemployment rate dropped to 8.3 percent in January. We talked to four labor economists about this data. They agreed that Gingrich is using it wrong. In fact, those who performed a close analysis of the numbers agreed the data suggest the opposite. The BLS surveys a sample of the U.S. population to determine which respondents are working; which ones are not but are looking for a job; and which ones don’t have a job, are able to work, but are not looking for work. It calculates the unemployment rate by taking the number of people who are unemployed but are looking for work and dividing it by the sum of two categories -- those who are employed, plus those who are not but looking for work. This means the unemployment rate does not account for an important category of people -- those who don’t have a job and are able to work, but who are not actively searching for employment. This "not in the labor force" category may include people who stopped looking for work because they’re going to school, taking care of children, have retired, gave up looking or any number of other reasons. This also means that two factors could push the unemployment rate lower: More people could be getting jobs, or more could have dropped out of the labor force. We looked at the BLS data for those "not in the labor force" and found that between December and January, their ranks appeared to swell by some 1.2 million. This seems to support Gingrich’s statement, but labor economists say otherwise. This is why: The BLS bases its unemployment rate on a survey that samples only a portion of the U.S. population. Sometimes, this can cause problems. For instance, the sample might be made up of only 40 percent of women, when they actually make up half the population. Or the sample may contain too great a proportion of Montanans and not enough Floridians. BLS economists address this problem by running this data through a series of "weights." These are mathematical equations that smooth out quirks in the sample. The weights are based on the makeup of the U.S. population. The U.S. population changes constantly, so the BLS updates these weights every January. As a consequence, comparing data between December and January can lead to bad conclusions. Changes are not clear-cut signs of changes in economic conditions. They’re distorted by changes in the weights. This is no secret. It’s on the BLS news release. It’s been standard practice for years. To help policymakers get a handle on what’s actually going on, the BLS issues alternative data that show what the numbers would be if the same population controls stayed the same. By this measure, the number of people "not in the workforce" actually shrank by 75,000, said Barry Hirsch, a professor at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. "The [number of people] not in the labor force definitely went down, not up," Hirsch said. There are other signs that the workforce is expanding. Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the Brookings Institution think tank, considered data for adults between 25 and 54. January’s data indicated population control changes did not have as dramatic an effect on this group. In this category, the number of employed rose 0.3 percentage points in January, reaching a level last seen in the summer of 2009. He believes other groups experienced similar improvements. "The favorable unemployment rate change reflected in the 2012 jobs report was mainly the result of increased employment, contrary to Speaker Gingrich’s claim," Burtless said in an email. Gingrich’s claim that "the biggest contribution" behind easing unemployment "was 1.2 million people leaving the workforce" is based on a bad interpretation of the data that is easy to avoid. BLS numbers suggest the number of those not in the workforce is actually shrinking. Other measures support this conclusion. How can the "biggest contribution" to a decline in unemployment be a shrinking workforce when the numbers suggest the opposite is taking place? Gingrich earns a False.

pomt-09327	Rubio's "got more experience than Obama had."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/14/richard-land/rubio-president-obama-experience/	Former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio hasn't been elected to the U.S. Senate -- he hasn't even won his Republican primary -- but already his name is being floated as a possible 2012 presidential contender. One of the latest mentions comes from Richard Land, president of The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. The conservative religious group opposed President Barack Obama's health care reforms as well as a recent federal hate crimes bill because the group said it provided "special federal protections for homosexuals that most others do not have." In a recent interview with Politico, Land -- unprompted -- brought up Rubio's prospects. "The longer nobody catches fire, the more space there is for Marco," Land said of a possible presidential run. "It wouldn’t be unheard of for a freshman senator from Florida to be the nominee — particularly one who was speaker of the (Florida House of Representatives). "He's got more experience than Obama had," Land continued. "There are a lot of Hispanics in this country who would find someone with Marco’s ethnic background very appealing. Although I like Sarah (Palin), I think Sarah’s got a lot more impediments to a nomination than Marco Rubio does." Rubio has tried to dismiss the Internet buzz of a possible run. But that doesn't mean PolitiFact Florida can't dream. Which begs a real question: If the fresh-faced Rubio did run in 2012, would he have more experience than Obama did when he was elected in 2008? To begin to answer that question, we have to first presuppose Rubio 1.) gets elected in November 2010 to the U.S. Senate and 2.) decides to run for president in 2012. If that happens, Rubio will have two years in the Senate plus nearly 11 previous years of political experience -- a little less than two years as a part-time West Miami city commissioner (April 1998-January 2000), and almost nine years in the Florida House of Representatives. (He was elected in a special election in early 2000 and served through 2008.) While in the House, Rubio served in the Republican leadership as whip, majority leader and eventually speaker. A position in the state House is considered part time. All together that adds up to 13 years of political experience. Before that, Rubio's work experiences are thin. According to his official biography, Rubio attended South Miami Senior High School and graduated in 1989. He went to three colleges, eventually graduating from the University of Florida in 1993 with a bachelor of science, and then from law school at the University of Miami in 1996. He then began to work for the private Miami law firm Tew Cardenas. He has worked as a lawyer with private firms on and off ever since. In 2008 and 2009, Rubio co-instructed a class on Florida politics at Florida International University. Contrast that with Obama. During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact extensively researched Obama's work and political experiences. Obama had 12 years of political experience prior to being elected president -- nearly four years in the U.S. Senate (2005-2008) and eight years in the Illinois state Senate (1997-2004). Like Florida, Illinois' Legislature is considered part time work. That's in addition to his work before being elected to the state Senate. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama worked for a year as a financial analyst, then three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. He graduated from law school in 1991, then ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992. After that, he accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993 and was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school while in the Illinois Senate. PolitiFact determined that Obama had at least 20 years of work and political experience. By the same calculation, Rubio would have 16 years of work and political experience if he was elected president in 2012. Rubio would have one more year as a public official, but less work experience overall. And all experience is not equal. Obama, when elected president, had four years in the U.S. Senate. Rubio would just have two. That's a significant difference. Consider this: Of the 16 U.S. senators to have been elected president, all served at least four years in the Senate, and most served at least one full term. President Richard Nixon served only four years in the Senate, but he was vice president for two terms. President William Henry Harrison left the Senate after a truncated term (he was appointed minister plenipotentiary of Columbia) but had been a war hero from the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 and previously had served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Then there's Rubio's time in West Miami (pop. 5,533). While constructive, being a city commissioner in a small town certainly doesn't have the complexities of state or federal government. That said, Obama and Rubio's state experiences certainly are comparable -- Rubio served almost nine years in Florida's state House, including two years as House speaker, to Obama's eight in Illinois' state Senate. If elected in 2012, Rubio would be the country's youngest-ever president at age 41. In making a hypothetical argument that Rubio could be elected president in 2012, Land said that Rubio -- while young -- would have more experience than Obama when he was elected in 2008 at age 47. Rubio spent slightly more time in state government than Obama and had a more prominent role, so by that measure he has more experience than Obama did. But if you look at time in the U.S. Senate (Obama's four years to what would be Rubio's two) and overall work and political experience (Obama's 20 years to Rubio's 16), Obama outmatches Rubio. And Obama has worked in a variety of roles, while Rubio has only been a lawyer. As such, we rate Land's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00636	Says the State Department has "had half a year" to respond to a Benghazi document request, yet "I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/21/trey-gowdy/benghazi-committee-chair-state-dept-hasnt-complied/	The State Department is "stonewalling" the House Committee on Benghazi’s investigation, says its committee chair, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. On Fox News May 15, Gowdy said the State Department is taking far too long in producing documents related to the 2012 terrorist attack on an American diplomatic compound. Gowdy pointed to a November 2014 request for emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top advisers that has yet to be fulfilled. "It's a conscious decision not to cooperate with a legitimate congressional inquiry," he said, adding. "I don't want the drama. I want the documents. They have had half a year and I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper." Because the Benghazi investigation -- as well as Clinton’s private email use while secretary of state -- are likely to stay in the news as Clinton’s presidential campaign moves forward, we decided to look into Gowdy’s statement. There’s no denying that the Benghazi committee doesn’t have all the documents it wants and not by the committee’s desired timeline. But it’s inaccurate to say they haven’t received "a single, solitary scrap of paper" related to their November request. The committee’s own interim progress report -- published May 8, 2015 -- proves this. 850 scraps of paper In November, the committee asked for communications and documents about Benghazi for 11 top State Department officials that included Clinton and her senior staff, according to the report. The committee also asked Clinton’s attorney for her private emails related to Benghazi and Libya. Two months later, the committee held a hearing to draw attention to what Gowdy says is a prohibitively slow executive branch response to document requests. After the hearing, on Feb. 13, 2015, the State Department produced about 300 emails to and from Clinton, totaling about 850 pages. Of course, this didn’t completely satisfy the November request, because it didn’t include the emails of Clinton’s top aides and senior staff. The committee ordered a subpoena in March for the rest of these emails. The subpoena has a broader scope than the November request -- for example, requesting all emails pertaining to Libya, not just the attack on the Benghazi compound. Committee spokesman Jamal Ware told PolitiFact that Gowdy’s statement referred to the March subpoena for Clinton’s aides’ emails, which the committee still hasn’t received. However, Gowdy’s statement includes the qualifier "They’ve had half a year," which would indicate he is talking about the November 2014 request, not the March 2015 subpoena. Additionally, the Clinton emails were the committee’s top priority from the November request, according to a State Department document detailing the documents provided. It’s worth noting that more than two-thirds of the Clinton emails are communications with her senior staff, and some senior staff emails pertinent to the November request were included in earlier document releases to the committee. In defense of Gowdy’s statement, Ware added that the Clinton emails don’t necessarily count as State Department documents because Clinton used a private email address while secretary, maintained in her own private server, so the emails were never under State Department control. "The only records the committee has received were self-selected by the former secretary and turned over by her," Ware said. "The State Department did not have control or custody over those emails." The department did, though, have at least some modicum of control over these emails. Because of the Benghazi investigation, the department requested and received 50,000 pages of Clinton’s emails weeks before the November request. They read through every email to select the ones that pertained to the November request, resulting in the turnover of 300 emails in February. The State Department contends that they are unable to fully complete records requests within the committee’s desired timeframe in large part due to "resource and technological restraints." For example, going through Clinton’s 50,000 pages of emails took about 2,400 man hours, according to the Washington Post. The State Department had to digitize every single page by hand because Clinton handed over paper copies of her emails, rather than electronic ones, vastly slowing down the process. Additionally, the State Department said it does not have key phrases to search through emails pertaining to the subpoena, so they have to read through every single email over a two-year period for 10 members of Clinton’s senior staff. In response to the State Department’s assertion that how fast they can comply is limited by their resources, the committee’s interim report said, "While the committee respects the State Department’s institutional interests, it is also important to note that a substantial degree of this effort may result from its own internal review processes rather than any requirements imposed by the committee." State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach said his office has worked closely with the committee since its inception, noting that over the course of the investigation, the State Department has provided more than 40,000 pages of documents in total. "We have been continuously engaged and responsive to the committee’s requests and stated priorities, and we have had several meetings and discussions with them during recent months regarding the specifics of our plans to respond to both their Nov. 18, 2014, letter and their broader March subpoena," Gerlach said. Our ruling Gowdy said the State Department has "had half a year" to respond to a Benghazi document request, yet "I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper." The House Benghazi Committee’s own report notes that in response to a November 2014 request for emails from Clinton and her top aides, the State Department has produced 850 pages of Clinton’s emails. The State Department hasn’t yet produced Clinton’s staffers’ emails in response to this request. The department argues that Clinton’s emails were top priority, that many of the staffers’ emails have been provided in previous document requests, and that their response time is limited by department resources. Gowdy has a point that he’s still waiting on quite a few documents, but it goes too far to say he hasn’t received a "single, solitary scrap of paper." We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-13865	"Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail" by President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-isnt-winging-it-complaint-about-air-f/	It's a political fact of life: Incumbency has its perks. You're already in a position of power. Name recognition is not a problem. And, if you're president, your arrival at a venue — whether for campaign reasons or not — is bound to generate headlines. That's the underlying complaint of a tweet presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sent out July 5 as his presumptive Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was preparing to join President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One for a campaign trip to North Carolina. "Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail" by President Obama and Hillary Clinton, Trump said. We wondered if it was true that the trip was going to be made at taxpayer expense. To some degree, it is. And that's out of necessity. The president doesn't stop being president just because he's campaigning for himself or someone else. Even if he flew to a campaign stop on a commercial jet, he would need a host of support services and personnel to keep him connected and in charge. And that doesn't include the requirements for security. Thus, the president always uses Air Force One, which is one of two specially designed Boeing 747s built in 1986 to include a command center, a medical suite, bedroom, office, two food preparation galleys, and plenty of room for staff and reporters. It's not cheap to operate. According to CNN, the Air Force was reporting two years ago it cost $206,337 an hour to operate the jet. It's not clear what that covers. A General Accounting Office analysis of three overseas presidential trips in 1998 reported an hourly cost of $34,400, which would be $50,700 per hour in 2016 dollars. Technically, if the president makes a campaign trip, the campaign or the political party is supposed to reimburse the government for use of the plane to some degree. (The full cost is not reimbursed because some of the costs are directly connected to the responsibilities of being president.) These days, the amount is the price of chartering a 737, which is a bit over $11,000 an hour, according to the Washington Post. Prior to 2010, the required reimbursement was nothing more than the cost of a first-class ticket on a commercial airline. When you have someone traveling on behalf of a campaign, such as Clinton and any staffers who might be accompanying her, the accounting can get even more complicated. But how it's calculated by the White House Airlift Operations office isn't known. The government does not release details of how it figures such costs, and that's been a secret going back to the 1970s, according to CNN. The amount is even more complicated when the president mixes business with politics, such as flying somewhere to give a policy speech or performing another official act but also spending time attending a purely political event, such as a fundraiser. (The North Carolina appearance, in contrast, was purely political.) How much taxpayers end up paying when business is mixed with politics isn't clear because, once again, the formula for calculating the share paid by the campaign and the government is secret. The White House Counsel's office makes a determination on how political a trip is, according to Time magazine. Mark Knoller, the CBS News White House correspondent who has been tracking presidential trips for years, noted in a tweet that presidents have repeatedly told the press that such costs will not be revealed. > "Prior administrations also refused," he noted in a followup tweet. "But they didn't claim to be most transparent Admins ever." The closest you can get to getting an estimate is to see what the campaigns pay the government. For his re-election in 2004, George W. Bush's campaign paid just under $1 million, according to the Post. But that was when the cost was based on a first-class commercial airline ticket. By 2012, after the rules were changed to be based on chartering a 737, Obama spent just over $3 million. In this case, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said the campaign will cover its portion of the costs, although he indicated those costs had not been determined. The Trump campaign didn't respond to an email, but Trump is well aware that campaigns are required, by federal law, to reimburse for expenses. During his trip to Scotland last month, Trump went to great lengths to repeatedly state that federal law requires his campaign to pay for everything, even if it's the use of a conference room in Trump Towers, which he said he would gladly let his campaign use for free. "I'm forced, you know, legally, I have to pay myself back," he said. "If I use one of my resorts in the United States and we have a press conference or something, by law I have to pay myself back." Our ruling Trump said, "Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail" by Obama and Clinton. How people define a fortune is somewhat subjective, and details about how the costs of using the presidential plane are determined are secret. But based on the information available, it's clear that the campaign is only going to be picking up a small fraction of the $200,000-plus hourly costs of using the plane, with taxpayers footing the bill for the rest. Because Trump's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa60cf08-a414-40d2-b91a-70999d4188a2	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-07T11:55:06	2016-07-05	['Barack_Obama', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-09106	"We get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf (of Mexico)."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/21/orrin-hatch/hatch-says-30-percent-our-oil-comes-gulf/	As Americans continue to worry about environmental damage from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is raising another concern -- that the federal government might overreact by putting up excessive obstacles to drilling in the Gulf. "That would be the stupidest thing they can do," Hatch told interviewer Neil Cavuto in a June 16, 2010, appearance on the Fox Business Network. "The best thing we can do is keep BP going so that they can make these payments (to compensate people hurt by the spill). And let me tell you something. To put a moratorium on all of the gulf and all of the drilling down there when we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf? Where are these rigs going to go? They are going to leave our area, where we won't be able to get them back except at exorbitant prices, and they're going to go elsewhere in the world, and at the same time that they are shutting down exploration in the gulf that has worked very, very well up until this incident." What caught our eye was Hatch's comment that "we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf." It's becoming something of a talking point for Republicans who express concern that the Obama administration may curb offshore drilling. For instance, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, cited the same statistic in a June 20, 2010, appearance on NBC's Meet the Press. So we decided to check whether Hatch's statistic is accurate. First, some background. On May 27, 2010, a few weeks after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig caught fire and sank, President Barack Obama ordered a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling -- that is, a six-month halt to new drilling projects in water depths of 500 feet or greater. (Oil production currently under way that doesn't involve new drilling was exempt from the moratorium.) Those who see oil as an economic linchpin of the Gulf Coast region have warned that if the government heightens regulation too much, oil companies will simply relocate to other countries that have lower regulatory standards, leaving Gulf Coast workers and their families in the lurch. Under this logic, it would be a substantial economic wallop if the government were to place at risk an industry that provides 30 percent of the nation's oil needs. But the numbers don't necessarily back up what Hatch says. In the wake of the spill, the Energy Information Administration -- the nonpartisan Energy Department office that publishes the most complete set of statistics on U.S. energy use -- released a Gulf of Mexico fact sheet. Using the fact sheet, we were able to pinpoint what appears to be the source of Hatch's 30 percent figure. It refers to the Gulf of Mexico's "offshore share of U.S. crude oil production." In other words, 30 percent of the crude oil produced in the United States in 2009 came from the Gulf. Now, you could use that statistic to justify Hatch's statement that "we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf." But we don't think that interpretation of his statement is the only one -- or even the best one. If Hatch had wanted to communicate that, he could have said that "30 percent of the oil we produce in the U.S. comes from the Gulf." Instead, we think that an equally fair -- if not more fair -- reading of his statement is that 30 percent of the oil used in the United States comes from the Gulf. And statistically speaking, that leads to quite a different answer, thanks to the major role played -- for better or for worse -- by imported oil in the nation's petroleum supply. The same EIA fact sheet shows that offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for 8 percent of total U.S. liquid fuels consumed. (Slightly over half of the liquid fuels used in the U.S. are imported, and slightly under half are produced domestically.) We'll acknowledge that even at 8 percent, Gulf Coast offshore oil production accounts for a significant share of U.S. consumption. If that spigot were shut off entirely, the economy would surely suffer. But the current moratorium does not involve shutting off the spigot entirely, only delaying new drilling projects for six months to grapple with the consequences of a disaster of historic proportions. More directly relevant for judging Hatch's statement, we think a reasonable person would conclude that the senator was saying that 30 percent of the oil used in the United States comes from the Gulf -- a comment that overstates the actual share by nearly a factor of four. That's not a trivial difference when Hatch is using the statistic to back up his contention that Gulf oil is simply too vital to the economy to overregulate. So we rate Hatch's comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14928	"92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama’s first term belonged to women."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/29/carly-fiorina/fiorina-levies-out-date-charge-women-job-losses-un/	As the only female candidate on the debate stage, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said women voters shouldn’t assume that just because Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is a woman that she has their interests at heart. "It is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman president, when every single policy she espouses and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstratively bad for women," Fiorina said. "Ninety-two percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women." Her 92-percent claim dates back to the 2012 presidential race when it was used by the Republican National Committee and GOP nominee Mitt Romney. At the time, March 2012, the claim had some numerical validity but was also cherry-picked and flawed. We rated it Mostly False. We reached out to the Fiorina campaign and did not hear back, so we’re not sure if she based her statement on the same data as Romney’s campaign used. But here’s what we found back in April 2012: Between January 2009 and March 2012, the total drop in employment was, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 740,000. In the same period, employment for women fell by 683,000. Do the division and you get 92.3 percent. A big problem with the claim in 2012 was that it cherry-picked the starting date for assessing Obama’s jobs track record. The recession began in December 2007, and he didn’t take office until January 2009, when it was nearly over. It’s difficult to blame any president for the economic situation he inherited. The bigger problem with Fiorina making the same statement today is that Obama’s first term continued for another 10 months. During that time, the women job numbers did a U-turn and became a net gain. The government data show an increase of 416,000 working women between January 2009 and January 2013. Total employment also rose by 1.3 million. So more women actually were working at the end of Obama’s first term compared with the day he first took office. We used the January 2009 to January 2013 timeframe to be consistent with the original Republican framing of the critique of Obama’s economic policies. Our ruling Fiorina said 92 percent of the jobs lost during Obama’s first term belonged to women. By January 2013, the jobs numbers don’t back it up at all. The number of women with jobs increased by 416,000 during Obama’s first term. We rate this claim False.	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2015-10-29T11:55:19	2015-10-28	['None']
pomt-02932	"Texas Governor Rick Perry’s voter ID law is a blatant effort to defeat Wendy Davis by disenfranchising tens of thousands of women voters."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/oct/31/democratic-governors-association/no-evidence-behind-claim-2011-voter-id-law-came-be/	An Oct. 24, 2013, email blast from the Democratic Governors Association opened: "BREAKING: Texas Governor Rick Perry’s voter ID law is a blatant effort to defeat Wendy Davis by disenfranchising tens of thousands of women voters." The email, urging donations to Davis’ gubernatorial campaign, went on to say that Perry and "his handpicked successor, Greg Abbott," the Republican Texas attorney general running for governor, "are trying to undo the voting rights women fought for – a century ago! It’s downright anti-democratic." Dramatic--and is this so? From the top, there’s a sizable timeline hiccup in the idea that the Texas voter ID law, approved by the Republican-led Legislature and signed into law by Perry in 2011, came to be in order to disenfranchise women potentially voting for Davis for governor in 2014. Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, announced her gubernatorial candidacy on Oct. 3, 2013 and wasn’t even reported to be considering a statewide bid until after her June 25, 2013 filibuster slowing GOP-led passage of a measure stepping up abortion restrictions. To our request for backup information, an association spokesman, Danny Kanner, emailed us links to a news article and commentary, both published in October 2013, and to a 2006 report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. The articles touched on the possibility that photo IDs presented by women at the polls might not have the same names on them as voter records. None reached conclusions about a link between the 2011 law and Davis garnering votes for governor in 2014. Under the Texas law, which had its implementation delayed to the November 2013 elections by legal challenges, voters going to the polls are expected to present a photo ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or by the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). One voter's experience As noted by Kanner, on Oct. 22, 2013, KIII-TV, Channel 3 in Corpus Christi, reported that the law may cause delays at polling places when a voter’s name on their offered ID doesn’t match their name on the voter roll. The story quoted a state district judge, Sandra Watts, as saying that when she went to vote the day before, what "I have used for voter registration and for identification for the last 52 years was not sufficient." Watts was required to sign an affidavit affirming her identity, the story said, when a poll official noticed that she had one name shown as her middle name on her driver’s license and a different middle name on her voter registration card. One of the middle names was her maiden name. The story further noted that the alternative to signing a voter affidavit would be to vote a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot isn’t counted until seven to 10 days after an election and then only after a voter proves their eligibility. Commentator's speculation On Oct. 24, 2013, Slate legal columnist Dahlia Lithwick wrote a commentary, also noted by Kanner, about the effect of voter ID laws on turnout. She concluded there is insufficient data to reach sweeping conclusions about the effects of voter ID laws on disenfranchising women. Lithwick noted first that some see an effort to deter females aligned with Democratic candidates from casting ballots. To the contrary, Lithwick wrote, some election law experts told her such laws might deter more conservative women who might be more likely to have different names on their voter registrations and photo IDs. Brennan Center survey Kanner also pointed out a 2006 survey conducted by the Brennan Center indicating that only 48 percent of voting-age women with ready access to their birth certificates had a certificate with their current legal name. "Many of those who possess ready documentation of their citizenship do not have documentation that reflects their current name. For example, survey results show that only 48% of voting-age women with ready access to their U.S. birth certificates have a birth certificate with current legal name – and only 66% of voting-age women with ready access to any proof of citizenship have a document with current legal name. Using 2000 census citizen voting-age population data, this means that as many as 32 million voting-age women may have available only proof of citizenship documents that do not reflect their current name." Concern about women being blocked from voting is one thing. We looked for signs the law was written to do so, coming up empty. A press release and a news blog post On the Nexis database, we searched for news articles on the 2011 Texas law and the disenfranchisement of women. Many stories touched on Democratic charges that ID demands at the polls would deter Latino and black voters. Very little turned up focusing on the effects of the mandate on women. On March 24, 2011, blogger Charles Kuffner of Houston quoted a press release issued by Houston state Rep. Jessica Farrar, a Democrat who opposed the proposal. Issued after the House advanced the ID measure, Farrar’s release said: "The list of citizens who could be denied the right to vote because of the new requirement is quite lengthy, and includes: the elderly, women who are recently married or divorced, college students, the poor, those who live in rural areas, Hispanics and African Americans." Earlier, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported on Davis questioning the Senate’s version of the ID measure by recalling her younger years while stressing the possible effect of the law on low-income Texans. "Long before she was a Harvard-educated attorney and a member of the state Senate, Wendy Davis was a divorced single mom who was holding down two jobs and raising a young daughter while attending Tarrant County Community College," the newspaper’s Dave Montgomery said in a Jan. 25, 2011, PoliTex blog post. "Davis recalled those experiences Tuesday as the Republican-controlled state Senate debated a controversial voter ID bill. Like other Democrats, she contended that (Senate Bill) 14 threatens to disenfranchise the indigent, minorities and elderly by requiring voters to show a photo identification in order to vote," the post went. The blog post continued: "‘There was a time when I was indigent,’ the Fort Worth lawmaker told Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, as they debated the merits of the legislation. Had the law been in effect during her earlier days, Davis told Fraser, she ‘would have been quite challenged’ in acquiring the documentation needed to exercise her right to vote." Davis cited her own experiences when was holding down two jobs and said that many low-income Texans do not have the time to leave work and stand in long lines, nor do they have the money to purchase the required ID documents, Montgomery wrote. "For people who have to take off at work it can be a very real problem," Davis said as she stood beside a chart illustrating the cost of supporting documents, the blog post said. "I'm afraid we're going to wind up disenfranchising legal citizens...who are going to be denied the right to vote." More women might lack required ID to vote Separately, we asked activists and attorneys who have questioned the law about evidence bearing on the association’s claim. Wendy Weiser, who directs a Brennan Center project focused on voting rights and who also has been involved in litigation against the law, said by telephone that she is not aware of studies specific to the ID mandate’s effect on women alone, though she said that due to marriages and divorces, women generally change their names more often than men. Weiser suggested we consider research by Matt Barreto, a University of Washington political scientist who has conducted voter surveys to gauge how many have the IDs required to vote in states with such mandates. By email, Barreto told us that a 2009 survey of Texas registered voters indicates that at that time, 89.5 percent of male registered voters had a valid photo ID compared with 84.2 percent of women. The difference, Barreto said, was statistically significant and an indication that about 900,000 registered female voters lacked the ID likely required to vote compared with about 520,000 men. Arianna Campos, a Farrar aide, suggested we contact Sondra Haltom, president of Empower the Vote Texas, a nonprofit group that describes itself as advocating changes that encourage voter participation and opposing restrictions of voter rights. By telephone, Haltom said that by her analysis, a match of state voter rolls with driver license data, as of August 2013, nearly 610,000 registered voters had no sign of a driver’s license or state ID on their voter registration records--with 84 percent of them being women and/or minorities and/or young people. Haltom emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that by her calculation, about 402,000 of the nearly 610,000 voters, 60 percent, were women. But the state of Texas and federal judges have objected to reaching conclusions about how many people carry appropriate IDs based on such absences of matching information, a spokesman for Abbott’s state office, Jerry Strickland, pointed out by email. In August 2012, a judicial panel for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling striking down the Texas ID law, though that ruling was overtaken on June 25, 2013 when the Supreme Court held that Texas and other jurisdictions no longer had to win federal preclearance of changes in voting laws before carrying them out. Regardless, the 2012 ruling said the state had failed to prove the ID law would not lead to retrogression in voting among racial minorities. That ruling also challenged the methodology behind tabulating those registration records lacking driver license numbers. The judges noted, first, that Texans seeking to register to vote are given the option of recording the last four digits of a Social Security number or their eight-digit driver’s license number, meaning "even voters who possess a driver’s license may opt to provide a Social Security number. After all, four digits are easier to write than eight. Furthermore, many voters likely memorize their Social Security number but not their driver’s license number," the judges wrote. "Thus, what voters write on their registration form is barely probative of whether they actually possess a state-issued ID card—much less whether they possess any" of the types of photo IDs permitted under the law. State: No voters turned away to date Finally, a spokeswoman for the Texas Secretary of State’s office, Alicia Pierce, telephoned us after learning of this fact check from the attorney general’s office. Pierce stressed that the Texas law does not require anyone’s name on a valid ID to perfectly match their name on their voter registration. She said, too, that voters whose names are "substantially" similar had cast ballots in the 2013 "early voting" period by swearing that they are who they say they are. Men and women were affected to limited degrees, she said. She said she was not aware of anyone with a substantially similar name on their ID and voter registration being prevented from voting. Our ruling The Democratic governors group said the voter ID measure signed into law by Perry is a "blatant effort to defeat Wendy Davis by disenfranchising tens of thousands of women voters." In addition to its timeline gulf--the ID proposal passed into law two years before Davis emerged as a serious gubernatorial prospect--this claim suffers from an absence of proof that the Texas law was intended to disenfranchise tens of thousands of women or has had such an immediate effect. Significantly, we are not judging here whether the ID hurdle is affecting voter participation. The law is lately being enforced for the first time. Only after the 2013 elections is there likely to be data on its effect on voters--of all kinds. This pre-election claim, weakened by chronological illogic and an overall absence of evidence, shakes out as both incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00214	In Wisconsin, Foxconn has "4,000 jobs, people making $53,000 a year."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/12/kanye-west/kanye-west-jumps-gun-saying-there-are-4000-foxconn/	Not to be outdone by pop singer Taylor Swift, rapper-producer Kanye West weighed in on politics — from the Oval Office, no less — and made a statement about Wisconsin that we want to check. Swift made her first foray into politics with an Instagram post in which she made a claim about a federal domestic violence law and a Republican U.S. Senate candidate from Tennessee, her home state. She earned a Mostly True from PolitiFact National. West, who’s from Chicago, has spoken out before about politics, including going on a rant during one of his concerts in 2016. But as one of the highest-profile celebrity supporters of President Donald Trump, West drew more attention on Oct. 11, 2018, four days after Swift’s post. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. West pontificated during what USA Today called a "meandering 10-minute monologue while making remarks with Trump and Trump’s son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner. He made his claim about Wisconsin during this exchange, according to the White House transcript: West: And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That’s one thing — I’ve never stepped into a situation where I didn’t make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring — Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota. Kushner: Wisconsin. West: Fifty-three thousand — Trump: Wisconsin. Yeah.Wisconsin. West: Yeah. Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs. People making $53,000 a year. So, does Foxconn have 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin with people making $53,000 a year? Not yet. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. The Foxconn deal West’s reference is to a massive deal that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, forged with GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Walker has praised the deal as a mega-job creator. Critics, including Democrat Tony Evers, who faces Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, say Wisconsin is spending too much on the deal. Foxconn plans to invest as much as $10 billion on a high-tech electronics factory in Racine County, in southeast Wisconsin, and to employ up to 13,000 people. In exchange, Wisconsin has agreed to give the company up to $2.85 billion in cash payments and $150 million in tax breaks. The full $2.85 billion would be paid only if the company invests at least $9 billion in its plant and, in rough numbers, employs at least 13,000 people earning at least $30,000 per year. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Kanye’s claim We didn’t hear back from a spokesman for West about the claim. But here’s what we know about what West said: No jobs yet: Foxconn has broken ground on the factory. But no one is producing ultra-high-definition flat screens yet. Thousands expected: Foxconn has said it plans to initially employ 3,000 people — and eventually 13,000 — at the plant. So, West’s figure of 4,000 jobs is in that range. Wages: Foxconn’s contract with the state says the average annual salary will be $53,875, plus benefits. So, West’s claim of $53,000 is on target. Critics of the Foxconn deal have questioned whether the average would reach that level only by Foxconn paying huge salaries to executives, and then paying wages well below the $53,875 to a large portion of employees. Under the state’s contract with Foxconn, wages paid up to $400,000 annually will be counted as part of the average. Our rating West says in Wisconsin, Foxconn has "4,000 jobs, people making $53,000 a year." The Taiwanese company has broken ground on a massive electronics factory that it says will initially employ 3,000 people, and eventually 13,000, at an average wage of nearly $54,000 per year. But both figures are plans, albeit connected to a contract Foxconn has signed with the State of Wisconsin. There aren’t any jobs, and therefore no average wages in that range, yet. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Join us for PolitiFact chat Interested in the U.S. Senate race? How about the battle for governor?

The website tdtalliance.com, whose design crudely mimics Fox News’s website, posted an article Dec. 12 headlined, "War on Christmas: Obama orders ban on Christmas cards to military." The article said Obama issued the executive order out of concern that Christmas cards would offend Muslims in the nations where soldiers are deployed. But tdtalliance.com is not affiliated with Fox News. And the article is 100 percent fiction. First of all, a search of all of Obama’s executive orders shows that he never issued an order banning Christmas cards to the military. In fact, the 2016 White House holiday website prompts visitors to send a USO e-card to members of the military. One of the pre-written message options is, "We are grateful for all you do. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!" The tdtalliance.com article quotes a Hyman Stratcher, litigation director at the Liberty Institute. The Liberty Institute is a real right-wing advocacy group based in Texas, but Stratcher is a made-up person. (The institute’s real head of litigation is named Hiram Sasser.) The article also quotes Imam Al-Suq Akweer of the Islamic Friendship Coalition, and neither the person nor the organization are real. Finally, the article includes an image that has been edited to look like an on-air Fox News report featuring anchor Martha MacCallum, captioned, "Obama orders ban on all Christmas cards to overseas servicemen. Pentagon to censor all outgoing mail that appears to be Christmas themed." While Fox has published numerous stories about the so-called "War on Christmas," they did not run this fabricated story about banning Christmas cards. Side note: In researching this fact-check, we came across a 2013 Fox article that says a Veterans Administration hospital in Dallas refused to accept cards that say "Merry Christmas." However, that article is misleading because it does not explain that a VA chaplain reviews and distributes Christmas cards to veterans who want to receive cards with a religious message. It’s also worth noting that Tdtalliance.com posted the same article in 2015. Our friends at Snopes debunked it back then, too. This article claiming that Obama issued an executive order that bans sending Christmas cards to overseas soldiers is fake news, designed to deceive.

pomt-09191	Mexican government officials "hand out brochures showing individuals how they can avoid our Border Patrol, how they can get into our country."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/may/29/lamar-smith/smith-says-mexico-hands-out-brochures-showing-migr/	U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith told Fox News on May 20 that the United States needs Mexico's help in stopping their citizens from entering the United States illegally but that "we get just the opposite." "They hand out brochures showing individuals how they can avoid our Border Patrol, how they can get into our country," Smith said May 20, referring to the Mexican government. His statement came to our attention from Lainey Melnick of Austin, the Democratic nominee challenging Smith in November. Smith backed off his statement slightly when the Fox News interviewer, Bill Hemmer, asked: "You are saying that the Mexican government is passing out leaflets on how to cross the border?" Smith's reply: "They have done that in the past, on how to, of course how to be safe, and maybe how to get food and water, but also how to avoid detection." Has Mexico really been giving its citizens advice on how to sneak into the United States without running into the Border Patrol? We looked into it. In response to our inquiry, Jamie Zuieback, who works for Smith as an aide to the House Judiciary Committee, pointed us to an opinion piece that aired on National Public Radio on Jan. 27, 2005. In it, commentator Gustavo Arellano reacts to a pamphlet produced by the Mexican foreign ministry called "Guia del Migrante Mexicano," or "Guide for the Mexican Migrant." Earlier that month, The New York Times reported that about 1.5 million copies of the guide had been distributed across Mexico in December 2004. In his commentary, Arellano said the 32-page booklet "advises Mexicans who are thinking of leaving their homeland on the best ways to do it." Arrellano noted that the publication riled some American lawmakers, who described it as a manual on how to enter the country illegally -- a position aired at the time by then-U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., in an opinion article published in the Jan. 9, 2005, Austin American-Statesman. (Hayworth is challenging U.S. Sen. John McCain in Arizona's 2010 Republican primary.) Several weeks later, Francisco Alejo, who was then the Austin-based Mexican consul general, responded to Hayworth with an opinion piece in the Statesman. He wrote: "In no way does the guide promote undocumented immigration into the United States. As it is clearly stated in the guide’s introduction and on the back cover, the safe and appropriate way to enter any country -- including the United States -- is with a valid passport and visa." Alejo said the guide was produced to advise "people of the risks involved in, as well as the legal consequences of, crossing into the United States." His article also said the Mexican government had produced similar guides in the past. Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies international migration, said his reading was that the purpose of the brochure was humanitarian, to prevent migrants from being stranded in the desert or dying. In the January 2005 Times article, Geronimo Gutierrez, then Mexico’s undersecretary for North American affairs, said that the year before, "over 300 Mexicans died in their attempt to enter the United States, the vast majority if not all of them in search of a job. ... The Mexican government obviously has an obligation to take all actions possible in order to avoid the loss of life.’’ Let's recap. Smith first said that the Mexican government is currently handing out leaflets telling people how to avoid the U.S. Border Patrol and "get into the country." He amended that to say that Mexico has handed out such leaflets in the past and that they included information on how to "be safe." And the Mexican government acknowledged a few years ago that it was distributing information about safely crossing the border. That leaves two significant questions. Are the leaflets still being distributed? And do they -- or did they ever -- advise border-crossers how to get into the country while avoiding detection? Seeking answers, we tried to find a current copy of the handout, which is no longer available on the Mexican government's website. However, we resurrected the pamphlet using an Internet archiving tool. We then matched the Spanish text of the document with an English translation of excerpts published in the Times in 2005, supplemented with translation by Spanish-speaking colleagues at the American-Statesman. The introduction to the brochure we found -- it's undated -- says it was designed to dispense "practical advice" and notes that the safe way to enter another country is to do so legally, by acquiring a passport in Mexico and a visa from the destination country. It is illustrated with comics-like drawings. It warns migrants of the perils of crossing over. For instance, they are told that crossing the river -- unnamed in the brochure, but presumably the Rio Grande -- can be perilous and that wet, heavy clothing makes floating or swimming difficult. For desert crossers, this section advises migrants "to walk during hours when the heat is not too intense." It also describes the dangers of getting involved with human smugglers and advises migrants not to use false documents or carry packages for someone else. If detained, they are told not to resist arrest or try to escape, and that they have certain rights while in custody. And there are tips for migrants to keep a low profile once they are settled in the U.S.: Avoid noisy parties, fighting, domestic violence, carrying weapons, illegal activities, driving while drinking or driving without a license or insurance. There is no information on where to cross the border or how to avoid the Border Patrol or U.S. authorities when doing so. When we noted the lack of such specific advice, Zuieback, Smith's committee aide, pointed out illustrations that she said show "illegal immigrants watching the border for an opening to enter and, later, running from the Border Patrol." She also said the advice to cross the desert when the heat is less severe is "a clear message to cross at night." Zuieback also interpreted the tips on keeping a low profile as information on "how to avoid detection by law enforcement while in the United States." As for showing migrants how to "get into our country" -- per Smith's statement to Fox News -- the closest such reference we spotted was a sentence urging people to "use power lines, train tracks or dirt roads as guides" if they get lost. Next, we tried to find out whether the migrant guide was still being distributed. Zuieback said Smith was not aware of "additional publications" since the guide prompted a flurry of news articles in 2005. However, we came across 2005 reports of similar publications by at least one Mexican state, Yucatan. Using Google Scholar, we found an academic article on the "Guide for the Mexican Migrant" published in 2009 by Bruno Lutz, a professor at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Xochimilco, on the outskirts of Mexico City. Lutz wrote that the brochure was published and distributed from 2004 to 2006; that was confirmed by Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington. When President Felipe Calderon came to power in 2006, the paper says, the guide was substituted on the government's website with a guide for the "Mexican traveler," which Lutz describes as "limited to giving very general indications about required visas and tourist attractions in each country." We then read the "Guia del Viajero Mexicano" on the website of Mexico's foreign ministry and found information on travel alerts, consular services and visa requirements, but nothing on illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. So where does that leave us? Smith was right when he told Fox News that the Mexican government handed out brochures offering advice to people planning to immigrate to the United States without authorization. And there is an element of truth in Smith’s statement that the information in the pamphlet shows people, as Smith says, "how they can get into our country," but the part of the publication that deals with crossing the border focuses on safety. Significantly, Smith incorrectly declared, initially, that Mexico currently gives out the guide. We found no evidence to support that statement. Also, the congressman's description of the "Guia del Migrante Mexicano" -- that it tells how to avoid the Border Patrol -- was misleading. While two illustrations appear to show migrants in flight from law officers, the text does not contain information on how to avoid law enforcement while crossing over. In fact, it advises cooperation if apprehended. We rate Smith's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Lamar Smith	None	None	None	2010-05-29T22:32:51	2010-05-20	['Mexico', 'United_States_Border_Patrol']
pomt-12916	The inauguration of Donald Trump "will be the first one that I miss since I've been in Congress."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/17/john-lewis/john-lewis-wrong-whether-he-skipped-inauguration-d/	The back-and-forth between President-elect Donald Trump and civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., dominated news coverage over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. It began on Jan. 14 with an excerpt from an interview that Lewis did for NBC’s Meet the Press, in which he said that while he believes in forgiveness, "it's going to be very difficult" to forge a relationship with Trump. "I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president." Trump quickly took to Twitter to criticize Lewis. In a pair of tweets, Trump said, "Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to.....mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!" Trump’s comments drew criticism for ignoring Lewis’s sacrifices in the 1960s civil rights movement and for mischaracterizing Lewis’ district. PolitiFact rated Trump’s assertions about the district Mostly False. Lewis, for his part, also drew criticism (including from Democrats) for his characterization of Trump as someone who isn’t "a legitimate president." Lewis’ stance is not universal among Democrats. While the 40-plus Democrats who are skipping the inauguration is an unusually large number, they amount to a minority of the Democratic caucus in the House. In his Meet the Press interview, Lewis underlined the importance of his concerns about Trump by saying, "It will be the first (inauguration) that I miss since I've been in Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right." Some readers asked us whether this was true. It turns out that it is not. Lewis didn’t attend President George W. Bush’s inauguration in 2001. Bush prevailed after a weeks-long, controversy-laden recount that ended with a 5-4 Supreme Court decision. A contemporary Washington Post article included this paragraph: "Some members of the Black Caucus decided to boycott Inauguration Day; John Lewis, for instance, spent the day in his Atlanta district. He thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in because he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president." Lewis’ office confirmed the accuracy of the Post’s 2001 account. "Rep. Lewis also missed one other inauguration, the first inauguration of President George W. Bush," said the statement from Lewis’ communications director, Brenda Jones. "His absence at that time was also a form of dissent. He did not believe the outcome of that election, including the controversies around the results in Florida and the unprecedented intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court, reflected a free, fair and open democratic process." Indeed, on Jan. 17 -- three days after Lewis’ original comment and three days before his inauguration -- Trump jumped on the discrepancy in another pair of tweets. "John Lewis said about my inauguration, ‘It will be the first one that I've missed.’ WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he… thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president. Sound familiar! WP" (The "WP" apparently refers to the Post story.) So Trump’s tweet is accurate, and Lewis’ original statement on Meet the Press was not. Our ruling Lewis said that Trump’s inauguration "will be the first one that I miss since I've been in Congress." That’s incorrect: Lewis also boycotted the first inauguration of George W. Bush, a decision confirmed both by contemporary news reports and Lewis’ own office. He made this comment to demonstrate the intensity of his opposition to Trump, but it's a fact that he also boycotted Bush's inauguration. We rate Lewis’ statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12593	"There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders."	true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/06/randolph-bracy/has-us-supreme-court-banned-all-state-laws-make-ex/	Florida Sen. Randolph Bracy argues that Gov. Rick Scott overreached when he issued an order removing Orlando-area prosecutor Aramis D. Ayala from a high-profile prosecution of an accused cop killer after she said she would not pursue the death penalty in murder cases. Bracy, an Orange County Democrat and chairman of the Florida Senate criminal justice committee, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that prosecutors have broad discretionary power. "Although Ms. Ayala’s critics have denounced her actions as dereliction of duty, they cannot point to a single law or statute that she has violated," he wrote in the April 4 op-ed. "That’s because she hasn’t. There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders." Legal experts told PolitiFact that Bracy is correct. Key court rulings about the death penalty forbid laws that force prosecutors to seek the death penalty. Ayala, a Democrat elected as state attorney state attorney in Orange and Osceola counties in 2016, announced in March that she would no longer seek the death penalty. Her decision came while handling the case of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of killing Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton amid a manhunt for Loyd after he allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend. Laws about death penalty prosecutions In 1972 in Furman vs. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty, finding lack of standards in enforcing the death penalty constituted "cruel and unusual punishment." In response, many states then changed their laws. In 1976, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of new death sentencing laws in five cases from Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana. It was in these cases that the court struck down statutes that mandated death sentences while allowing the statutes to stand that required juries or judges to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Still, some states in the intervening years tried to pass laws that mandated the death penalty. In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court found all such laws unconstitutional, the "last vestiges of the mandatory death penalty in the United States," the New York Times explained. In addition to pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Bracy’s legislative assistant Travaris McCurdy also pointed to Florida cases including an argument by Attorney General Pam Bondi in a death penalty appeal case, State vs. Perry. Bondi argued in a 2016 petition to the court that "The Florida Supreme Court has recognized that the State has complete discretion in charging decisions, including the determination to charge and prosecute a capital case." (Bondi has called Ayala’s actions a "blatant neglect of duty and a shameful failure to follow the law.") Due to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions, we have a discretionary system in which prosecutors and juries are supposed to evaluate the use of the death penalty case by case, said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which supports the death penalty. And Ayala isn’t doing that, he said. "For a prosecutor to make a blanket decision to prosecute all cases as capital or none of them is not exercising discretion that is supposed to be part of system," he said. "Prosecutors are supposed to look at each case and decide if it is one of the exceptionally heinous cases that deserve the death penalty." Spokespersons for Scott and Bondi made some similar points about how prosecutors should evaluate the death penalty case by case. "Gov. Scott has not said that prosecutors must seek death sentences," Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said. "State Attorney Aramis Ayala was removed from the cases in the interest of justice following her public announcement to not consider capital punishment during her time in office, regardless of the individual facts and circumstances in any case." On April 3, Scott removed Ayala, a Democrat, from 21 additional first-degree murder cases and reassigned them to Brad King, a Republican Ocala-based state attorney. Our ruling Bracy wrote, "There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders." Ayala, the Orlando-area prosecutor, has been criticized by some people for refusing to pursue the death penalty in any case. But the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear for decades that it is unconstitutional to require prosecutors to seek the death penalty in any case. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07174	Non-defense discretionary spending has increased "by over 80 percent in the last two years."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/10/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-some-federal-spending-over-80-per/	U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt recently refashioned a threadbare GOP claim on the growth of federal spending under President Barack Obama. Hurt, R-5th, wrote in a June 3 newsletter that non-defense discretionary spending has increased "by over 80 percent in the last two years." Does the the Southside Virginia congressman have his facts right? We thought we’d check. First, a few definitions. Discretionary spending is the money Congress controls through annual appropriations. It goes for services such as defense, education, health and housing. In contrast, mandatory spending is used for entitlement programs with required levels of spending -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. About 60 percent of discretionary spending goes towards the U.S. defense budget. As the phrase suggests, "non-defense discretionary spending" removes military money from the pot. So Hurt is addressing a left over portion of the U.S. budget that accounts for about one-sixth of annual spending. Amanda Henneberg, Hurt’s press secretary, said her boss’s statement was based on a Feb. 3 news release by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., the chairman of the House Budget Committee. PolitiFact is no stranger to Ryan’s release. An assortment of Republicans -- including speaker Speaker Boehner of Ohio and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia -- have used Ryan’s numbers to exaggerate spending increases since Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009. Ryan’s numbers show non-defense discretionary spending rose from $434 billion in fiscal 2008 to $537 billion in fiscal 2010. That’s a 23.7 percent jump. Then Ryan added $259 billion in stimulus money to the fiscal 2010 ledger, since that’s the amount of the roughly $862 billion stimulus outlay deemed discretionary by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. If you compare the new 2010 total -- $796 billion -- to the original $434 billion, you get an 83.4 percent increase. It creates a convenient Republican chart that shows non-defense discretionary spending soaring up like a rocket from 2008 through 2010. If Ryan put the stimulus money in 2009, when it was approved, his chart would look like a roller coaster -- spending would have climbed steeply in 2009 and dropped in 2010. Hurt’s newsletter did not mention that he was counting the stimulus money. And there’s a major problem with the congressman’s math. The CBO counts all of the stimulus funds in the 2009 budget, since that’s the year the bill passed Congress. Hurt and other Republicans have chosen to move the stimulus money to its 2010 budget count. The money actually is being spent over several years. The bulk of the spending came in 2009 and 2010, with increasingly smaller amounts being spent this year and in the next several years. The CBO says it cannot provide a breakdown of how much money is being spent each year. To get another look at how much the government has spent in each of the past several years, we turned to budget tables from the Office of Management and Budget. The OMB is the White House’s budget office. It tracks exactly how much was spent by each agency during the past several years, regardless of the source of the funding. According to OMB tables, non-defense discretionary spending was $522.4 billion in fiscal 2008 and climbed to $658.2 billion in fiscal 2010. That is a 26 percent increase, roughly in line with the increase cited by Ryan. But that spike includes money from the stimulus, said Meg Reilly, an OMB spokeswoman. It counts all non-defense discretionary money spent by the government during the given year. Paul Krugman, a liberal economist who teaches at Princeton University and is a columnist for The New York Times, noted in a recent blog that the OMB projects non-defense discretionary spending to fall off rapidly in 2012 and 2013, as stimulus funds are exhausted. By 2013, the OMB estimates it will be back at 2009 levels, though that is still about 10 percent higher than 2008 spending, the last full budget year under former Republican President George W. Bush. "So this GOP talking point is a complete fraud; it’s based on counting the same spending several times over," Krugman wrote. Let’s review Hurt’s claim. The Virginia Congressman said non-defense discretionary spending has climbed "by over 80 percent in the last two years." Unlike other Republicans who have made similar claims, he did not say that much of the increase came from the 2009 stimulus bill. Republicans reach this number by putting all of the one-time discretionary stimulus money in the 2010 budget instead of 2009, when the stimulus was approved. Moreover, data from the White House budget office provide strong evidence that the GOP has double-counted the stimulus. The White House budget office shows non-defense discretionary spending rose 26 percent from 2008 to 2010. The CBO, which Hurt and other Republicans cite as their source, puts the increase at 23.7 percent. That’s a long way from the "over 80 percent" increase claimed by Hurt. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00502	Says Jeb Bush "appointed a guardian for the fetus of a rape survivor."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/jun/25/ultraviolet/jeb-bush-did-not-appoint-guardian-rape-victims-fet/	A political group has highlighted a controversial fight over fetal rights that former Gov. Jeb Bush mounted years ago, but it went too far in its description of what the current presidential candidate did. Ultraviolet, a women’s rights group, posted an image on Facebook on June 15, 2015, with the title "5 things you should know about Jeb Bush." The first item read, "Appointed a guardian for the fetus of a rape survivor." We checked into all five of the claims listed on the image and found this one was not accurate. (Read our story on the rest here.) In May 2003, a severely mentally handicapped woman identified only as J.D.S. had been raped in a group home at 22 and was six months pregnant. J.D.S., who was abandoned at birth and raised in foster care, suffered from severe mental retardation, cerebral palsy and autism, with the mental capacity of a 4- or 5-year-old. But Bush actually didn’t appoint a guardian, because he didn’t have that power. What he did was order state lawyers to ask the Orange County Circuit Court in Orlando to appoint a representative for the fetus. Though Bush opposes abortion, he said the court case was not about that. "This is a question of protecting an innocent life," Bush told the Miami Herald. "And it will be the policy of our government in the case of a woman who is incapacitated or cannot make decisions for her child, that there should be a guardian." The Florida Department of Children and Families had already asked the court to appoint a guardian once the baby was born. No parties involved had suggested aborting the fetus. But Judge Lawrence Kirkwood did not consider the guardian request, saying he had to follow state statute. Appointing a guardian for the fetus would be "a clear error," he wrote. "A trial judge must follow the law as written," Kirkwood said. "Many had expected this court to blaze new territory and write new law for the facts beyond the Florida statute." The issue moved forward, even after a healthy girl known as Baby S was born in August 2003. Kirkwood appointed her a guardian at birth. In January 2004, a three-judge panel in a Daytona appeals court ruled against Bush in a 2-1 decision. Kirkwood had adhered to a 1989 state Supreme Court ruling that said appointing a representative for an unborn fetus would be "clearly improper." A fetus was not a person under state law, and was therefore without the same rights as a person. Judge Emerson Thompson noted in the majority opinion that fetal rights were not mentioned anywhere in state statutes about guardianship. Bush continued to hold his position after the appeal ruling in Daytona. "I do think that a child that could be brought to term, as this child was, in the case where a mother has little or no capabilities in representing the child's interest, a legal guardian should be appointed," he said. Our ruling Ultraviolet said Bush "appointed a guardian for the fetus of a rape survivor." Bush asked a judge in 2003 to name someone to act in the interests of the fetus of a mentally disabled woman raped in a group home. But the judge did not, because state law does not give a fetus the same protections as a person. An appeals court upheld the judge’s compliance with a 1989 Florida Supreme Court ruling. To be clear, Bush did not appoint anyone as a representative for the fetus, but he did want one. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-03199	"Congressman Patrick Murphy voted to keep the scandal-ridden IRS in charge of enforcing Obamacare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-patrick-murphy-voted-keep-scandal-ridden/	In a YouTube video published Aug. 22, the National Republican Congressional Committee took a swipe at U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, for his vote against an attempt to derail the Affordable Care Act. The video’s message: "The most dreaded return address in America. The IRS. And just days ago, Congressman Patrick Murphy voted to keep the scandal-ridden IRS in charge of enforcing Obamacare. Just what you need. To owe more to the IRS. Under Obamacare, your insurance premiums could double and your personal data could be at risk. Call Patrick Murphy. Ask him to get the IRS out of your health care." The NRCC published the same YouTube video about U.S. Reps. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H., and William Enyart, D-Ill. In this item we’re focusing on whether the IRS is "in charge" of enforcing Obamacare. The video leaves the impression that the agency is the chief enforcer over the whole shebang. It is true that Murphy, who represents parts of Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties, joined most Democrats Aug. 2 in opposing the "Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act of 2013." The congressman’s legislative director, Chris Fisher, said this act "would prevent the Department of Treasury (and anything under it, including IRS) from enforcing any portion of Obamacare. It's basically a repeal vote for every part of the law that falls under Treasury jurisdiction." Murphy voted no, Fisher said, because the measure would raise taxes on small businesses and working families. "The $5,000 small business tax credit and tax credits to help you buy insurance if you are up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line fall under the Treasury," Fisher noted. "These would go away if the anti-IRS bill became law tomorrow." Murphy was among 185 Democrats who voted against the measure, which passed the House Aug. 2, with the approval of 228 Republicans and four Democrats. It’s the 40th attempt to dismantle the law, which all have failed because Democrats control the Senate and the White House. The video by the NRCC political committee is the latest sweeping comment about the IRS’ role in implementing the new health law -- especially in recent months, since the agency came under fire for giving particular scrutiny to some conservative groups seeking tax exemptions. As to the specific claim, NRCC spokesman Katie Prill said, "It has been noted by several news organizations that the IRS will play a ‘dominant role’ in enforcing Obamacare" and referred to a May article from the McClatchy Washington Bureau. It called the IRS an "important cog" and said the tax agency "must act on 47 provisions of the new law, more than half of those already in effect, including the more controversial ones taking effect in 2014 such as the requirement that nearly all non-elderly adults have health care coverage." But health care policy experts say that implying that the IRS is in charge of enforcing the new health law is misleading. The IRS is certainly involved in implementing the Affordable Care Act, including subsidies and penalties, "but hardly the whole ACA," said Eric Toder, co-director of the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. In a previous fact-check, we noted that the IRS has posted a list of its many roles dealing with the health care law, everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) But states and other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Labor and other agencies "play just as important a role," in implementing the new health care law, says Katie Keith, a consultant and former researcher with Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. Greg Mellowe, policy director for the healthcare consumer advocacy group, Florida CHAIN, said that responsibility for implementing and enforcing the provisions of the Affordable Care Act is divided by function. The Department of Health and Human Services, not the IRS, is considered the lead agency in this regard, he said. The Department of Labor notes its involvement with regulations that affect employment-based, private-sector, group-health plans. The IRS (Department of the Treasury) has authority with respect to regulations that pertain to income and taxation. "The IRS is the only entity that can appropriately implement and enforce these tax-related provisions," Mellowe said. Moreover, states also have a major role to play -- mainly by running health insurance exchanges. Florida, which opted against creating a state-based exchange, passed legislation, SB 1842, that maintained the state Office of Insurance Regulation’s current authority to review health insurance policy forms for compliance with state and federal laws as part of a collaborative effort with the HHS. For issues of noncompliance with federal law, the OIR would attempt to obtain voluntary compliance and, if they're unable to do that, HHS would provide the enforcement. Our ruling The NRCC video stated that the IRS would be in charge of enforcing Obamacare. While the IRS will play a major role in enforcing elements of the Affordable Care Act, stating that the agency is "in charge" of enforcing the new health law is misleading and leaves out the vital roles of the states, the health department, the department of labor and other agencies in enforcing and implementing various aspects of the law.

pomt-05858	"Here's something that people never talk about with coach Schiano: Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/12/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-under-coach-greg-schiano-rut/	Greg Schiano has his detractors in New Jersey, but Gov. Chris Christie isn’t one of them. The governor defended the football coach, who recently left Rutgers University to become head coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in a Jan. 31 radio interview. Despite criticism about Schiano’s 11-year tenure with the Scarlet Knights, Christie said the coach transformed the program from a "laughingstock" into a fierce competitor -- and in more than just athletics. "Here's something that people never talk about with coach Schiano: Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America. Now, when all you see is scandal all over college football, in 11 years you never saw it touch Rutgers. Not once," Christie said on New Jersey 101.5’s "Ask the Governor" program. "And he graduated his kids from college, so those kids if they went on to the NFL like some of the folks who have gone on to the NFL and done really well, great. But the majority of them don't and for the majority who don't, he got them out of Rutgers with a Rutgers degree and I tell you, I bet you the parents of those kids love Greg Schiano because those kids now have a future because they have a college degree from a great university like Rutgers." There’s a reason people don’t talk about Rutgers’ football team earning the top graduation rate in its division: it never did. There are 120 teams playing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Football Bowl Subdivision, formerly known as Division I-A. Rutgers’ Scarlet Knights play in the division’s Big East Conference with seven other teams. The most recent data available on graduation success rates, which are calculated by the NCAA, ranks Rutgers at the top of its conference, but not the top of its division. Among Football Bowl Subdivision teams, Notre Dame, Northwestern University, Rice University, Boston College, Duke University and the U.S. Naval Academy had higher graduation success rates than Rutgers. Rutgers never topped its division in graduation rates under Schiano, but it’s worth noting that in five years, the team’s NCAA graduation rate climbed from 55 percent to 89 percent. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokesman for the Rutgers football program said: "I would think he was referring to our APR, which he has commented on before." The APR, or academic progress rate, is another measure of academic performance based on whether a student-athlete remains academically eligible and remains with the school. Emily Potter, a NCAA spokeswoman, said in an email that the academic progress rate is "intended to be predictive of eventual graduation rates. Both should be important measures of academic success, and the higher that one of these measures is, the more likely it is that the other will also be high." But, "having said that, it is true that graduation is not included in the actual measurement of APR." Rutgers grabbed the top spot in its division by that measure two years ago. Last year, Rutgers fell to the second spot in the academic progress rate rankings, behind Northwestern University in Illinois. David Ridpath, an assistant professor of sports administration at Ohio University, said in an email that "Governor Christie is incorrect, but probably not intentional on his part—still he should be more careful with his absolute statements." Our ruling Christie claimed that "Rutgers had the best graduation rate of any Division I football program in America." The Scarlet Knights ranked at the top of their conference, but not the top of their division for graduation rates in the most recent data. During Schiano’s tenure, the team never had the best graduation rate in the division. By another measure of academic performance, Rutgers football topped its division, but, according to a NCAA spokeswoman, graduation is not included in that calculation. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10536	Obama "basically threatened to bomb Pakistan."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/hillary-clinton/et-tu-clinton/	At the Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb. 26, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton stole a line from Sen. John McCain and President Bush. Clinton said that last summer, Sen. Barack Obama "basically threatened to bomb Pakistan, which I don't think was a particularly wise position to take." Clinton's line echoes recent comments by McCain, who told reporters Feb. 20 that Obama "suggested bombing Pakistan," and Bush, who said in a Feb. 17 TV interview that he didn't know much about Obama's foreign policy except that "he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad." Clinton is seriously distorting Obama's remarks, just as Bush and McCain did. As we said with our check of McCain's statement last week, it is an extreme charge because Pakistan has been a key ally to the United States. Clinton, Bush and McCain are referring to a speech that Obama gave in August 2007 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He spoke about the problem of terrorists at large within Pakistan. He said he would continue to provide military aid to Pakistan as long as the authorities there work to close terrorist training camps and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan. Then Obama added: "I understand that (Pakistan) President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will." The transcript of his speech makes it clear that Obama is talking about targeting terrorists within the country regardless of whether he has the permission of the Pakistani government. We recognize that Clinton et al. are making a larger point questioning the wisdom of Obama telegraphing future military plans and we are not addressing whether that is a good idea. But it is a significant distortion to say Obama wants to "attack Pakistan," as President Bush did, and an even more serious one that he supports "bombing Pakistan" as McCain and Clinton did. (Indeed, all Obama said was that he would "act.") The charge from Clinton and her odd allies is especially unusual in light of a Feb. 19 article in the Washington Post that revealed missiles from a CIA-operated Predator aircraft recently killed a key al-Qaida commander in the Pakistani town of Mir Ali. The U.S. government did not have permission from the Pakistani government for the attack, the article said. So the United States is already doing what Obama is advocating. We might give Clinton points for qualifying her remarks with "basically." But even with that qualifier, she is twisting Obama's comments to imply he wants to attack a U.S. ally. It's not enough to call that False. We called it Pants-on-Fire wrong when McCain said it and we're doing the same for Clinton.

pomt-15339	"We're destroying more businesses in the United States now than are being created for the first time in our history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/12/carly-fiorina/fiorina-us-destroying-more-businesses-it-creates-f/	America’s economy can’t get a proper foothold to start growing quickly again, in part because the country is losing businesses faster than it creates them, Republican presidential contender Carly Fiorina said. Talking to George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week on July 12, 2015, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO said her GOP rival Jeb Bush’s talk of 4 percent economic growth is a good goal. But Fiorina said a dearth of new small businesses is preventing more than anemic growth at the moment. "In fact, we're destroying more businesses in the United States now than are being created for the first time in our history," she said. PolitiFact has looked at this claim before, and when we asked Fiorina’s campaign where they found their statistic, they pointed to the same source -- the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics data. Fiorina is accurate to say that more business firms are closing than are opening, but the data can’t say for sure whether this is the first time that’s happened in the 239-year history of the United States. A Fiorina spokeswoman sent us a September 2014 article from Gallup that examined the data, which showed that the startup rate for new businesses first dipped below the closure rate in 2008. The trend has remained through 2011, the latest year of available data. Here’s a chart illustrating Fiorina’s point, from a May 2014 Brookings Institution study of the same data: As you might notice, the chart only goes back to 1978. Why? Because the Business Dynamics Statistics database only goes back to the 1970s. Before then, there was no official metric recorded -- by the federal government or anyone else -- for business startups and deaths. Economists say that really limits the ability to judge claims like Fiorina's, who talked about the entire history of the country. Business failures may have exceeded startups at other points, such as during the Great Depression, but it’s impossible to say without reliable data. Claims like Fiorina’s are "somewhere between plausible and impossible to prove," Robert Litman, a Brookings economics fellow who has studied the number of business openings and closings, told PolitiFact. He suggested it would be "more accurate to say that for the first time since the government began tracking these things, fails have exceeded starts." The reasons for this trend are harder to determine. "Despite all this research, there has been no definitive answer as to why the rate of U.S. startups has declined so precipitously," the Gallup story concedes. Fiorina told Stephanopoulos the problem was "crony capitalism" and a "very large, powerful, complicated government" that made it difficult for smaller businesses to survive while bigger, established business have thrived. Litman, in his research, noted that "it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones." As HP’s CEO, Fiorina oversaw a controversial $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2001. The move resulted in 30,000 layoffs as the two companies merged operations. HP’s board of directors fired Fiorina in 2005 for poor stock performance and missed earnings targets. Our ruling Fiorina said, "In fact, we're destroying more businesses in the United States now than are being created for the first time in our history." The data she’s relying on, however, only looks back to 1978, and economists say it’s going a bit too far to say this is the first time such a trend has occurred in all of U.S. history. The fact is we simply don’t have definitive data to prove it either way. Fiorina’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-05628	"We’ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law (‘stand your ground’) has been in effect."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/23/dennis-baxley/crime-rates-florida-have-dropped-stand-your-ground/	An author of Florida’s "stand your ground" legislation has been defending the law on national television, warning that it may not have anything to do with the recent death of Trayvon Martin. Martin was an African-American 17-year-old who was watching a basketball game at a friend’s apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. During a break, he walked to a nearby store for candy and iced tea. While he was out, a resident, George Zimmerman, reported him to 911 as acting suspicious. The operator told Zimmerman not to pursue Martin, but Zimmerman shot Martin a short while later. Police didn’t arrest Zimmerman, and that angered Martin’s family and others. It also got people talking about Florida’s "stand your ground" law. The law allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk. Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, told MSNBC’s Tamron Hall on March 21, 2012, that the law protects people who are attacked, but it does not protect aggressors. "There’s nothing in this statute to protect people who are pursuing and confronting other people," he said. Hall asked Baxley about crime statistics that show justifiable homicides are up in Florida, but Baxley said that’s only one statistic. "What we’ve learned is if we empower people to stop bad things from happening, they will," Baxley said. "And in fact, that statistic is coupled with another statistic. That is the fact that we’ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law has been in effect." In an interview with PBS Newshour the next day, Baxley added that he thought the law "has saved thousands of people's lives." Here, we’re checking whether there’s been a dramatic drop in violent crime since the law went into effect. To do that, we turned to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s crime statistics and various news reports about violent crime in Florida. We found that violent crime has dropped significantly in Florida since 2005. (The law went into effect Oct. 1, 2005.) We calculated the drop in violent crime rates, to account for population growth. In 2006 and 2007, violent crime rates were up just slightly up compared with 2005. In 2008, the violent crime rate began declining. By 2010, the violent crime rate had dropped 23 percent since 2005. (See chart below.) But that’s not the whole story. We also looked at crime rates for the five years before the "stand your ground" law started, and we found violent crime was declining during those years as well. Between 2000 and 2005, violent crime dropped 12 percent. When we turned to news reports, we found many stories documenting drops in crime nationwide over the past decade. Experts have been surprised that the numbers have continued dropping through a historic recession. Why are rates declining? Nobody can say for sure. The theories are highly diverse, to say the least, and some are fairly controversial. Here are just a few we ran across: Police are getting better at using technology to prevent crime. More people are in jail and therefore can’t commit crimes. Online banking and debit cards mean people don’t have cash at home. Abortions have suppressed the number of poor, unsupervised young men. Low inflation makes stealing less attractive. President Barack Obama is setting a positive example for African-American youth. New gun laws establishing the right to carry are deterring criminals. Joblessness means people are at home watching the neighborhood. Extended unemployment benefits and food stamps mean people don’t have to turn to crime. Baxley told PolitiFact Florida he didn’t think the "stand your ground" law was the main reason for Florida’s drop in crime rates. But it could be one of several reasons, he said. "I don’t want to claim all the effect," Baxley said. "But in public policy, if you make changes, and things go in a positive direction, you’re grateful. So I don’t want to say we caused all of it, but I do think that it helped." Others, though, have said the "stand your ground" law could potentially drive up the crime rate. In 2007, the National District Attorneys Association convened a symposium on the "stand your ground" law and other expansions to the right to use of deadly force in self-defense. A symposium report listed a number of concerns: Criminals might be emboldened as they learn to use "stand your ground" as a legal defense. More deaths could result as more people carry weapons for self-defense. People might feel less safe if they believe anyone could use deadly force in an unsettling situation. More pointedly for the Trayvon Martin case, the report noted that a misinterpretation of physical clues could result in the use of deadly force, "exacerbating culture, class, and race differences" and that there could be "a disproportionately negative effect on minorities, persons from lower socioeconomic status, and young adults/juveniles." Our ruling Baxley said "We’ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law has been in effect." His comments in television interviews implied the law itself reduced violent crime rates. There has been a drop, but rates were declining before the law went into effect. We found no proof that that the "stand your ground" law caused the drop in crime rates; some groups worry the law could lead to more violence. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-11988	"The current city mayor (Kasim Reed) has been virtually absent in terms of regional cooperation the last eight years."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/sep/28/john-eaves/was-reed-virtually-absent-regional-issues-no/	At a recent candidate forum in Atlanta’s mayoral race, John Eaves touted his credentials as a force for broad economic development. The former Fulton County chairman said he understands what the job requires. "I’ve been there, done that," Eaves said. "The current city mayor has been virtually absent in terms of regional cooperation the last eight years. As mayor of Atlanta, I’ll continue to work with regional partners." Term limits have the current mayor Kasim Reed stepping down after two terms. During his time in office, Atlanta proper has attracted new jobs. But did Reed aim to advance the city’s future without regard for the surrounding cities and counties? A 2013 blog post faulted Reed for failing to attend many meetings of the Atlanta Regional Commission. Between 2010 and August 2013, he missed 24 meetings out of 36 total. Only one other member of the commission board had a worse attendance record. That is one yardstick, but there are others to measure Reed’s presence in regional issues. One of Reed’s top priorities has been the deepening of the Port of Savannah, about 250 miles from the city. In 2015, the Georgia Port Authority said the port supported about 370,000 jobs across the state. Reed is credited for working with Republican lawmakers and the state’s Republican governor to push the project forward. The Trump administration has included $50 million for the nearly $1 billion effort, far short of what state and local officials sought, but a modest victory in a budget cutting environment. Reed has also promoted expansion of Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport, an anchor for economic development in the region. Reed struck an agreement with Delta Airlines to keep the company in Atlanta for the next two decades. In the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Atlanta region led among the nation’s 12 largest metropolitan areas in the rate of job growth, and ranked third overall for the number of jobs added in the past year. Companies that have moved to the region include Mercedes-Benz and State Farm, both of which located just outside the city of Atlanta. Symbolic of regional cooperation, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Mercedes-Benz headquarters building featured Gov. Nathan Deal, Reed and Sandy Springs Mayor Rusty Paul. Reed touts his push for half-a-cent increase in the Atlanta sales tax to finance a $2.6 billion expansion of the regional subway system, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. While the work would take place inside the city, the MARTA system extends out to the surrounding cities. His work on regional transportation links to Eaves’ criticism of Reed. Eaves led a group of Fulton County mayors to craft a joint transportation investment plan. According to one news report, Reed chafed at having a vote that was equal to that of mayors from much smaller communities. Through a spokeswoman, Eaves said, "Over the course of my tenure establishing the Mayors’ Council, Reed did not really play a role, giving off the general sense that he was more important than the other 14 mayors." But Reed did participate and remained open to a compromise approach hammered out by the group. Our ruling Eaves said Reed has been virtually absent from regional cooperation over his eight years in office. This seems to be rooted in Reed’s attitude toward a mayors’ initiative led by Eaves. There is also some evidence that Reed failed to faithfully attend meetings of Atlanta’s Regional Commission. However, in terms of promoting major development activity that boosted jobs across the region, Reed was deeply involved and can take credit for playing a key role. Reed might have rubbed some local officials the wrong way, but for residents, tangible results matter more than style. There’s a sliver of truth. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07407	Says stories about his birth certificate drowned out media coverage of the Republican and White House budget plans the week of April 11.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-birth-certificate-drowned-out-bu/	On the day he released copies of his long-form birth certificate, President Barack Obama said he was motivated to provide the document because he wanted to make sure that substantive issues, not sideshows, remained at the top of the news. Obama said that "two weeks ago, when the Republican House had put forward a budget that will have huge consequences potentially to the country, and when I gave a speech about my budget and how I felt that we needed to invest in education and infrastructure and making sure that we had a strong safety net for our seniors even as we were closing the deficit -- during that entire week the dominant news story wasn’t about these huge, monumental choices that we're going to have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate. And that was true on most of the news outlets that were represented here" at this news conference. Readers suggested that we look into the president’s contention that birth-certificate stories overshadowed stories on the Democratic and Republican budget plans. Other media organizations have also looked into the question. Fact-checkers and pundits who examined it used data from the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a nonpartisan group that produces a weekly analysis by sampling news coverage in broadcast and cable TV, newspapers, radio and the Internet. PEJ calculates its numbers based on a rigorous methodology and its ongoing study offers some of the most detailed statistics on news coverage available. For the week the president referenced -- April 11-17 -- PEJ found that the biggest topic of news coverage was the economy, with 39 percent of news coverage. Birth-certificate-related coverage accounted for a bit less than 4 percent, PEJ reported. So, based on PEJ’s figures, Obama is way off. But just to be sure, we took a second look using a more targeted approach. We called up transcripts for cable and broadcast television news coverage in the Nexis database and looked at three topics of coverage: stories involving the terms "Obama" and "birth certificate" or "birther"; stories involving "Paul Ryan," the architect of the GOP budget plan, and "Medicare"; and stories involving "Obama" and "budget speech." These are not perfect measurements -- the Nexis database, while large, is not fully comprehensive, and some minor or irrelevant mentions probably crept into our data. In addition, we just looked at television coverage, not radio, print or Internet coverage, as PEJ does. But we think the results still illustrate trends about what the media covered: For the week of April 11: Stories mentioning the birth certificate issue: Cable news 66, broadcast news 12, total 78. Paul Ryan and Medicare: Cable news 63, broadcast news 15, total 78. Obama’s budget speech: Cable news 135, broadcast news 24, total 159. So Obama is also wrong by our Nexis count. Coverage of his own speech was twice as common as birth-certificate coverage, while stories about the birth certificate and Ryan’s plan ran neck-and-neck -- hardly a "dominant" edge for the birth certificate issue, as Obama had indicated in his news conference. Still, we wondered whether the president would have been right if he’d simply said "last week" -- that is, the week of April 18 -- rather than "two weeks ago." It turns out that using those parameters, Obama would have been right. Here are the numbers for that week: Stories mentioning the birth certificate issue: Cable news 80, broadcast news 12, total 92. Paul Ryan and Medicare: Cable news 21, broadcast news 4, total 25. Obama’s budget speech: Cable news 37, broadcast news 3, total 40. In other words, for the week of April 18, the birth certificate issue was almost four times as prominent as the Ryan plan and more than twice as prominent as Obama’s budget speech. Indeed, our data shows that cable television attention to the birth certificate issue grew consistently over the course of March and April. Mentions on the three cable news networks -- CNN, Fox and MSNBC -- increased from week to week, from one during the week of March 14, to 16 the next week, then 26, 43, 66 and finally 80 during the week of April 18. PEJ, for its part, found birth certificate coverage jumping media-wide during the week of April 18. That week, coverage of the 2012 campaign generally jumped dramatically -- especially on cable, where it accounted for 19 percent of airtime studied. Driving that, PEJ found, was coverage of Trump in particular, and within the Trump coverage, birth-certificate issues were a major theme. "This is a classic case of selective perception," said S. Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University. "The birth certificate issue seemed irrelevant and irritating to the president, so he noticed whenever he saw it raised. The budget issue seemed indispensable to him, so he took it for granted whenever he saw it covered. This is a malady that affects politicians and journalists alike -- not to mention humble political scientists." Obama said that during the week of April 11, "the dominant news story wasn’t about these huge, monumental choices that we're going to have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate." He would have been correct if he’d simply referred to coverage one week later. But his precise claim -- and he was clear about the timing -- is not accurate. According to both PEJ’s analysis and our own, the big, substantive issues of the economy and the Democratic and Republican budget plans received quite a bit more coverage than the birth certificate story did during the week Obama referenced.

In an attempt to give taxpayers a sense of the impact of not extending the cuts, the Obama administration has issued state-by-state estimates of how many families would be affected if the cuts expire. In a report tailored for Rhode Island, the administration claims: "If the House of Representatives fails to extend the middle-class tax cuts, 400,000 middle-class Rhode Island families will see their federal income taxes increase." Rhode Island only has a million people (1,051,302 according to the latest census estimate). So 400,000 middle-class families seemed like a high number to us. We decided to check. The latest data from the Census Bureau says there are 412,259 households in Rhode Island, but only 256,181 households with families. The rest are non-family households, mostly people living alone. That's a huge difference. (There's an identical problem with the national numbers the Obama administration is using. The White House says 114 million middle-class families across the United States would be affected. The number of families is actually 76 million.) The second problem: Not all Rhode Island’s 256,000 families are middle-class families. The federal poverty level is about $15,000 a year for a family of two. According to the latest census income data from 2011, 8.4 percent of Rhode Island families -- about 21,500 -- had an income of less than $15,000. Subtract that number from 256,000 and you get about 234,500 families. (If you do the same calculation on a national level, the 114 million middle-class families that the White House talks about is really fewer than 70 million families.) Another complication: There is no official definition of middle class. People in a wide range of income levels consider themselves to be there. "Everybody thinks he's middle class," said Nick Kasprak, an analyst with The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. Kasprak said the category is meaningless. In addition, Kasprak said, everyone who already pays taxes will be in the same boat if a deal isn't reached, whether they would be considered middle class or not. "The only people who are unaffected by the fiscal cliff are the people that don’t file a tax return," Kasprak said in an e-mail. Tax increases "hit pretty much everyone" who files. "If you pay taxes at all, they will go up – there’s no cutoff line." We contacted the White House to ask about its numbers, but no one would talk to us for the record. In summary, the Obama administration is taking the number of households in the United States -- and Rhode Island -- and inaccurately categorizing them as middle-class families. There's no need to exaggerate the numbers. Without an agreement on tax reform, a lot of people are going to be affected. But saying that the number of middle-class Rhode Island families to be affected is 400,000 is a substantial exaggeration. We rate Mr. Obama's claim False.

pomt-14317	Says that when Michelle Fields "found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-michelle-fields-changed-her-story-fir/	Donald Trump is maintaining the innocence of his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was arrested March 29 and charged with simple battery for forcefully grabbing a reporter. Following a March 8 press conference in Jupiter, Fla., Michelle Fields, at the time a writer for the conservative website Breitbart, tried to ask Trump a question as he was leaving. Lewandowski allegedly grabbed Fields’ arm and pulled her away, leaving bruises. When news of the incident started to spread, Lewandowski tweeted at Fields, saying, "you are totally delusional. I never touched you." But security footage of the event released by the Jupiter Police Department March 29 appears to show Lewandowski grabbing Fields. (video from the Washington Post) Despite the recent video, Trump said Lewandowski didn’t misrepresent what happened. Rather, it’s Fields who is being deceptive, he said. "(Fields) said she went to the ground, or something to the effect of she almost went to the ground," Trump said at a March 29 CNN town hall. "She was in pain. She went to the ground. When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed. She didn't talk about it." Trump asked on Twitter why no one was checking to see how Fields’ story changed, and Fields responded, "Because my story never changed. Seriously, just stop lying." Did Fields change her story on what happened between her and Lewandowski? It appears not. We couldn’t find an example of her publicly retelling what happened since the second week of March when the story first unfolded. And since the security footage became public March 29, Fields has not yet given an interview. We tried to reach Trump and Fields and did not hear back. At the CNN town hall, Trump said Fields’ initial claim was that she fell to the ground or that she almost fell to the ground. It was the latter. "I was jolted backwards," Fields wrote March 10. "Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken." The Washington Post’s Ben Terris witnessed the incident and wrote a similar account the same day. "As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit ballroom, (Fields) pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question," Terris wrote. "I watched as a man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s 41-year-old campaign manager." Lewandowski and the Trump campaign immediately denied Fields’ accusation. "The accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false," spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. "As one of the dozens of individuals present as Mr. Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident." Fields stood by her account of what happened in a March 14 interview with Fox’s Megyn Kelly. "This is a campaign that continues to lie," she said. "I never wanted it to get this way. Those bruises will heal. My problem is the smearing of my name, my reputation." Following the incident, Breitbart editor-at-large Joel Pollak published a report where he questioned whether it was actually Lewandowski who grabbed Fields rather than another man. Claiming Breitbart was standing with the Trump campaign instead of its own employees, Fields and several other Breitbart employees resigned. Since the security footage came out in the past couple days, though, Pollak has admitted that his report was incorrect. Trump, conversely, said the footage "exonerates" Lewandowski "totally." It doesn’t; it looks from the video as if he did grab her — and the police report says the video is consistent with what Fields alleged. Trump also criticized Fields for allegedly grabbing him to ask a question and for holding a pen. While somewhat expected for a reporter to have a pen handy, Trump said it could have been a "little bomb" or a knife. Our ruling Trump said that when Michelle Fields "found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed." We see no evidence that Fields’ story about her altercation with Trump’s campaign manager has changed. She gave an initial account and hasn't backed off of it. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09665	Recovery.gov listed congressional districts that "do not exist."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/24/jeff-miller/nonexistent-congressional-districts-recovery-gov/	The Obama administration has promoted its Web site Recovery.gov as a bold new step in government transparency and a convenient way for voters to see that the economic stimulus program is working. Some Republicans say the site is filled with unreliable propaganda. Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller ridiculed the site in a newsletter Nov. 19, writing about how he looked on Recovery.gov and found jobs created in Florida's 34th, 53rd, 86th, and "00th" districts. "The problem is, these congressional districts do not exist," Miller wrote. "Florida only has TWENTY-FIVE congressional districts. "We know that the Administration is pulling a 'jobs created or saved' number out of thin air despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains high," Miller wrote. "The people of Florida know. We know that although Democrats represent only 10 of Florida’s 25 districts, their districts received 60% of the stimulus funds. These numbers reek of partisanship and potential corruption." Miller was right that Recovery.gov did have incorrect information on it. Officials blamed it on errors entering the data and have since replaced the erroneous districts with the notation "unassigned congressional district." ABC News broke the story on Nov. 16 and the corrections were made about two days later. The error caught our attention here at PolitiFact, and we archived the Florida page that confirms Miller's observations on bad district data. We also looked into whether Democratic districts received more money than Republican districts , and rated that statement Barely True. Here, we're verifying Miller's statement that Recovery.gov listed congressional districts that do not exist. That was indeed the case until news reports brought attention to the wrong data. Officials removed the data the evening before Miller posted his newsletter, so that now the jobs and money are attributed to "unassigned congressional district."

pomt-10672	"It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something, so we double the size of the Department of Education."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/19/ron-paul/so-true-hes-understating-it/	Fiscal conservatives have dreamed of abolishing the Department of Education since President Jimmy Carter created it in 1980. Ronald Reagan ran that year against Carter, pledging to kill it. After he failed to follow through, leading Republicans sponsored legislation to do the job in 1995, arguing that states should oversee education policy. But they couldn't persuade enough of their colleagues to go along. For a budget hawk like Ron Paul, that failure is particularly galling, especially considering the GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, the Senate for most of those years and the presidency starting in 2001. During that time, the Education Department has lived on — and enjoyed sizable budget increases. At a debate in Iowa on Dec. 12, 2007, Des Moines Register editor Carolyn Washburn gave Paul an opening to raise the issue: "What's the biggest obstacle standing in the way of improving education in the United States? And how would you address it?" The "federal government," Paul said, adding that — to his dismay — "It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something so we double the size of the Department of Education." In fact, Paul understates the shift. The size of the Education Department nearly quadrupled between 1994 and 2006, increasing from $27-billion to $100-billion. Even when adjusting for inflation — the 1994 budget rises to $36.8-billion when calculated in 2006 dollars — the increase is huge: nearly triple (172 percent). Much of the increase came as a result of the 2001 education law known as the No Child Left Behind Act. In return for implementing a regimen of student testing and teacher accountability, states received an infusion of federal funds. We should point out that federal funding contributes a small portion to education funding for grades K-12. Even under the No Child law, states and localities contribute 83 percent of K-12 education funding. The federal contribution is 8 percent; private sources provide 9 percent, according to Education Department calculations. The $100-billion budget in 2006 was by far the largest ever, and something of an anomaly. It marked a substantial increase from the 2005 funding level of $71.5-billion. In 2007, the budget fell to $67.4-billion, a 75 percent increase over 1994 levels in inflation-adjusted terms — big but not quite double. The bump in 2006 was the result of a massive increase in mandatory spending related to student loan processing and to a one-time infusion of $4.3-billion to cover shortfalls in funding for grants to university students. Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending, meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications. Most other programs — including No Child Left Behind funding — are considered discretionary, meaning the amounts get decided each year. But whether the spending is mandatory or discretionary, Paul, a libertarian who does not believe the federal government has a role to play in education policy, says it's better left to the states. Many of his Republican colleagues, as evidenced by the $73-billion increase in funding the Education Department enjoyed while they controlled Congress and the White House, apparently do not agree. Paul's statement, therefore, is True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2007-12-19T00:00:00	2007-12-12	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12305	"If you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you are grandfathered in."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/25/kellyanne-conway/house-health-care-bill-allows-some-stay-medicaid-n/	Proposed changes to Medicaid shouldn’t worry people currently using the health care program for the very poor, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said, because their coverage will continue. Conway and George Stephanopoulos discussed the GOP's health care plans on ABC’s This Week on June 25, 2017. Senate Republicans earlier in the week had released a bill to follow up the House plan passed in May. Despite a projected $800 billion in cuts to the joint state and federal program — which Conway characterized not as cuts but as "getting Medicaid back to where it was" — current enrollees would not be affected, she said. "If you are currently in Medicaid, if you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you are grandfathered in," Conway said. We reached out to the White House to try to get more details on Conway’s statement, but did not get a response. Conway appears to be talking about a provision in the House version of the bill that doesn’t appear in the Senate version. In either scenario, however, experts say current Medicaid enrollees will be in danger of losing funding and benefits. Aid for Medicaid First, let’s review the Medicaid expansion and how it’s funded. As part of its efforts to obtain health coverage for as many people as possible, the Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid and help pay for it with more federal dollars. Thirty-one states plus D.C. currently have extended Medicaid benefits to all adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The poverty line for a family of four is $24,600 in 2017. For states with expanded Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act said the federal government would cover 90 percent or more of the cost of newly eligible Medicaid recipients. The money Washington kicks in to cover those patients is called the federal match rate. The House bill would lower the federal match rate for new Medicaid applicants, back to the pre-Obamacare rate, which depends on the state, but would average about 57 percent by 2020. That would shift more costs of expanded Medicaid to states, and almost assuredly result in drastic changes to state programs. "In practice, this means tens of billions of dollars cut from the Medicaid expansion, and most states wouldn’t be able to cover that gap, so they’d have to reduce eligibility, benefits or both," said Ben Sommers, a Harvard University health policy and economics professor. Some states even would mandate changes by law. Seven "trigger" states — Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Washington — built requirements into their Medicaid expansions to protect them from the higher costs of covering so many more people. Those states would legally have to end or curb the expansion if the federal match rate goes down. Bottom line, while the House bill would allow for an expanded Medicaid system to continue, GOP lawmakers would put less money into it and allow individual states to change eligibility requirements. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in February 2017 that about 2.6 million expansion-eligible adults would lose coverage due to these trigger laws. A grandfather clause in the House bill The House bill does allow people covered by expanded Medicaid as of Dec. 31, 2019, to continue to qualify for the higher 90 percent federal match rate under Obamacare. The "grandfathered expansion enrollees" would have to maintain near-continuous coverage, with no breaks of more than a month, in order to get the higher rate. That’s not as simple as it sounds. Continuous coverage can be hard for Medicaid recipients to maintain. Medicaid patients have to continuously provide proof of income, and if a patient goes over the income limit, they lose coverage. This is a concept known as churning. Joan Alker, a public policy professor and executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, said that even if the bill grandfathers in those people at Obamacare funding levels, there’s no guarantee they’ll be able to keep their Medicaid benefits. "After a few years ... it is estimated that those people will mostly all have churned off, effectively ending that protection," Alker said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office detailed what would happen in a March analysis of the House plan. The CBO concluded "that fewer than one-third of those enrolled as of December 31, 2019, would have maintained continuous eligibility two years later." If the bill became law, the higher federal match rate would still apply to less than 5 percent of newly eligible enrollees by 2024, the CBO estimated. That would be translate to about 550,000 of the roughly 11 million enrollees who now qualify for the enhanced federal matching under Medicaid expansion. "Even under the ACA, Medicaid is income sensitive and it is typical for people other than the elderly and people with disabilities to cycle on and off," said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. "Under neither the House nor Senate bill are current expansion beneficiaries guaranteed any coverage duration." The Senate bill, meanwhile, continues to fund Medicaid expansion at the same rates until 2020. After that, the federal contribution shrinks to 85 percent in 2021, 80 percent in 2022 and 75 percent in 2023. In 2024, the federal reimbursement rate drops to the current average of around 57 percent. For states to maintain the Medicaid expansion as is, states would have to raise spending by $43 billion in 2024 alone, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Our ruling Conway said, "If you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you are grandfathered in." The GOP health care bill that passed the House, along with the "discussion draft" circulated in the Senate, make changes to Medicaid for people who acquired health care coverage through Obamacare. The House proposal includes a grandfather clause that allows people covered by expanded Medicaid as of Dec. 31, 2019, to continue to qualify for a 90 percent federal match rate. But the "grandfathered expansion enrollees" would have to maintain near-continuous coverage in order to get the higher rate. Experts say that is extremely difficult because of changes in income or because of changes states could choose to make. The Senate plan, which remains just a draft, continues the Medicaid expansion program largely as is until 2020, before beginning to reduce federal funding for all enrollees. That means either states will have to pick up a larger share of the cost or make changes to the program. In either scenario, changes are likely. It's just a matter of when and how.

pomt-00990	"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/08/katty-kay/katty-kay-countries-africa-have-higher-vaccination/	Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine "Katty" Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. "There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States," Kay said on NBC’s Meet the Press. "Because when people really need it, and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate." Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFact and PolitiFact busy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kay’s claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kay’s source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percent for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in 2013, according to the WHO data. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the measles immunization rate in the United States is 91.9 percent. But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States 91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, it’s not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States’ include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a "major public health success" that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. "I’m old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available," Troisi said, "and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason we’re seeing this refusal is because parents haven’t seen what these diseases can do." Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, "There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States." We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data. We rate her claim True.

pomt-13196	"ISIS is in 32 countries."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/24/donald-trump/context-crucial-defining-how-many-countries-now-ha/	The terrorist group ISIS continues to be a focus of the 2016 presidential campaign. During the final presidential debate in Oct. 19, Donald Trump said the group has spread significantly. Hillary Clinton "gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there," Trump said. "And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries." "We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place," Trump said later in the debate, "and right now, they're in 32 countries." As we've noted before, Trump's claim that Clinton is responsible for ISIS rates False. But we wanted to know if Trump's count of countries with an ISIS presence is correct. The short answer: No. But experts we consulted said counts can vary depending on how you define whether ISIS has a serious presence in country. If you use a broad definition, Trump's count is probably too low. By a stricter definition, it's too high. We asked the Trump campaign for the source of the candidate's tally but we didn't hear back. Where ISIS's impact is felt Claims about ISIS (also known as the Islamic State, ISIL and Daesh) being in 32 countries seem to originate from a blog post two years ago on The Long War Journal website. The post described "a partial list of reported or suspected ISIS/Islamic State activity outside Iraq and Syria since Jan. 1, 2013." That's a broad standard because it includes the United States and Canada, which are countries where ISIS has no known military presence. Additionally, it's not clear if any significant terror networks are operating in the United States or Canada, and many of the attacks that do occur seem to be coming from ISIS wannabes. "Context is always key," said Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a right-center think tank. As a practical matter, Trump's count of 32 countries from 2014 would be out of date because ISIS' strength has ebbed and flowed in various regions of the world, Roggio said. "If Trump had said the Islamic State is operating in 32 countries to various degrees or had supporters in 32 states, the actual number is probably larger." Roggio said he could easily come up with a list of 37 countries, including countries where ISIS supporters have actually launched attacks — places like Spain, Canada and Italy, where officials claim to have broken up ISIS cells and arrested people. Some attacks have come from pre-existing terror networks that have pledged affiliation with ISIS. Roggio said it's legitimate to include countries where self-declared supporters have launched attacks because "that's exactly what the Islamic State and al-Qaida tell people to do. To me, we wouldn't refrain from calling out someone who identifies as a Nazi or a KKK member just because they didn't sign the membership rolls somewhere." Another source, the National Counterterrorism Center has listed ISIS attacks, big and small, in 27 countries between September 2014 and June 2016. Trevor Thrall, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed us to data from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism reporting that in 2015, ISIS-related terrorist attacks took place in 33 countries. "This is not quite the same, of course, as saying ISIL is 'in' 33 countries. Many of those attacks — most of those occurring outside Iraq in particular —- were conducted by lone wolves or by ISIL affiliated groups, not ISIL per se," Thrall said. CNN's running tally lists attacks in 31 countries, including Iraq and Syria. Strong physical presence By the narrow standard, where some sort of military presence — or at least an established network — is required, Trump's count is too high. A June 2016 Congressional Research Service report identified nine countries where ISIS had a serious presence. That's a far cry from 32. The State Department's "Country Reports on Terrorism 2015," survey says that last year, beyond its operations in Iraq and Syria, ISIS was claiming affiliates along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, in northern Nigeria, the North Caucasus region in southern Russia, Algeria, Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. That's a total of 11 countries. The areas outside Iraq and Syria are identified as "governates" in this Institute for the Study of War map from November. William McCants, director of the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World at The Brookings Institution, said that in July the Islamic State was claiming governates in 14 countries (including Cameroon, Chad, and Niger). In August, NBC News obtained what's known as a "heat map" from the National Counterterrorism Center indicating that there were "aspiring branches" of ISIS in six additional countries: Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Somalia, Tunisia and Mali. That would bring the count to 16. ISIS itself has also claimed to have "covert units" in Turkey, France and Lebanon, according to McCants. That would bring the total, at best, to 19. Our ruling Trump said "ISIS is in 32 countries." As the experts noted, context is important here. If lone wolf attacks by ISIS wannabes or people with access to ISIS propaganda who are exploring attacks are included, Trump's number is a little low. But if you look at countries where ISIS has a sizable, established presence, Trump's number is too high.

Here’s a portion of the column: "Seventeen years (after the 9/11 attacks), endless wars abroad and reckless policies at home have produced annual deficits approaching $1 trillion. President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence. And while the United States has been mired in endless wars and bloody occupations over the past 17 years, China has used that same period to aggressively develop economic partnerships across Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Perhaps that is one reason China will soon overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy." It's a common refrain, regardless of who's in the White House. In February 2016, we rated Mostly True a statement by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush that "Barack Obama will somehow manage to add more than $8 trillion to the national debt, which is more debt than the 43 presidents who held office before him compiled together." So is it really true that "President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence"? Pretty much. A few preliminaries. First, there are two common measures for debt. One, called public debt, tallies up the debt held by the public, while gross federal debt is a larger figure that combines publicly held debt plus debt held by the government itself, such as in the Social Security or Medicare trust funds. Both figures are considered legitimate, and since Scarborough didn’t specify which one she was referring to, we’ll run the numbers for both categories of debt. Because debt is cumulative (minus any intervening surpluses) the debt level at the end of a given time period is the cumulative debt up to that point -- you don’t have to add the yearly figures for debt to get the figure Scarborough is referencing. Calculating the debt The first question to answer is, when do you start counting to calculate debt for "the first 200 years of America’s existence"? (An NBC spokesman didn’t respond to an inquiry.) Probably the most obvious way to do it is to look at the cumulative debt between 1776, the date of the Declaration of Independence, and 1976, the national bicentennial year. At the end of 1976, the public debt was $477.4 billion, and the gross federal debt was just under $629 billion. So how does that compare to Trump’s record? The amount of public debt added in 2017 -- a year when Trump was president for all but 20 days and when the Republicans were in control of Congress -- was $497.8 billion, while the amount of gross federal debt added was $666.3 billion. Whichever variety of debt you use, the amount of debt added under Republican control in 2017 was greater than the accumulated debt by the end of 1976, making Scarborough’s statement correct. (Economists do not typically adjust debt figures for inflation; the figures cited above are nominal dollars.) Meanwhile, projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office suggest that the size of the debt under Trump will only grow from what it was in 2017. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, the debt is projected to increase by more than $1 trillion in each year. Some might suggest starting the clock in 1788 -- when the Constitution was ratified -- and stopping it in 1988, rather than starting with pre-Revolutionary War independence. In that scenario, the accumulated public debt over 200 years would be $2.1 trillion and the accumulated general debt would be $2.6 trillion. That would make Scarborough’s calculation incorrect. However, "I think most people would say America began its existence in 1776," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Some caveats Beyond the starting date, we see a few caveats. First, Scarborough lays the blame entirely at the Republicans’ feet. However, decisions made by Democrats or by both parties long before Trump’s tenure have shaped how much was added to the debt in 2017. Net interest on the debt accounted for 6.6 percent of federal spending in 2017, and mandatory spending -- outlays that are essentially on autopilot, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- accounted for an additional 63.3 percent of federal spending. So the broad outlines of today’s spending picture were not solely set by today’s Republican congressional majorities and Republican president. Second, the inevitable grind of inflation and population growth puts an upward pressure on the scale of the debt. Unless and until the United States reverses course and starts paying down the debt, every new president will preside over ever-larger amounts of debt. A better way to look at debt is by measuring debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, Ellis said. That’s because a more economically productive country can more easily carry a big debt load. And how do those figures look? Here’s a chart. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As the chart shows, the current level of debt as a percentage of GDP is not unprecedented (it was higher around World War II) and its growth has eased recently since a spike after the Great Recession. The recession both fed higher spending on the national safety net and weakened the denominator, which is gross domestic product. The chart does show that, when looking at a percentage of GDP, Scarborough is correct in his comparison. Debt as a percentage of GDP in 2017 was far higher (almost 77 percent) than it was in 1976 (about 27 percent). Our ruling Scarborough said, "President Trump’s Republican Party will create more debt in one year than was generated in the first 200 years of America’s existence." If you use the period 1776 to 1976, Scarborough is correct. However, it’s worth noting that much of today’s debt picture owes something to guidelines for mandatory spending and net interest for past debts, both of which were shaped by both parties.

pomt-02777	"About 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/08/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-about-2-percent-americans-get-pai/	Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman questioned Democrats who want to raise the federal minimum wage and offered a flurry of statistics to help make his point. Speaking Sunday on ABC's This Week, Portman suggested that raising the $7.25 an hour minimum wage could force employers to cut jobs. "If you want to deal with income inequality, the No. 1 way to do it is to get people to work. That's what all the statistics show. About 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage. Of that group, by the way, less than .3 of 1 percent of Americans are both under poverty -- under the line of poverty and on minimum wage. So it's a lot of young people. About 50 percent of them are between 16 and 24 years old. For a lot of them, it's a part-time job. So what you don't want to do is raise the minimum wage to the point that you're actually losing jobs." That exchange includes a bunch of different statistics, but here we’ll be checking this one: "About 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage." We won’t get into the question of what this means for minimum-wage policy here; for now, we’ll just look at the numbers. To do so, we turned to a study published by Bureau of Labor Statistics -- the federal government’s official chronicler of employment and wage data -- titled, "Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers: 2012." It was released on Feb. 26, 2013. The study found that a little under 3.6 million workers were paid either at or below the federal minimum wage. (The study did not look at whether workers were paid higher minimum wage rates set by their state, as many states have done.) To determine the percentage, we looked at the number of Americans employed. That number ranged between about 133 million and 134 million during 2012. If you divide the two numbers, it turns out that, by the official statistics, roughly 2.6 percent of all American workers were earning the minimum wage in 2012. That’s slightly higher than Portman indicated, but his estimate was definitely in the ballpark. That said, we do see a few caveats, none of which strike us as particularly troublesome for the accuracy of his comment. • Portman said "2 percent of Americans," but to be entirely accurate, he really should have said 2 percent of workers. To figure out the percentage of "Americans" earning the minimum wage, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimated that the U.S. population in 2012 was 313,914,040. That would mean that minimum-wage workers accounted for just over 1 percent of Americans. That said, dividing by the number of Americans would not be a very useful number -- it includes a lot of people who aren’t old enough to work or who have retired. • Portman referred to people who "get paid the minimum wage." Actually, the numbers he cited refer to Americans who either get paid the minimum wage or get paid less than the minimum wage. How can you get paid less than the minimum wage? The minimum-wage law actually exempts whole classes of workers from the $7.25 standard -- "vocational education students," "full-time students employed by retail or service establishments, agriculture, or institutions of higher education," and those "impaired by a physical or mental disability." This is not a trivial population -- for 2012 at least, the number earning less than the minimum wage (about 2 million) actually exceeded the number who earned the minimum wage exactly (about 1.6 million). In addition, it’s worth noting that workers in tipped professions, such as wait staff, get a legal minimum wage that’s well below $7.25. By factoring in tips earned, the employer only has to pay workers a minimum of $2.13 an hour. One other note: The BLS offers some words of caution about its data. It counted only minimum-wage workers who are actually paid by the hour. Salaried and other non-hourly workers are excluded from the BLS analysis. BLS says the number of salaried workers earning at or below the minimum wage is probably modest, but the data is sufficiently opaque that the agency warns that "the actual number of workers with earnings at or below the prevailing federal minimum is undoubtedly understated." BLS also warns that this study is based on a sample, and samples are imperfect. Our ruling Portman said that "about 2 percent of Americans get paid the minimum wage." He didn’t word the statement with complete accuracy; he would have been better off saying that, according to official statistics, "about 2 percent of American workers get paid at or below the federal minimum wage." Still, his number is close to accurate, and his general point -- that workers who are paid the federal minimum-wage represent a small percentage of the entire working population -- is backed up by official data. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2013-12-08T14:54:20	2013-12-08	['United_States']
pomt-02214	"One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/21/democratic-national-committee/which-more-unpopular-obamacare-or-repealing-obamac/	Searching for painted eggs. Brunch with the family. Heading to church dressed in Sunday best. Debating health care. Maybe not all of those fit in your Easter morning routine, but when you're a spokesman for one of the two major parties in this election climate, even when people are celebrating a holiday, you’re talking Obamacare. As was the case April 20, 2014, on CNN’s State of the Union, where Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee and Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer jousted over the Affordable Care Act’s potential impact on the 2014 midterms. When asked about Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., running campaign ads talking about fixing Obamacare, Elleithee said there’s a difference between positive fixes and full-on repeal. "Mary Landrieu is absolutely going to say, and I think Democrats across the country are going to say, there is a difference between our side and their side. Our side supports this law, making it work better. Their side wants to take it away. People don't want that fight anymore, right?" Elleithee said. "One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act, and people are tired of the fight that Sean and his side keep pushing." We’ve done plenty of poll watching on President Barack Obama’s health care law. You can find examples of fact-checks about them here, here and here. We know the law itself has divided the country with a plurality of people generally holding an unfavorable view. But what about comparing the law’s popularity against the number of people who want it repealed? That’s a new one to us, and we decided it deserved a second look. Polls, polls and more polls Elleithee linked us to a couple of polls conducted in the last few months. We found a handful on our own as well. The crux of the question is this: Which is more unpopular: the law itself, or the idea of repealing the law? The Kaiser Family Foundation has released a health care poll almost monthly since early 2012, the most prolific and persistent public tracking of the bill’s popularity. According to the nonpartisan organization’s latest Health Tracking Poll conducted between March 11-17, 46 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the law against 38 percent with a favorable opinion. How does that compare to people looking to repeal? While only 10 percent want to keep it as is it is, a plurality, or 49 percent, want to keep it in place but work to improve it. Just 29 percent said it should be repealed and replaced with a GOP alternative or nothing at all. So that’s one poll showing 46 percent expressing an unfavorable view of the law against 59 percent who would elect an option other than repealing it. That seems to back up Elleithee’s claim. Other polls were more nuanced. National Public Radio partnered with two firms, one Democrat, one Republican, for a survey between March 19-23. It measured support for the law at 47 percent with 51 percent opposing. But 44 percent said it should be repealed and replaced and 53 percent said implement and fix it. So, in this poll, those with an unpopular opinion of the law (51 percent) was pretty darn close to the people who didn’t want to repeal (53 percent). The difference in outcomes could be attributed to how varying pollsters asked the question. In the Kaiser poll, respondents had five options (keep it as is, tweak it to improve it, repeal it and replace it, just repeal or other). In the NPR poll, there were just three choices: "Implement and fix," "Repeal and replace," or "Unsure/Refused." Bloomberg News went a step further and asked about individual components of the law in a March 7-10 survey. At the macro level, the poll showed 34 percent of people calling for repeal, with 51 percent saying, "It may need modifications but we should see how it works" and 13 percent calling for no change. But the majority of people said one of the central pillars of the law, the individual mandate requiring almost everyone to buy health insurance, should be repealed. Other provisions, like eliminating lifetime caps on insurance and allowing children to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26, remained quite popular. This poll didn’t ask individuals if they had a favorable or unfavorable view of the law. A poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal conducted March 5-9 found an entirely new way to pose the question. It asked half the respondents if they would be more likely to vote for someone who supported repealing the health care law — 47 percent said yes and just 32 percent said they would be less likely. The other half of the respondents were asked if they would support a candidate who wanted to fix the law but keep it in place. While 45 percent said they would be more likely to vote for them, 42 percent would be less likely. Still, when asked if they would rather support a Democrat who would fix and keep the law, or a Republican who wanted to repeal, 48 percent said they would support the Dem and 47 percent said the GOP. So what do we make of all of this? "I think the two items show that while the law remains more opposed than supported, the idea of repealing (or repeal and replace) also lacks majority support," said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. "In part this may reflect a lack of appetite for going through the entire process of legislating again, or perhaps concern that a replacement would be no better. It may also reflect the lack of specific proposals that would be part of a replacement." "Without strongly formed opinions about alternatives, surveys are likely to be especially sensitive to question wording and the particular focus of a question." We’ll throw one more poll in there, just for fun. According to the Pew Center for People and the Press, of the 53 percent of people who disapprove of the law, a majority — 56 percent — said lawmakers should still try to make it work, while just 36 percent said they should do what they can to ensure it fails. Our ruling Elleithee says, "One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act." Polls support that idea: Generally speaking, more people are against the idea of repeal than the Affordable Care Act. But how much of a difference varies. Elleithee said repeal is "much more unpopular" than Obamacare. While one respectable poll (Kaiser Family Foundation) could make that case, others were less definitive. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2014-04-21T17:31:48	2014-04-20	['None']
pomt-01896	"There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/06/sheldon-whitehouse/there-are-already-more-american-jobs-solar-industr/	For more than a year, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has delivered weekly Senate speeches about the dangers of climate change. He frequently denounces climate-change deniers, and urges growth of green jobs and technologies to reduce America’s reliance on foreign fossil fuel. In a May 27, 2014 commentary in The Providence Journal, Whitehouse argued for a nationwide price on carbon pollution. And he expressed hope for a prosperous, clean-energy future and faith that "there is more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries." To that end, Whitehouse noted that there "are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining." This claim is reminiscent of his November 2012 statement that "we have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country." (PolitiFact Rhode Island ruled that claim as True.) The solar industry has seen tremendous growth. But have solar industry jobs actually eclipsed the number of coal-mining jobs? Whitehouse communications director Seth Larson cited two sources to back up the senator’s claim. The first is a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued in May 2013 that counts an estimated 80,030 jobs for all occupations within the coal-mining industry -- a sector of the coal industry as a whole. For solar jobs, Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s "National Solar Jobs Census 2013," which states that the solar industry "employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013." First, let’s look at coal-mining jobs. We checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that Whitehouse had quoted the May 2013 number correctly. (The more recent April 2014 BLS month survey counted 78,500 coal-mining jobs. Neither of those include self-employed contractors.) BLS press officer Gary Steinberg said its estimated numbers are drawn from "an annual survey of employers, by occupation," based on data sent by businesses. They reflect jobs, not people. We also found three other sets of coal-mining numbers. Spoiler alert: they are not all apples-to-apples. They use different methodologies and different definitions. But they provide an overall picture. A 2013 report from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited 123,227 jobs -- substantially more than the BLS, but still less than the number of solar jobs Whitehouse cited. MHSA surveys the mines themselves as opposed to the companies, and therefore includes contractors as well as regular workers. SNL Energy, a leading energy data provider, analyzes MSHA data to capture "snapshot" industry trends. Its June 2014 report, "U.S. coal miner employment sustains free fall beyond 2nd year," cites an 8.3% drop in the one-year period ending March 31, to 79,658 employees. That excludes contractors and 33 not-yet-reported mines. By contrast, the National Mining Association, a trade group, counted 195,494 coal-mining jobs in 2012. The breakdown: miners (including contractors): 137,650; support activities: 6,930; transportation: 50,914. That’s nearly 53,000 more than Whitehouse’s solar jobs number. Spokeswoman Nancy Gravatt said the NMA maintains that the additional support services "should be included because all of these activities are integral to the daily work in the mines." But the NMA’s definition of coal-mining jobs goes far beyond those used by the federal agencies, including such transportation workers as railroad engineers and seamen on coal freighters. In other words, data from three sources supports Whitehouse’s claim. The NMA count does not. Now let’s check out the solar data. Larson cited The Solar Foundation’s "National Solar Jobs Census 2013," which states that the solar industry "employs 142,698 Americans as of November 2013." The Solar Foundation is an independent, national 501(c)(3) nonprofit, non-lobbying group, that strives "to increase the widespread adoption of solar energy through educational outreach, policy research, and market transformation." Their data is considered "the most authoritative" by the Congressional Research Service. Its report defines "solar workers" as those who spend "at least 50 percent of their time supporting solar-related activities." According to its 2013 census, "approximately 91 percent of those who meet our definition of a solar worker spent 100 percent of their time working on solar." Andrea Luecke, the foundation’s executive director, said the foundation surveys the "known universe" of self-identified solar companies, of which there are about 6,000 nationwide. "We go out directly to those companies. This year, we made 74,000 phone calls and sent 11,000 emails," over the course of one month. The foundation also surveys companies "that help supply the ‘known universe’ with raw materials," Luecke said. "It’s a census approach, so we’re doing a direct count and extrapolate to get national numbers, which is how the BLS does it." Luecke said by the census report’s measure, "the solar industry is outpacing coal mining." But she noted, "You have to understand that coal-mining is one aspect of the coal industry - whereas we’re talking about the whole solar industry." If you add in other coal industry categories, "it’s more than solar, for sure. But the coal-mining bucket is less, for sure." Our ruling: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said that solar industry jobs have now outpaced coal-mining jobs. The most recent data from three objective sources support his claim. The one source that offered a contrary view, the National Mining Association, cited two-year-old numbers and counted categories such as off-site transportation workers on coal barges and ocean freighters. Because Whitehouse’s statement was specifically about coal-mining jobs, we rule it True.

(Correction: The original version of this item misspelled the last name of Andrea Luecke, president of The Solar Foundation, and incorrectly reported the name of the Congressional Research Service.)

pomt-08039	"We can save $125 billion in simply not giving out money to Medicare recipients that don't exist for procedures that didn't happen."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/04/darrell-issa/rep-darrell-issa-claims-government-could-save-125-/	Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., promises to be a politician we're going to hear a lot from this year. Issa is the incoming chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He has pledged an aggressive agenda of hearings to ferret out government fraud and waste. And he called President Obama's White House "one of the most corrupt administrations." So he's going to be busy. On CBS's Face the Nation on Jan. 2, 2011, Issa put a dollar figure on his goal, vowing to identify and eliminate about $200 billion in waste. Medicare alone, he said, accounts for $125 billion in waste and fraud annually. Said Issa: "We can save $125 billion in simply not giving out money to Medicare recipients that don't exist for procedures that didn't happen. These are real dollars. Ten percent of the deficit goes out in wasted money, money that doesn't get one person health care in Medicare." We called the Oversight committee's press office to find out where Issa got the $125 billion figure and were told it came from an Office of Management and Budget report that concluded there was about $125 billion worth of "improper payments" in 2010. Improper payments include money paid to the wrong person (sometimes people who are dead or in jail), or in the wrong amount or for the wrong purpose, or payments for which there wasn't proper documentation. It also includes fraudulent claims by contractors and organizations. But the OMB's total was government-wide, not just for Medicare. The $125 billion also included improper payments for programs including Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security and the school lunch program. Medicare is the government agency with the largest chunk of improper payments, but it's still less than half the total. In fact, improper payments in Medicare came to $47.9 billion ($34.3 billion in Medicare fee-for-service and $13.6 billion in Medicare Advantage). That's a significant amount of money but far less than the $125 billion Issa assigned entirely to Medicare. It's also inaccurate to suggest that all of the money identified as improper payments could be returned as savings to taxpayers. As Issa said, improper payments can include money paid to the wrong person or for procedures that didn't happen. But there's more to it than that. About a third of Medicare's improper payments are the result of a claim not having enough, or proper, documentation. Upon further investigation, many of those claims are ultimately deemed proper. One example is a payment based on a claim by a doctor who submits forms that are illegible. Also, not all improper claims can be completely recouped. For example, say a surgeon was paid $10,000 for an inpatient procedure when Medicare only reimburses for an outpatient procedure that costs $5,000. The government wouldn't recoup the full $10,000, just the $5,000. In other words, the government wouldn't end up with $125 billion even if all improper payments were eliminated for all those services, including Medicare. The Obama administration has taken a number of steps aimed at reducing improper payments. With regard to Medicare specifically, Obama announced on June 8, 2010, the administration's intent to cut the improper payment rate in the Medicare fee-for-service program in half by 2012, eliminating more than $20 billion in payment errors. The Office of Management and Budget report cited by Issa's office notes that improper payments in the Medicare fee-for-service program actually went down in 2010 as a percentage, from 12.4 percent to 10.5 percent. There's no question improper payments in Medicare are a very significant problem. But Issa has overstated the potential savings in the Medicare program. For starters, the report on which Issa based the $125 billion figure shows that the Medicare portion of that total is $47.9 billion. That alone makes Issa's figure simply wrong. But in addition, Issa wrongly suggests that all of the money from "improper payments" can be "saved" by simply not making those payments. In fact, a good portion of that money lacked proper documentation, but upon further investigation, may very well be verified as proper. In other words, even the $47.9 billion in improper payments in Medicare could not be fully recaptured for taxpayers. We rate Issa's statement False.

pomt-05274	Says Larry Taylor gave "in-state tuition to illegal immigrants."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/may/25/conservative-voters-texas-pac/conservative-pac-says-larry-taylor-gave-state-tuit/	Matt Welch, press secretary with Galveston County state Rep. Larry Taylor’s campaign for a Texas Senate seat, wrote PolitiFact Texas asking us to examine a statement posted on a website attacking his candidate. The site created by the Conservative Voters of Texas PAC, www.whylarrywhy.com, blares in big type, "Why did Larry Taylor give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants?" Taylor is among three Republicans and a Democrat seeking to represent Senate District 11, southeast of Houston. Mark McCaig, president of Conservative Voters of Texas and a Houston attorney, told us by phone that the PAC’s claim was based on passage of Senate Bill 1528 in 2005. "The current law that allows illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition was voted for -- was supported by Larry Taylor," he said. The PAC’s website urges readers to send a letter to Taylor saying, "Because of your vote on SB 1528 (79th Regular Session), children of illegal immigrants are allowed to attend state schools with in-state tuition." We have previously reported that Texas became the first state to offer the in-state tuition benefit to children of illegal immigrants in 2001 -- or two years before Taylor joined the House. In 2001, only five legislators voted against House Bill 1403, which Gov. Rick Perry signed into law that June. McCaig conceded that the 2001 law created the in-state tuition benefit. He said, however, that the 2005 measure backed by Taylor replaced the 2001 law while preserving the in-state tuition benefit. Hence, he said, Taylor voted to give that benefit. Taylor disagreed, saying by phone that the option he voted on was not to discontinue or continue giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, but to tighten restrictions or "leave it the way it is." Given that choice, he said, he and other representatives present voted unanimously to pass SB 1528. Legislative records confirm that House members unanimously approved the proposal, though one legislator recorded his "no" vote in the House Journal. State senators also unanimously endorsed the legislation. At the time, lawmakers said they were changing definitions in law to ensure that applicants to colleges and universities were treated fairly in determinations of residency. At McCaig’s nudging, however, we noticed the 2005 proposal repealed the 2001 language enabling illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition. But the latter proposal also swapped in similar provisions. In a telephone interview, Dominic Chavez, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, said the 2005 proposal covered several topics related to residency issues and tuition. Chavez said the revisions were intended to ensure that other legal U.S. residents had the same access to in-state tuition earlier made possible for illegal immigrants. For example, he said, a student who earned a Texas high school diploma while living here with his grandmother could be denied in-state tuition rates if his "domicile" was determined to be with a parent in another state. Did the 2005 law tighten restrictions on who could qualify, as Taylor says? Chavez said, "I’m not sure we could prove it one way or the other." Broadly, Chavez told us, SB 1528 "was not designed to repeal or not repeal" the 2001 law. "A vote against SB 1528 did not equate to a vote to repeal HB 1403," he said. Put another way, he said, the coordinating board traces creation of the tuition benefit for illegal immigrants to the action in 2001. Welch, Taylor’s consultant, pointed out by phone that various conservative Republicans including Reps. Leo Berman, Ken Paxton and Wayne Christian voted, like Taylor, for the 2005 proposal. He said this was an indication that no one thought they were voting to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. Asked for comment on our findings, McCaig said that SB 1528 constituted a renewal of the tuition benefit because its definitions replaced all the definitions in HB 1403. Our ruling The PAC says Taylor voted to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. However, Texas lawmakers granted illegal immigrants the chance to pay in-state college tuition rates in 2001. It’s correct that the cited 2005 action revised the 2001 law, partly to benefit legal U.S. residents. But these changes did not give or create the tuition benefit. If lawmakers had simply rejected the 2005 proposal, for instance, the tuition benefit would have stayed in place. It was years old.

pomt-08229	The cap-and-trade bill before Congress "prevents you from selling your home without the permission of the EPA administrator."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/17/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-bill-requires-epa-permission-h/	"If you own a home, you must read this!" says the e-mail making the rounds in Rhode Island mailboxes. The message says "It will come as a huge shock to you if you aren't informed as to what Obama is up to" and warns that if legislation designated as HR-2454 is approved by Congress, "a year from now, you won't be able to sell your house. Yes, you read it right." The reason, according to the e-mail, is that homes, including mobile homes, will be required to meet new federal energy standards before being sold. "In effect, this bill prevents you from selling your home without the permission of the EPA administrator." Is there really a plan to require homeowners to get permission from Washington before they can sell their property? It turns out, the authors of this warning aren't reading it right when they discuss the actual legislation, better known as the anti-pollution "cap-and-trade" bill that is controversial for other reasons. Here's what PolitiFact found when it looked into the homeowner issue a year ago: There's lots of language in the bill regarding building efficiency. Section 201, for instance, requires building energy codes for new homes to be 30 percent more efficient than current standards when the bill goes into law and 50 percent more efficient by 2016. State and local governments will be responsible for enforcing the new codes, but will receive government allowances to cover the cost of developing and adopting the improvements. And Section 202 of the bill would establish a program that would allow states to help homeowners finance energy-efficient home retrofits; the more energy a retrofit saves, the more money the homeowner would get from the government to subsidize the work. Finally, Section 204 would require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a model program that individual states could voluntarily adopt to label new buildings for their energy performance. This "license," as the chain e-mail calls it, is only applicable to new construction and would be completely voluntary. In fact, that's a point the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the panel that has jurisdiction over the cap-and-trade bill, makes over and over in its summary of the legislation: "Nothing would require a homeowner to audit or retrofit their home to ensure that it meets building code requirements," the document says. Lane Burt, a building efficiency expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports the legislation, has blogged about the issue. He says the e-mail is false. "The anti-efficiency crowd have alleged that the [cap-and-trade] bill is going to require Americans trying to sell their homes to undergo some sort of energy inspection or meet some sort of green requirements -- 'or else,' " he wrote of the supposed requirement in the bill. "Of course, when I have heard and read this claim there isn't a provision cited, and for good reason -- it doesn't exist!" he said. William Fay, executive director of the Building Energy Efficient Codes Network -- a coalition including The Alliance to Save Energy, Duke Energy Corp. and the National Association of State Energy Officials among other organizations -- called the e-mail an "urban myth." "The bill certainly does not require a retrofit, or an energy label for an existing home," Fay said. "It does not make them a condition of sale." This fact-check is clear-cut. There's nothing in the bill that would require homeowners to retrofit their homes to meet new efficiency standards or get a government "license" before putting their home on the market. Homeowners who do want to retrofit their homes can do so voluntarily and with the help of government funding. Nonetheless, this e-mail keeps making the rounds, even though it has been debunked by PolitiFact, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org. There's plenty of debate about the overall bill, which was passed by the House in 2009 on a largely partisan vote and is stalled in the Senate. But there's no debate among the fact checkers, and we invite readers to check one of these sites before blindly forwarding such messages to others. This e-mail warrants a Pants On Fire.

pomt-01422	The cost of "health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down" the federal budget deficit.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/08/barack-obama/obama-health-care-driving-down-deficit/	Since the Affordable Care Act was first proposed, policymakers have been debating its potential effect not just on health care but on the economy as a whole. The bill effectively increases some types of spending, reduces other types and increases some taxes. President Barack Obama considers the health care legislation one of his economic success stories. "Partly because health care prices have been growing at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years, the growth in what health care costs the government is down," Obama said in a speech about the economy last week at Northwestern University. "Health care has long been the single-biggest driver of America’s future deficits. It’s been the single-biggest driver of our debt. Health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down those deficits." We wondered: Is it true that "health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down" the federal budget deficit? We found that the claim is pretty well supported. To put it simply: A few years ago, economists predicted that net federal spending on health care would get very high, very fast -- fast enough to drive the deficit out of control. Now, by contrast, they predict that net federal spending on health care will grow, but not quite as fast as originally thought, making the deficit at least a little more manageable. The projections We know that the deficit has gone down quite a bit in the past few years -- from about 10 percent as a share of GDP in 2009 to about 3 percent this year. For future projections, we turned to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which frequently publishes budget outlook reports. In 2010, the CBO said the health care legislation, as proposed, would reduce the deficit by an estimated $124 billion over a decade when compared to projections that did not include the Affordable Care Act. The CBO has since said that economic conditions have changed, making this projection less reliable; CBO still says it will likely lower the deficit, but it has not pinned down a specific dollar value. In February, the CBO produced a report outlining general budget projections for the next decade, through 2024. In that report, they said the deficit over those 10 years would be a cumulative $7.9 trillion. Then, in April, CBO revised that calculation, shrinking the cumulative deficit over the next decade to $7.6 trillion -- $286 billion smaller than before. The CBO said this shrunken projection of the deficit largely had to do with lower estimates of the cost of Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies and Medicare. Between February and April, CBO lowered estimated spending over the 10-year period for Affordable Care Act-related expenses by 15 percent and lowered estimated spending on Medicare by 1.4 percent. Of course, this is a comparison between two scenarios that both take into account the Affordable Care Act. So some of these changes might have to do with costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, but those costs wouldn’t have existed if the law hadn’t been enacted in the first place. This trend holds for the long term, too, said David Rosnick, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. Rosnick pointed us to the CBO’s 75-year projection published in 2007, which was both before the recession and before the Affordable Care Act. That year, the CBO projected that the primary deficit (that is, the deficit not counting interest payments) in 2082 would be about 7.1 percent of GDP. By contrast, the 75-year budget outlook published in 2014 projects that the 2082 deficit will be around 2.4 percent -- significantly lower than previous projections. That coincides with lower projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid over the next several decades, Rosnick said. In 2007, the CBO predicted that Medicare and Medicaid spending would cost about 18.6 percent of GDP in 2082. But in 2014, the CBO predicted that Medicare, Medicaid and insurance subsidies would cost about 13.1 percent of GDP in 2082. Rosnick said the change in projected federal health care spending compared to the change in projected deficit shows that the former "is the biggest factor driving down the long-run deficits." Of course, the art of projecting deficits out to 2082 are far from exact -- that would be 21 years after Obama turns 100 -- and a lot of factors are at play. But we spoke with several budget experts who agree that health care is a major reason why CBO’s projections for future deficits are going down. Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, said that while the spending cuts known as sequestration and ending certain tax cuts for the wealthy are helping to bring down the long-term deficit projections, health care is the main driver. "The longer-term projections are now much less threatening than they were just a few years ago," he said. "The big story is that health care spending growth is now projected to be much slower than it was projected to be just a few years back." That said, there is debate among health economists over how much of the downward trend is specifically attributable to the Affordable Care Act. Mark McClellan, a former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George W. Bush, now at Brookings, said it’s unlikely the legislation itself is the main factor, since the slowdown in health care costs began before the law was enacted, and most of the cost contractions comes from areas of health care care that aren’t directly affected by the law. McClellan also noted a shorter-term concern: The main reason deficits are projected to rise over the next decade is spending on health care. CBO agrees. "The pressures stemming from an aging population, rising health care costs, and an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance would cause spending for some of the largest federal programs to increase relative to GDP," CBO said in July. Of course, we should note that the aging population would have happened independent of the Affordable Care Act, and health care costs were rising for years before the law was signed. Our ruling Obama said the cost of "health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down" the federal budget deficit. The CBO recently lowered its projection for long-term deficits and specifically cited health care costs as the main reason, though the Affordable Care Act is not necessarily the primary cause of that calculation. That said, even though projections are lower than they were years ago, health care spending is rising in the short term and will keep adding to the deficit. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-13189	Says he and his running mate "are the only candidates that do believe in free trade."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/25/gary-johnson/testing-gary-johnson-claim-he-only-candidate-favor/	Amid a presidential election that seems to grow stranger every day, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is looking to stand out the old-fashioned way: with good, clean political claims. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, appeared on UpFront with Mike Gousha, a public affairs show on WISN-TV (Channel 12), when he stopped in Milwaukee in early September. Responding to a question about how his platform might appeal to a Republican voter, Johnson rattled off a minute-long list of values ranging from honesty to low taxes to limited government. "We’re the only candidates that do believe in free trade," he told Gousha midway through, referring to his himself and his running mate, Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts. Free trade — the ability to import and export products among countries without restrictions such as taxes and tariffs — has been a hot topic this cycle. While it is an example of limited government intervention, which conservative voters tend to favor, critics say unfettered competition sends domestic jobs to countries with lower wages. The issue of trade came up in each of the three presidential debates — though Johnson’s poll numbers didn’t earn him a spot on the stage with Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. So, do Johnson and Weld stand alone in support of free trade? Trading positions Let’s start with Johnson’s own position. Over the course of the campaign, he and Weld have both said several times they’re the only candidates who believe in free trade. Specifically, they have voiced support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a far-reaching free trade deal between 12 countries that was finalized and signed by President Barack Obama in February but has yet to be voted on by Congress. John Vaught LaBeaume, a spokesman for Johnson’s campaign, referred us to a Ballotpedia overview of each candidate’s position on the TPP to support Johnson’s claim that he and Weld are the only candidates who support free trade. While a collection of quotes shows Johnson has embraced the TPP, in June, Johnson questioned whether or not he would have signed the TPP while speaking to Politico’s Glenn Thrush. "Would I have signed or implemented the Trans-Pacific Partnership?" he said in the June 6, 2016 podcast. "I've got to tell you, I think it's laden with crony capitalism." Three months later, when speaking to Gousha in Milwaukee, Johnson suggested that his view that political favors are tied in to free trade agreements is similar to that of many Americans. "The aversion that we have to these trade agreements is that they are laced with favoritism," he said. Despite the issues, Johnson says he would sign the TPP. Clinton and Trump Clinton has had her own change of heart when it comes to free trade agreements. She praised the North American Free Trade Agreement finalized during her husband’s presidency — only to criticize it while running for president herself in 2008. PolitiFact verified the switch at the time. And in 2012, she famously called the TPP "the gold standard" of trade deals while serving as Secretary of State — before flipping entirely. At a Democratic primary debate last October, she said that after absorbing new information, she determined the TPP did not meet her standards and she now opposed it. As a senator, she had the opportunity to vote on 10 free trade deals, though none as sizable as NAFTA or the TPP. She voted in favor of six. Two other deals she supported but missed the votes. The final two she voted against. PolitiFact previously broke down her votes. So, Clinton has supported such trade deals in at least some of the cases. Republican nominee Donald Trump’s position has been equally conflicting. He has floated the idea of tariffs, as PolitiFact has previously examined, which is not in line with free trade positions. In July, he railed against the TPP: "The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country — just a continuing rape of our country. It’s a harsh word, but it’s true." Much like Clinton, Trump has voiced support of free trade while criticizing current free trade deals. In the final presidential debate, he said if elected, he would support free trade deals but re-negotiate them. "We'll have more free trade than we have right now, but we have horrible deals," he said. Finally, Green Party candidate Jill Stein has a clear track record of opposing free trade agreements including the TPP and NAFTA. In 2015, she released a video called "Flush the TPP" in which she characterized the agreement as a "backroom deal" that "gives corporations more power than nations." Our rating Johnson said he and his running mate were the only candidates who support free trade. While his statement has truth to it — they are the only candidates supporting the largest free trade agreement currently on the table — Clinton and Trump say they support the idea of free trade deals if executed to their liking. Clinton supported NAFTA and in the Senate voted for several smaller trade deals. For a partially accurate statement that leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/923861a1-ca56-4194-815e-b6bc706cf015	None	Gary Johnson	None	None	None	2016-10-25T05:00:00	2016-09-04	['None']
pomt-05063	Says cuts by Gov. Rick Perry's administration left "12,000 teachers without a job."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/06/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-rick-perrys-administration-left/	In his June 8, 2012, keynote speech at the Texas Democratic Party convention, San Antonio’s mayor told the crowd that cuts to education spending harm future economic growth. "Every Texan knows that, except (Governor) Rick Perry," Julián Castro told the crowd. "His Republican administration cut $4 billion out of our public schools. That's 12,000 Texas teachers without a job." Castro’s reference to a $4 billion cut is very familiar. As we noted in an April 2012 fact check, the 2011 Legislature changed school finance formulas so schools would get $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same. Perry signed the formula changes into law. But Castro’s claim about 12,000 teachers going jobless as a result was new to us. Is he right? We’ll also look at whether it’s reasonable to hang the funding decision on Perry. Castro’s political consultant, Christian Archer, offered as backup a December 22, 2011, National Public Radio news story that begins, "School funding in Texas is in turmoil. State lawmakers slashed more than $4 billion from education this school year — one of the largest cuts in state history — and more than 12,000 teachers and support staff have been laid off." NPR education reporter Claudio Sanchez told us by email that he got the number from lobby groups representing teachers and school boards. A spokesman for one of the groups, Clay Robison at the Texas State Teachers Association, told us by email that his group drew the figure from Moak, Casey and Associates, a research and lobbying firm whose clients include school districts. Lynn Moak, a partner in the firm, told us by phone that the number was a preliminary projection based on results from the firm’s September/October 2011 survey of 60 districts. So, the 12,000 figure was not a count of how many teachers had left school employment as a result of the $4 billion reduction in formula aid. Rather, it was a projection of how many more teachers schools would have employed in 2011-12 if lawmakers had increased school aid in proportion to enrollment growth -- as past legislatures had done for decades. We sought other sources for the number of teachers left jobless. Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us by email that according to the agency’s online database, the number of full-time Texas public school teaching jobs decreased by 10,717 from the 2010-11 school year to 2011-12. School districts had 334,930 full-time teaching positions in 2010-11 and 324,213 in 2011-12. Does that mean 10,717 teachers were left without a job? Cindy Clegg, an administrator at the Texas Association of School Boards, told us by phone: "We have that many fewer teachers, but a large number of those have left the profession." A significant number of teachers retired, she said, allowing some districts to reduce budgets through attrition -- not hiring replacements. There were layoffs, but Clegg and Culbertson said TASB and TEA don’t record those numbers. Clegg emailed us a May 2012 article from the association’s HR Exchange publication, which it produces for members, indicating that retirements by Texas public school and university employees have risen steadily since 2009 and climbed steeply in 2011, according to Teacher Retirement System of Texas figures. Among the reasons cited in the article: Anticipating cuts, many school districts offered staff incentives to retire. Some teachers "voluntarily left to preserve jobs for their peers." Teachers’ job satisfaction is slumping, with bigger classes and emphasis on standardized tests among the factors. According to the article, TRS reported that for all public school/university employees, retirements from September 2010 through August 2011 were up 25 percent from the same period the year before. In the first part of the 2011-12 school year, September to January, retirements were up 28 percent over the same period a year before. We sought to learn how many of the reported 21,854 retirements in 2011 were public-school teachers. TRS director of government relations Ray Spivey told us by email that the retirement system doesn’t break down its numbers by job title. Next, we looked into whether Perry is responsible for the reduced number of teacher positions, as Castro also said. The 2011 NPR story Archer sent us quotes state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, as saying lawmakers could have softened the blow by tapping into the rainy day fund, but Perry told them not to: "The governor drew a very, very sharp line in the sand (saying) that the rainy day fund, which was specifically designed for periods of economic slowdown, would not be touched." Moak said he believed Perry’s stance was instrumental in forcing the legislature to cut into public education. "Day-to-day control" of changes to the state budget, he said, fell under Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, House Speaker Joe Straus and the chairmen of the Senate Finance and House Appropriations committees. "And they certainly don’t operate as part of the Perry administration, if you will, to use (Castro’s) words," he said. "What Perry was instrumental in doing, I believe, he played a greater role in limiting access by the Legislature to the rainy day fund," Moak said. "And once that became clear, that the House with very much Perry’s support was not going to consider above an emergency level of funds from the rainy day fund, the Lege had a limited series of choices as to where it’d make funding cuts." An Austin American-Statesman news article published June 19, 2011, in the wake of the state budget passing into law, opens: "GOP legislators didn't budge this session from their commitment to reduce Texas' education spending even in the face of protests, negative ad campaigns and reams of criticism." Perry reinforced the pressure to make deep budget cuts, the story said. For his part, the governor was quoted in a March 9, 2011, Statesman news story as saying that local administrators and school boards, not state government, would be laying off the teachers. "The lieutenant governor, the speaker, their colleagues aren't going to hire or fire one teacher, as best I can tell," Perry said. "Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees added to school rolls," Perry said, a statement we later rated Mostly True. "So are the administrators and the school boards going to make a decision to reduce those, or are they going to make a decision to reduce the number of teachers in the classroom? I certainly know where I would point." Culbertson gave a similar answer when we asked if TEA could provide context on how staffing has changed because of state budget decisions: "Hiring and personnel decisions are a local issue," she said. Our ruling Castro’s reference to 12,000 unemployed teachers is based on an out-of-date, what-if projection -- not actual job losses. Still, school districts shed nearly 11,000 teaching positions in the first school year affected by the $4 billion cut signed into law by Perry. And while it’s uncertain how many of the eliminated positions resulted in unemployed teachers -- retirements also came into play -- it seems reasonable to speculate that many teachers were left jobless. Without more precise information, this statement rates Half True.	None	Julián Castro	None	None	None	2012-07-06T16:11:09	2012-06-08	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-04190	"The Agriculture Department estimates that roughly 42 percent of the corn crop will be used to make ethanol -- more than the amount of corn used to feed livestock and poultry in the United States."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/dec/10/bob-goodlatte/rep-bob-goodlatte-says-more-corn-goes-making-ethan/	With much of the nation experiencing drought, U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says the livestock industry needs relief from federal rules that siphon potential animal feed into ethanol production. Goodlatte, R-6th, was irked by by the Environmental Protection Agency’s refusal last month to ease the Renewable Fuel Standard that mandates minimum levels of the nation’s fuel supply that must come from ethanol. The standard, he said, has shifted an increasing share of the corn crop into fuel production. "In 2012 alone, the Agriculture Department estimates that roughly 42 percent of the corn crop will be used to make ethanol -- more than the amount of corn used to feed livestock and poultry in the United States," Goodlatte said in a Nov. 23 news release. Goodlatte said the standard has contributed to a sharp rise in the price of corn -- it went for $6.95 a bushel this October compared to $4.32 a bushel in October 2010 -- and has tightened supplies of livestock feed. We wondered if more corn really is being used to manufacture ethanol than to feed livestock. Beth Breeding, a spokeswoman for Goodlatte, pointed us to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It estimates a yield of 10.7 billion corn bushels for the market year that runs from Sept. 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013. The Department projects that 4.15 billion bushels -- or 38.7 percent of the crop -- will go to "feed and residual use." The amount of corn going for towards ethanol production is projected to be 4.5 billion bushels -- or roughly 42 percent of the crop. Agricultural economists told us there’s no doubt that the percentage of corn for ethanol has been on the rise, driven by renewable fuel standards first adopted in 2005 and expanded in 2007. Under those guidelines, most types of gas are blended with about 10 percent of corn-based ethanol. But there’s a key point to consider: Not all of the 42 percent of the corn crop sent to ethanol plants for production ends up as fuel. "That’s what I call a gross number," said Wallace Tyner, an agricultural economics professor at Purdue University. "That’s what goes into the ethanol plant, but a third of that comes out of the ethanol plant as ethanol feed called distillers dried grains with solubles." About two-thirds of a corn kernel is starch, which is removed at plants to make ethanol. The remaining portion has protein-rich compound of distillers grains and solubles, which is sold as livestock feed. Tyner said when taking into account that livestock feed yield, about 27 percent of the nation’s corn crop is going to produce ethanol. Using the gross number, he said, is "misleading." Estimates vary on the net amount of the corn crop that goes to ethanol after taking into account the distillers grains bi-product. Richard Wisner, a professor emeritus of agricultural economics at Iowa State University, estimated that when that after taking into account that bi-product, about 32 percent of the 2012-2013 crop is projected to go to ethanol. Using the gross figures as Goodlatte did is a common way of looking at how much corn is used for ethanol, said Wisner, a biofuels economist at the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center that’s partly funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Still, Wisner said, the net figure of 32 percent is a "more realistic" gauge of the how much corn is going to ethanol. Our ruling Goodlatte said 42 percent of the nation’s corn crop is being used to manufacture ethanol, more than the amount of corn used to feed livestock. Goodlatte’s statement is based on commonly cited raw figures from the agriculture department. But the tallies don’t take into account that a portion of the corn used in ethanol production still ends up in feed troughs as dried distiller’s grains. When that corn byproduct is taken into account, contrary to Goodlatte’s claim, the amount used for feed easily outpaces the amount that ends up as ethanol. So Goodlatte’s statement is based on accurate raw numbers, but omits key information that disproves his conclusion that more corn goes to ethanol than livestock feed. On the whole, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2012-12-10T12:35:19	2012-11-23	['United_States']
pomt-12717	Says HB2 has hurt North Carolina’s economy by "one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/mar/07/dan-forest/hb2-has-cost-north-carolina-hundreds-millions-doll/	The boycotts of North Carolina by businesses, musicians, sports leagues and others have led to national headlines and outrage from opponents of the law that spurred the backlash. House Bill 2, or HB2 as it’s more commonly known, has been creating economic backlash against North Carolina for nearly a year now. The controversial law was the first (and so far, only) in the nation to say that transgender people can’t use the bathrooms or locker rooms of the gender with which they identify in government facilities like schools or parks. It also continued North Carolina’s policy of not giving people protection from anti-LGBT discrimination and banned any city or county from extending local nondiscrimination rules. It also banned local governments from enacting rules related to issues like the minimum wage or paid family leave. North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest spoke in Texas at a press conference Monday in support of a bill similar to HB2 that’s under consideration there. Forest said the backlash is worth it to protect people’s privacy and safety in bathrooms. And, he said, the backlash hasn’t even been that big in the grand scheme of things: That despite the steady stream of boycotts and cancellations, North Carolina’s economy has barely been harmed by HB2. "If you look at the most extreme instances of economic impact, by the media and by the universities and the people who come out and say ‘This is the impact,’ that most extreme impact equates to one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP," Forest said. We have seen instances of politicians trying to deflect or whitewash the effects of HB2 – we gave former Gov. Pat McCrory a Pants On Fire ruling for a ludicrous claim he made about a high-profile Bruce Springsteen concert cancellation – so we wanted to look into this most recent claim by Forest. NC by the numbers It could be that Forest has been reading some of our previous coverage of HB2. His claim is exactly what we reported in October, in a fact-check of McCrory’s top economic official. At that time, former Commerce Secretary John Skvarla had said that HB2 hadn’t had "one iota" of a negative effect on North Carolina’s economy. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Our research, plus interviews with economists and analysis of other studies, has shown HB2 probably cost the state between $450 million and $630 million. Others have cited a $500 million loss. The law has also cost North Carolina a minimum of 1,400 jobs. "North Carolina’s GDP is around $510 billion," we wrote at the time. "So even a $500 million loss would only represent 0.1 percent of that." That’s exactly what Forest said Monday. (For the mathematically-challenged out there, 0.1 percent is the same thing as one-tenth of 1 percent.) GDP means gross domestic product. When states are concerned it’s sometimes called GSP for gross state product. It counts a combination of consumer spending, government spending and other measures of economic output. In recent months, there haven’t been many major new boycotts or cancellations – or at least, none that have been publicly verified. The NCAA could soon pull years’ worth of championship events out of North Carolina, costing the state millions more, but that hasn’t happened yet. And even if there have been hundreds of millions more in losses that we don’t know about yet, that still wouldn’t change the truth of Forest’s claim. Whether North Carolina has lost $500 million, $600 million or even $1 billion, that’s still just a small fraction of the state’s overall economy. For that same reason that Skvarla’s argument didn’t really hold up, Forest’s is accurate: North Carolina’s economy has indeed been harmed by HB2. But the economy as a whole is large enough that it would take some serious losses to add up to even a 1 percent loss. North Carolina has the country’s ninth-largest population and 10th-largest economy. The state’s GDP was the nation’s fastest-growing several years ago, we found in a fact-check of a True claim McCrory made last year. But it was slowing down by the end of McCrory’s time in office, and in 2015 North Carolina’s GDP growth was below the national average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Other economic factors at play Forest made a number of other economic claims about North Carolina’s job growth, unemployment rate and budget surpluses. Some were more accurate than others. For a more detailed explanation, see this roundup of other claims Forest made Monday. Forest also cited several magazines or other groups that have rated North Carolina a good place to do business, even despite the headlines and headaches HB2 has created. He’s right about that, too. As we noted last year: "And even after HB2 passed and the backlash became apparent, CNBC rated North Carolina the fifth-best state for business. And the trade publication Site Selection Magazine ranked North Carolina and Texas as tied for the title of "most competitive state." Our ruling Forest said HB2’s economic harm to North Carolina has amounted to only "one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP." He’s right. While $500 million in economic losses (not to mention at least 1,400 jobs lost) is not insignificant, the state’s overall economy is large enough that the losses are only about 0.1 percent of the total GDP.

pomt-02379	"The majority support (raising) the minimum wage."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/16/katrina-vanden-heuvel/do-most-americans-favor-hike-minimum-wage/	Call it the Democrats’ midterm disease. The voters who come out in presidential elections and help them win the White House tend to stay home in the off-years. Last week’s loss in Florida showed clear symptoms of the party’s affliction and whether Democrats can do much about it was batted about by the pundits on the Sunday talk shows. Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of the liberal magazine The Nation, argued that Democrats should take advantage of what she called a populist moment. "The majority support (raising) the minimum wage," vanden Heuvel said on ABC’s This Week. "More fairness, taking on a rigged system that's working against working people." We wanted to review the polls to see where the electorate stands. As a matter of simple support, plenty of opinion surveys back up vanden Heuvel’s claim. The latest results from a Bloomberg poll show 69 percent of the public supports raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour over the next three years. ABC News and the Washington Post asked if a candidate’s support for raising the minimum wage would make you more likely to vote for him or her. Half of all voters said they would be more likely to vote for that candidate. Only about a fifth said they would be less likely; most of the remainder said it would make no difference in their decision. A CBS/New York Times poll in February found 65 percent of the public favored raising the minimum wage to $10.10. So people largely support increasing the minimum wage, polls show. But polls also suggest that it’s not necessarily a high priority. A February Gallup poll found just 2 percent of respondents said wages were the most important issue facing the country. The gap between rich and poor, another Democratic theme, also came in at 2 percent. What voters cared most about in that survey, 23 percent of them, were jobs and cutting unemployment. That’s obviously connected to whether Americans have enough money to get by, but it isn’t the same as supporting a raise in the minimum wage. A Quinnipiac University poll in January had very similar results. In an open-ended question about the nation’s top priority for 2014, 1 percent of respondents mentioned the minimum wage, while 16 percent said jobs and unemployment, 15 percent said the economy in general, and 18 percent said health care. With jobs and the economy ranked so high, the latest findings from ABC News/Washington Post polling show the public equally divided on which party they trust to handle the economy. About 40 percent give the nod to the Democrats and 40 percent to the Republicans. Our ruling Vanden Heuvel said most Americans support raising the minimum wage. The polls confirm it. About two-thirds of the public consistently say boosting the minimum wage to $10.10 is a good idea and as many as a half of all voters say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who backs that increase. But how much a candidate’s position on the minimum wage matters in the polling booth is much less clear. The minimum wage is not top of mind except for a small fraction of voters. Still, vanden Heuvel's specific claim is accurate. We rate the statement True.	None	Katrina vanden Heuvel	None	None	None	2014-03-16T17:33:01	2014-03-16	['None']
pomt-04347	Says Chris Christie was "behind" in the polls against Jon Corzine during the 2009 governor's race.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/24/joseph-kyrillos/chris-christie-was-trailing-jon-corzine-polls-duri/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos has much in common with his Republican governor, but when it comes to polling against a Democratic incumbent in a statewide race, Kyrillos is no Chris Christie. Trailing Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez by double-digits in recent polls, Kyrillos recently argued that Christie also was behind in the polls against Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine during their 2009 matchup. "Public polls had, had, had Chris behind as well, and, and I know that they’re close because I’m with people each and every day," Kyrillos, a state senator, said during an Oct. 15 campaign stop with Christie. But most of the polls leading up to the 2009 election indicated that the race was roughly even between Christie and Corzine. Christie was leading in some polls and Corzine led in others, but those leads were typically minimal and fell within the polls’ margins of error. That’s very different from how Menendez has been outperforming Kyrillos in polls as the two prepare for the Nov. 6 election. In a statement, Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, told us: "This is silly. Fact: public polls had Christie behind. That is what Kyrillos said. Your opinion that he wasn't behind enough does not change the fact that polls had Christie behind." Let’s break down those poll figures. To analyze Kyrillos’ claim, PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed the results of 15 polls released between September 2009 and November 2009. In five of those polls, Corzine held leads within the margins of error, and Christie’s leads were within the margins of error in four polls. Another poll had them tied. Christie held leads greater than the sampling errors in four polls, and Corzine had such a lead in one poll. As the polls indicate, Christie held significant leads over Corzine in early September, but the race became much tighter in its final weeks. Chris Daggett, an independent candidate for governor, trailed Christie and Corzine by wide margins in each poll. By mid-October, Christie’s lead had shrunk to 1 percent among likely voters, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Oct. 14. With the same margin of error, Corzine took a five-point lead among likely voters in a Quinnipiac poll released on Oct. 28. But less than a week later, Christie was beating Corzine by 2 percent among likely voters in another Quinnipiac poll, with a sampling error of 2.5 percent. Polls conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute also presented a close race. A poll released on Oct. 20 had Christie and Corzine in a dead heat at 39 percent each among likely voters. In two subsequent Monmouth polls, Christie held a slight lead among likely voters in the first and Corzine had a minimal lead in the second, but both leads fell within the polls’ margins of error. Polls conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind put Corzine ahead of Christie going into the election, but Corzine’s leads still fell within the polls’ margins of error. For example, in PublicMind polls released on Oct. 6 and Oct. 30, Corzine held a 1-point lead over Christie among likely voters, 44 percent to 43 percent, but the margins of error were 4 percent each time. The chart below outlines how Corzine and Christie performed among likely voters in those 15 polls. The ten polls listed in bold represent cases where the candidates’ leads were within the margins of error or they were tied. Poll Release Date Jon Corzine Chris Christie Difference Margin of Error Quinnipiac 9/1/2009 37% 47% 10% 2.4% Quinnipiac 9/30/2009 39% 43% 4% 2.8% Quinnipiac 10/14/2009 40% 41% 1% 2.8% Quinnipiac 10/28/2009 43% 38% 5% 2.8% Quinnipiac 11/2/2009 40% 42% 2% 2.5% Monmouth 9/13/2009 39% 47% 8% 4.3% Monmouth 10/1/2009 40% 43% 3% 4.3% Monmouth 10/20/2009 39% 39% 0% 3.1% Monmouth 11/1/2009 42% 43% 1% 3% Monmouth 11/2/2009 43% 41% 2% 3.7% FDU PublicMind 9/1/2009 42% 47% 5% 4% FDU PublicMind 10/6/2009 44% 43% 1% 4% FDU PublicMind 10/30/2009 44% 43% 1% 4% FDU PublicMind 11/2/2009 43% 41% 2% 3% Rutgers Eagleton 10/22/2009 39% 36% 3% 4.1% So, among those 15 polls, Corzine’s lead over Christie ranged from 1 percent to 5 percent -- far from the double-digit leads held by Menendez over Kyrillos. In a Monmouth poll released on Sept. 25, 2012, 49 percent of likely voters supported Menendez, compared to 34 percent for Kyrillos. A PublicMind poll released on Sept. 20 gave Menendez a 14-point advantage over Kyrillos among likely voters, 50 percent to 36 percent. Our ruling At a recent campaign stop, Kyrillos compared his polling against Menendez to how Christie was behind Corzine in polls during the 2009 governor’s race. But while Kyrillos has been trailing Menendez by double digits, most of the polls leading up to the 2009 election suggested a close race between Christie and Corzine. When Corzine held an advantage over Christie, his leads typically fell within the polls’ margins of error. Since Christie was behind in some polls, we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13414	"Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/22/donald-trump/trumps-pants-fire-claim-blacks-are-absolutely-wors/	In his continuing efforts to court African-American voters -- a group that overwhelmingly backs Hillary Clinton -- Donald Trump took a moment at a rally in Kenansville, N.C., to reiterate his call for African-Americans to turn against the Democratic Party, arguing that the party has poorly served black Americans’ interests for decades. "Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever," Trump said. "You take a look at the inner cities. You’ve got no education. You’ve got no jobs. You get shot walking down the street." The comment quickly sparked criticism on social media, with many accusing Trump of having no sense of American history. We analyzed Trump’s comment that black American communities are "in the worst shape" ever, using history and data. We’ll note here that African-Americans continue to trail white Americans in many important quality-of-life measurements, among them economic, health and criminal justice metrics. Being better than the past is "a pretty low bar," said Bruce Levine, a historian at the University of Illinois-Champaign Urbana, who has authored books about slavery and the Civil War. Not only do African-Americans currently trail whites in many economic measures, but they "continue to face major discrimination in hiring, access to housing, mortgages, and decent schools and — as almost weekly headlines from around the country demonstrate — death, while unarmed, at the hands of police." A Trump surrogate, New York City council member Joseph Borelli, said something similar on CNN. "I don't think he's talking about the days of Jim Crow, even the days of the civil rights movement of the '60s and obviously not slavery," Borelli said. "But he's saying the African-American community is at times being outpaced by other communities." If Trump had simply pointed out the ongoing discrepancies between blacks and whites in economic, health and educational data, he would have had a point. But that’s very different from what he actually said. (His campaign didn’t respond to a request for clarification for this article.) Slavery and Jim Crow The clearest counterpoints to Trump’s statement are more than two centuries of slavery for African-Americans, followed by another century of discrimination, disenfranchisement and lynchings in the South, the region where most blacks lived at the time. "African-American communities are suffering from many social ailments, including poor schools and high unemployment, and it is important that candidates address these problems and offer specific ways of ameliorating the situation," said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian who has written numerous books on slavery and post-Civil War reconstruction. "However, it is absurd to say they are in the worst shape they've ever been. Putting slavery aside, go back to the Great Depression, or the crack epidemic of the 1970s and 1980s." Herbert S. Klein, a historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who has written several books about slavery in the Western Hemisphere, agreed. "Not to say that color is not a fundamental marker today of comparative health and well-being — African-Americans are still the poorest and least healthy of the U.S. population," he said. "But it’s still much better than in previous decades." Trump "needs a history lesson — or two — desperately," added Harold Holzer, a historian at Hunter College who specializes in slavery and the Civil War. He’s also wrong for the past half century There’s solid statistical evidence that the black experience in America has been on an upward trajectory over the past half century or more. Here are some examples: • Unemployment rate Unemployment for black workers has zigzagged up and down with recessions and recoveries, just as it has for whites. But historically, the present day is a relatively strong period for black employment. In August 2016, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 8.1 percent. While that’s almost double the rate for whites -- 4.4 percent -- it’s only been this low for black Americans in 5 percent of months since 1972, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began specifically tallying monthly black unemployment. Here’s a full chart showing the unemployment rate month by month: • Poverty rate Nationally, the black poverty rate is 24.1 percent, which is much higher than the 9.1 percent percent it is for whites. But that’s still lower than it has been in the past. The annual black poverty rate never fell below 30 percent between 1966, the first year it was tracked consistently, and 1994. And it has only been lower than it is now in four previous years, starting in 1999 and ending in 2002. Here’s a chart showing the data from the late 1970s until 2014. The green line shows the rate for African-Americans. • Life expectancy Shortly after 1900, black men could expect to live from birth until their early 30s, and black women could expect to live until their mid 30s. Since then, life expectancy for African-Americans has essentially doubled. Today, a black man has a life expectancy from birth in the low 70s, and for black women it’s the high 70s. Here is a chart from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing life expectancy trends from 1900 to 2000. It shows that whites have outpaced blacks in expanded lifespan, but it also shows that both whites and blacks have risen substantially: And here are the figures from 1970 to 2013, showing a similar pattern. • Educational attainment African-American graduation rates from high school and college have risen over time. The following chart shows black rates of high school graduation (the top lines) and black rates of college graduation (the bottom lines). Both have been climbing since the mid 1970s, when the data series began. • Crime On multiple occasions, Trump has said that crime is rising. There is evidence of an uptick for 2015 and 2016 -- neither of which is a year with final federal data available -- at least in certain cities, such as Chicago and Baltimore. But as we have previously noted, the homicide rate and the violent crime rate have fallen to such an extent over the past quarter century -- both in big cities and in the country at large -- that it would take many years of significant increases to return to the "record levels" of the early 1990s. African-Americans have also experienced a drop-off in the incidence of being a crime victim, at least through 2014, the last year final data is available. In 2005, for instance, 32.7 per 1,000 African-Americans age 12 and older were the victim of a violent crime. In 2013, that fell to 25.1, and by 2014, it had fallen further, to 22.5. Rates peaked in the early 1980s at nearly 40 per 1,000. Our ruling Trump said, "Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever." Trump’s emphatic statement lacked any nuance. There is no comparison between the situation today and slavery, or the situation today and the Jim Crow era. Meanwhile, over the past half-century, African-Americans, despite consistently trailing whites, have made significant strides in life expectancy, educational attainment and other measures, and currently have unemployment and poverty rates that are near historical lows.

pomt-06236	"Eighty percent of the net new jobs created in the state of Texas since 2009 went to the foreign-born."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/02/david-frum/david-frum-says-foreign-born-individuals-filled-80/	Commentator David Frum, exploring the state of his Republican Party, recently wrote that disaffected white voters have "been plunged into a mood of pessimism and anger since 2008." One reason is that U.S. employers lately prefer foreign-born workers, Frum said in his Nov. 29, 2011, New York magazine article titled "When did the GOP lose touch with reality?" Adding a Texas touch, Frum said: "Eighty percent of the net new jobs created in the state of Texas since 2009 went to the foreign-born." That many? We were curious. On Frum’s behalf, Noah Kristula-Green, managing editor of the online FrumForum, told us that he relied on a September 2011 memo posted by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports reducing illegal immigration. That memo, drawing on information gathered by the Current Population Survey taken by the U.S. Census Bureau, states that 81 percent of the jobs created in Texas since 2007 — not 2009, as Frum writes — "were taken by newly arrived immigrants (legal and illegal)." By email, Frum told us that his two-year misstatement was a typo. And how did the center come to its estimate of immigrants filling new Texas jobs? The memo says that total Texas employment increased by 279,000 between the second quarter of 2007, right before the national recession began, and the second quarter of 2011, the most recent quarter for which data were available. And, it says, answers to the surveys taken by the Census Bureau suggest that immigrants who arrived in the United States in 2007 or later filled 225,000 of the gained jobs. The memo estimates that half of those 225,000 newly arrived immigrants were in Texas illegally — a conclusion traced in part to assuming illegal residents are disproportionately young, male, unmarried, younger than 40 and have little schooling. It says too that, over all, 40 percent of the jobs gained in Texas over the four years went to recent legal immigrants with 40 percent filled by illegal immigrants. Generally, the memo says, this "means that in Texas — one of the few states that experienced job growth after 2007 — native-born workers benefited little from this growth." Then again, as noted by PolitiFact in an October 2011 fact check considering the memo, the center’s researcher, Steve Camarota, presented calculations using two sets of numbers. The one that Frum relied upon solely took into account immigrants who recently came to the state. Another calculation took that tally and subtracted immigrant departures and deaths--concluding that the net increase in 150,000 immigrant workers over the four years equaled 53.6 percent of the overall growth of 279,000 jobs. Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, an independent research organization, separately told PolitiFact that there are "lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes." In October 2011, the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation issued a paper critical of the center’s analysis. Author Chuck DeVore conceded that Texas saw a net job gain of 279,000 in the period. But, DeVore said, there’s no statistical way to conclude how many of the jobs were taken by immigrants. Among his points: The number of Texas jobs churned considerably over the four years, with employees shifting positions as well. Before DeVore’s critique surfaced, the Dallas Morning News quoted Pia Orrenius, an economist and immigration expert at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, calling the methodology behind the 81 percent figure "misleading." Orrenius was quoted as saying the center’s second methodology — the one suggesting that 54 percent of gained jobs were filled by immigrants — was more reliable and also "typical for the nation." Mark Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies' executive director, told PolitiFact that regardless of methodological preferences, "immigrants still got a disproportionate share of new jobs" in Texas. In our follow-up, Camarota stood by his work. Our ruling Aside from having the wrong starting date for the studied period, Frum’s statement relies on a methodology that isolated immigrants recently arrived in Texas, disregarding immigrant departures and deaths and leaving the 80 percent figure in question. Then again, no one has disputed that recent immigrants filled a surprising share (more than half) of the added jobs. We rate Frum’s claim Half True.

pomt-06940	"[L]ess than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered" in a referendum to levy a 1-cent sales tax.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/20/mike-bodker/johns-creek-mayor-says-transportation-vote-covers-/	Persuading voters to back next year’s tax referendum to help unclog the region’s roadways may be tough. Divvying up the cash is no cakewalk, either. Area leaders have asked for billions of dollars in transportation projects they think the region needs, but the proposed 1-cent sales tax can’t pay for all of them. In fact, it won’t even cover most of them, Johns Creek Mayor Mike Bodker said. "Let's keep in mind that less than one-tenth of Atlanta's transportation needs are covered in this referendum," Bodker told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a recent news story. Less than one-tenth? But won’t the tax rake in billions of dollars? Before we address Bodker’s claim, let’s take a quick detour into the complex realm of transportation planning. Since the effects of a single project can cross city and county boundaries, much of the region’s transportation planning is handled by the Atlanta Regional Commission. The planning body helps area governments with issues that need regional coordination, such as clean air, water and aging. As part of its duties, the ARC drafted Plan 2040, which maps out transportation, land use, environmental, economic, housing and human service strategies covering the 18-county area for the next 30 years. Plan 2040 estimates what the region needs, what it will cost and how much it can afford. It found that the region needs about $126 billion in transportation projects. It can probably pay for about $60.9 billion, according to a Plan 2040 report. As the ARC formed transportation plans for metro Atlanta, state legislators worked to find ways to fund needs across Georgia. Their efforts resulted in the 2010 passage of the Transportation Investment Act. This legislation created special regional transportation tax districts across the state, including one in metro Atlanta. This district includes 10 counties: Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. A roundtable made up of Atlanta-area elected officials must come up with a list of projects for the taxing district that can be completed with money from a 1-cent sales tax. If voters back the tax in a 2012 referendum, it gets levied and construction begins. Atlanta-area jurisdictions have submitted $22.9 billion in eligible projects they would like to see funded by the referendum. The roundtable is trying to cut the list down to an affordable level. This brings us back to Bodker. As mayor of Johns Creek, he thinks the referendum has a better chance at success if leaders promise to use the money to build road projects. We asked Bodker how he determined that the upcoming referendum would cover "less than one-tenth" of the region’s transportation needs. Bodker was talking about money, he told us. To get the "one-tenth" figure, he compared the amount of revenue the tax is expected to raise with the estimated cost of building the projects metro Atlanta needs. Through Plan 2040, regional planners calculated all the projects the area needs would cost some $120 billion, but the referendum is estimated to bring in only $7.2 billion, Bodker said. That’s less than 10 percent. The federal government will likely match some of the money metro Atlanta raises from its tax, boosting the amount of transportation projects the region can afford. Still, most of the region’s needs will remain unmet. We checked Bodker’s figures with those from the ARC, and they are very close. But there’s one small hitch. A state economist determined that, depending on economic conditions, the 1-cent sales tax could raise between $6.8 billion and $7.2 billion in 2011 dollars, according to ARC documents. Since the current Plan 2040 draft says the region needs $126 billion in projects, the potential tax revenue does amount to "less than one-tenth" of the need, as Bodker said. Furthermore, projects that make the roundtable list will receive only an estimated $6.1 billion of the tax revenue, an ARC spokeswoman said. The remainder will go to localities. The $6.1 billion figure is also less than 10 percent of the regional need. The hitch is that Plan 2040’s cost estimate defines the Atlanta region as an 18-county area. The state Legislature designed the planned referendum to cover a smaller, 10-county region. Determining how much of the $120 billion would address needs for the smaller 10-county region is problematic because major projects can affect traffic in multiple counties. That said, this quirk does not render Bodker’s statement inaccurate. It may have been more precise for him to say that the 10-county referendum funds less than 10 percent of the 18-county region’s needs, but we think it’s safe to say your average voter doesn’t parse regional definitions this closely. We therefore rule Bodker’s statement True.	None	Mike Bodker	None	None	None	2011-07-20T06:00:00	2011-06-16	['None']
pomt-02428	Says 21 million people "still suffer slavery today."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/03/steve-mcqueen/director-steve-mcqueen-dedicated-his-oscar-21-mill/	The 86th Academy Awards featured the expected red-carpet pageantry, a few surprise winners, a "selfie" that went viral and a mid-show pizza party, courtesy of host Ellen Degeneres. But it wasn’t until the end of the three-and-a-half hour affair that viewers finally learned this year’s pick for best picture. The award went to 12 Years a Slave, the powerful true story of a black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South during the mid-1800s. In accepting the award, director Steve McQueen delivered an emotional tribute. "Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live. This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup," McQueen said. "I dedicate this award to all the people who have endured slavery. And the 21 million people who still suffer slavery today." Because we’re PunditFact, we can’t even watch the Oscars without our ears perking up at such a statistic, especially when millions of people potentially heard it, too. So we decided to put McQueen’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. Modern slavery is often referred to today as "forced labor" or sometimes "trafficking in persons." It’s not as easily defined as the slave trade of the antebellum American South, nor is it simple to identify victims. The United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines trafficking in persons two ways. There is sex trafficking "in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age." Then there’s a more general category: "the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery." There are many different examples of modern slavery worldwide. The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, looks for 11 indicators to identify forced labor: Abuse of vulnerability Deception Restriction of movement Isolation Physical and sexual violence Intimidation and threats Retention of identity documents Withholding of wages Debt bondage Abusive working and living conditions Excessive overtime. Estimates on modern slavery vary because victims are difficult to identify and do not often come forward. The United Nation’s International Labor Organization believes the best way to get statistics on slavery is through national surveys, but so far "only a handful of countries have undertaken special surveys on this topic." As a result "the practice is extremely difficult to research and quantify as it is most often hidden and out-of-sight of law enforcement." Because of this, only 46,570 victims were formally documented by law enforcement agencies internationally in 2012, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report. Still, overall estimates exist. The International Labor Organization estimated in June 2012 that 20.9 million individuals were in forced labor. This included 15.4 million adults and 5.5 million children. About 55 percent are women or girls. By far, the most common purveyor of forced labor is in Asia, where 11.7 million are in slave-like conditions. Africa is second at 3.7 million. Labor exploitation is most common worldwide with 14.2 million forced laborers, while 4.5 million are exploited for sex. State-enforced labor entraps 2.2 million, the group estimated. The organization has changed how it calculates the figure. As recently as 2005, the estimate for forced laborers was much smaller, at 12 million people, so identifying trends is not possible using their data. Other organizations, however, have estimated that the figure is much higher. Luis CdeBaca, the Ambassador-at-Large in the Office To Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, testified to Congress in 2013 that there were "up to 27 million people living in slavery." A State Department spokesman told us that language was agreed to after consulting with industry experts. The Walk Free Foundation, an international organization committed to ending modern slavery, estimates the figure at between 28.3 million and 31.3 million in its Global Slavery Index.

pomt-06919	Says Wisconsin Senate recall candidate Jessica King "voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/22/randy-hopper/wisconsin-gop-state-sen-randy-hopper-says-democrat/	Jessica King was a part of the first graduating class of Emerge Wisconsin, which touts itself as the premier program for training Democratic women to run for office. She was elected to the Oshkosh Common Council in 2007, even before completing the training. In 2008, King ran for an open seat in the state Senate, but lost to Republican Randy Hopper of Fond du Lac. After a recount, the margin was 163 votes out of more than 83,000 cast. When Hopper became one of the Republican senators targeted for recall for his support of GOP Gov. Scott Walker, King entered the race, creating a rematch. Hopper dismissed King as having a "liberal tax-and-spend agenda" and has since sharpened his attack ahead of the Aug. 9, 2011 election. A Hopper TV ad released July 15, 2011 begins by praising his own work as a lawmaker. Then, as background music turns ominous, the narrator says: "When you see Jessica King’s negative attacks, remember 63. King opposed balancing the state budget and voted to increase her pay with taxpayer dollars by 63 percent. Raising your pay by 63? Does Jessica King really care about you and me?" A politician voting herself a 63 percent pay raise during tough economic times? That’s worth a look. Asked for evidence to back the attack, Hopper campaign spokesman Sean Stephenson cited the 2009 and 2010 and Oshkosh city budgets. They show the pay appropriated for the seven council members -- the mayor and six aldermen -- totaled $17,400 in 2008 and had risen to $28,500 in 2010. That’s an increase of 63.8 percent. But that doesn’t break down how much of a raise King might have received, nor whether she voted for it. So we went back to Stephenson, who stood by the 63 percent claim. He said the proof King voted for the raise was that she voted for the 2009 and 2010 city budgets. King campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris pointed instead to a vote on a pay raise ordinance the Oshkosh council took April 8, 2008. The ordinance and official minutes from that meeting show the council voted, 4-3, to double the mayor’s salary to $6,000 and boost the salary of each of the six council members from $2,400 to $3,750, or 56 percent. King voted no on the raises, saying salaries should be reviewed by a citizen committee. Oshkosh City Manager Mark Rohloff said the council members’ pay can be raised only through an ordinance such as the pay ordinance King voted against. City budgets cannot authorize pay raises for elected officials; they only carry out what has been legally authorized by an earlier pay ordinance, he said. One more point before we close: By law, elected officials cannot directly vote themselves pay raises. Any raises that they adopt can’t take effect for a particular office until after that office comes up for election again. The Oshkosh raises took effect in April 2009, a year after the council adopted the pay ordinance. So, although King voted against the raises, she did receive the 56 percent raise herself after being re-elected in 2009. Let’s get back to the claim. In a TV ad, Hopper said King voted to increase her pay on the Oshkosh Common Council by 63 percent. It’s ridiculous to claim King voted for the raise, given that she voted against the ordinance that raised the pay -- which is the only legal way council pay can be raised. And Hopper’s claim of 63 percent itself is false, given that the correct raise figure is a somewhat lower 56 percent. Ridiculous and false. Around here, that’s a combustible mixture. We give Hopper’s claim a Pants on Fire.	None	Randy Hopper	None	None	None	2011-07-22T09:00:00	2011-07-20	['None']
pomt-03989	Except for Virginia, "the other 49 states keep raising their gas tax."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/11/richard-saslaw/dick-saslaw-say-except-virginia-all-states-keep-ra/	Sen. Minority Leader Richard Saslaw has spearheaded the opposition this winter to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s plan to raise transportation revenues by abolishing the state gas tax and replacing it with a sales tax increase. Saslaw, D-Fairfax, says the only way to raise ample money for roads is to increase both the sales and the gas tax. He introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have raised Virginia’s 5 percent sales tax to 6 percent. It also would have increased the state’s 17.5-cent a gallon gas excise tax by 5 cents a gallon during each of the next two years and set the levy to automatically rise at the inflation rate of construction costs. McDonnell says that the gas tax is outdated and will produce declining revenues in the future as cars become more fuel efficient. Saslaw says the problems with Virginia’s flat gas tax are that it’s not indexed to inflation and has not been increased since 1987. That’s a far cry from other states, he claims. "There’s a reason the other 49 states keep raising their gas tax," Saslaw during a Jan. 15 news conference called by the Senate Democratic Caucus to lay out its positions on key issues, including transportation. He repeated the statement at the end of the news conference. "Everybody, all the other states, raise their gas tax except Virginia," Saslaw said. "Naturally, your gas tax isn’t going to grow." When we contacted Saslaw, he said he may have misspoken. The senator said he was trying to make a point that, with few exceptions, other states have raised their gasoline excise tax since Virginia’s rate went into effect 26 years ago. "I don’t know of a state that hasn’t raised their gas tax since 1986," Saslaw told us. "Some of them, they’ve gone up quite a few times." Saslaw, who's been in the General Assembly since 1976, acknowledged he could have worded his original statement better, saying perhaps he shouldn’t have said all the other states "keep" raising their gas taxes. Most states do not routinely raise their gas taxes, we learned after consulting a September 2012 report by the Federal Highway Administration and a December 2011 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Excise gas taxes regularly increase in 14 states. That’s because they have variables in their tax rates that periodically rise with inflation or the price of gas. Of the remaining 36 states with flat rates, 25 have not increased their excise tax in 10 years of more. And 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have not raised the levy in 20 years or more. Virginia’s gas tax rate, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1987, is the second oldest in the nation. It bows only to Alaska, which implemented its 8-cent gas tax in 1970, although it was suspended for a year in 2008. Virginia’s 26-year-old tax has a peer group, however. South Carolina’s 16-cent per gallon tax went into effect in July 1987. Oklahoma’s 17 cent rate was established in May 1987. New Jersey’s 10.5-cent tax went into effect in July 1988 while Tennessee’s 20-cent levy went into effect in July 1989. Our ruling Saslaw said the 49 other states keep raising their gas tax. Twenty-five states have not raised their gas tax in a decade or more, and 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have gone at least two decades without an increase. Saslaw offers no proof for his claim and acknowledges he may have misspoken. His statement is wrong, without basis and we give it our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.

pomt-02624	"During my administration, funding for education has increased by over $930 million."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/22/nathan-deal/deals-speech-jumps-gun-education-spending-increase/	Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal spent a portion of his State of the State address discussing what’s often a major issue in any election year. Education. Deal touted his accomplishments on the issue in his speech. One statistic he cited piqued our interest and that of one PolitiFact Georgia reader who asked us to do a fact check. "Since spending on education has always been the largest part of our state budget, representing over half of all spending, it was to be expected that it would be reduced during these hard times," the governor said. "However, during my administration, funding for education has increased by over $930 million." Has funding for education increased by $930 million since Deal took office? Not exactly. Before Deal took office in January 2011, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue and the state Legislature approved a fiscal year budget that included about $7 billion for its public school students. Deal amended that year’s budget, increasing education spending to about $7.1 billion. Last spring, Deal signed a fiscal year budget for a 12-month period that ends June 30 that included about $7.4 billion for education. That’s about a $400 million difference since Deal took office. Not exactly $930 million, is it? We had a theory about how the governor came up with that number. Deal has proposed increasing education spending by $547 million. That’s the greatest single budgetary year increase in seven years, Deal said. Add those numbers and the total does equal more than $930 million. That’s how they came up with the number, Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said. Deal offered some specifics about his plans for the extra money. About $200 million of that would merely fund growth in student enrollment. An additional $315 million would go to shore up local budgets, and school districts can choose raises, smaller classes, more school days or other ways to spend the money. The governor wrote in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he wants to spend an additional $10 million to redevelop the state’s standardized tests for grades three to 12. He wrote that he wants to add nearly $50 million in state general and bond funding to support high-speed broadband access for all public schools. We still wondered whether it was accurate for the governor to say education spending had risen by $930 million if this budget hasn’t been adopted. Robinson said the sentence should had been phrased differently. "There is still a legislative process," Robinson said. "The sentence could use ‘once the budget is adopted.’ " Deal has received little resistance from the Legislature over his past budget proposals. Deal is a Republican, and both chambers of the Legislature are led by the GOP. It’s likely the budget will be adopted, but it is still a proposal at this point. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the Senate president, praised Deal's proposal to pump more money into education, "rightfully our state's top priority," the AJC reported. The governor’s statement contains some elements of truth, but there is a good deal of context that must be considered here. We rate this statement as Half True.

pomt-09204	In Hawaii, "they don't have a history of throwing incumbents out of office."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/23/michael-steele/rnc-chair-michael-steele-says-republican-victory-h/	On ABC's This Week, the chairmen of the Republican and Democratic national parties debated the significance of Republican Charles Djou's victory in a Hawaii congressional special election on May 22, 2010 -- the first time a Republican will represent Hawaii in Congress since 1991. RNC Chairman Michael Steele called the victory significant, given Hawaii's penchant for supporting Democrats, and he noted that the state is the birthplace of President Barack Obama (Sorry, birthers). Of course, DNC Chairman Tim Kaine had a different read. He said Djou's victory was more about the unique circumstances of the special election -- which was called to replace the resigning Rep. Neil Abercrombie until the regular fall election -- than a political mood swing in Hawaii. The special election did not include a primary, which meant parties could field multiple candidates. Of the three main contenders, two were Democrats while Djou was the lone Republican. He won with a little under 40 percent of the overall vote. "In the November election, it will be one Democrat against one Republican, and we feel very, very confident about winning that race," Kaine said. But Steele countered, Hawaii doesn't "have a history of throwing incumbents out of office." It's an obvious fact that incumbents have an easier road to re-election than challengers. Since 1964, no less than 85 percent of incumbents have been returned to the U.S. House, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Since 1998, incumbents' re-election rate has hovered between 94 and 98 percent in the House. The numbers in the Senate are a little lower -- between 79 and 96 percent in elections since 1998. But do incumbents have an even easier time getting re-elected in America's youngest state? Since Hawaii wasn't incorporated as a state until 1959, there isn't a lot of history to examine. And since Hawaii has just four members of Congress (two senators and two members of the U.S. House), there are relatively few elections to scour. In fact, only 5 people have represented the state in the U.S. Senate: the two sitting senators, Democrats Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, and three others -- Republican Hiram Fong, Democrat Spark Matsunaga and Democrat Oren E. Long. None of them lost a re-election campaign for the Senate -- Fong and Long retired and Matsunaga died in office. Hawaii's two congressional House districts were created in 1971. Previously both seats had been elected at large. Djou will represent Hawaii's 1st District, the second Republican ever to do so. He replaces Abercrombie, a 10-term Democrat who resigned to run for governor. The state's 2nd District has never elected a Republican. Have any incumbents lost? Not really. In the 2nd District, Patsy Mink, Daniel Akaka and Ed Case all resigned or retired in order to run for another office. Mink was eventually re-elected to the U.S. House and died in office. In the 1st District, Spark Matsunaga, Cecil Heftel, Pat Saiki and Abercrombie all also resigned to run for another office. There's one asterisk. Abercrombie was first elected to Congress in 1986 in a special election just like Djou. But though he won the special election, he lost his party's primary to run for a full, two-year term on the very same day. We counted and found about 50 elections where the incumbent on Hawaii was on the ballot. The closest anyone got to losing was Abercrombie in 1986, but he wasn't actually an incumbent when he lost the Democratic primary. Depending how you count it, that puts the re-election rate in Hawaii between 98 percent and 100 percent, which is higher than the national average over the same period. Though Steele was talking about federal races, we also checked to see if an incumbent Hawaii governor ever lost a bid for re-election. It happened once since Hawaii became a state, in 1962, when Republican William Quinn lost to Democrat John Burns. Back to the statement by RNC Chairman Steele. He said Hawaiians don't have a history of throwing incumbents out of office and said that Djou's election to Congress in May means Republicans have a good shot of keeping the seat in November. While we're not in the business of predicting the outcome of House races, no incumbent has ever lost a November congressional election in Hawaii. We rate Steele's claim True.

pomt-09813	"The Obama Administration's own White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated 4.7 million Americans will lose their jobs if the (health care) bill passes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/08/john-carter/texas-lawmaker-latest-republican-say-health-bill-w/	In an argument, it's always helpful to quote your rivals when they seem to undermine their own case. That's what Republicans have been doing as they attempt to cast doubt on the Democratic push for health care reform. This summer, a number of Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators have asserted that Christina Romer, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, believes that the Democratic health plan could result in 4.7 million Americans losing their jobs. Here's a recent version of this claim, made by Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, in an Aug. 31 column on the Web site of the Christian Coalition of America: Answering his own question, "Will the Bill Cost American Jobs?" Carter writes, "No argument here either. The Obama administration's own White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated 4.7 million Americans will lose their jobs if the bill passes, as employers who cannot afford health insurance or the 8 percent payroll tax penalty will have to fire their employees, move overseas, or go out of business." But Obama's Council of Economic Advisers has not said that. Rather, the number comes from calculations made by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee, based on ideas in two papers co-authored by Romer, who was an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining the administration. Another Republican lawmaker, House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, put it more accurately when he wrote in a July 20 column, "According to methodology developed by Dr. Christina Romer, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, the government takeover would cost Americans 4.7 million jobs over the next 10 years." But since many other Republicans have cited the same numbers, we thought it would be helpful to explore whether they are accurate. We obtained a copy of the math behind the claim from the Ways and Means GOP staff and, to be honest, it's pretty complicated stuff. (Readers with a taste for econometrics can read a more detailed version here .) But despite the complexity, we think that a thorough examination of the statistic is warranted because one of the major Republican arguments against the bill is that it's a job killer. And, based on the number of Internet hits we see on the 4.7 million jobs figure, this statistic has become a key talking point for the party. (Complicating matters further, the Ways and Means Republican staff later issued a revised estimate, and the new number — as many as 5.5 million jobs lost — has begun to pop up as well, including in a national radio address by Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., on Sept. 5, 2009. However, because commentators have been using the 4.7 million jobs figure for most of the summer and continue to do so, we're mainly going to scrutinize the calculations that led to that number.) First, a little explanation of the math by the Ways and Means Republican staff. They focused on a tax in the health care bill that is informally known as "play or pay." It requires employers to either pay for health care coverage (that's the "play") for their workers or else pay a penalty equal to 8 percent of wages. The Republicans sought to estimate how many jobs would be lost from businesses being forced to cut back on expenses if this tax was implemented. In assembling their calculations, Republican staffers referred to two papers by Romer. One, from 2007 when she was a professor, was co-authored with her husband and fellow economist, David Romer. It explores how changes in tax policy affect the broader economy. The second paper, released by the Obama transition team on Jan. 9, 2009, sought to quantify how many jobs would be created by the economic stimulus package. The Ways and Means staff took two key numbers from Romer's papers, both of which are what economists call "multipliers." A multiplier is a number that shows how much of an added impact a given statistic (say, a tax increase) has on a different statistic (say, job numbers). Essentially what the GOP staffers did was to take three basic facts — the size of the health bill's tax increase, the size of the U.S. gross domestic product and the current number of jobs in the United States — and use the theory outlined in Romer's papers, including the multipliers she came up with, to figure out how many jobs the tax hike threatened to eliminate. When we talked to independent economic experts and the White House, we didn't hear a lot of complaints about the multipliers chosen by the Ways and Means staff. But we did hear a range of other concerns: — The size of the tax increase in the health bill. The figure used in the Republican calculation was $300 billion over 10 years. But a July 14 estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pegged it at $163 billion. The Ways and Means Republican staff did use the $163 billion in its second set of calculations, but because the $300 billion figure was built into the math that led to the 4.7 million jobs number, we're focusing on that number here. Simply put, using the $300 billion figure for the tax hit, rather than the $163 billion figure, inflates the job-loss number cited by Carter and others. — An expanded exemption for small businesses. On July 31, 2009, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adopted an amendment to the House health care bill (H.R. 3200) to make more small businesses exempt from the "play or pay" provision. In the original bill, companies with payrolls smaller than $250,000 annually were to be exempt. The amendment made the cutoff level $500,000. There's no guarantee that this provision will make it into the final bill, and even if it does, the CBO has not estimated the impact. But if the new limit becomes law, it seems likely that the size of the tax hit will go down — another factor that would decrease the Republican estimate of 4.7 million lost jobs. — What's the purpose of the tax hike? Romer's 2007 paper takes pains to distinguish between two types of tax policy changes. One type accompanies significant increases in spending — perhaps, as Romer suggests, to combat a recession, to fund a war or to foot the bill for a new social insurance program. These tax changes tend to balance out the other major changes going on in the economy, she argues, and they tend to keep economic growth on an even keel. The other kind of tax changes are undertaken either to reduce the deficit or to spur long-term growth, in the absence of economic emergencies or major expansions in government programs. This distinction becomes relevant for the Republicans' calculation because Romer concludes that the broader economic effects of the first type of tax changes are harder to identify because more factors are changing at the same time. For this reason her paper focuses primarily on the second type of tax changes, which she found to have much more reliable and measurable impacts on the economy. But the tax increases studied by Ways and Means accompany a major expansion in social insurance, meaning that by Romer's own definition, this scenario is not a good candidate for reliable calculations under her formula. Republican economists dismiss those complaints, saying her approach works equally well in a deficit-reduction scenario as when a new program is being created. — Ten years vs. one year . Our biggest concern about the Republican estimate is a math assumption that could make the jobs estimate off by a factor of 10. In the Ways and Means calculation, the Republican staff determined the tax increase's size as a percentage of GDP — a necessary step in the calculation — by dividing the total tax increase over 10 years ($300 billion by their count) by the U.S. GDP in a single year ($14.047 trillion, the CBO's projection for 2009). This struck us as odd, since one would think that a tax increase spread out over 10 years should be divided by GDP over 10 years. Other economists agreed with us. The Ways and Means staff told us that Romer did it that way in her papers, but the White House told PolitiFact that Romer's papers did not make calculations in which 10 years' worth of taxes were divided by one year's worth of GDP. Economists outside the White House told us they found several indications in her writings to back up the White House's assertion. This question is important because dividing by one year's GDP rather than 10 makes the scale of the expected job losses 10 times bigger. Not 10 percent bigger — 10 times bigger. That's enough to skew the entire results. We recalculated the original Ways and Means formula — this time dividing by 10 years' worth of GDP and using the smaller CBO estimate of the size of the tax hit — and came up with job losses totaling 193,946, far less than 4.7 million. We also took the suggestion of J.D. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and divided the 10th year tax hit by that year's estimated GDP. Using this calculation, we came up with 323,980 jobs lost over 10 years. That's a higher number than our first attempt, but still less than one-tenth of what the GOP Ways and Means staff estimated. It should be emphasized that any calculation of this sort is just an estimate, and a rough one at that. For instance, several factors not included in Romer's calculation could either push the job loss number higher or lower. Republicans say the bill as written will create higher deficits, which they predict will increase the pressure on lawmakers to eventually raise taxes beyond what is currently envisioned in the bill. Those tax increases, which are not captured by the Romer formula, could increase job losses in future years. So, assuming big deficits far into the future, it's possible that the number of jobs lost due to the passage of health care reform would rise to something approaching, or even exceeding, 4.7 million. And Republicans are free to make that case. But if Rep. Carter is using Romer's handiwork to make the argument, he has an obligation to cite her work fairly. And it is a significant distortion to say that her Council of Economic Advisers made such an estimate. That by itself is enough for us to find his claim False. But the case doesn't get much stronger when they use the Republican interpretations of Romer's work. The number initially calculated by Ways and Means Republicans overstated the size of the tax hit which in turn would exaggerate the number of jobs lost. The number ignored an amendment that could end up further shrinking the size of the tax hit. It invoked Romer's position even as it contradicted her view of whether her formula was legitimate to use in this situation. And most importantly, it used a calculation that increased the scale of job losses by a factor of 10. So we find Rep. Carter's claim to be a major distortion, not just because of the questionable math he based it on, but because he distorted who said it. We find his statement False.

pomt-14740	"The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration’s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year."	false	/texas/statements/2015/dec/17/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-clean-power-plan-will-raise-texas/	U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been frequent sparring partners. In a Dec. 6, 2015 oped column, Smith, R-San Antonio, took to the San Antonio Express-News to warn readers against the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. The EPA has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. It was the subject of a previous fact check. The plan is aimed at states with fossil-fuel fired electrical plants. Smith wrote: "Texans will be hit even harder than those in other states. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration’s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year." According to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, ERCOT manages 90% of the electrical load of Texas; it is a nonprofit corporation. The way the statement is phrased, it sounds as though every year energy costs in Texas will rise 16 percent. But the ERCOT report on the effects of the EPA Clean Power Plan says the increase will be over a longer period of time. Smith’s statement was based on incorrect information provided by an ERCOT official to his House Science, Space and Technology Committee. The ERCOT Oct. 16, 2015 report and an accompanying news release says that "energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone, without accounting for the associated costs of transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices caused by increased gas demand, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT Region" (ERCOT does not estimate how much these other factors might raise energy costs in their analysis). In other words, by 2030, energy costs will have risen 16 percent since the CPP took effect. So, how big is the disparity between a 16 percent increase by 2030 and a 16 percent increase each year until 2030? It helps to know when the Clean Power Plan is scheduled to come into effect. According to the EPA’s Clean Power Plan Final Rule, states with fossil fuel-fired electric generating units need to create plans that set emissions standards for those units. Vermont and the District of Columbia are exempt because they have none of the relevant units, and Alaska and Hawaii are exempt because the EPA says it lacks enough information to determine the best system of emission reduction for non-contiguous states. Plans are due in 2016 (with a possible extension to 2018), and the reduction in emissions needs to start by 2022, with extra rewards for states that also cut emissions in 2020 and 2021. If energy costs rise 16 percent each year from 2022 until 2030, that is roughly a 327 percent increase in the cost of energy. To help put this in real terms, we crunched some numbers on energy costs in Texas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey reported the average annual electricity cost per Texas household at $2,160 in 2009, the last year for which data are available, and just under 4.5 percent of the median household income in Texas that year. Adjusted for inflation, that’s about $2,394 in 2015. If the Clean Power Plan caused energy costs to increase 16 percent by 2030, that bill would rise to about $2,777 in today’s dollars. If energy costs increased 16 percent per year, though, that bill would be $7,828. The median household income in Texas was $53,035 by the last Census. The first price would mean Texans would spend around 5 percent of their yearly household income on energy, while the higher number implies energy costs would eat up closer to 15 percent of income. Smith, whose 21st Congressional District includes portions of San Antonio, Austin and the Texas Hill Country, is chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, with jurisdiction over the EPA, NOAA and NASA. A spokeswoman for his committee, Laura Crist, said in an email statement that the congressman’s claim of a 16-percent increase per year was based on communications with ERCOT staff. She noted that the ERCOT estimate is conservative and does not include costs for upgrades. ERCOT, meanwhile, stood by the estimate in the report. "It’s the 16 percent by 2030 that’s correct," said Robbie Searcy, ERCOT communications manager. Searcy said in a telephone interview that information provided to the House committee "created a misunderstanding in the congressman’s office and that’s why there was an error." Our ruling One of PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter principles is that words matter, and at the very least, Smith's claim is worded ambiguously. The ERCOT analysis and a news release point to an increase in energy costs of 16 percent by 2030. Smith claims that increase per year. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-12221	"One" Texas school "district alone -- Austin ISD -- is expected to lose more than $530 million in local property taxes to Robin Hood this year."	true	/texas/statements/2017/jul/19/joe-straus/joe-straus-says-austin-school-district-expected-lo/	Texas House Speaker Joe Straus hinted at the Texas House’s derailed push for more state education aid by asserting that absent fresh action, Austin taxpayers can count on ponying up more than half a billion dollars to schools in other places this year. The San Antonio Republican prefaced his Austin-centric claim by rehashing his view that Texas overly relies on property taxes to fund the schools. "Property taxes are going up, and more and more of those dollars are going to school districts in other parts of the state through the Robin Hood system," Straus said in an email blast distributed two days before the July 2017 special session called by Gov. Greg Abbott. Straus elaborated: "School districts are expected to send away $2 billion through Robin Hood in the upcoming year. One district alone -- Austin ISD -- is expected to lose more than $530 million in local property taxes to Robin Hood this year." Is that accurate? Straus was referring to the Robin Hood or "recapture" facet of state law designed for equalization purposes so districts with rich tax bases share revenue with less property-wealthy districts. In July 2017, before Straus made his claim, the Texas Education Agency said that some $2 billion all told would be redistributed via the share-the-wealth mechanism in 2017-18. In 2016, we found True a claim by Travis County state Sen. Kirk Watson that in Austin, "the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture." That fact-check said the district for 2016-17 would be forwarding more than $400 million for schools elsewhere. Straus cites newspaper Asked how Straus reached the larger $530-million figure, a Straus spokesman, Jason Embry, said by email that Straus relied on a June 19, 2017, Austin American-Statesman news story about the Austin district’s board of trustees approving a nearly $1.5 billion budget for 2017-18. The story said the district’s recapture payment "this year is expected to be $534 million, an increase of 32 percent, or $127.8 million, over 2016-17." It quoted Nicole Conley, the district’s chief financial officer, saying the district expects to pay more than $1 billion in recapture payments "during the next two years." Austin school district’s calculation When we reached out to the district, spokeswoman Cristina Nguyen specified that according to calculations taking into account expected student enrollment and tax collections, Austin’s estimated payments would total $533,874,730 for the 2017-18 school year. She emailed us the district’s calculations, viewable here. Another district spokeswoman, Tiffany Young, sent an email pointing out a May 2017 district chart suggesting its recapture payments could top $800 million by the 2020-21 school year: SOURCE: Document, "FY2018 Recommended Budget," Austin Independent School District, May 2017 (web link received by email from Tiffany Young, senior communication specialist, AISD, July 17, 2017) State’s preliminary analysis We also asked the Texas Education Agency how much the Austin district will be expected to forward in "recapture" money in 2017-18. By email, Lauren Callahan guided us to an agency estimate, last updated June 21, 2017, of $513,633,317. That’s $20 million less than the district’s announced estimate. But Callahan also cautioned that the state figure is preliminary and likely to increase depending on the district’s tax rate. Callahan wrote: "We use different estimates of local property tax collections as well as different estimates of student counts, both of which affect the estimate of recapture. Our numbers tie together when all final data is reconciled." Our ruling Straus said the Austin district "is expected to lose more than $530 million in local property taxes to Robin Hood this year." As of May 2017, the Austin district estimated that in 2017-18 it would flow nearly $534 million in local property tax revenue through the state’s school finance system, nicknamed Robin Hood, to help equalize school funding across the state. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-10305	Spending increases, not tax cuts, are the major cause of the federal budget deficit.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/06/john-mccain/right-but-tax-cuts-were-a-major-factor-too/	Faced with new projections showing a $482-billion federal budget deficit for 2009, Sen. John McCain tried to pin the blame on spending increases. "It wasn't taxes, it was spending. We presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society and we mortgaged our children's futures, to the great disgrace of the Republican Party. We let earmarking and corrupt spending get to the point where we mortgaged our kids' futures," he said on CNN's Larry King Live. McCain is right when he argues that higher government spending caused most of the current gap between what the government collects and what it spends, according to an analysis of Congressional Budget Office data. But it's the federal budget, so it's not quite that simple. In January 2001, CBO, the official scorekeepers of such things, projected government surpluses far into the future: $573-billion in 2007, $635-billion in 2008 and $710-billion in 2009. Things didn't turn out so rosy. Earlier this year, CBO broke out the factors that have contributed to the transformation from surplus to deficit. For fiscal year 2007, almost all of the $735-billion change was due to "legislative" factors, and just $12-billion was due to economic and technical factors. In other words, Congress did it. But measuring how much of the legislative changes were due to taxes and how much were due to spending is trickier. When the government spends more than it takes in, it borrows the remainder, and the interest charges are due in subsequent years. CBO doesn't parcel out the interest costs to the tax and spending sides of the budget, but the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities does. Their nitty-gritty calculation requires the quadratic equation, but the bottom line is McCain is right. For fiscal year 2007, 58 percent of the legislatively caused deterioration came from spending and 42 percent came from tax cuts. This year, taxes make up 52 percent of the change, because of those tax-rebate checks. But that's a temporary blip. In 2009, according to the projections, tax cuts' share of the blame will drop to 44 percent while spending's portion will rise to 56 percent. One other note: all spending isn't equal. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis found that most of the spending increase didn't come from the earmarks or domestic programs that McCain complains about. It was defense and homeland security. Until the rebates temporarily changed the equation, spending increases did cause the majority of the deficit. But tax cuts aren't blameless, either. We find McCain's claim to be Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-06T00:00:00	2008-07-28	['None']
pomt-03851	Ohio Republicans made significant gains during [Chris McNulty’s] time at the ORP, including the extremely successful re-election of President Bush in Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/13/bob-bennett/ohio-gop-chairman-bob-bennett-says-party-enjoyed-i/	After the Republican National Committee hired Vermilion native Chris McNulty as its political director last week, Ohio GOP Chairman Bob Bennett toasted the rise of a native son. In an emailed statement, Bennett praised McNulty as "an extraordinary political mind and a skilled strategist," then reflected on the longtime operative’s work at the state party. "Ohio Republicans made significant gains during his time at the ORP, including the extremely successful re-election of President Bush in Ohio," Bennett said. "I know he’ll serve the same energy and enthusiasm that he’s put forth throughout his entire political career." Bush’s Ohio victory in 2004 clinched his second term and has been well-documented. But what about the other gains Bennett referenced? PolitiFact Ohio always appreciates a chance to look back at recent history, so we decided to review McNulty’s entire tenure at the Ohio GOP. According to the RNC, McNulty joined the state party in 1995 as field representative covering Northeast and Southeast Ohio. He became political director in 1997 and executive director in 2001. He served in the latter post through 2006, then moved on to the national scene. Republicans swept Democrats out of statewide office in 1990, gaining control of the powerful Apportionment Board and setting up an era of dominance in Columbus. Their hold on the board allowed them to draw legislative districts for General Assembly, which approves congressional boundaries. The GOP had ruled the Ohio Senate since 1985 and captured the House in 1994. Recounting these events is important, as they all occurred prior to McNulty’s arrival. He joined the Ohio Republican Party at a time of great strength. We narrowed in specifically on the decade in which McNulty held the key positions of political director and executive director. The most significant accomplishments during that period are the party’s exclusive lock on nonjudicial statewide posts in the 1998 and 2002 elections and control of the General Assembly through 2008. This essentially kept the power of the redistricting pen with Republicans. In 2000, after Republican George W. Bush won Ohio’s electoral votes in his bid for the White House, McNulty was part of the team sent to Florida to oversee the recount there. Two years later, under new congressional lines, the party picked up a seat while Democrats lost two. (Because of population trends, Ohio’s delegation shrunk from 19 to 18 seats that year.) All of these achievements came during McNulty’s time at the Ohio GOP. It is fair to say that under his leadership, the party capitalized on previous gains and enjoyed new ones. But McNulty’s story doesn’t end in 2004. He served as executive director through 2006. That was the year Democrats won all but one of the statewide administrative offices and unseated Republican U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine. Coincidentally, McNulty briefly was a primary candidate for state auditor, serving as a placeholder until questions about Mary Taylor’s petitions were resolved. As it turned out, Taylor was the lone bright spot for the GOP that November. Republicans also lost a congressional seat that year. Democrat Zack Space won the battle to replace Republican Rep. Bob Ney, who stepped aside amid corruption charges. The Associated Press caught up with McNulty on Jan. 8, 2007, as Taylor was sworn into office and reported that the reality of the defeat had begun to sink in for the executive director. "On Election Night, you’re tired," McNulty told the AP. "Today, I’m wide awake. It’s real." Just as it’s unfair to credit one individual for all the party’s successes, it’s unfair to place all the blame for 2006 at McNulty’s feet. With Bush unpopular, the midterm elections represented a wave for Democrats nationally. And Ney’s legal troubles clearly hurt Republicans in that district. Bennett said the state party "made significant gains" while McNulty was there. There is no question that this was true between 1997 and 2004. However, Bennett’s statement does not take into account the significant Republican losses in 2006, McNulty’s last year in the Buckeye State. PolitiFact Ohio is not claiming the losses were McNulty’s fault. We’re not claiming the bad outweighs the good. But the fact that the party was in a weaker position when he left than it was when he arrived is an important clarification. So on the Truth-O-Meter, Bennett’s statement rates Mostly True.

pomt-09807	"You lie!" (in response to President Obama saying health reform would not insure illegal immigrants.)	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/joe-wilson/joe-wilson-south-carolina-said-obama-lied-he-didnt/	We suspect it's rare that the president gets heckled during a speech to a joint session of Congress, but Rep. Joe Wilson didn't hold back. "You lie!" shouted the South Carolina Republican. This was in response to President Barack Obama's statements on illegal immigrants. "There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants," Obama said. "This, too, is false — the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally." So who's right here? Wilson or Obama? Incidentally, Wilson apologized for the outburst after the speech, but said he still disagreed with Obama's statement. We've been monitoring claims about health care reform and illegal immigrants for some time now. Most notably, a chain e-mail claimed that page 50 of the House bill gave free health care to illegal immigrants. That page didn't say that. Rather, it included a generic nondiscrimination clause that said insurers may not discriminate with regard to "personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services." So we rated the chain e-mail's claim Pants on Fire . We read all 1,000-plus pages of the health care bill and were struck by the fact that it is largely silent on health care for illegal immigrants. Keep in mind that experts estimated there were 6.8 million uninsured illegal immigrants in the United States in 2007, out of a total of 11.9 million illegal immigrants. Right now, there are laws on the books that require hospitals to treat severely ill people who arrive at the hospital, regardless of immigration status, and we didn't see anything that would change those laws, either. Most illegal immigrants are also now excluded from Medicaid, the government-run health care for the poor. We didn't see anything that would change that. One place where the bill does mention immigration status is for "affordability credits." These are tax credits for people of modest means need to buy health insurance. The credits would help them buy insurance on a national health insurance exchange. The bill specifically says that people in the United States illegally are not eligible for tax credits, on page 132, section 242. Still, given all that, we have heard from people who said that other aspects of reform could benefit illegal immigrants. One of the most detailed responses was from the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform, called FAIR. You can read their statement on the matter on their Web site. Primarily, they argue that illegal immigrants would be permitted to purchase insurance on the national health insurance exchange because the bill does not include a mechanism for verifying citizenship. So illegal immigrants would have the chance to purchase insurance in the public option, a government-run health care plan that would offer basic coverage at a low price. FAIR also argues for more robust verification measures for the affordability credit and making sure that illegal immigrant parents won't be able to receive coverage if their citizen children are eligible. FAIR has a point that illegal immigrants would likely be able to buy insurance on the national health insurance exchange. We don't see anything in the bills that would hinder that. A Congressional Research Service report issued Aug. 25, 2009, confirmed our observation. The House bill "does not contain any restrictions on noncitzens participating in the Exchange — whether the noncitizens are legally or illegally present, or in the United States temporarily or permanently," the report said. But it's worth pointing out that illegal immigrants participating in the exchange would be paying for their insurance like everyone else. That's similar to the current system — we're not aware of any particular restrictions that stop illegal immigrants from buying private insurance now. Under health care reform, illegal immigrants would be able to buy private insurance or the public option. When we look at all of this evidence, it seems that health reform leaves in place the status quo on illegal immigration, and certainly does not provide any new benefits particularly for illegal immigrants. We hope to look at this issue more in the days ahead, because some hospitals are concerned about recouping their costs for treating illegal immigrants, and we're curious to know more about that problem and how it might or might not be solved by reform. The best argument that we find that health reform would help illegal immigrants is that some might be able to purchase the public option — if it passes, and it might not — on the new health insurance exchange. They would purchase that at full cost. Obama said, "The reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally," which Wilson said was a "lie." Actually, Obama can make a pretty thorough case that reform doesn't apply to those here illegally. We don't find the public option argument enough to make the case that Obama "lied." We rate Wilson's statement False.	None	Joe Wilson	None	None	None	2009-09-09T22:49:39	2009-09-09	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-12225	"While California’s population has doubled since the 1970s, we haven’t completed a single major (water) storage project in that time."	half-true	/california/statements/2017/jul/18/kevin-mccarthy/kevin-mccarthy-ignores-key-facts-claim-california-/	One of the biggest backers for building new dams and reservoirs in California is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield. The Republican, who’s been described as the most powerful Californian in Washington D.C., recently spoke on the House floor in favor of a bill to speed up studies on five water storage projects in the state. "Water is not optional. Not in my district. Not in California. Not anywhere," McCarthy told his colleagues. "But over the past five years my constituents have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a catastrophic drought." As part of his push for the bill, H.R. 23, McCarthy made a claim about the dearth of water storage construction in the state in recent decades. McCarthy makes his statement at about the 1:35 minute mark. "While California’s population has doubled since the 1970s, we haven’t completed a single major storage project in that time," McCarthy said. "Now that’s worth restating. With California’s population having doubled since the 1970s we have not completed a single major storage project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future if we depend on inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years go?" Not a single major water storage project since the 1970s? We wondered: Does the congressman’s claim hold water? We set out on a fact check. Our research In April 2016, we rated Mostly True a related though somewhat different claim by Sen. Feinstein. She said California had "the same water infrastructure" as it did in the 1960s. Our research showed large portions of the state’s modern-day water system, including the State Water Project and the federal government’s Central Valley Project, were built mainly in the 1960s or earlier. Construction started in the late 1950s on the State Water Project, a massive set of reservoirs, aqueducts and pumping plants that store and deliver water up and down the state to 25 million Californians. The backbone of the project, including Lake Oroville and the California Aqueduct, was finished in the 1960s and early 1970s. The Central Valley Water Project, which irrigates the San Joaquin Valley, was started in the late 1930s and completed in the early 1970s. This evidence mostly supported Feinstein’s claim. But we also found that regional water districts constructed several significant storage projects in the 1990s and that a new part of the state’s water infrastructure, a large ocean desalination plant, was built two years ago in San Diego County. Using that fact check as a reference, we zeroed in on McCarthy’s claim. McCarthy’s claim The first portion of the congressman’s statement, about California’s population doubling since the 1970s, is basically correct. In 1970, the state was home to 19.9 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. As of July 2016, California’s population was 39.3 million. The second portion of McCarthy’s claim about the lack of major water storage projects built since the 1970s is open to broader interpretation. Asked for evidence to support that part of the statement, McCarthy’s spokesman told us by email that "the last major (1M+ acre-feet) reservoir/dam we built in CA was in 1978 and it was New Melones Reservoir." The spokesman did not explain why only reservoirs with a capacity of one million acre-feet or more are considered "major." One acre-foot of water equals about 326,000 gallons. The average California household uses between one-half and one acre-foot of water per year. The capacity at New Melones, which sits on the Stanislaus River in the central Sierra Nevada foothills, is 2.4 million acre-feet. Its dam was, indeed, completed in 1978 by the federal government, according to the U.S. Department of Reclamation. But was that really California’s last major water storage project? Is it fair to describe only those projects with a capacity larger than one million acre-feet as major? And are dams and reservoirs the only way the state adds to its water supply? Given that his spokesman cited New Melones, one might interpret McCarthy’s statement as meaning the federal government hasn’t built any major water storage projects in California since the 1970s. The congressman, however, doesn’t make this point clear in his speech. Given the broad nature of the claim, we took it to mean no layer of government has built a large-scale storage project in decades. Experts weigh in Based on interviews with water experts, we found there’s some truth to McCarthy’s assertion. We also found it omits some key information and takes things out of context. California has not constructed any new statewide water storage projects to match the scale of those started in the 1950s under the State Water Project. For some context, the largest reservoirs on that system are Lake Shasta, with a capacity of 4.5 million acre-feet, and Lake Oroville, with a capacity of 3.5 million acre-feet. The bill supported by McCarthy would advance proposed reservoirs such as Temperance Flat on the San Joaquin River in Fresno County and Sites, an offstream reservoir in the Sacramento Valley west of Colusa. Both would have a capacity of more than one million acre-feet. "It is true that the federal and state governments have not added much," said Jay Lund, director of the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences. "But local and regional efforts have been quite effective, without new federal storage projects." Lund said McCarthy’s statement "is missing a lot of new functional storage," in the form of groundwater projects. One such project, the Kern Water Bank, is expected to store 400,000 acre-feet of water this year, Lund said. Recent projects Here’s a look at some of the largest water storage projects built in California since the 1970s: Diamond Valley Lake in Riverside County is the largest reservoir in Southern California. It was completed in 2000 by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and holds up to 800,000 acre feet of water, "almost as big as Folsom (Lake)," Lund noted. Lake Sonoma, a reservoir in Sonoma County, was constructed in 1983. It has a capacity of 381,000 acre feet. New Spicer Meadow reservoir was completed in 1989. It sits on a tributary of the Stanislaus River and holds up to 189,000 acre-feet of water. Los Vaqueros Reservoir, completed in 1998 by the Contra Costa Water District near Brentwood. It holds 160,000 acre feet. Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute, an Oakland-based think tank that advocates for sustainable water policies, said in an interview that McCarthy’s statement "is just wrong." He explained that California has continued to build smaller but still significant water storage projects in recent decades while adopting new water supply strategies. In a 2009 column in the San Francisco Chronicle, Gleick wrote the state had added more than 1.6 million acre-feet of water storage since 1979. "And these numbers don’t include new groundwater storage systems or the vast ‘reservoirs’ of saved water we’ve created through conservation and efficiency programs. Are we adding new traditional storage more and more slowly? Yes. We’ve built on all the good dam sites." Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed California hasn’t completed a single major water storage project since the 1970s. His claim is partially accurate. Nothing built since that time compares with the massive reservoirs built in the 1950s and 60s as part of the State Water Project. That doesn’t mean California hasn’t added anything of significance. Regional water districts have built large projects including the 800,000 acre-foot Diamond Valley Lake, built in 2000, the largest reservoir in Southern California. To describe "major" water storage projects, McCarthy’s spokesman used what amounts to an arbitrary marker of those with the capacity of one million acre-feet or more. But as water policy experts point out, California has continued to build water storage on a smaller but still significant scale. It’s also adopted new water supply strategies, including groundwater storage and conservation. McCarthy’s statement ignores these important facts and context. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08775	"This is not a mosque. It's a cultural center that has a prayer area."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/23/al-hunt/ground-zero-mosque-not-even-mosque/	By now, most of those following the so-called "Ground Zero Mosque" issue know it is not on Ground Zero -- but rather is two blocks away. But on ABC's This Week on Aug. 22, 2010, Bloomberg's Al Hunt said it's not even a mosque. Hunt said the issue has been "demagogued" and added, "This is not on ground zero. This is not a mosque. It's a cultural center that has a prayer area." Hunt's comment echoed Frank Rich who stated in an Aug. 21, 2010, New York Times op-ed, "It’s not a mosque but an Islamic cultural center containing a prayer room." But the developing organization repeatedly refers to the religious component of the site as a mosque. On the website for the project (Park51.org), the plan sounds more like a Muslim YMCA-type operation. The site's "facilities" page details plans for a "world-class community center" open to all New Yorkers, regardless of faith. According to the site, plans include: a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios, childcare services and a September 11 memorial and "quiet contemplation space, open to all." The plan also includes "a mosque, intended to be run separately from Park51 but open to and accessible to all members, visitors and our New York community." Organizers say the center would be used to promote cultural diversity and would be overseen by a 23-member Board of Directors, whose membership will not be limited to Muslims. But the center would be geared toward "engaging New York’s many and diverse Muslim communities and promoting empowerment and compassion for all." Another page of the website explains that the project, called Park51, is an independent project led by American Muslims. On that same page, it states, "The mosque, yet to be named, will be run by a separate non-profit whose Board of Directors will reflect a broad range of experience. While the mosque will be located in the planned final structure of Park51, it will be a distinct non-profit." In a July 24, 2010, interview with altmuslim.com, an Islamic news site, Sharif El-Gamal, owner of the building and developer of the Park51 project, was asked, "Why must the project necessarily include a mosque? Wouldn't a general prayer area, which could be reserved in advance by any religious group, be more appropriate and compatible with the community-centric interfaith mission of the project?" Gamal answered, in part, "With respect to the mosque, which will take up only a small portion of the final space, it’s a question of meeting a need. This mosque will be open to all. There are probably one million Muslims in the tri-state area and several hundred thousand in New York City." We also turned to a website for the Cordoba Initiative, "a multi-faith non-profit organization whose aim is to improve relations between different communities, and in particular between the Muslim world and the United States of America" which was founded by Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who along with Gamal acts as project manager of the Park51 site. On the "Frequently Asked Questions" page is one that asks, "Why are you building a mosque at Ground zero?" The response: "The community center is not located at Ground Zero. "It will be a multi-floor community center open to all New Yorkers, much like a YMCA or Jewish Community Center (JCC) with a designated prayer space (mosque) in one area to serve the needs of the large existing community of American Muslims in the neighborhood. "The community center will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their culture or background, will find a place of learning, arts and culture, and, most importantly, a community center guided by the universal values of all religions in their truest form – peace, compassion, generosity, and respect for all." We note that the "mosque" in parentheses is their word, not ours. Imam Rauf has been leading prayer services in one of the buildings -- a former Burlington Coat Factory -- since 2009, drawing a spillover from the imam's former main place for prayers, the al-Farah mosque about a dozen blocks north of the World Trade Center grounds, according to the Washington Post. According to the Post, the site's organizers estimated that the mosque could attract as many as 2,000 worshipers on Fridays. So how exactly does one define a mosque according to Islamic tradition, as opposed to simply a prayer space? We explored this very issue a bit when we researched a claim from Kendrick Meek, a Democratic Senate hopeful, who said there is a mosque at the Pentagon. It turns out there is a non-denominational chapel at the Pentagon, and it is used once a day by Muslim employees who gather there for prayer services. While that might be considered a sacred place by those who use it, it doesn't meet the definition of a mosque, according to Shafayat Mohamed, imam of the Darul Uloom mosque in Pembroke Pines, Fla. "The main thing that makes a mosque a mosque is the establishment of praying five times a day at that spot," Mohamed said. "If people pray five times per day, then it is considered a regular mosque." We agree with those who say it's imprecise to simply refer to the New York project as a mosque. As is clear from the organizers' comments and formal web pages, the big picture plans are for a $100 million, 15-story Muslim community center that would be open to New Yorkers of all faiths. But those comments and websites also make clear that the plans do include a "mosque." It may be a "small portion" of the overall project, but it is a part.

pomt-07593	The HOPE scholarship "has helped turn our University System into one of the best in the Southeast, with two institutions ranked in the top 20 of public universities in the country."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/25/nathan-deal/deal-says-hope-helped-universities-become-some-bes/	Georgia bid to keep HOPE alive by cutting it. There was no choice, Gov. Nathan Deal said. He could either trim the popular college scholarship program or let it go bust, he wrote in an op-ed published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Letting HOPE die was not an option. He signed cuts into law March 15. "This program has helped turn our University System into one of the best in the Southeast, with two institutions ranked in the top 20 of public universities in the country," he wrote March 21. This claim made PolitiFact Georgia reporters curious. HOPE has been credited with a lot of things. But improving the University System of Georgia? That was news to us. We checked this claim out. HOPE awarded its first scholarship in 1993. Until recently, it gave full tuition at Georgia’s public colleges to students who graduated from high school with at least a 3.0 grade-point average -- so long as they maintained that average in college. Under "Enduring HOPE," the revamped program, only the state’s top students will receive full tuition, and they must maintain a 3.3 in college to keep the award. Students with at least a 3.0 will still get HOPE, but the amount will vary each year. A Deal spokeswoman told us that the governor’s op-ed referred to U.S. News and World Report rankings for the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Georgia. Sure enough, Georgia Tech ranks seventh among public universities. UGA is 18th. In 1997, Georgia Tech ranked ninth. The University of Georgia didn’t crack the top 25. But has HOPE helped that happen? And does a rankings jump really mean HOPE helped turned Georgia’s University System into one of the "best in the Southeast"? College rankings, such as the ones from U.S. News, are regularly criticized by educators who think they are a poor measure of a school’s quality. They argue that the numbers say little about how well colleges educate their students and put pressure on administrators to game their numbers. Still, if UGA’s and Georgia Tech’s rankings are rising, something good is going on, right? We reviewed studies on the topic and talked to experts on merit-based scholarship programs such as HOPE. They agreed that Georgia’s program encouraged better-performing high school students who might have left the state to stay. For instance, a study found that in 1993, only 23 percent of Georgia’s high school graduates with SAT scores that topped 1500 stayed in state. By April 2002, 76 percent stayed. And while Georgia high school seniors’ SAT scores grew by only 30 points from HOPE’s start through 2005, the scores of the state’s college freshmen jumped by 60 points. This dramatic change helped rankings at top Georgia schools, especially UGA, rise. "Student selectivity" makes up 15 percent of a school’s U.S. News ranking. This measure includes students’ SAT and ACT scores, class rank and what proportion of applicants a university turns away. Other factors have boosted the rankings of Georgia’s top schools as well. Nationwide, research shows that the cost of higher education has climbed so high that high-performing students who would have only considered private schools are looking at top state schools, said Donald E. Heller, a professor of education at Pennsylvania State University who has studied HOPE. Also, flagship schools are working harder to recruit talent from other states. Those students tend to have higher scores and class rankings than in-state students. In addition, researchers have found that HOPE has negative effects. Because HOPE puts Georgia on the hook for college tuition, University System leaders have raised tuition rates at a much slower pace than schools in surrounding states, said David B. Mustard, a UGA economist who has been involved in a half-dozen studies that analyze the program’s effects. This helps state coffers, but over time, it hurts a university’s ability to retain high-quality staff and keep low student-to-teacher ratios, Mustard and other researchers have found. Between 1993 and 2002, the number of faculty focusing on teaching fell in Georgia’s research universities by 3.2 percent and at two-year colleges by 23.2 percent. Meanwhile, enrollment grew. And while HOPE may help students pay for school, it did not make them more diligent. Research comparing recipients with out-of-state students found that to maintain the required 3.0 GPA, HOPE scholars took easier course loads, withdrew from more classes or enrolled more frequently in summer school, where it’s easier to get higher grades. To sum up: Rankings aren’t complete measures of a school’s quality. But as Deal said, HOPE did help Georgia’s top schools improve their rankings because it encouraged higher-caliber students to stay in state. The downside is fewer faculty are teaching more students, and HOPE students are taking easier or fewer courses. Deal is correct, but his statement could use more context. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2011-03-25T06:00:00	2011-03-21	['University_of_Wisconsin_System']
pomt-10023	"Look, the earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/11/peter-orszag/earmarks-down-not-75-percent/	With Democrats now running the show, it's their turn to take the heat for earmarks in a $410 billion omnibus spending bill to keep the government running for the rest of the fiscal year. Congressional Democrats and the White House have been quick to note this spending bill is actually a holdover from the previous administration, that things will be different next year, and that earmarks hit a peak during Republican control in the middle part of this decade. On CNN's "State of the Union" on March 8, Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said, "Look, the earmarks have come down significantly, 75 percent." The same day on NBC's Meet the Press , Sen. Charles Schumer threw out a nearly identical assessment: "The bottom line is, there's been serious reform. We are now, this year, two years later, there's one-fifth the earmarks there were before — not 80 percent, 20 percent from before. They are transparent. No Bridge to Nowhere could occur." When it comes to earmarks, lots of numbers get thrown around. Different groups have different definitions of earmarks. Some people look at the number of earmarks, some at the dollar amount, some both. Most everyone agrees that earmarks have gone down with Democrats at the helm, but we haven't found any source to reasonably back up claims that earmarks have declined anywhere near 75 or 80 percent. According to the math provided by the Senate Appropriations Committee (Democratic-controlled, we note), earmarks were reduced by 43 percent last year, and the omnibus appropriations bill reduces earmarks by another 5 percent. There's a big caveat to their numbers: They do not include "project-based" federal programs. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees federal water projects, has such a high percentage of earmarks in its overall budget that Democrats exclude the projects from the totals. Their reasoning is that if they promise to cut earmarks by a certain percentage, as they have in the past few years, these programs will be disproportionately cut. By their count, there are $3.8 billion worth of earmarks in the omnibus bill. The most trusted source in earmark accounting, Taxpayers for Common Sense, doesn't go for excluding that "non-project-based" stuff. "An earmark is an earmark," said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "You can't start sequestering things off. I mean, I can meet my weight loss goals if I don't count my butt." They count more than 8,500 disclosed earmarks in the omnibus bill, coming to $7.7 billion. Together with $6.6 billion in disclosed earmarks in the three 2009 spending bills that passed in the fall, earmarks for the year come to $14.3 billion, which is $500 million less than earmarks last year, they note. Less, but not a whole lot less in the big picture. The total amount of last year's earmarks represented a 23 percent reduction from the high water mark in 2005, according to TCS. The slight reduction this year would add a couple percentage points to that. But in no way does it come anywhere near the reduction of 75 or 80 percent that Orszag and Schumer cited. So, we asked, where did Schumer and Orszag get their figures? Schumer's office didn't respond. And a spokesman from Orszag's Office of Management and Budget sent this vague reply: "A number of groups which tally earmarks have estimates on the level of reductions that are in the omnibus. Peter pulled from those." Um, okay. In summary, based on the figures from the most respected source on earmarks, Taxpayers for Common Sense — which uses Congress' own definition of earmarks — the figures cited by Orszag and Schumer are way off. The Appropriation Committee numbers are a little closer to those cited by Schumer and Orszag. But we don't buy this number because it excludes "project-based" federal programs. We note that Obama, in an announcement about earmark reform on March 11, said earmarks "hit their peak in the middle of this decade, when the number of earmarks had ballooned to more than 16,000." This number appears to include "project-based" federal programs. As we think it should. At any rate, the Appropriations Committee numbers suggest less than a 50 percent reduction — not 75 or 80 percent. We don't know where Orszag and Schumer got their numbers. And they aren't saying. At least not to us. But the authorities on this matter say their calculations are bunk. We agree. And we rule the statements False.

pomt-12084	Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin is "still 16,000 manufacturing jobs lower than we were during the recession."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/30/kathleen-vinehout/senator-under-scott-walker-state-16000-manufacturi/	In criticizing Gov. Scott Walker’s Foxconn factory deal, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout (D-Alma) lamented sluggish manufacturing growth and the governor’s manufacturing policies. Vinehout appeared Aug. 6, 2017, on WISN-TV’s "Upfront with Mike Gousha," where she said under Walker the state is "still 16,000 manufacturing jobs lower than we were during the recession." In July 2017, Walker announced that technology giant Foxconn, a company best known for making iPhone components, planned to build a near-1,000 acre LCD factory in southeastern Wisconsin that could eventually lead to 13,000 jobs. In her interview with Gousha, Vinehout, who ran for governor in 2014 and may run again in 2018, criticized Walker for picking winners and losers and said the continued use of tax credits has not resulted in fast economic growth for Wisconsin’s manufacturing sector. But what about her claim? Are Wisconsin’s manufacturing jobs still 16,000 below the recession total? Sluggish growth Vinehout said in an email through an aide that her 16,000 jobs number was a conservative estimate, meaning that the actual number could be much larger. She laid out her analysis this way: The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce that tracks GDP and wages, showed 494,427 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin at the end of 2008. She chose the annual number for 2008 because she said that’s the year the recession started. To be clear, the Great Recession started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Next, Vinehout compared the 2008 annual number to a monthly report from Wisconsin’s Department of Workforce Development, which showed about 472,000 manufacturing jobs in June 2017 in Wisconsin. "Using those numbers Wisconsin still has 22,327 manufacturing jobs to go to get back to the prerecession level," Vinehout said through an aide in an email. "Monthly totals in 2008 would vary depending on which month you looked at." While the numbers of each source may be sound, experts say it is not appropriate to compare a monthly number, particularly a preliminary one, with a final annual number. In doing so, Vinehout mixed together data that was collected and measured differently. Here at PolitiFact, we -- and economists -- consider the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the gold standard for jobs numbers, specifically its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data. So, let’s do a calculation of job numbers using their annual numbers. That data shows an annual total of about 492,000 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin in 2008. In 2016, the BLS reported about 463,000 manufacturing jobs in the state, meaning Wisconsin is about 29,000 jobs shy of returning to recession levels. While Vinehout’s methods might have been off, she’s not wrong in saying Wisconsin’s manufacturing sector hasn’t returned the jobs numbers it previously had. What’s more, the recent trend is not good. Manufacturing jobs fell between 2015 and 2016 by about 3,000, as overall job growth for the state slowed, according to a June 2, 2017, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Behind the claim In her claim, Vinehout used the numbers to criticize Walker’s performance as governor -- even though he took office in January 2011, well after the recession had ended. Experts said it is not fair to pin all of the blame for sluggish manufacturing growth in Wisconsin on Walker. Some of the factors that influence manufacturing job growth include state and federal economic policies, the overall national economy, automation replacing jobs, shipping jobs overseas and the decades-long shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy. States set policies that can either attract or discourage businesses from coming, but it’s ultimately the decision of the private sector to decide where to set up shop, said Brian Jacobsen, a Wells Fargo senior investment strategist. He added that the effects of policies and reforms typically aren’t felt until years after they have been implemented. The state is "not 100 percent responsible for creating or losing jobs, but state policies help attract new business to the state or retain existing businesses," said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson touted Walker’s policies as successful, citing plans from Foxconn and Haribo to build factories in the state. "Governor Walker’s reforms have led to a resurgence in Wisconsin manufacturing and have created opportunities few could have imagined during the last recession," Evenson said. Our rating In a TV interview, Vinehout said Wisconsin under Walker is "still 16,000 manufacturing jobs lower than we were during the recession." She mixes and matches data from a few government sources, but is right in saying Wisconsin hasn’t hit pre-recession manufacturing job numbers. However, in using the number to criticize Walker, she ignores the fact he was not in office until several years after the recession ended and that governors only have a limited impact on the economy.

pomt-02916	The federal health care law raises taxes and cuts Medicare.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/03/scott-brown/health-care-law-raises-taxes-and-cuts-medicare-say/	Republicans have had plenty of ammo to criticize President Barack Obama’s health care reform law in recent days. From the sputtering online insurance marketplaces to the millions of Americans who will lose insurance plans that don’t meet the new law’s standards, it has been a feeding frenzy for conservatives. But speaking Nov. 3, 2013, on Fox News Sunday, senator-turned-commentator Scott Brown dredged up some old claims about the Affordable Care Act to add to the ongoing criticism. Brown was a Massachusetts state senator when then-Gov. Mitt Romney passed what would become the blueprint for Obamacare, and he compared his own state’s effort to the federal law. "When the president was in Boston, it made my blood boil," Brown said. "I worked on the Massachusetts plan. It didn’t raise taxes or cut Medicare, and this one does." We’ll put aside for now Brown’s claims about what the Massachusetts law did and didn’t do. (For starters, it couldn’t cut Medicare because that’s a federal program). Instead, we’ll focus on Brown’s statement that Obamacare raises taxes and cuts Medicare. Raising taxes? We’ll start with Brown’s claim on taxes. The health care law requires most uninsured Americans to purchase health insurance. Individuals who don’t comply with the law face a tax penalty when they file their taxes next year. In its decision to uphold the individual mandate, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the penalty was basically a tax that Congress was imposing on people who failed to buy insurance. The contentious decision allowed Obama’s signature legislative achievement to survive a constitutional battle. There’s still plenty of debate on whether that penalty is a tax or just analogous to one. But there are other tax hikes in the law we’ve reviewed before that give Brown clearance to make his claim. A good part of the law’s new taxes are on the wealthy. High earners -- defined as households making make more than $250,000 or single people making more than $200,000 -- will see their Medicare payroll taxes go up by 0.9 percentage points, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Also, they will pay an additional tax on investment income of 3.8 percent. Other taxes in the law hit the insurance companies, the health care industry and even indoor tanning salons, including: A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided "Cadillac" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018. A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. So regardless of whether the penalty imposed on people who don’t buy insurance is a tax, there are other taxes that raise revenue to offset the costs of the new law. Cuts Medicare? This is one of the claims we’ve checked the most since the start of the 2010 midterm campaigns, and we typically rate it Mostly False or Half True, depending on the specific claim. It became a big issue in the 2012 election as well, when Romney, the Republican nominee, hoped to win over support from older voters in swing states like Florida by accusing Obama of slashing the popular entitlement program for seniors. Written into the health care law is a reduction in future Medicare spending. It is not a cut in current services. The reductions take place over the next decade (the last estimate pegged it at $716 billion over 10 years) and are achieved by offering incentives and penalties to health care providers to promote more efficient care. In an email to PolitiFact, Brown specifically pointed to stories written about cuts to Medicare Advantage, which make up about a third of the projected savings. Medicare Advantage is a program started under President George W. Bush that provides some seniors with private insurance plans. In recent years it has proven to be more costly than traditional Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act seeks to rein in the program by decreasing reimbursements and pressuring the plans to be more efficient. The Republican budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., takes advantage of Medicare savings as well. Romney continued to criticize Obama and refer to them as "cuts" to Medicare even as he tapped Ryan to be his 2012 running mate. It should be noted that while representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate, Brown voted against the Ryan plan. So we can’t call him a hypocrite. But it’s an exaggeration to say Obama is cutting Medicare. Our ruling Brown said Obamacare raises taxes and cuts Medicare, a two-pronged attack. The law definitely raises taxes. As to whether it cuts Medicare, that's a more complicated picture. The standard benefits for people on Medicare were largely left intact. The law does try to prod the health care industry and insurers who are part of Medicare to operate with more efficiency. Considering both points, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-01631	"Every 28 hours" an unarmed black person is shot by a cop.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/26/marc-lamont-hill/unarmed-black-person-shot-every-28-hours-says-ma/	In the days before the funeral of 18-year-old Ferguson, Mo., resident Michael Brown, two black pundits appeared on CNN to debate what his killing meant for race relations in America. It quickly turned into a shoutfest driven by the opposing political views of conservative radio host Larry Elder and liberal professor and author Marc Lamont Hill. Elder blamed the media for inflaming the racism narrative and ignoring that black homicide is the No. 1 cause of death among young black men. (We previously fact-checked a similar claim and found it to be True.) "How often does it happen that an unarmed black is shot by a cop?" Elder asked in the Aug. 20, 2014, interview. "Every 28 hours," Hill said. "Every 28 hours, Larry. Larry, every 28 hours. According to the MXGM study, a black person is killed by law enforcement, vigilantes or security ..." Elder cut in, but Hill revisited his point later in the interview, saying, "But if this study bears out, and it does, that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is killed, then that also is a problem." We wanted to see if that statistic is correct. We didn’t hear back from Hill, but as he said on CNN, he is referencing a 2013 report by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement called "Every 28 Hours," which examined killings of African-Americans in 2012 by law enforcement, security guards and "vigilantes" who claimed self-defense. The report is not an academic, unbiased representation of these deaths. It was put together by one volunteer researcher and details 313 deaths based on news clips and police reports. It arrives at one death "every 28 hours" by dividing the number of hours in a year, 8,760, by the number of deaths, 313. But the report doesn’t say what Hill offered on CNN, that an "unarmed black person is killed" every 28 hours. In fact, less than half of the people who were killed were unarmed, according to MXGM. PunditFact found 136 were labeled as unarmed after reviewing the compiled profiles. The 28-hour calculation factored in all 313 deaths, which included people who were armed, "allegedly" armed and unarmed. That’s an important distinction not reflected in Hill’s claim. Also, not all of the "unarmed" people are analogous to Brown’s case or were killed by police. Included in the unarmed tally, for instance, is Trayvon Martin, the Miami Gardens teen who was killed by a neighborhood watchman named George Zimmerman. In other cases, whether someone was really "unarmed" may depend on your definition. In nine cases, police said they shot at suspects because they were charging at them from behind the wheel of a vehicle. Another case to make the list is Rudy Eugene, the Miami man who attacked a homeless man and gnawed his face before police shot him to death. We also found several "unarmed" deaths that were due to accidents, many car crashes as officers sped to a scene. In another example, one woman was killed at her birthday party, hosted by an off-duty police officer, when she hugged the officer from behind and somehow set off his gun. Our ruling When asked how often an unarmed black is shot by a cop, Hill answered "every 28 hours." He then referenced a report issued by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and said "that every 28 hours an unarmed black person is killed." Either description is incorrect. The report, which is not an academic work, reaches its conclusion by including deaths that were not at the hands of police, deaths of blacks who were armed, car accidents, and deaths of blacks who were in aggressive or hostile situations. The report only classified 136 of 313 deaths as unarmed, which does not support his claim that an unarmed black person is shot by police every 28 hours. We rate the claim False.

pomt-13935	Says Hillary Clinton "said she was under attack (in Bosnia) but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/trump-clinton-bosnia-sniper-story/	Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump wasted no time punching back the day after Hillary Clinton listed in detail why he could not be trusted to run the economy. Clinton "is a world-class liar," Trump said in a June 22, 2016, speech in New York. "Just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers." On that Bosnia trip, Trump picked one of Clinton’s most prominent transgressions. When she made that claim, we rated it Pants on Fire in 2008. Here’s why. During an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996. "I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base." But that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post Fact Checker also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady. CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit, wrote of her memories of the trip: "To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. " Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. "There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened," she said. But she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she "misspoke," correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, "So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation." On the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. The Des Moines Register reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, "We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there." Interestingly, Clinton's memoir Living History depicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling: "Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.' " There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. And there was a welcoming ceremony where a young girl gave her a poem. Our ruling Trump said Clinton claimed "she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers." In all key respects, Trump is correct. Clinton did claim that she landed in Bosnia under sniper fire and that there was no greeting ceremony. She later retracted the entire statement. The only flaw in Trump’s speech is he said Clinton was handed flowers. It was a poem, which seems like a trivial difference.

pomt-00200	"Republicans in the General Assembly cut teacher pay so much when they took over in 2011 that even with recent pay raises, we are still below pre-Recession pay levels."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/17/jd-wooten/wooten-doesnt-paint-full-picture-teacher-pay-cut/	In a Facebook ad video that ran through the first week of October, Democratic state Senate candidate JD Wooten waded into one of North Carolina’s hottest topics for debate: teacher pay. "Republicans in the General Assembly cut teacher pay so much when they took over in 2011 that even with recent pay raises, we are still below pre-Recession pay levels," said Wooten, who is running to unseat incumbent Rick Gunn in District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County. Wooten’s statement made our ears perk up, so we decided to check it out. Is teacher pay in North Carolina still lower than it was before the Great Recession? And if so, is the Republican-controlled state legislature at fault? In short, Wooten is mostly correct that teacher pay has not returned to pre-recession levels. But he misses the mark on the political blame, as the biggest cuts actually came under Democratic leadership. How much money are teachers making? The average North Carolina public school teacher made $49,970 during the 2016-17 year and an estimated $50,861 in 2017-18, according to the National Education Association, the country’s biggest teachers union. The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction put its own estimate for 2017-18 slightly higher, at $51,214. Assuming these estimates hold true, last school year marked the first time the average teacher salary in North Carolina has exceeded $50,000, as The News & Observer previously reported. (Estimates for 2018-2019 have not yet been released.) As state Republicans are quick to point out, average teacher salaries have been trending up for several years. That positive momentum follows a years-long dip in the wake of the recession, which started in December 2007 and lasted through June 2009. Average teacher pay was $47,354 in 2007-08 and $48,648 in 2008-09, according to the NEA. So on first glance, it seems that average teacher pay have surpassed where it was before the recession hit. But as Wooten pointed out when we contacted him for comment, the NEA’s numbers have not been adjusted for inflation. This means that while their salaries might look like they have gotten bigger, teachers still have approximately $5,000 less in purchasing power than they did prior to the recession. To see what Wooten meant, we ran each year’s estimate through the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator and found out their approximate value in today’s dollars. Here’s what we came up with: Academic year Average teacher pay Average teacher pay, adjusted for inflation 2007-08 $47,354 $55,606 2008-09 $48,648 $57,109 2009-10 $46,850 $53,591 2010-11 $46,605 $52,455 2011-12 $45,947 $50,245 2012-13 $45,737 $49,230 2013-14 $44,990 $47,673 2014-15 $47,819 $50,716 2015-16 $47,941 $50,157 2016-17 $49,970 $51,005 2017-18 $50,861 $50,861 As the table shows, the inflation-adjusted numbers — which could vary slightly, depending on how the calculations are performed — prove that Wooten’s claim about average teacher pay levels still trailing what they were before the recession is fairly accurate. It’s worth noting, however, that the inflation-adjusted numbers could be declining at some points for several reasons, and not just because teachers are being paid less. For example, it’s possible that many veteran teachers left the state, and the average teacher became less experienced. That may explain why, if you compare the salary schedules from 2008 and 2018, many pay levels are actually much higher for teachers now than then, even when adjusted for inflation. Still, as far as averages go, Wooten is right that they have not returned to pre-recession levels. Republicans took control of the state legislature in 2011, when average teacher salaries were about $46,605, or approximately $52,455 in "current" dollars. That’s higher than the $50,861 that the NEA has estimated the average North Carolina teacher pocketed in 2017-18. Who is to blame? Wooten’s ad placed the blame squarely on the state’s Republicans, but in reality, both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their leadership in the last decade. Previously, PolitiFact gave Mostly False ratings to Gov. Roy Cooper and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for similar claims that also sought to pin the full blame on Republicans. As the timelines show, teacher pay had been rising before the recession hit. But it was Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue who, in 2009, ordered a 0.5 percent pay cut for all state employees, including teachers. That measure was approved by a Democrat-controlled legislature — which also voted to freeze teachers' salaries — and average teacher salaries continued to drop every year under Perdue. Teachers did not receive raises in 2010, either. Perdue held office through 2012, meaning Republicans dominated the legislature for the last two years of her term. In each of those years, Perdue vetoed the budget and insisted that more money be spent on education, but the budgets went through anyway. When Perdue left office and Republican Gov. Pat McCrory took over in 2013, average teacher pay continued to go down, even after all state employees and teachers were given a 1.2 percent raise in 2012. Teacher pay fell to its lowest point during McCrory’s first year — the third year of the Republican-led legislature — when it dove below $45,000 in 2013-14. Republicans in the legislature did overhaul the education system in many ways, and some budget policies McCrory signed into law could have had an impact on teacher salaries. The 2013 budget, for example, eliminated a salary increase that went to teachers who earned a master’s degree. On the flip side, teachers can now get bonuses based on how their students perform on state exams, The News & Observer has previously reported. But since 2013, teacher pay has been trending upward. Although it has not yet returned to pre-recession levels, it is getting close. In 2016 under McCrory and in 2017 under Cooper, the GOP-controlled legislature approved budgets with teacher pay raises. In 2017, the legislature added a 6.5 percent average pay raise for teachers, the News & Observer reported. Previously, PolitiFact said it was Mostly True that teacher pay has increased each of the last five years under Republican leadership. Wooten did not make any mention in his ad of the role played by Democratic state leaders in the state’s low teacher pay, but he did acknowledge the Perdue administration’s cuts in an email explaining his statement. "While there were some initial pay reductions, adjusted for (consumer price index), during the final years of Democratic control of the (North Carolina General Assembly), it was due to the recession and was consistent with national averages and overall market reductions due to the economic contractions," he wrote. Wooten said his ad faulted Republicans because of the "additional drastic cuts after the GOP took control." For the record, it's also worth noting that state leaders are not entirely responsible for teacher pay, since many of the state's school districts provide teachers with additional pay supplements in addition to their state salaries. The NEA factors these supplements into its estimates. Our ruling Wooten said, "Republicans in the General Assembly cut teacher pay so much when they took over in 2011 that even with recent pay raises, we are still below pre-Recession pay levels." Wooten is correct that North Carolina’s teachers are still receiving salaries that are lower on average than what they were getting before the recession, when adjusted for inflation. He did not specify in his ad that he was talking about inflation-adjusted average teacher pay, which could have confused readers. More importantly, his attempt to pin the full blame for the state’s below-average teacher salaries on the GOP was misleading, as Democratic leaders were responsible for the heaviest teacher pay cuts in the wake of the recession. Since the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08245	Experts say the property tax "is the most harmful to economic growth and . . . the sales tax is least harmful."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/14/lincoln-chafee/chafee-quotes-experts-saying-sales-tax-increase-wo/	Lincoln Chafee's plan to impose a 1-percent sales tax on currently exempt items was clearly the most controversial proposal of his 2010 campaign. During his first news conference as governor-elect, Chafee was asked about the prospect of having the General Assembly pass it. "I'm open to better ideas, but I am going to be a fierce protector of the property tax," he said. "I do firmly believe, as the experts have said, that that's the most harmful to economic growth and that's what we want in the state, economic growth. And the sales tax is least harmful to economic growth. While no tax is good, let that sink in. We want economic growth. Let's go with the one that's least harmful." Chafee had made a similar assertion 10 months earlier when he announced his run for governor and proposed the tax. We were curious whether tax experts really believed that a sales tax increase imposed by the state is less harmful to economic recovery than a property tax hike, which can be forced on municipalities if the state cuts aid to cities and towns. Our first stop was to the Chafee transition team, which gave us a PowerPoint presentation made in September at a Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council forum for the gubernatorial candidates. The author is Joseph Henchman, director of state projects at The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Henchman's data included some interesting information, such as the fact Rhode Island gets significantly more state and local revenue from property taxes and less from the sales tax than the national average. But the presentation says nothing about which type of tax is more harmful or beneficial to economical growth. Neither did a Wall Street Journal editorial on taxes that the Chafee team supplied to us. So we asked for other, more relevant information. Meanwhile, we did our own poking around. The Tax Foundation ranks states based on their business-friendly tax climate. Their latest index, based on data as of July 1, 2010, has Rhode Island 42nd, up from 44th the previous year. (The higher the number, the worse it is for business.) If a company is thinking of starting or relocating here, the fact that we're in the bottom 10 could influence that decision. That ranking is influenced by how much various items are taxed. In addition, the foundation gives more emphasis to the sales tax (where Rhode Island ranks well, at 14th) than corporate taxes (where we rank 37th) or property taxes (where we rank 47th) when it does its ranking. "A lot of businesses take the index as a first step" in deciding where to go or expand, said Kail Padgitt, a staff economist at the foundation. So because it emphasizes the sales tax more than the property tax, Rhode Island's overall ranking when it comes to the business tax climate would be disproportionately harmed if we increase the sales tax. Padgitt referred us to a study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international agency founded to help its 33 member countries find the best economic policies. The OECD's 2008 study of tax structures and economic growth says that when taxation is necessary, a stronger reliance on property taxes is the best method for encouraging an economy to grow, followed by consumption taxes, such as sales taxes. High corporate taxes, it concluded, were the worst when it came to increasing the gross domestic product (GDP). "Comparing only consumption taxes and property taxes, both of which seem superior to income taxes, it is property taxes, and particularly recurrent taxes on immovable property, that appear to be associated with the highest levels of GDP per capita," the report says. So this organization disagrees with Chafee. On the other hand, Wendy Schiller, professor of political science and public policy at Brown University, said she could see how high property taxes would be a big factor in stifling economic growth in Rhode Island, especially in communities like Providence, where the taxes are used to finance schools that are regarded as inferior. "Over the long haul, it really deters the kind of people with innovative ideas for new businesses and professionals who may want to work in Boston but want to live somewhere else," she said. "They're going to live and spend money here, but not if they have to pay for private school." Kim Rueben, a public finance economist at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., said Chafee's assertion is "way too strong" and overly simplistic. "Whether raising taxes actually impacts your ability to attract businesses has a lot to do with what you actually spend those revenues on," she said. For example, financing a good network of roads or building a top-notch educational system "are things that businesses value and leads to positive economic activity." When we finally heard back from the Chafee team, spokesman Mike Trainor sent us directly to Henchman, the Tax Foundation official who made the September presentation. When we asked Henchman about Chafee's statement, he told us, "It's difficult to make a broad claim like that. It depends pretty much on circumstances." But what about the OECD's conclusion that property taxes hurt economic growth least and the foundation's own emphasis on giving states lower rankings if their sales tax is high? Henchman said that advice works on a large scale. But when it comes to an individual state, things can be different. He said Rhode Island has one of the better sales tax systems, yet "the property tax, by contrast, is one of the worst in the country. It's very high, very complex." Henchman said he would recommend doing whatever could be done to relieve the property tax burden. A good way to do that would be to take the sales tax and smooth out its selective nature, which he said creates "distortions" in a system by taxing different items at different levels. He recommends getting rid of complicated tax systems that require extra administrative costs and systems that favor certain industries, activities or products. It can get silly to place a high tax on prepared foods and no tax on groceries. "The argument often made is that it's less regressive to exempt groceries, but poor people buy prepared food and rich people buy groceries," he said. In the end, there is no consensus from the experts. An international report disagrees with Chafee, one expert says such ranking is too simplistic and another gave qualified support. And even when the Chafee team found someone to support the assertion that property taxes are the most harmful to economic growth, it was with the caveat that the strategy is specific to Rhode Island's current circumstances. But that's a distinction the governor-elect didn't make. As a result, we rate Chafee's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Lincoln Chafee	None	None	None	2010-11-14T00:01:00	2010-11-03	['None']
pomt-14548	"Kasich’s budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder."	false	/ohio/statements/2016/feb/12/american-future-fund/ad-distorts-john-kasichs-budget-proposa/	In this Republican primary, you’re nobody until you’re the subject of a dark-money-funded attack ad. Even before his success in New Hampshire, Ohio Gov. John Kasich had made the cut, judging by an ad labeling him an "Obama Republican," paid for by the American Future Fund, an organization linked to the billionaire Koch brothers. The ad’s voiceover states, "Common Core. Obama’s Medicaid expansion. Tax increases. Barack Obama? No. John Kasich. Kasich still supports Common Core. Kasich was one of the few Republican governors to cheerlead Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, and Kasich’s budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder. John Kasich. Not a conservative. Not even a moderate. An Obama Republican." It’s the statement about raising taxes by "billions" that raised our fact-checking antennae. But first, the other claims. On Common Core, the school boards and administrators in most states have used the national initiative as a model on which to base their own standards. Kasich has been steadfast that curriculum decisions in Ohio schools are made at the local level. It’s true that his statements on Common Core are far from the condemnation coming from the rest of the Republican field. On the Affordable Care Act, Kasich opposed health care exchanges in Ohio, but did expand Medicaid, defending his decision by referencing the Bible’s commands to help the poor. On to the ad’s criticism of Kasich’s budget proposal. Ohio’s budget goes through two-year cycles. Kasich’s 2015 proposed budget would have: • Raised tobacco taxes by 35 cents, to $1.60 a pack; • Created a new electronic cigarette tax; • Raised state sales taxes by a half-cent; • Raised the tax on oil and gas producers; • Created a 3 percent flat tax on businesses income above $250,000. These tax hikes were intended to offset the key element in Kasich’s plan: a sweeping income tax cut. And tax policy analysts from the left and the right both defined it as such. Economist Scott Drenkard, with the business-backed Tax Foundation, panned Kasich’s plan for shrinking Ohio’s tax base. A more left-leaning policy research institute, Policy Matters Ohio, also identified Kasich’s plan as a tax cut, and was critical of it for rewarding the wealthiest taxpayers the most. According to their February 2015 report, the richest top 1 percent of Ohioans would see $11,906 in tax savings, and the next 4 percent would see an average savings of $890. But the bottom 20 percent of earners could expect to pay an average $116 more. "To say his budget raised taxes by billions is a wild overstatement, to me," says Zach Schiller, research director of Policy Matters Ohio. Kasich’s budget "raised taxes by billions, before it cut them by even bigger billions." The next element of the attack ad’s claim is that Kasich’s budget hurt Ohio businesses. But Schiller says that’s questionable as well. "His proposal would have increased taxes that businesses themselves pay. You could possibly debate that," Schiller says. "But it included a big cut in the income taxes for the owners of those businesses." Schiller also takes issue with the statement from the ad about hitting middle-class Ohioans "even harder." "What you find is, the people at the top, making the top 1 percent, are getting many thousands of dollars a year in tax cuts," Schiller adds. "The people in the middle are either breaking even or seeing modest increases, and the people at the bottom are seeing modest increases." Ohio’s Department of Taxation provided PolitiFact with a table showing net tax reductions by year through Kasich’s tenure as governor, from 2012 through 2017. The net savings resulting from the 2015 budget comes to $1.88 billion. Our ruling An ad from the American Future Fund said, "Kasich’s budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder." His budget did raise taxes, but then it cut taxes by billions. The biggest increase in Kasich’s plan, a bump of $1.5 billion over two years, is the sales tax increase. That increase offsets Kasich’s income tax cuts, which total $1.88 billion over the same two-year period. The ad said these tax increases hit businesses hard. Some businesses -- the biggest ones -- would see a flat tax rate increase of 3 percent. But the income tax cuts reward the most affluent Ohioans -- many tied to big businesses -- with thousands of dollars in tax breaks. Were middle-class Ohioans hit the hardest? Most would break even or see a slight tax increase. It would have been more accurate to say that the poorest taxpayers would gain nothing from Kasich’s tax restructuring. But that wouldn’t make for much of an attack ad. We rate this statement False. Editor's note: The original headline of this fact-check misidentified the American Future Fund as a "Koch group."

pomt-11151	"Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/29/donald-trump/trump-correctly-tweets-democrats-mistakenly-tweete/	President Donald Trump went on offense against Democrats after liberals attacked the Trump administration’s policy on child migrants. Trump said the Democrats were sharing a photo of detained children from 2014 during President Barack Obama’s presidency. "Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages," Trump tweeted May 29. "They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!" Trump’s tweets followed some blame and confusion about nearly 1,500 "lost" immigrant children. In late April, a federal agency reported being unable to locate about 1,500 children who came to the United States alone. Around the same time, the Trump administration announced a "zero-tolerance" policy to ramp up prosecutions of individuals who cross the border illegally. Trump’s tweet is accurate. One of the Democrats who shared the photo was Jon Favreau, a former Obama speechwriter. Favreau, who has one million followers on Twitter, tweeted on May 27: "Look at these pictures. This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible." Favreau included a link to a Arizona Republic story showing a photo of two detainees lying on mats on the ground in a holding cell with the headline "First Glimpse of Immigrant Children at holding facility." While Favreau has since deleted the tweet, Twitchy and Fox News showed screen grabs. The photo was taken by Ross D. Franklin of the Associated Press in June 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection Agency center in Nogales, Arizona. The photo was used in an Arizona Republic article which described the migrants as "children in cages." The newspaper verified the timing of the photo in a tweet. Minutes after Favreau’s tweet about the photo, at 3:27 p.m. Favreau followed up with a tweet that cited the actual date of the photo. "These awful pictures are from 2014, when the government's challenge was reconnecting unaccompanied minors who showed up at the border with family or a safe sponsor. Today, in 2018, the government is CREATING unaccompanied minors by tearing them away from family at the border." Favreau responded to our questions by pointing to his May 29 Twitter thread, including this tweet: "I tweeted a story that multiple journalists were posting. My mistake for not checking the date first. A few minutes later, when I realized my error, I deleted the tweet and immediately tweeted the correct info and date of the picture." In an email, Favreau told PolitiFact that a New York Times Magazine editor was one of the journalists who posted the photo. Jake Silverstein, the magazine’s editor in chief, tweeted on May 27 "My bad for RT’ing without closer inspection and implying by timing that it’s current." Trump’s swipe at "Democrats" was broad but there were liberal activists who tweeted about the photo including Shaun King and Linda Sarsour. The Daily Caller and The Daily Mail linked to tweets by other activists and journalists. Our ruling Trump tweeted "Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages." Several Democrats did tweet a photo of a facility where child migrants are detained. While they initially stated the image was something happening right now, the photo was actually from 2014. Trump’s attack on "Democrats" is broad here, it is nonetheless accurate. We rate this claim True.

pomt-01594	Says Mark Pryor voted "to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/04/national-republican-senatorial-committee/did-mark-pryor-vote-give-social-security-benefits-/	The National Republican Senatorial Committee -- the GOP’s Senate campaign arm -- is attacking Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., for becoming a creature of Washington after 12 years in the Capitol. But the ad now airing relies on an eight-year-old charge that we and other fact checkers have debunked multiple times over the years. Pryor is one of the Senate’s endangered Democratic incumbents and a top target for Republicans. Here’s the narration of the NRSC’s ad: Narrator: "When Mark Pryor went to Washington 12 years ago, he promised to put Arkansas first." Video of Pryor speaking: "As your senator, I’ll always put Arkansas first." Narrator: "But something happened. Mark Pryor changed. Voting to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. Voting to give members of Congress special benefits to purchase Obamacare. Twelve years ago, Mark Pryor promised to change Washington. Instead, Washington changed him." We have already fact-checked several claims about lawmakers voting to give themselves special benefits to purchase Obamacare. Almost a year ago, we checked a claim by Pryor’s Republican opponent, Rep. Tom Cotton, that Pryor had voted for "special subsidies" for lawmakers and staff in Congress "so they’re protected from Obamacare." We rated that claim False. So here, we will look at the ad’s other main assertion, that Pryor voted "to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants." There are two problems with this claim. The claim is worded much more broadly than what was actually voted on. The ad makes it sound like Pryor was voting to create a vast new entitlement for illegal immigrants by allowing them to qualify for Social Security. In reality, the 2006 vote concerned a much narrower issue -- the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former illegal immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill (a bill that never made it into law). At the time, illegal immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. During a Senate debate over the broader immigration bill in 2006, then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number -- a provision that would have mostly (if not entirely) affected illegal aliens. This is what was cited in the ad. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted on a motion to table (that is, to stop consideration of) the Ensign amendment. By a bare one-vote majority, the chamber voted to table the amendment. Pryor’s was one of the 50 votes in favor of tabling. So while the ad is correct that Pryor cast that vote on that date, the way the ad described it -- that Pryor had voted "to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants" -- is substantially misleading. The ad ignores two cases in which Pryor supported a similar amendment. It’s important to note that the May 2006 vote on Ensign’s amendment is not the end of the story. Ensign continued to push the issue, offering a substantially similar amendment on at least two other occasions. The first time, on July 19, 2007, Ensign proposed a similar amendment to the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Under the rules, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass but only got 57, so it failed. However, Pryor voted for the amendment. The second time, on Oct. 23, 2007, Ensign offered a similar amendment during another immigration bill debate. This time, the Senate passed it by an overwhelming 92-2 vote. And once again, Pryor voted for the amendment. So the ad cherry-picks the one time Pryor voted against the measure and ignores two times he voted for it. That, too, is substantially misleading. Our ruling The NRSC’s ad claims that Pryor voted "to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants." That’s wrong for two reasons. First, the provision was much more narrowly targeted than the ad suggests -- it addressed the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by legal Social Security beneficiaries who at one time had been illegal immigrants. Second, the ad cherry-picks one vote Pryor cast against this provision while ignoring two separate votes he cast for the provision. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04447	Says Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan would "eliminate the guarantee of Medicare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/11/joe-biden/says-mitt-romney-paul-ryan-would-eliminate-guarant/	During the vice presidential debate in Danville, Ky., Joe Biden attacked the Republican ticket’s proposal for Medicare. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, Biden said, would "eliminate the guarantee of Medicare." We tackled this point when President Barack Obama made a similar point in September. We asked: Are there "guaranteed benefits" for Medicare today? And if so, would they be at risk if Romney wins? A lot of it depends on how you define these words. What guarantees exist under Medicare today? Probably the clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked. That wasn’t always the case. Before Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965, health coverage for seniors was far from guaranteed. When people retired, they often lost coverage they had from their former employer and couldn’t afford a new plan. (For more on the pre-Medicare era, including statistics, see our article, "Were the early 1960s a golden age for health care?") The Obama campaign goes further. It argues that "guaranteed benefits" refers to "all the benefits that Medicare is required to cover." Today, Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting one’s benefits depend on the amount of money they paid into the system. "As a system of defined benefits, Medicare does guarantee those benefits," said Paul Starr, a specialist on health care reform at Princeton University. "The government has a responsibility for them that it would not have in a defined-contribution scheme. There are a host of legal rights in regard to providers that are also associated with those guaranteed benefits. All that goes away with the shift to defined contribution." Is there a guarantee of benefits? No, Medicare benefits aren’t guaranteed in every sense. First, while the federal government guarantees that you will be served by Medicare once you turn 65, it doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get every possible service or treatment paid for. Indeed, an entire industry sector -- Medigap insurance plans-- has emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn’t cover. This is particularly true for the coverage for newly emergent technologies and treatments. And just because something is covered today doesn’t mean it will be covered indefinitely, or at the same percentage of the cost. Congress and the president can -- and do -- change the benefit rules for Medicare. In 1988, for example, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, adding a bevy of benefits, including a prescription drug benefit and a catastrophic-care benefit, said Robert Moffit, a health care specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The following year, Congress repealed it. Obama’s own health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, doesn’t maintain the status quo indefinitely. While we have previously said that the Romney campaign is exaggerating when it criticizes Obama for cutting Medicare, the Romney campaign isn’t wrong that changes are going to be made. The fact that Obama would reduce Medicare reimbursement to certain Medicare providers -- likely resulting in the elimination or reduction of some benefits -- is proof positive that Medicare is not a fixed, unchangeable program. Obama’s law also creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member, appointed panel that is charged with identifying Medicare savings. While PolitiFact has in the past been critical of Republican exaggerations about what the board would do, the board could force certain changes in the Medicare program. Any such future changes would undermine the notion that Medicare has "guaranteed benefits." "If you are promised a benefit but find trouble accessing physicians or home care or long-term-care providers to provide that service, have your benefits been changed or compromised?" said Gail Wilensky, a former health care official under President George H.W. Bush. "I think a reasonable person could say yes." Another important factor that could infringe on any Medicare "guarantee" is the program’s fiscal challenges. According to Medicare’s actuary, the trust fund for Medicare Part A -- the part of the program that pays for hospital care -- will run out in 2024 if the Obama law’s cuts remain on the books, or in 2016 if the cuts are rescinded (the course Romney has said he wants to follow). So unless something is done to change the program’s fiscal balance, Medicare would spend down its reserves for hospital payments within eight to 16 years. "If you define guarantee benefit as simply receiving a Medicare card, then that only lasts until the money runs out," said Joshua Archambault, a former Romney aide who is now a health care policy specialist at the free-market Pioneer Institute. "So I guess the president can make that claim until 2016 … but then he loses it." Even health care experts who are supportive of Obama’s law do acknowledge that the concept of a Medicare "guarantee" may be too strongly worded. "So long as the law is in place, people who meet specified eligibility requirements are assured specified benefits," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Still, "nothing in the statutes is ‘guaranteed,’ because Congress always has the option of changing the law." Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has advised both Obama and Romney on health care reform, agreed. "Under today's system, you have a guaranteed benefit, but one that is subject to political risk," he said. How Romney would change Medicare As for Romney’s plan, it’s important to note that it has not been been set out in full detail, and it hasn’t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. But we’ll explain it as best we can. Romney has said his plan would be close to the most recent one offered by his running mate, Paul Ryan. For people who are now under age 55, Medicare would no longer pay for seniors’ health care bills directly. Instead, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available. We know that the Romney plan, like the status quo, would preserve the guarantee that people will start receiving coverage under a federal health care program when they turn 65. (The age threshold would gradually rise to 67 by 2034.) Less clear is whether the operational changes Romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under Medicare. The Romney campaign argues that not only would be traditional Medicare be a choice, but that private plan offerings must provide coverage at least comparable to what Medicare provides today, and that those plans would be Medicare-approved. However, since CBO hasn’t weighed in, we don’t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, especially over the longer term. The Obama campaign argues that "Romney has said that under his voucher system, plans have to offer coverage that is ‘comparable’ to Medicare today" -- a term they believe falls short of a guarantee of specific benefits. But Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health-care issues for President George W. Bush, says that’s a smokescreen. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services "establishes the benefits covered by Medicare each year, and the private insurers in Medicare Advantage and Part D, the drug benefit, are required to cover at least that minimum benefit or its actuarial equivalent. That's exactly the Romney proposal." Under the most recent plan, Levin said, "seniors are guaranteed at least one and generally two options that provide comprehensive coverage for no greater out-of-pocket costs than they have now." Levin also disputes the notion that the Romney plan is a pure defined-contribution plan. "The Romney approach is a hybrid of defined benefit and defined contribution," he said. "The minimum benefit is set by the government, and all competing insurers must meet it, but the government payment is determined by competitive bidding among those insurers to see how cheaply they can provide at least that minimum benefit." The most recent Republican plans have lessened the likelihood that Medicare’s payment will fall behind the actual rise in health care costs, experts say, but given the limited details, there’s still some uncertainty on this front. Under the Romney plan, MIT’s Gruber said, you have the same political risk of a broken guarantee as you have today, but that guarantee is compounded by health spending risk. "As health spending rises faster than your voucher, you are in trouble," he said. Our ruling Biden said that Romney and Ryan would "eliminate the guarantee of Medicare." Calling today’s Medicare benefits "guaranteed" is partially, but not entirely, true. Currently, Medicare does guarantee broad health coverage for seniors and, in the short term, guarantees specific benefits. But Medicare doesn’t cover everything, and Congress and the president can change what is covered -- and will be forced to do so when fiscal pressures hit. Meanwhile, it’s plausible that the Romney plan could provide less of a "guarantee" than Medicare currently does, but we found sharp disagreement between supporters and opponents of Romney’s Medicare plan on that point. This disagreement is hard to resolve given the shortage of information Romney has so far provided. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13333	Says Rep. John Katko "promised he wouldn’t vote to defund Planned Parenthood and since he’s been in office he’s done that four times"	true	/new-york/statements/2016/oct/05/colleen-deacon/katko-voted-against-planned-parenthood-funding-fou/	Democrat Colleen Deacon says Rep. John Katko, R-Camillus, flip-flopped on funding for Planned Parenthood. When Katko first ran for the office in 2014, he wasn’t against federal funding for the organization. Now, his opponent says he broke his promise to voters. At a regional campaign office opening for Hillary Clinton in Syracuse, Deacon said Katko voted four times to defund Planned Parenthood. "He’s somebody who when he ran said he promised he wouldn’t vote to defund Planned Parenthood and since he’s been in office he’s done that four times," Deacon told WRVO. She also made the claim in her victory speech in June’s primary election. The Syracuse area congressional district is considered a toss-up. Three Republicans and two Democrats have represented the district since 2003. Is Deacon right about Katko’s record on Planned Parenthood funding? Katko’s position on abortion Katko opposes abortion, except in cases of rape and incest, or if the health of the mother is at risk. He said during one debate in 2014 that he would reverse the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade if given the opportunity. That doesn’t mean he opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Katko told the Post-Standard newspaper in Syracuse last year he supported funding until a set of videos was released that implied the organization was harvesting fetal tissue for sale. The creator of those videos has since faced charges related to the incident. Katko also went on the radio last September to explain why he changed his position. "It’s never an easy issue, right? Before, when I was running in the campaign, I was absolutely for funding for Planned Parenthood. The law is clear that any federal funds for Planned Parenthood can’t be used for abortions, so that’s not an issue," Katko told Grant Reeher on WRVO. He went on to explain that the videos gave him pause to support federal funding for the organization. "It isn’t about abortion to me. It’s about whether they’re breaking the law or not," Katko said. The first and second votes The videos sparked state investigations into Planned Parenthood and a renewed effort to strip the organization of federal funding in Congress. In September 2015, The Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 was brought to the House Floor. Katko voted twice to advance the legislation. In his first vote, Katko opposed a proposed amendment to reconsider the bill. His vote helped keep the legislation on the House floor. His second vote supported the actual bill, which passed in the House but was not brought to a vote in the Senate. The third vote Then during federal budget negotiations last year, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 was slipped into a one-house resolution to fund the federal government. It included the same language as the standalone bill. The House, with the help of Katko, passed the resolution. The Senate did not. The fourth vote The fourth vote happened a few weeks later when Republicans in the House tried to defund the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. Tucked away in that legislation was language that would have stripped federal funding to any entity that provided abortion services. Katko voted for the legislation. The House passed the measure, but the bill did not become law. Our ruling At the opening of Hillary Clinton’s regional campaign office in Syracuse, Deacon said Katko voted four times to defund Planned Parenthood. She’s right. Katko voted defund the organization, according to voting records. We rate this claim as True.	None	Colleen Deacon	None	None	None	2016-10-05T06:00:00	2016-09-10	['None']
pomt-09472	In 2001, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan "justified increasing spending and cutting taxes, saying that we didn't really need to pay down the debt."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/02/hillary-clinton/greenspan-gave-approval-tax-cuts-only-if-deficits-/	On the same day that President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., were talking about health care at the president's health care summit, two other former presidential candidates -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- faced off over government spending. The occasion was Clinton's testimony at a House committee hearing on the 2011 budget for the State Department on Feb. 25, 2010. Paul asked her about spending money to build a new embassy in London. Paul argued that the new embassy amounts to more debt spending. First, we should mention that Paul's foreign policy outlook is noninterventionist, generally opposing foreign spending and arguing that the United States should not intervene abroad. During the 2008 campaign for president, he spoke often about his opposition to the war in Iraq, to the point of drawing occasional boos from Republican audiences. At the hearing, Paul said, "Here in the Congress, everybody justifies all their spending -- people here justify the domestic spending, people justify the overseas spending and the war spending, and they worry about a lack of bipartisanship. I worry about too much, because they get together and they enjoy spending both places, and nobody cares about the deficit," Paul said. Responding to Paul's concerns about the embassy project, Clinton said that the State Department was selling some its London properties, adding that the new embassy would be built with the proceeds of those sales. But she also aimed a zinger at former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- someone Paul is no fan of. "I take very seriously your larger point, congressman," Clinton said. "It breaks my heart that 10 years ago we had a balanced budget, that we were on the way to paying down the debt of the United States of America. I served on the Budget Committee in the Senate, and I remember as vividly as if it were yesterday, when we had a hearing in which Alan Greenspan came and justified increasing spending and cutting taxes, saying that we didn't really need to pay down the debt -- outrageous in my view." We were interested in the accuracy of Clinton's recollection. We confirmed Clinton's claim that 10 years ago, the country had budget surpluses, and that various prognosticators, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, projected surpluses for years to come. (It's important to note that a budget surplus applies only to a single year. There was still significant public debt from previous years -- about $5.7 trillion.) At the time, Congress was considering a number of policy options. President George W. Bush, who had just been sworn into office, was proposing significant tax cuts. It was at this point that Greenspan testified about the budget outlook and Bush's proposed 2001 tax cuts before the Senate Budget Committee, which included Clinton, then a newly elected junior senator from New York. Greenspan talked at length in his central banker language, saying things like this: "Continuing to run surpluses beyond the point at which we reach zero or near-zero federal debt brings to center stage the critical longer term fiscal policy issue of whether the federal government should accumulate large quantities of private -- more technically, nonfederal -- assets. At zero debt, the continuing unified budget surpluses currently projected imply a major accumulation of private assets by the federal government. ... This development should factor materially into the policies you and the administration choose to pursue." In plain language, Greenspan was saying that the government shouldn't collect more taxes than it needs to run the government, and tax cuts might be a good idea. In fact, headlines the day after his testimony read, "In Policy Change, Greenspan backs a broad tax cut," and "Greenspan supports a tax cut; Fed chairman says surpluses changed his mind." But at no point did Greenspan say that we didn't really need to pay down the debt. In fact, he went out of his way to say that tax cuts were only appropriate because the federal government appeared to be on its way to paying off all of the public debt. He also added a cautionary note: "With today's euphoria surrounding the surpluses, it is not difficult to imagine the hard-earned fiscal restraint developed in recent years rapidly dissipating. We need to resist those policies that could readily resurrect the deficits of the past and the fiscal imbalances that followed in their wake." Clinton appears to have held a contrary interpretation of Greenspan's testimony for some time. In 2005, at another committee hearing, Clinton confronted Greenspan about his previous remarks. At this point, the 2001 tax cuts had become law, as had a second round of cuts in 2003, and the United States was spending large sums on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I can remember serving on the Budget Committee four years ago, in the spring of 2001, when your testimony helped blow the lid off the lockboxes when it came to the size of the tax cut, the extent of the tax cut," Clinton said. "In addition to the tax cuts, without the real opportunity to continue to pay down the debt and the deficit, we did away with the pay-go rule, so we essentially have, you know, been in a free fall ever since, and we are still in that free fall. And I think that your testimony today is a little nostalgic for me, and I regret that we're in the position we're in." Greenspan, though, told her he never suggested that deficits were a good thing: "I actually went back and reviewed the testimony that I gave in January of 2001, and we were confronted at that time with an almost universal expectation amongst experts that we were dealing with a very large surplus for which there seemed to be no end. And that was true of the best analysts in OMB (Office of Budget and Management), in the Congressional Budget Office, in the Federal Reserve. ... I argued back then that excessive budget deficits and excessive on-budget surpluses distorted the private system, and we should try and eliminate that. I did indicate that we should have a scheduled tax cut. And the reason for that was in order to reduce the surplus. I also indicated that there was the possibility -- indeed the language is fairly strong in some cases -- that we may be fooling ourselves that in fact deficits are coming back. And I therefore recommended that we have some form of trigger to readjust if indeed that happens. And subsequently, I've been a very strong supporter of pay-go. So in all tax cuts and all expenditure increases, I have held the position that we have to pay for them one way or another, or we're creating serious problems." In reviewing the record, we find that Clinton's statement contains a little bit of truth. Ten years ago, the country was on the way to paying down its debt. Clinton is correct that Greenspan, at a pivotal moment, testified that the 2001 tax cuts were acceptable. His testimony was widely perceived as an endorsement of the tax cuts and received significant press coverage. But Greenspan never suggested that "we didn't really need to pay down the debt." Rather, he clearly said that continuing deficits were not good and that the federal government should practice fiscal discipline. And he reiterated that view in 2005. So we rate Clinton's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05104	Says "Barack Obama and his team" are "socialists in every respect of the word."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/29/mark-neumann/obama-and-team-socialists-wisconsin-gop-senate-can/	Discussing a hotly contested provision of federal health care reform, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mark Neumann resorted to fiery rhetoric to brand President Barack Obama and his entire administration. Neumann was interviewed June 20, 2012, by conservative talk show host Jay Weber on WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee. He criticized the part of Obama's reform law that requires what he called "abortion-inducing drugs" be included in insurance plans offered by religious institutions. As The New York Times explains, the Obama administration announced in January 2012 that as part of the rollout of the reform law most health insurance plans will be required to cover contraceptives for women free of charge. The announcement set off a political firestorm among religious and conservative groups, who denounced it as a threat to religious freedom, the newspaper said. The rule does not apply to church organizations themselves, but instead to affiliated nonprofit corporations, like hospitals, that do not rely primarily on members of the faith as employees. Back to the interview. Weber said: "You always have to look at motive. Don't you think that one big reason that (U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen) Sebelius and Obama even imposed this mandate is that they want to get anyone other than government out of the health care business? I think that they're hoping the Catholic Church says we have no choice other than to close our hospitals." Neumann replied: "Well, I think that's true. I think Barack Obama and his team believe that the federal government is best prepared to handle virtually everything in our lives. I mean, they're socialists in every respect of the word and I think they'd like to take over everything in our lives if they could, including health care." So, Neumann, a former House member, is claiming Obama and his team are "socialists in every respect of the word." Having cast himself as the most conservative candidate in the GOP primary, he goes to the opposite end of the spectrum by using socialist. While Milwaukee had a socialist mayor (Frank Zeidler) as recently as 1960, these days those are fighting words. So let's see what this is all about. Twice before, our colleagues have rated statements calling Obama a socialist -- and both times issued ratings of Pants on Fire. 1. Texas Gov. Rick Perry At a January 2012 debate for Republican presidential candidates, GOP Texas Gov. Rick Perry called Obama a socialist. Two months earlier, when Perry told Fox News he thought Obama was a socialist, he explained his claim by saying: "When you talk about printing money and spending government money, and trying to spend it out … kind of redistribute the wealth -- the best I can tell, that's socialism." PolitiFact National pointed out in rating Perry’s debate claim that Obama's tax policy "relies on the same progressive approach that has been the cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863, an approach embraced by Republicans and Democrats." Our colleagues continued: "To the extent the government then gives some of the money to the less-wealthy through various programs, you could say the income is being redistributed. But that concept has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats for well over a century. That's a far cry from true socialism, which is defined as support for "governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods." 2. Texas congressional candidate Roger Williams Two weeks before Neumann’s claim, Texas Republican Roger Williams vowed that if elected to Congress he would "fight a president who's, quite frankly, a socialist." PolitiFact Texas concluded in rating Williams’ statement that "certain Obama policies may have expanded government" and that "some perceive the health care law as government asserting more control over health care." But that's not even equivalent to the dictionary definition of socialism that Williams’ own campaign provided: "any of various social systems based on shared or government ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of good." Now back to the statement at hand. Neumann went even further than the two Texans, claiming that not only Obama but "his team" are socialists. Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander also offered a definition of socialism, saying in an email it is "economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of means of production and distribution of goods." Obama, through his votes as a U.S. senator or in his time as president, "has used government money to buy some of the largest companies in the United States and took an active role in the management of the companies," Englander said, citing General Motors, Chrysler and AIG. But that argument doesn't go far. In the Perry item, conservative economist Bruce Bartlett told PolitiFact National that "although it is true that the federal government did come to own some private businesses as a consequence of bailout policies initiated by the George W. Bush administration such as TARP, the Obama administration sold many of them -- such as its shares in GM -- as quickly as feasible. A true socialist would have held onto them." Englander also argued that with health care reform, Obama "advocates the government distributing $1.7 trillion worth of health care services. Presumably he has an economic policy that is going to collect this $1.7 trillion from one group of people and/or businesses and redistribute it to another." But our national colleagues addressed this, as well, saying: "The health care law relies largely on the free enterprise system, an economic approach that Perry usually speaks about fondly. To increase health care coverage for the uninsured and people in small business, the law sets up exchanges to encourage private health insurance companies to compete. (In 2010, we chose the Republican claim that the law was a ‘government takeover’ as our Lie of the Year.)" When we asked for a response to Neumann's claim, Obama Wisconsin campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris simply cited the two Pants on Fire items. Our rating We share our colleagues' view that while Obama's policies may have expanded government, they don't justify this "ridiculous hyperbole." Words matter, and Neumann’s statement takes the hyperbole even further, branding not only Obama but also his entire team as socialists. Neumann’s statement is false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire.	None	Mark Neumann	None	None	None	2012-06-29T09:00:00	2012-06-20	['None']
pomt-02829	On changing the rules for filibusters on presidential nominees	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-among-flip-floppers-senates-nuclear-opt/	"What they are attempting to do in this instance is really too bad. It will change this body forever. We will be an extension of the House of Representatives, where a simple majority there can determine everything." Sen. Harry Reid, remarks on Senate floor, May 23, 2005 "The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change, as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American, adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense. This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making Washington work — regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate. Sen. Harry Reid, remarks on Senate floor, Nov. 21, 2013 After years of threats and retreats by both parties, the Democratic Senate majority on Nov. 21, 2013, enacted a controversial rule change called the "nuclear option." The change eliminated the filibuster — a blockage of floor action, typically by the chamber’s minority party — for executive branch nominations as well as judicial appointments short of the Supreme Court. Under the new rule, the Senate only needs a 51-vote majority instead of a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and move to a final vote on a nomination. The question of whether to change the rule has long divided the chamber’s majority and its minority. In fact, supporting or opposing the "nuclear option" has been much more closely linked to a senator’s position in the majority or the minority than whether they’re a Republican or Democrat. This means that both sides in this recent faceoff made different arguments than they had in previous iterations of the battle. The rule change was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and was implemented with the support of all but a few Democrats and no Republicans. Yet Reid had strongly condemned the nuclear option when he was still in the minority. Time to take out the Flip-O-Meter! PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on whether the change is justified or not. It simply looks at whether they did, indeed, change their stated position. We’ll take a look back to 2005, when the partisan lineup was substantially different. President George W. Bush had recently won a second term, while his fellow Republicans had a majority in the Senate. (The House was also controlled by Republicans, but the House isn’t directly involved in the filibuster fight.) In the Senate, the Democratic minority had filibustered a number of Bush’s judicial appointments, displeasing Republicans, who seriously considered implementing the nuclear option that would allow them to confirm judges with a simple majority. The effort drew the outrage of Democrats, among them then-Minority Leader Reid. "You should not be able to come in here and change willy-nilly a rule of the Senate," Reid said on the Senate floor in May 2005. Reid was afraid how a nuclear option could undermine the power of the Senate. "What they are attempting to do in this instance is really too bad. It will change this body forever," he said. "We will be an extension of the House of Representatives, where a simple majority there can determine everything." The threat to go nuclear was eventually rescinded when a bipartisan group of senators – the "Gang of 14" – pledged to block the effort. Seven Democrats agreed to no longer support their party’s filibusters on judicial nominees, while seven Republicans promised not to vote with their colleagues to invoke the nuclear option. In 2008, when Reid was already the Senate majority leader, he discussed the 2005 events in an interview with C-SPAN. He continued to condemn the fact that the Republicans even contemplated using the nuclear option: "The Senate was set up to be different, that was the genius, the vision of our Founding Fathers. … That's why you have the ability to filibuster, and to terminate filibuster. They wanted to get rid of all of that," Reid said. Then he was asked if he would ever consider invoking the nuclear option himself: "As long as I am the leader, the answer’s no," Reid promised. "I think we should just forget that. That is a black chapter in the history of the Senate. I hope we never ever get to that again because I really do believe it will ruin our country." Fast-forward to 2013. Now, Democrats held the White House and a Senate majority. The Republican minority had been stalling nominations and appointments by Obama, including filibustering the nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense. Senate Democrats decided to go nuclear after the Senate GOP made clear that they had no intention of allowing three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be filled. At that point, Senate Democrats took the opposite view they had taken in 2005. Led by Majority Leader Reid himself, they successfully invoked the nuclear option in a near-party-line vote, 52-48. Before the vote, Reid explained his plan on the Senate floor: "The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change, as it has over the history of this great country … This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making Washington work — regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate," Reid said. Then he added: "It is time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete." Our ruling In 2005, Reid strongly condemned a proposed Senate rule change by the Republican majority. This week, with a Democratic majority, he proposed it himself. We rate this a Full Flop.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2013-11-22T18:32:44	2013-11-21	['None']
pomt-02875	"Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/13/steve-israel/medicare-part-d-and-obamacare-health-care-gov/	Democrats are pleading for patience as they try to reassure the country that the online insurance marketplaces critical to President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul can be fixed. Big programs have seen rocky rollouts only to achieve success later, they say. Their top example: the 2005 launch of Medicare Part D, President George W. Bush’s prescription drug benefit plan. "Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out," Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., told MSNBC on Nov. 6. "When things go wrong, there are two things we can do as a country. We can spend all our time figuring out who to blame, or we can spend all our time figuring out how to fix it." Eight years after it went live, Medicare Part D is now widely popular among the seniors who use it. Were there major problems with the rollout of Medicare Part D? And were they comparable to the challenges facing Obamacare? We decided to take a more a detailed look at its implementation. Strangely similar Let’s play a quick game: who made this statement? "This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches." A Democrat in 2013? Wrong! Actually, it was Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican who chaired the House Energy and Commerce Committee, about Medicare Part D in 2006. The similarities between the two health care programs, both heralded as the signature domestic achievements of the presidents who signed them into law, are at times eerie. Supporters of the laws asked for time and promised a quick fix. Critics did not mince their words. Even the lingo -- words like "glitches" -- has been recycled. A report documenting the history of Medicare Part D was released earlier this year by a group of health policy experts at the Center on Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University. It highlighted several areas where Medicare Part D struggled in its implementation that sound extremely familiar. For one thing, the Bush administration faced a difficult political battle to get the bill passed in 2003. That damaged public opinion of the law, making it a challenge to educate 43 million seniors on its nuances. Enrollment in the law was set to begin in late 2005. In April of that year, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 27 percent of respondents understood the law, while only 21 percent favored it. (In a comparable Kaiser poll in April 2013, 35 percent viewed the Affordable Care Act favorably and less than half felt they were well-informed of its details.) The Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005, but it didn’t go live until weeks later in November. Even then, "the tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing," the Washington Post reported at the time. "Visitors to the site could not access it for most of the first two hours. When it finally did come up around 5 p.m., it operated awfully slowly," the Post reported. (Sensing a pattern?) Once seniors began to enroll, problems persisted. According to the report, the online tools had "accuracy problems," and local organizations designated with assisting seniors "reported problems getting necessary and accurate information." Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated "the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided" and "service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information." The Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act, noting that the country’s experience with Medicare Part D suggested "the experience will be far from perfect" and "problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked, but fixes were usually found." These days, nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it. "There’s really a striking amount of similarity even though this time it’s a far larger and daunting task. It’s a fair comparison," said Jack Hoadley at the Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute and one of the authors of the study. "Once something works its way through the problems, you forget the problems." Still different But there are important differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different. Because it was aimed at seniors and e-commerce was still relatively young, Medicare.gov was not intended to be the main hub for people to purchase and review plans, said David Brailer, the first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under Bush. "The issue with Medicare Part D is there were choices of 70 to 100 plans," Brailer said. "People were overwhelmed with the choices, with the options available and didn't know how to navigate and pick one. I don’t remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people. This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices." Meanwhile, most people who logged on to healthcare.gov in the opening weeks couldn’t even get far enough to review what options were available. Also, prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy-to-understand part of health care. Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated. "For those who did choose to enroll (in Medicare Part D) online, they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used, and once you did, you got an estimated out-of-pocket cost to make your comparisons. In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy," Hoadley said. "The drug cost is relatively predictable, certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs. The challenge for this website is a lot greater, probably by a significant amount of magnitude." And there’s the political climate as well. When Medicare Part D passed, Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout. But even then, they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits. When Medicare Part D faced early troubles, many blue states came to its rescue. The New York Times reported in 2006 that "about 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program." By contrast, not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act, and in the years since it passed, the party has made its repeal a top priority. In the states, many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces, putting greater pressure on the federal government. Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute, said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a "two-front war" Bush did not have to fight. "On the one hand, one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem," he said. "But you’re also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics." Our ruling Israel said, "Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out."

pomt-11273	"I’ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We’ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/26/evan-jenkins/how-much-have-republicans-cut-epa-budget-staff-two/	The Environmental Protection Agency is not very popular among West Virginia Republicans, who see the agency as threatening the state’s mining jobs through overregulation -- at least until President Donald Trump took office. So, during an April 23 debate between Republican primary candidates for a U.S. Senate seat, it was not surprising to hear the agency criticized. One of the candidates, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, boasted about his efforts to rein in the agency. "I’ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We’ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA," he said. (It’s around 29:30 in the video.) We’ll look at the two parts of this statement separately -- first, the agency’s budget, and second, its employment level. EPA’s budget Jenkins would have been more accurate if he’d said "we’ve" cut half a billion dollars, as he did in the second part of his statement. Obviously, in our constitutional system of checks and balances, individual U.S. House members cannot cut an agency’s budget on their own. On the more substantive question, however, Jenkins was on target. In fact, he lowballed it a little. Historical data from the Office of Management and Budget, shows spending by the EPA at $8.725 billion in 2016; $8.165 billion in 2017; and an estimated $7.916 billion in 2018. The two-year difference between 2016 and 2018 is $809 million, which is more than half a billion dollars, or a 9.2 percent reduction over that two-year span. The actual amount allowed by the omnibus spending bill passed after OMB made its estimate is slightly higher for 2018 -- $8.058 billion. But even at that higher level, the two-year decrease exceeds the half-billion-dollar figure Jenkins cited. Here’s a chart showing EPA’s budget going back to 2009: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So Jenkins’ budget number appears solid. EPA employment For employment, we used a data tool created by the federal Office of Management and Budget called FedScope, which federal employment gurus consider the most accurate information available. FedScope provides detailed employment data on a quarterly basis; the most recent quarter available at the time of Jenkins’ comment was September 2017. For simplicity, we took note of EPA employment in September of every year. In September 2015, EPA employed 15,445 people; in September 2016, it employed 15,634; and in September 2017, it employed 15,058. Over this two-year period, EPA employment fell by 387 people -- well short of the 3,000 Jenkins cited. The only way you can achieve a decrease of 3,000 EPA employees is by comparing the September 2017 level to the September 2012 level -- a five-year period that started before Jenkins was even in Congress. Moreover, EPA employment in 2012 was boosted by spending through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- more commonly known as the stimulus bill signed by President Barack Obama. So a chunk of the jobs lost since then were always intended to be temporary. This chart shows EPA employment every September going back to 2009, according to FedScope: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com When we asked the Partnership for Public Service, a group that studies federal employment, to look at our math, they agreed that it was accurate. Jenkins’ campaign said the candidate was referring to a news release from the House Appropriations Committee that mentioned a decline of 3,106 jobs at the EPA since 2010 -- a longer period than a listener would have assumed hearing Jenkins’ comments at the debate. When more recent data is released, it may show additional decreases in employment at EPA. An EPA plan for a government shutdown in December 2017 said the agency had a staff of 14,449, which was down from the prior shutdown plan in April, which cited a staff size of 15,219, according to the liberal website ThinkProgress. That’s a decline of 770, but it’s still not as high as the 3,000 Jenkins noted. Our ruling Jenkins said, "I’ve cut a half a billion (dollars) out of the EPA just in the last two years. We’ve cut 3,000 jobs out of the EPA." Setting aside his choice of "I" rather than "we," Jenkins has a point about the decrease in the EPA’s budget; in anything, his estimate is actually low. On employment, though, 3,000 jobs shed is an overzealous estimate. To get a number that large, you have to go back at least to 2012, before Jenkins was in Congress. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-03259	"Ohioans can expect to pay up to 41 percent more for their insurance premiums when Obamacare takes effect next year."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/aug/09/mary-taylor/mary-taylor-says-obamacare-will-push-insurance-cos/	Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, who also is the director of the state’s Department of Insurance, is a Republican who has been highly critical of the federal law known as Obamacare. In an email distributed Aug. 3, 2013, by KasichforOhio.com, a message bearing Taylor’s name solicits signatures to an online petition against the Affordable Care Act. "A new study by the Ohio Department of Insurance details how Ohioans can expect to pay up to 41 percent more for their insurance premiums when Obamacare takes effect next year," the message says. Taylor’s note is accompanied by a photo headlined "41% Increase For Ohioans." In the picture, a smiling Barack Obama is looking toward the image of a woman with her hand over her forehead in anguish. Sounded and looked pretty bad. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. We didn’t have to look far for an explanation. When Taylor’s Department of Insurance put out a news release containing essentially the same message, The Plain Dealer investigated the facts behind the study. Reporter Natalie Villacorta and Washington Bureau Chief Stephen Koff talked with the Department of Insurance and also experts who looked at the department’s findings. What they found was that the 41 percent figure applies to one group of people -- individuals buying health insurance policies on the new state marketplace, or exchange. And that’s a small percentage of the population. The majority of Ohioans are insured by group plans, typically offered through their employers. A study done for the state by Milliman, Inc., a consulting firm, found that only 350,000 out of 10 million people with medical coverage in Ohio had these kinds of policies in 2010. That’s 3.5 percent of the people with medical coverage. The study by the Insurance Department, the one Taylor’s claim cites, also drew criticism from outside experts. They noted it did not take into account subsidies that will lessen the costs for many people who buy their policies in the exchange. The average premium for 2014 was estimated at $332.58 a month for individuals, but that figure did not take into account the impact of subsidies that will help reduce out of pocket costs. Taylor acknowledged to The Plain Dealer that the impact of the subsidies was not factored into the estimates. She said that the Insurance Department did not have the necessary information to calculate the impact of the subsidies. But the subsidies could have a broad impact. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 80 to 90 percent of Americans using the exchange will be eligible for income-based federal subsidies. Those who make less than four times the federal poverty level – $45,960 a year for a single person and $94,200 for a family of four – will be eligible. And that can make a big difference. For example, a 30-year-old individual who makes $30,000 will be expected to pay $2,512 in premiums per year. That breaks down to $209 a month. But in that example, subsidies would cover about $76 of the monthly total. One other point is that comparing premiums from 2013 plans with those that will be used in 2014 is tricky. The Insurance Department’s report said 2013’s average premium for individuals was $236. That figure is part of the calculation that yields the 41 percent increase. A spokesman for the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, Larry Levitt, told The Plain Dealer that there are factors in play, though, that make that average figure artificially low. First, cheap policies today often come with steep deductibles and co-payments and limited coverages. And second, it can be hard for people with pre-existing conditions to even qualify to purchase an individual policy. But that changes in 2014, under the Affordable Care Act. Insurers will be required to include coverage for some essential benefits, such as maternity care, in their policies. And, they will not be able to turn away clients with pre-existing conditions. Furthermore, to arrive at the 41 percent average increase, Taylor included all current policies -- including those with deductibles as high as $25,000, which some health policy analysts say barely qualify as health coverage. By contrast, the Affordable Care Act caps out-of-pocket spending for individuals around $6,000 (indexed for inflation). Mathematically, that doesn't make her figure wrong, but qualitatively, it's like comparing a used Chevy to a new Cadillac. So where does that leave Taylor’s claim? She said in the email that "A new study by the Ohio Department of Insurance details how Ohioans can expect to pay up to 41 percent more for their insurance premiums when Obamacare takes effect next year." Taylor didn’t say all Ohioans. By using the words "up to," she implies that some won’t pay that much. And the Department of Insurance did in fact find some people could pay 41 percent more. But someone hearing Taylor’s claim would need to know some important details to put it in full context. While she implies "some Ohioans" rather than all, what her claim makes no mention of is that the 41 percent applies to a very small percentage of Ohioans. Nor does it mention that the figure would be impacted by federal subsidies for which a large percentage of those purchasing policies on the insurance exchange could qualify. And, as the expert from Kaiser noted, figuring average premium costs is tricky because some cheaper policies that lower the average price now won’t be available in 2014, while laws requiring certain coverages could push up the 2014 averages. On the Truth-O-Meter, Taylor’s claim rates Half True.	None	Mary Taylor	None	None	None	2013-08-09T18:00:00	2013-08-03	['Ohio']
pomt-01571	A poll found that "20% of young adults use (smartphones) during sex."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/10/arianna-huffington/huffington-20-young-adults-use-smartphones-during-/	The unveiling of the Apple Watch, a bit of wearable tech that puts a lot of iPhone features on your wrist for easy viewing, prompted an intriguing tweet from media mogul Arianna Huffington. The founder of the Huffington Post wrote, "As it is 20% of young adults use their devices during sex. Prepare for ‘Honey, I'm checking how many calories we're burning on my #iWatch!’ " We don’t know if wearable tech will mesh with moments when little — if anything — is worn, but the statistical reference to smartphones and sex raised the eyebrows of one of our fans, New York Times Upshot reporter Josh Barro, who tweeted asking for a fact check. We asked Huffington for her source and she pointed us to a Huffington Post article from about a year ago. Indeed, Jumio, a firm involved with mobile credit and debit card payment systems, commissioned a distinctly non-random online survey of mobile consumer habits. Topping the press release was the finding that 9 percent of adults say they have used a smartphone during sex. For those 18 to 34, the percentage rises to 20 percent. (Huffington said use, while the study asked "have used.") We asked Jenny Davis, the media contact for the survey, if there were any other details. In particular, we wanted to know what people were doing with their phones at times when their attention might be focused elsewhere. "That’s the question everybody has," Davis said. "The survey didn’t go further. I’ve always thought a follow-up study would be interesting. Are they playing music? Are they taking pictures?" Or looking up recipes, who knows? The online report of the poll, we should note, included this word of caution. "This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated." That’s an important distinction for anyone who knows anything about polling, and means that you shouldn’t consider the results scientific or all together meaningful. Our ruling Huffington said that 20 percent of young adults use mobile devices during sex. That, for the most part, accurately reflects the findings of an unscientific online poll. While the poll itself is dubious, there is no better information available to contradict the poll of Huffington's claim. Maybe the new Apple Watch will have an app for that one day.

pomt-04429	"David Cicilline was the state representative who opposed tough mandatory sentences for those convicted of domestic violence and child abuse."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/15/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-us-rep-david-cicilline-when-h/	Republican Brendan Doherty, the former superintendent of the state police, has been mining incumbent U.S. Rep. David Cicilline’s past votes in the state legislature and his work as a criminal defense lawyer to portray the Democrat as someone unwilling to stand up for the victimized. One of those charges, made in an Oct. 9 news release, was that, as a state representative in the 1990s, Cicilline was against mandatory sentences for those convicted of domestic violence and child abuse. The charge was part of a flurry of political counterpunches Doherty unloaded against Cicilline after the Democratic incumbent linked Republican Doherty to what the Democrats are saying is the Republican Party’s "war on women." Doherty’s campaign claimed it was hypocritical for Cicilline to make such a charge when he cast votes as a state representative that indicated a lack of support for victims of domestic violence or child abuse. The Doherty campaign backed up the charge with citations. In 1995, as a state representative from Providence, Cicilline was one of seven House members to vote against a bill that set mandatory minimum sentences for those who were convicted of domestic violence a second time. In 1996, they said Cicilline also voted against a law that established a 10-year minimum sentence for first-degree child abuse of a child under six. Those sentenced also had to serve at least eight and a half years before being eligible for parole. We checked the official record and confirmed that Cicilline voted against both bills. The 1995 law on domestic violence set a 10-day minimum sentence for a second conviction of misdemeanor domestic assault. The mandatory minimum went up to a year for a third conviction. It also required anyone sentenced under the law to pay a $25 fee to a state fund that paid for state programs on domestic violence training. It also obligated those sentenced to seek counseling. The bill passed the House 83-7 and was signed into law. The second vote came on a bill that had become known as Brendan’s Law. It was proposed in response to the public outrage over the case of six-week old Brendan Cunha, who was left blind, deaf and brain-damaged after a brutal beating by his father, Michael Bertrand, in 1993. Bertrand was given a 10-year prison sentence and 10 years of probation, which meant he was eligible for parole after two years. In 1998, however, the Parole Board not only denied his request, it voted never to consider a request from him again and ordered he serve the full 10 years. During the 1996 debate on the bill, Cicilline proposed an amendment that would have allowed a judge to consider an alternative to the 10-year minimum if the judge found "that substantial and compelling circumstances exist" to justify such an action. The amendment failed on a 60-18 vote and the final bill passed, 77-6, with Cicilline in the minority. Cicilline campaign spokesman Eric Hyers said Cicilline’s votes were based on his longstanding belief that judges in the courtroom, who have heard the evidence and arguments in a case, are more qualified to determine appropriate sentences. "He strongly believes that judges, not politicians, not elected officials -- should be making sentencing decisions," Hyers said. Our ruling Brendan Doherty’s campaign said David Cicilline voted against a 1995 bill that imposed harsher sentences on those convicted a second time of domestic violence and a 1996 bill that did the same for convicted child abusers. The legislative record shows Cicilline did vote against both bills. We rule Doherty’s statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-04067	"Even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/23/jackie-speier/rep-jackie-speier-says-poll-shows-nra-members-beli/	On the president’s list of gun-control priorities: require background checks for all gun sales. That step has widespread support, even among gun owners, gun-control advocates say. In fact, many assume such a measure is already in place, claimed Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who is vice chair of a new congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. "Even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check," she told Ed Schultz in a Jan. 15, 2013, appearance on MSNBC’s The Ed Show. We wondered: Is that true? We asked Speier’s office to point us to the poll. Mayors Against Illegal Guns Speier’s communications director, Jenny Werwa, told us the lawmaker based her comment on a July 2012 poll commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. As its name suggests, the group includes city mayors concerned with illegal guns and gun violence and is helmed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat. The group hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz. His organization, Luntz Global, polled 945 gun owners nationwide in May 2012, half of whom were gun owners who were "current or lapsed" members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners. The poll showed that "gun owners’ knowledge of existing laws is tenuous," Luntz Global’s report says. "Over half (53 percent ) of non-NRA members and 57 percent of NRA members believe the statement, ‘Everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check to complete the purchase’ is true." The reality is that background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but not for those by private sellers. The White House wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which supports the current background check requirement, has suggested that an expansion of the law might be a step toward gun confiscation. What the NRA says We contacted NRA spokesmen to ask for their evaluation of Speier’s claim, but they didn’t respond. We found an NRA response, however, to a similar poll by Mayors Against Illegal Guns conducted by Frank Luntz in 2009. The Web post calls Bloomberg an "anti-gun politician-activist," and attacks Luntz, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with decade-old criticism from two polling organizations. In other words, the NRA attacked the source of the previous poll, not the results. We looked for other polls to see if they exposed weakness in the poll’s conclusions. We didn’t immediately find a survey that addressed gun owners’ knowledge of existing laws. But the Luntz poll also asked about support for "requiring a criminal background check of anyone purchasing a gun." The poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of NRA members. Recent independent polls show similar numbers. A Pew Research Center poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of gun owners favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks — nearly identical to the Luntz poll. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted Jan. 11-15 among 1,110 adults showed that 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member support universal background checks. Our ruling Rep. Jackie Speier said, "even members of the NRA, when they were polled recently, were under the impression that everyone has a criminal background check." She relied on a poll conducted last summer by an interest group that broke out results for "current or lapsed" NRA members. It showed a majority of those NRA gun owners believe "everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check." While we didn’t find recent polls asking a similar question, we did find other polls showing that NRA members support background checks for all, including private purchases and purchases at gun shows. It should be clarified that the Luntz poll results were for current and former NRA members. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00505	American schools are "more segregated than they were in the 1960s."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/25/hillary-clinton/american-schools-are-more-segregated-they-were-196/	Speaking at a black church near Ferguson, Mo., Hillary Clinton applauded efforts to remove Confederate flags before challenging America to own up to its racist past and confront "hard truths" about bigotry in the present. The shooting in Charleston, S.C., was no isolated incident, but an extreme manifestation of institutionalized racism, she said. "The truth is equality, opportunity, civil rights in America are still far from where they need to be," Clinton said on June 23. "Our schools are still segregated, in fact, more segregated than they were in the 1960s." The Supreme Court declared segregation "inherently unequal" and unconstitutional in its landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Sixty years later, have we really regressed and resegregated? It’s important to note that modern school segregation is not the same as the government-sanctioned social system that the Supreme Court struck down in 1954. Segregation today refers to the level of isolation of minority students, which can be measured in a variety of ways. Clinton's comment omits a lot of nuance. Not quite Jim Crow The Clinton campaign pointed us to a passage in a 2014 study by UCLA Graduate School of Education’s Civil Rights Project that tracked the amount of southern black students attending white schools in the South. By that yardstick, schools are slightly less integrated now than they were in 1968. That’s the year the Supreme Court mandated the enforcement of desegregation in Green vs. County School Board and diverse classrooms really started to become reality. Clinton, however, bookended the 1960s as the point of comparison and her claim doesn’t hold true for the better part of the decade. Jim Crow laws were still in place until the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and despite the Brown decision, most black students in the South still didn’t attend white schools,"the kind of schools that provided strong potential opportunities for diverse learning experiences," according to the study. In 1967, one in 100 black students went to a white school. In 1960, it was one in 1,000. "It’s true that segregation for blacks is worse today than it was in 1968, but it’s certainly not worse than 1964 and before," said Gary Orfield, a UCLA professor of education and lead author of the study Clinton cited. Even if we take 1968 to represent the 1960s, Clinton’s claim has issues if we look at different ways of measuring segregation. The UCLA report also considers how many black students are isolated in overwhelmingly black schools. Across the United States, fewer black students attend these schools now than they did in 1968 (four in 10 versus six in 10), signalling a decline in segregation. A separate study by Charles Clotfelter, a professor of public policy and economics at Duke University, measured the potential for black and white students to interact. According to that data, segregation has been declining since the 1970s, albeit at a slower rate in the past decade. Rainbows here, black and white there Clinton’s blanket statement also leaves out regional and demographic nuances in the UCLA study. According to that data, the South is now the least racially divided region in the United States when it comes to school segregation, and no state in Dixie is among the top five most segregated by any yardstick. For example, a third of black students are isolated in black schools in the South, compared to half of black students in the Northeast and 40 percent on average. How did the South surpass the rest of the nation in diversity? It’s a mixture of the judicial mandates in the 1960s and modern geography. "The South is really the only place where we seriously enforced desegregation," said Orfield, the lead author of the UCLA study. "Large school jurisdictions," added Clotfelter, the Duke professor. "That means that it's not possible to slice up into such small bits, like a metropolitan area where the districts dramatically differ." In contrast, the densely populated cities of the Northeast and West are becoming more and more segregated. On the Pacific coast, Clinton’s claim is on the money: Latino students are now more isolated than black students and "more segregated than they’ve ever been," according to Orfield. "Latinos have increased more than five times over in the number of students since the 1960s," he said. "Demographics is the largest factor (in their segregation) but there’s a lot of history as well. There was never was much of a desegregation effort for Latinos." Two steps forward, one step back Clinton does have a strong point that American schools have relapsed into monochrome. Classrooms were the most diverse from the 1970s through the early 1990s. At peak integration, four out of 10 black southern students attended a white school, while less than a third of all black students attended black schools. "We’ve lost a lot of the progress we gained, no doubt about that," Clotfelter said. Experts say the backslide was the consequence of a series of judicial decisions, beginning with Milliken vs. Bradley in 1974, a relatively unheard of but seminal case in the desegregation saga. Criticized by some as "one of the worst Supreme Court decisions" ever, Milliken dealt with Detroit’s plan to integrate students by busing them from the intercity to the suburbs. The court ruled that such a plan was unconstitutional, arguing that black students had the right to attend integrated schools within their own school district, but were not protected from de facto segregation. "That decision … said the racial disparities across districts would remain outside the reach of policymakers," Clotfelter wrote in piece exploring the impact of Milliken. "The maximum amount of interracial contact one could strive for, then, would be limited by the two remaining factors: balkanization of jurisdictions and household choices about where to live." Court-mandated desegregation was dealt its own deadly blow by three rulings from the Supreme Court between 1991 and 1995. According to the court, integration was only a temporary federal policy and after the historical imbalance was righted, school districts should reclaim local control and were released from desegregation orders. Since then, school segregation has been intrinsically tied to the racial gaps in housing and income, leading to the re-emergence of the color line. Economic segregation, which disproportionately affects black and Latino students, is increasing, pointed out Orfield. He noted that in California, Asian and white students are 10 times more likely to go to a high-quality school than Latinos and therefore dramatically more likely to attend college. "We’ve lost something very vital," he said. "Inequality is very related to the double segregation of low-income racial minorities and (their) isolation from the middle class, from the best teachers, the best curriculum. That has become very profound." Our ruling Hillary Clinton said, "In America today, our schools are more segregated than they were in the 1960s." Overall, experts say and the data shows that the United States has taken two steps forward and one step back, but hasn’t quite reverted to pre-Civil Rights levels of segregation. Clinton would have been more accurate setting her time frame a little later. But she has a strong point that the country has fallen back from the high levels of diversity that existed from the 1970s to the early 1990s. On the whole, we rate her statement Mostly True.

An article on fake news website Politicono.com got that fact right but nothing else. The Dec. 3 article carried the headline, "Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because ‘Santa Was Always White In The Bible.’" The article quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America "into the ground," on the basis of Santa "always having been white in the Bible," and, "No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong," The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things. Politicono.com, which calls itself a "hybrid news/satire platform," takes real news hooks and builds fake stories on top of them. Every article has a "show facts" button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated. When you click the "show facts" button on the Palin article, it highlights as fact the first paragraph, which is about the Mall of America’s real decision to hire a black Santa. But the entire rest of the article, detailing Palin’s supposed call to boycott the mall because of the Bible’s teachings on Santa, is completely made up. "Dear Democrats, this is what ‘fake news’ actually looks like, and I guarantee you no Trump voter actually fell for this," Palin wrote on Facebook Dec. 20, with a link to a Breitbart article debunking the Politicono.com post. Politicano.com is more forthcoming than other fake news sites about the fact that it posts made-up content. But it’s still not immediately apparent that its editors fabricated the story claiming Palin said she would boycott the Mall of America because Santa was always white in the Bible.

Ramos appeared on Fox News on May 12 and told Tucker Carlson that there is "no invasion" of immigrants coming illegally.

"You know, whatever we’re doing at the border somehow is working. Some of the safest communities in the United States are along the border," Ramos said. "So, I don't think a wall is really going to help." Studies show immigrants are less likely to commit crime than the native-born population, though the Trump administration often backs its tough stance against illegal immigration with claims that immigrants bring a wave of crime and threaten public safety. We wanted to know if the border region has some of the country’s safest communities, as Ramos claimed. FBI data shows they have lower violent crime rates than other places (though the FBI has cautioned against making safety comparisons), and some local crime statistics show drops in crime in recent years. One possible explanation: Border towns have a heavier presence of federal and local law enforcement. The U.S.-Mexico region includes the four U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas and six Mexican states. Some estimates pin the population in the border region (from both Mexico and the United States) at more than 15 million people, as of 2015. Many of the residents live on one side of the border and work on the other, with likely 1 million legal border crossings daily. Ramos has a point that these communities tend to be safe. The most common kinds of crime are those that ail other poor communities, such as drinking and driving, and domestic violence, said Tony Payan, a fellow and director of the Mexico Center at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. "The murder rates, however, are indeed very low," Payan said. He said it’s very difficult to tell exactly why those communities don’t have high levels of crime, but would not disregard as a deterrent the heavy presence of law enforcement. "But it may also have to do with other issues like the crime levels among migrants," Payan said. "It is well known, contrary to what Mr. Trump may say, that crime among migrant communities is lower than that among natives. And those communities tend to have very high migrant communities and foreign-born populations." When we asked Ramos about his comment, he pointed to reports in the Huffington Post and the Texas Tribune. The April 2015 Huffington Post report quotes former U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner David Aguilar at a 2015 Border Security Expo event. Aguilar reportedly said that border communities are safer than the interior of each of the border states — as well as Washington, D.C. — and "violent crime is lesser along the border than it is in the interior." Robert Harris, then a commander heading a joint task force for the Department of Homeland Security, told the Huffington Post that violence on the Mexican side of the border did not reach the United States sector because criminal groups were less organized in the United States. The February 2016 Texas Tribune analysis offered some support for Ramos’ statement. The Tribune article said that based on state and federal data, violent crime rates in many border cities either remained the same or dropped between 2009 and 2014 -- setting them apart from larger cities in the state. In Houston, for instance, the violent crime rate was at 991 crimes for every 100,000 residents, according to data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. The border cities of Laredo, El Paso, Edinburg and Brownsville recorded fewer than 400 crimes for every 100,000 residents, the Tribune said. It’s important to keep in mind that the FBI has warned against using its data to rank and compare the safety of communities, because such comparisons may neglect unique factors in each locale. CQ Press years ago ceased using the words "safest" and "dangerous" in its annual rankings of cities with the lowest and highest crime rate. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas considered the FBI’s cautionary note in a past fact-check of a claim that El Paso is the safest city in Texas and in the United States. PolitiFact Texas rated that claim Half True, because it was based on CQ Press’ past lists and related news stories that labeled El Paso the safest. Also, the rankings did not factor in every Texas burg and did not account for differences in population density, PolitiFact Texas found. (PolitiFact Texas analyzed crime in Texas in another fact-check in 2014, rating Half True a claim about less crime in the Rio Grande Valley than in other major Texas cities.) In its report, the Tribune also noted that border communities have a large presence of local and federal law enforcement officers. Ponce Treviño, Webb County Jail commander, told the news organization: "You've got to understand, we're a border city so we have a lot of local law enforcement. You have Laredo (Police Department). You have Webb County Sheriff's Office. You've got the constables. Then you have the federal government here. You've got customs. You've got border patrol. You've got ICE. You have a big influx of law enforcement and there's officer presence, so that makes the crime rate a lot lower." In 2011, the Austin American-Statesman analyzed all 14 counties sharing a border with Mexico and two dozen border cities. It found that between 2006 and 2010, violent crime on the U.S. side fell 3.3 percent. The combined number of murders in the 14 counties also dropped, from 97 in 2006 to 73 in 2010, according to the newspaper. The newspaper said its data analysis did not paint a picture of "out-of-control chaos" at the border, although some areas did see a rise in crime. "Violent crime increased in seven border counties, although those tended to be among the region's least populated, so a small number of incidents can have an outsize effect on rates," the Statesman reported. "Aggravated assaults, in particular, spiked in Starr County and the city of El Paso, the latter long held up as a paragon of border safety." While violent crime overall decreased in the border, it "badly trailed" the more than 12 percent statewide decrease in that same timeframe, the newspaper found. Our ruling Ramos said, "Some of the safest communities in the United States are along the border." Violent crime rates in some border communities are lower than in other parts of the United States, according to FBI data. The FBI has warned against using its crime rates to rank communities’ safety because doing so overlooks other factors. Yet, local law enforcement officials have said crime is low in their border communities, and heavy federal and local law enforcement presence may be deterring crime in border communities. Overall, we rate Ramos’ statement Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jorge Ramos	None	None	None	2017-05-17T17:10:55	2017-05-12	['United_States']
pomt-06520	U.S. unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 is "18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/10/matthew-rothschild/progressive-magazine-editor-says-young-worker-unem/	Activists participating in Occupy Wall Street, a movement that protests greed, corporate influence and unemployment, began camping out in New York’s financial district in September 2011 and have spawned similar demonstrations around the country. Supporters include the left-leaning political advocacy group MoveOn.org and Russ Feingold, the former Democratic U.S. senator from Wisconsin, who said "accountability for corporate greed is long overdue." As part of what is being billed as an international protest, local offshoots of the Occupy Wall Street plan to demonstrate in Milwaukee, Madison and Appleton on Oct. 15, 2011. On Oct. 4, 2011, Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardindiscussed the demonstrations with Matthew Rothschild, editor and publisher of The Progressive. The 102-year-old Madison magazine calls itself "one of the leading voices for peace and social justice in this country." When Cardin asked Rothschild why younger people are leading the demonstrations, he said: "The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high." Is the rate for younger workers that high? Unemployment has been a major issue since the start of the recession in December 2007 -- and not just for people in their late teens and early 20s. The U.S. Department of Labor reported, for example, that in December 2009, unemployment reached a record 7.2 percent among people ages 55 and over and that people in that age group spent an average of 35 weeks out of work -- considerably more than the average of 23 weeks for unemployed people ages 16 to 24. In making his claim about younger workers, Rothschild told us he was quoting an April 2011 report from the Economic Policy Institute. It said: "In 2010, the unemployment rate for workers age 16-24 was 18.4 percent — the worst on record in the 60 years that this data has been tracked." So, although Rothschild said the current rate of unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 is at a 60-year high, he was referring to the annual rate for 2010. The Economic Policy Institute is a liberal-leaning Washington, D.C. think tank that says it seeks to "broaden discussions about economic policy to include the needs of low- and middle-income workers." Its report -- which urges "substantial additional stimulus spending" by the federal government to create jobs for younger workers -- says the unemployment statistics came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau is the federal government’s statistics keeper on unemployment. We queried the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ database to create a chart showing the monthly and annual unemployment rates for people ages 16 to 24 from 1948 through August 2011. We found that the Economic Policy Institute report was correct: Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 18.4 percent in 2010; and that rate is higher than any annual rate dating back to when statistics were first kept in 1948. That’s more than 60 years. The next-highest annual rates, each exceeding 17 percent, were posted in 1982, 1983 and 2009. In each of the first eight months of 2011, however, the rate has been below the 2010 mark of 18.4 percent. Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 17.7 percent in August 2011, the most recent month for which statistics are available. And the year-to-date average is 17.6 percent. So, the rate is lower today than it was for 2010 as a whole, though only eight months of 2011 are accounted for. We don’t know, of course, how the year will end up. Our conclusion Rothschild said unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 "is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high." The 18.4 percent is correct as the average rate for 2010, and that average annual rate is the highest in more than 60 years. More recent figures, however, show the unemployment rate among people ages 16 to 24 has dipped below 18 percent in 2011, at least through August. We rate Rothschild’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-14537	"Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed (gun) dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/15/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-virginia-law-bars-private-gun-selle/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe says Virginia’s law requiring background checks on prospective gun buyers would be substantially broadened under a bipartisan agreement he’s struck with the General Assembly. Virginia now requires federally licensed dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to conduct computerized checks to see whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales between individuals are exempt and that, the governor says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. McAuliffe, a Democrat, is backing legislation that would position state police at Virginia gun shows to conduct voluntary background checks on the private sales. "Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one," McAuliffe said during a Feb. 3 interview with Mike Valerio of WWBT-TV in Richmond. "We changed that law." McAuliffe made a similar claim during a Feb. 1 interview on WJLA-TV in Washington. "Even if the non-licensed dealer today wants to do a background check, he is prohibited by law," he said. Those claims and others by the governor were disputed in a full-page ad taken out in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Feb. 9 by Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown accuses McAuliffe, who promised in his 2013 campaign to seek background checks for all gun buyers, of backing weak reforms. The ad said "voluntary background checks already exist" for private sellers. So we decided to investigate whether the governor is right in saying that an unlicensed seller in Virginia - say, someone who wants to get rid of a rifle or a handgun he has at home - now is legally barred at a gun show from getting a background check on a potential buyer. Under state law, a person seeking to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer is required to fill out a form stating that he never has been convicted of a felony or adjudicated mentally incompetent and that he is not subject to a restraining order. The dealer forwards the information to the state police, which performs an "instant background check" and tells the dealer whether he can sell the gun to the customer. Virginia’s law allows only federally licensed dealers to contact the state police for the check. "The private seller, they can’t even ask for a background check from the state police," Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, told us on the phone. But that doesn’t mean a private seller is without recourse. He still can ask a licensed dealer to conduct a background check on the potential buyer but, if the dealer is willing, it becomes a complicated process. Under state law, licensed dealers can do background checks only for the purchase of firearms that are in their inventory. A private seller seeking a background check could convey his gun on consignment to a dealer, said Corinne Geller, public relations manager for the state police. That’s not an unusual occurrence, according to David Hathcock, manager of Bob Moates Sports Shop in Chesterfield County, a licensed dealer of firearms. "Most people want to make sure their guns to wind up in good hands," he told us, adding "At any given time, I have 50 to 100 guns on consignment" in the store. Moates, however, only does business from his store. And McAuliffe, in his comments, was specifically referring to private sellers at gun shows being barred from getting a background check. We spoke to three Virginia dealers on Feb. 14 who had tables set up at The Nation’s Gun Show in Chantilly. They all told us the governor’s statement is wrong and they are occasionally approached by a private seller and a buyer seeking a check. The dealers said they’ll run the background check for a fee -- usually $25 to $35 -- to compensate for the trouble of putting the gun in their inventory and storing the information for a required 20 years. "We do it all the time; it’s absolutely legal," said Brian Parrish, owner of Triune Shooting Sports in Warrenton. He told us he gets an average "one or two" such requests at every gun show. Sonny Condon, owner on Sonny’s Guns & Transfers in Richmond, said it’s rare when he gets such a request from a private seller, "but it does happen." Jerry Cochran, owner of Trader Jerry’s in Tazewell County, said he only recently became aware that he could run a background check for a private seller. "I’ve done five of them in the last month," he said. McAuliffe’s measure would streamline the procedure by allowing a private seller to go straight to the state police at a gun show to request a background check. But, as before, neither the seller nor the buyer would be required legally to seek the check. McAuliffe warns that a private seller who bypasses the new system could face increased liability if a gun he sold was used in a crime. Philip Van Cleave, president of the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense League, said he thinks more private sellers will seek background checks if the legislation passes, "but it’s not going to be earth-shaking." The bill, we should note, sailed through the House of Delegates on a 96-3 vote on Feb. 10 and now is pending in the Senate. Our ruling McAuliffe says, "Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed (gun) dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one." The law requires only licensed dealers - those in the business of selling guns - to conduct background checks on a prospective buyer. As such, only licensed dealers are allowed to contact the state police to request the check. A private seller has no direct access to the background-check process. That doesn’t mean a private seller determined to get a background check is out in the cold. He can ask a gun dealer to conduct the check for him. But that’s a messy process that requires a lot of paperwork and the private seller to temporarily convey his gun to the dealer. So McAuliffe misspeaks when he says the law prohibits the private seller from getting a background check. But the law does make it very difficult for the private seller - who is under no obligation to seek a background check - to get one. We rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-04079	Abraham Lincoln "visited and some say even danced in (the Ohio Senate) chamber."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/21/keith-faber/says-abraham-lincoln-spoke-ohio-senate-chamber-and/	Abraham Lincoln was both loved and hated in his own time, but few political figures are more revered in ours. That made him a logical reference for the newly elected president of the Ohio Senate, Keith Faber, when the 130th General Assembly met for the first time on Jan. 7. Delivering the president's customary opening remarks, Faber, a Republican from west-central Ohio, spoke of the legislature's traditions and responsibilities and asked for a spirit of cooperation: "Lincoln, who visited and some say even danced in this chamber, appealed in his first inaugural address to 'the better angels of our nature,'" he said. "I echo that call for civility today. I believe we should seek to compromise on policy but never to compromise on principle, and you will always have my profound respect for acting on conviction – knowing that at times we might disagree." While PolitiFact Ohio could appreciate his thoughts on civility, the historical tidbit was the music to our ears. We knew that Lincoln danced -- he met his future wife, Mary Todd, at a cotillion in Springfield, Ill. -- and we knew he spoke at the Ohio Statehouse. But dancing there was new to us. It didn't take long to find supporting background, among the historical facts buried in the "Chamber Tour" portion of the Ohio Senate website: "While the Ohio House of Representatives can boast that former President Abraham Lincoln spoke in the House Chamber," it says, "legend has it that before he was president, Lincoln danced on the Senate floor. Some sources suggest that during Lincoln's 1859 visit to Columbus as a presidential candidate, he attended a Statehouse ball in which he shared a dance with the lovely Kate Chase, daughter of former Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, who would later serve in Lincoln's cabinet." Chase, earlier a U.S. senator and later chief justice of the United States, was Lincoln's treasury secretary and a presidential hopeful himself. His daughter Katherine was his staunchest supporter and the widower's official hostess. (We’ll also add a bonus tidbit: Chase whose face appears on the $10,000 note, is one of the three non-presidents who, along with Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin, are featured on U.S. paper currency.) Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin tells more about the story in the magisterial biography "Team of Rivals." The movie "Lincoln" is loosely based on a portion of it. Lincoln visited Columbus in February 1861 on the way to his March inauguration in Washington. While meeting with the governor in the Statehouse, Lincoln was notified that the votes for the Electoral College had been counted, confirming him as the next president. Goodwin writes that Lincoln "attended a lavish military ball, where it was said that he danced with Chase's lovely daughter, Kate, much to the irritation of Mary. The image of Lincoln dancing with the 20-year-old beauty, tall, slim, and captivating, was spoken of in hushed tones for many years afterward. "In fact," Goodwin continues, "the charismatic young belle could not have danced with Lincoln that evening, for she was absent from the city when the Lincolns arrived. In an interview with a reporter more than three decades later, Kate maintained that 'Mrs. Lincoln was piqued that I did not remain at Columbus to see her, and I have always felt that this was the chief reason why she did not like me at Washington.’" According to the source notes for "Team of Rivals," the story of the dance "was told to the author by a tour guide at the Ohio Statehouse during a visit to Columbus in 1998." That puts the story solidly in the category of Statehouse lore -- a classification confirmed by the Senate website, which adds more: "As the story goes, the dance was cut short due to a jealous Mary Todd Lincoln. However, many, many years later, Statehouse lore suggests that the two may have tried to finish their dance. At the turn of the 20th century, former Ohio Senator and Governor Joseph B. Foraker heard waltz music blaring through the locked doors of the Senate Chamber while he was working in his Senate office late one night. When he looked through the chamber window, he saw a tall, slender man with a petite woman in a Victorian-age hoop skirt. Foraker identified the pair as Lincoln and Ms. Chase, but unfortunately, no one else was there to corroborate his story." PolitiFact will leave ghost-hunting to others. We will presume that Lincoln did not spell out O-H-I-O with his arms, and we know that he never heard a band playing "Hang on Sloopy" or even "Carmen Ohio." But we know that Lincoln visited the Statehouse on several occasions, and that he attended receptions and a ball. And Faber left himself room to two-step by phrasing the claim about dancing as "some say." Some do say, and not without justification, that he danced there. He didn’t dance with Kate Chase, which is a bit of lore that Faber wisely left out of his opening day remarks. On the Truth-O-Meter, Faber’s claim rates True.

pomt-08386	"What is the maximum number of students allowed in your classroom? ... 30 or more!"	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/24/vote-no-8/vote-no-group-claims-amendment-will-lead-classes-m/	A battle has erupted among parents, educators, taxpayers and politicians about how many students should be allowed in Florida classrooms. That battle will be waged on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot when voters statewide will decide on Amendment 8, which would change the rules about class sizes that voters approved in 2002. Groups urging Floridians to vote yes or no have created catchy websites and mailers with photos of eager students, stern-looking teachers in crisp white button-down shirts and claims about what will happen to children's futures. In a related Truth-O-Meter, we examined a claim from a group pushing for passage of Amendment 8 about the number of empty classroom seats statewide. We rated that claim as Mostly True. In this Truth-O-Meter, we will examine a claim by the group opposing passage of the amendment. In a mailer we saw Oct. 18, 2010, the Vote NO on 8 group wrote: "Amendment 8 dramatically increases the number of students per class by at least 20%. In fact, some classes will have over 30 students!" The other side of the flier resembles a test question and asks "What is the maximum number of students allowed in your classroom?" It shows five numbers crossed out ranging from 18 to 29 and a pencil broken in half, then states the answer: "30 or more!" If Amendment 8 passes, will there be "30 or more" students in a classroom? First, some background. The 2002 amendment was intended to limit classrooms to 18 students per teacher in kindergarten through third grade, 22 for fourth through eighth grade, and 25 for high school classes. The rules apply to core courses, and don't include some courses such as gym or band. The amendment was phased in over time -- last year schools could go over the limit as long as they met average class sizes for the school. This school year was the first time that districts must meet the caps in each classroom. Amendment 8 would tweak the rules to allow class sizes to be measured based on school averages rather than on individual classrooms -- though there are also caps in terms of how many students can be assigned per teacher. To pass, the amendment needs 60 percent of the vote. Supporters of the amendment say the 2002 rules are too rigid and expensive to implement. According to the Florida Department of Education, districts have spent about $15.8 billion through the 2009-2010 school year on class size implementation statewide and are on track to spend an additional $2.9 billion for the 2010-2011 school year.. But opponents say it's crucial to limit class sizes as the previous amendment intended. The Florida Department of Education has a handy website that explains how the rules would change if voters approve the constitutional amendment. The new rules state that the maximum class size would be calculated based on a schoolwide average in core classes: • 18 students in prekindergarten through grade 3; • 22 students in grades 4 through 8; • 25 students in grades 9 through 12. Also, the new rules would set the maximum number of students assigned to each teacher while not exceeding the schoolwide average: • 21 students in prekindergarten through grade 3; • 27 students in grades 4 through 8; • 30 students in grades 9 through 12. Note that the Department of Education says that if Amendment 8 passes, the maximum number of students per classroom would be 30 -- not "more than" 30 -- and that figure only applies in grades 9 through 12. But it isn't as rigid as it seems. We asked Ingrid Olsen, spokeswoman for Vote NO on 8, how the group arrived at the "30 or more" figure. Their conclusion is two-fold: one part has to do with those non-core classes such as physical education and band -- a simpler issue we will address first -- and the other part has to do with districts trying to "game" the system, Olsen says. "The class size requirements of this subsection do not apply to extracurricular classes....,'' Olsen wrote in an e-mail "Accordingly, a significant number of classes in all grade levels now do, and will continue to be able to exceed the maximum class size goals (i.e., it will not be unusual for those classes to vastly exceed 30 students; it occurs today)." Thomas Butler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, confirmed for us that the class size rules don't apply to non-core classes. But that's the case right now -- and will be the case whether Amendment 8 passes or fails. Olsen also wrote: "In their attempts to comply with the class size requirements in the absence of the required funding from the state, we are hearing about school districts gaming the system; a practice which will become more widespread if Amendment 8 were to be enacted. Doubling up classes with a primary teacher and an associate teacher, renaming core classes to resemble non-core classes and carrying ghost teacher assignments on rosters, are practices which appear to be occurring today. Amendment 8 will cause increases in those actions." (No -- ghost teachers aren't educators who dress in scary costumes and distribute chocolate bars for Halloween. We'll explain who they are later.) We asked Olsen to point us to specific examples of districts taking such actions. Here are the people and sources she sent us to: • We interviewed Beverley Dowell, who teaches 5th grade language arts and other subjects at Treasure Island Elementary in North Bay Village in Miami-Dade County. Dowell told us that she has 41 students in one of her sections -- the most she has ever had during her on- and off-again teaching career that started in 1971. Dowell said she has a paraprofessional who assists her and sometimes another teacher. Miami-Dade school spokesman John Schuster confirmed Dowell's class size. He said she can have 41 students because the school's reading coach shares responsibilities with the teacher and a paraprofessional assists. • From an Aug. 21, 2010, article in the Miami Herald about schools facing the class size deadline: "For a while, some districts considered ignoring the limits and paying millions in fines, figuring that would be cheaper than corralling enough teachers to make the teacher-student ratios work. In the end, most found creative ways to comply, such as offering more Internet-based virtual classes to older students and shifting athletic directors and media specialists into the classrooms to teach." • Several additional news sources across the state stated that some schools are using co-teaching or associate teaching (which adds a lower-paid educator to the classroom) to allow more students in each classroom since there is more than one educator. An Aug. 22, 2010, story in the St. Petersburg Times stated: "Some schools have moved to co-teachers, effectively doubling the number of students they can house in a classroom." • A letter from T. Alan Cox, principal of Lawton Chiles High School in Tallahassee, told parents as the new school year approached that "One adjustment that was made at Chiles that will allow a core class to have more than twenty-five students is the participation of more than one teacher per class" -- a reference to him hiring associate teachers. (The letter we saw did not have a date but it starts with "summer is quickly coming to a close.") And now, about those ghost teachers. Lynda Russell, a public policy advocate for the Florida Education Association who is aligned with the Vote NO side, said a ghost teacher refers to math or reading coaches who aren't assigned a classroom because they are floaters who assist students in need. Russell said coaches have been asked to sign paperwork showing they are responsible for a classroom -- though they are essentially assigned one on paper only, hence the reference to "ghost." We asked her for proof that this is occurring and she said she obtained an e-mail from a union official in Osceola County from a coach who raised questions about this practice. We asked for the e-mail but have not received it. "Right now we've got this limit that is not adhered to at 25," Russell said. So if Amendment 8 passes, we will have a cap "that is not adhered to at 30." We asked Butler, the DOE spokesman, whether districts can use co-teaching to increase those caps on numbers of students in the classroom if Amendment 8 passes. He said co-teaching is allowed and pointed us to a statute that shows several other options including virtual instruction programs or use non-traditional school calendars or hours. If Amendment 8 passes, will there be "30 or more!" students in classrooms? That depends. For starters, the class size issue is far too complicated for such a simple numerical claim without explanation on a mailer. The suggestion that there will be "30 or more!" students in "your classroom" could suggest to the average reader that school classes could hit those numbers in any classroom no matter what subject or age. While there are certain ways that could occur, it's impossible to quantify at this point how often that will happen under Amendment 8. Yes, there will be more than 30 students in non-core classes -- but that's the case today. And the number "30" only applies to 9th through 12th grades -- the numbers are lower for younger children. But as the Vote NO group points out, districts across the state are experimenting with co-teaching this year that allows them to put two educators in a room and therefore more students than the caps. If they're doing that now, they could continue that practice if Amendment 8 passes. But all that is a lot of omitted context and clarification, so we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00467	"President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did (for African-American employment) in eight years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/15/sarah-huckabee-sanders/white-house-base-comparing-african-american-job-gr/	During a testy White House daily briefing that included discussion of former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman and her new tell-all book, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered a series of favorable statistics about the economy under President Donald Trump. At one point, Sanders said, "This president, since he took office, in the year and a half he’s been here, has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans. … When President Obama left, after eight years in office — eight years in office — he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans. President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did in eight years." Sanders recounted the numbers under Trump accurately, but she vastly undercounted the number under Obama, leading to a misfire on the comparison between the two presidents. We turned to statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data. First, a technical note. BLS uses two different surveys to create its familiar monthly employment report. When measuring how many jobs are created or lost nationally from month to month, economists generally turn to the bureau’s survey of business establishments rather than the bureau’s survey of households, because the establishment survey is considered more accurate for counting employment level. However, the establishment survey doesn’t break down data by race, so we had to turn to the data from the household survey, which does include a racial breakdown. Here’s a graph of what we found: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The good news for Sanders is that she’s on target in describing the increase in African-American employment under Trump. From January 2017 to July 2018, the figure rose by 708,000, or essentially what Sanders said. The bad news for Sanders is that she dramatically undershot the amount of the increase under Obama. From January 2009 to January 2017 -- the eight-year period under Obama that she referred to -- African-American employment rose by just shy of 3 million. That’s vastly larger than the 195,000 she credited Obama with creating during that span. Sanders’ error dramatically alters the comparison between the two presidents. Rather than Trump tripling Obama’s increase in African-American employment, it is actually Obama who in eight years quadrupled the increase Trump oversaw in a year and a half. And Obama had to deal with the fall-out from the Great Recession during that period. (We should note, as we usually do, that presidents are not entirely responsible for job growth under their watch. Underlying economic trends tend to carry more weight that any particular president’s policies.) After we finished our reporting, the White House's Council of Economic Advisers sent a tweet that said, "Apologies for @WhiteHouseCEA's earlier miscommunication to @PressSec." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The tweet included a screenshot of data for the intended talking point -- "minority employment changes 20 months after a presidential election." For Obama's first term, according to the chart, African-American employment fell by 636,000, compared to a gain of 848,000 for Trump. However, Obama's first 20 months were dominated by the recession, unlike Trump's, making the comparison dubious. The chart also offered the number for the first 20 months of Obama's second term, but it was only modestly below the gain under Trump -- 831,000. Later, Sanders herself tweeted, "Correction from today’s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn’t. I’m sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African-Americans created under President Trump." But her comparison in the tweet still didn't make much sense. To come up with the 195,000 figure, she added together the numbers for the first 20 months of Obama's first and second terms -- a disjointed period of time heavily influenced by the recession -- and compared it to the first 20 months of Trump's. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Sanders said, "President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did (for African-American employment) in eight years." Sanders dramatically undercounted African-American employment gains under Obama. In reality, the correct Obama-Trump comparison shows the opposite of what Sanders indicated: African-American employment gains under Obama were four times higher than the gains to date on Trump’s watch. The White House's Council of Economic Advisers later tweeted a correction and apology. As is our policy, we rate the original statement False.

pomt-07820	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker "has threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against" changes to bargaining laws.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/16/progressive-change-campaign-committee/group-says-gov-scott-walker-threatened-send-out-na/	When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced bold plans to strip public employee unions of most of their powers and make government workers pay more for their benefits, he included this footnote: If state employees reacted with job actions that would disrupt services, Walker said he was prepared to call on the National Guard for help. Some Democratic-leaning organizations, however, took the new Republican governor’s warning to mean something more. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a Washington, D.C., organization that backed former Democratic Wisconsin senator Russ Feingold in his failed 2010 re-election bid, said it sent an e-mail to 13,000 of its Wisconsin members on Feb. 14, 2011, that contained this line in bold: "Walker has threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against these cuts!" It goes on to say: "The idea that a governor can use the military to impose his personal, political will on the people he governs is a primitive relic of the past -- one that resulted in a century of bloodshed in this country. The last time military force was used against workers was during the Memphis sanitation strike in 1968, just days before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. It must not be repeated again." Walker certainly anticipated a strong reaction from government employees to his plans to strip bargaining rights and increase their contributions to pensions and health care premiums. But did he threaten to call out the National Guard in response to protests? And did he threaten to use them in this manner, to use force to "impose his personal, political will"? Like the progressive committee, Citizen Action of Wisconsin issued a news release the same day that condemned Walker’s "threat of force" and mentioned the King assassination. That release also cited the Bay View Massacre of 1886, when seven workers protesting for the eight-hour workday were shot and killed. We asked the progressive committee for evidence to back its claim that Walker threatened to summon the National Guard in response to protests. It cited three Feb. 11 news stories: Milwaukee public radio station WUWM-FM reported that "if there is worker unrest, Walker says the Wisconsin National Guard is prepared to respond" and that Walker said the Guard is prepared "for any problems with workers." The Associated Press reported that Walker said the Guard "is prepared to respond if there is any unrest among state employees." Milwaukee-based Biz Times Daily reported that Walker said he "is prepared to call in the Wisconsin National Guard to respond if there is any unrest among state employees. None of those reports quoted Walker directly, so let’s see what he actually said at the news conference where he announced his proposals. Walker made reference to having made contingency plans and was asked by a reporter whether they included the National Guard. "In state government, we have had, before I’ve taken office, plans for contingencies no matter what the circumstances. We have updated those," Walker said. "I got a full briefing from all the major, level-one state agencies as well as the the National Guard yesterday (Feb. 10). We are fully prepared and equipped to handle whatever may occur. So we have every confidence we can move forward on that. "But again, you plan for the worst, you expect the best. And I expect from the good men and women who work for state and local government that they’re going to continue to do the good, professional job they do each and every day." Referring to the Guard, he added: "They’re not called up at this point. We obviously have a whole series of circumstances that would lead to that. I’m not anticipating that, I’m not expecting that, but I want to make everyone certain in this state that I’m fully prepared for whatever may happen." When he spoke later that day to Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, Walker used the example of the National Guard helping run state prisons in the event of a strike by corrections workers. In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie wrote: "In the unlikely event that core government services are disrupted the Guard would be used just to continue those services. That’s what the National Guard does." Indeed, demonstrations over Walker’s proposals were held in Madison and elsewhere in Wisconsin on Feb. 14 and 15, with thousands of people showing up, but the National Guard was not summoned. And on Feb. 15, the Guard issued a news release saying it "has not been mobilized for state active duty" and "we remain in our normal state of readiness." Let’s return to the statement. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said Walker "threatened to call out the National Guard if workers protest against these cuts!" The governor spoke of possibly calling up the Guard if state workers didn’t show up for work, but he made no reference to using it in response to protests. And certainly none that would suggest the Guard is authorized to use force to impose anything on state workers. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09863	During the 2005 fight over Social Security, "there were noisy demonstrations — but they were outside the events," and opponents were "not disruptive — crowds booed lines they didn’t like, but that was about it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-claims-protests-2005-werent-raucous-h/	As congressional town halls across the country increasingly draw loud protests from critics of Democratic health care legislation, a debate is brewing about whether the protests are more raucous than those four years ago against President George W. Bush’s effort to create private accounts for Social Security. In an Aug. 5 blog posting, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote: "Indeed, activists made trouble in 2005 by asking congressmen tough questions about policy. Activists are making trouble now by shouting congressmen down so they can’t be heard. It’s exactly the same thing, right?" He continued, "Seriously, I’ve been searching through news reports on the Social Security town halls, and I can’t find any examples of the kind of behavior we’re seeing now. Yes, there were noisy demonstrations — but they were outside the events. That was even true during the first month or two, when Republicans actually tried having open town halls. Congressmen were very upset by the reception they received, but not, at least according to any of the reports I can find, because opponents were disruptive — crowds booed lines they didn’t like, but that was about it. "After that, the events were open only to demonstrated loyalists; you may recall the people arrested at a Bush Social Security event in Denver for the crime of … not being Bush supporters. "So please, no false equivalences. The campaign against Social Security privatization was energetic and no doubt rude, but did not involve intimidation and disruption." We decided to join Krugman in looking back to the news clippings. We conclude that while some of the recent conservative protests — such as ones at town halls in Tampa, Little Rock, Ark., Houston, Philadelphia, and Green Bay, Wis.— may have been angrier and more widespread than the ones in 2005, it would be incorrect to suggest, as Krugman does, that the noisy demonstrations against Bush's policies were only taking place outside the events or that disruptions were limited to the occasional boo. We used the Lexis-Nexis news database to find newspaper and wire service stories in calendar year 2005 that included the words "town hall," "Social Security," and a variant of either "protest," "heckler" or "shout." The search returned just under 250 articles. Not all were relevant, and a majority of ones that were relevant addressed town halls hosted by President Bush rather than Members of Congress. Generally speaking, the Bush events were, as Krugman correctly notes, held in front of largely handpicked crowds, which meant that little disruption went on inside the hall. Most of them, as he also notes, inspired protests outside, some of them loud and unruly, and all of them kept at a distance by the Secret Service. (At one event in Westfield, N.J., for instance, a protest that included "hundreds" of people led to the arrest of nine people on disorderly conduct charges.) But for this comparison, we need to look at town halls sponsored by members of Congress. News coverage was more spotty, but here is a sampling of examples we found in which journalists reported conflict inside an event: — "At two stops, morning at Drexel University, afternoon at Widener University, [Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.] encountered skepticism and hostility as he voiced his support for the White House plan to allow creation of personal accounts using payroll taxes. He was heckled by protesters, called a liar, and told that his views were unconscionable. Those sentiments ranged across the age spectrum. … "Santorum asked the audience what would happen in 2008. The response he wanted was that the oldest baby boomers would turn 62 and be eligible for early retirement. "What he got instead, shouted out by an unfriendly voice, was: ‘George Bush will leave office!’ "Actually, that's scheduled for 2009. But many in the crowd cheered anyway." (Feb. 23, 2005, Philadelphia Inquirer ) — "Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., delivered a PowerPoint presentation Thursday night to a packed auditorium in Phoenix. As he laid out the long-term demographic problems for Social Security and expressed his support for private accounts, Shadegg encountered scattered heckling, boos and hisses. (Feb. 26, Chicago Tribune ) — A session sponsored by Rep. Chris Chocola, R-Ind., in South Bend, at the downtown branch of the St. Joseph County Public Library "was a raucous affair, with many of the 100 or so people who attended shouting questions and insults, talking over each other and still bubbling with questions when it was all over. "One gentleman was so angry when Chocola indicated the hour-long session was coming to an end and wouldn't be extended that he walked out." ( South Bend Tribune , Feb. 27, 2005) — John Busch, a letter-writer to a newspaper in Chico, Calif., said, "I attended Congressman Wally Herger's recent town hall meeting in Chico regarding Social Security. I must have witnessed more rude, disrespectful behavior from an audience somewhere along the line, I just can't remember where. The congressman's efforts to provide and gather information were continually thwarted by hecklers who seemed not to care what the congressman had to say, but whose sole reason for attending the meeting was to be rude and disruptive. They certainly accomplished that." (May 8, 2005, Enterprise-Record of Chico, Calif.) Republican officials at the time said that about 95 House lawmakers took part in 287 Social Security-related events in February, with more held in March, so in all likelihood, there were many, many events that did not result in news coverage we could find. So we can't say whether there were protests or shouting matches. And some stories noted the meetings were civil. For example, a Feb. 26, 2005, Chicago Tribune report found that a meeting held by Rep. Rick Renzi, R-Ariz., had "no booing or shouting or threatening tirades. A volunteer from AARP took notes and politely reminded Renzi that ‘Social Security is a retirement plan and a family protection plan. It is not an investment plan.’" And a different Chocola event, according to the news account, "was quiet, orderly and polite, with the 60 or so persons on hand taking turns asking questions and listening to Chocola's response." Still, the protests inside and outside town halls, even if they were not universal, clearly rattled Republican leaders. On March 17, 2005, USA Today reported: "Shaken by raucous protests at open ‘town hall’-style meetings last month, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Deborah Pryce of Ohio and other GOP leaders are urging lawmakers to hold lower-profile events this time. … This month, Republican leaders say they are chucking the open town-hall format. They plan to visit newspaper editorial boards and talk to constituents at Rotary Club lunches, senior citizen centers, chambers of commerce meetings and local businesses. In those settings, ‘there isn't an opportunity for it to disintegrate into something that's less desirable,’ says Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference." And leaders of the movement against changing Social Security made no bones about being aggressive. Brad Woodhouse, then a spokesman for Americans United to Protect Social Security, the labor-backed group that was a key player in the fight against Bush’s proposal, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on March 20, 2005 that "we are going to be getting in the faces of people who are for privatization; they're going to feel the heat. ... It's vociferous, it's rough, it's tough." It’s worth noting that today, Woodhouse is on the other side, so to speak — criticizing the people who are disrupting town halls. He is the communications director for the Democratic National Committee and issued a statement on Aug. 4, 2009, blasting "the Republican Party and Allied Groups’ Mob Rule," saying it was "inciting angry mobs of a small number of rabid right wing extremists funded by K Street Lobbyists to disrupt thoughtful discussions about the future of health care in America taking place in Congressional Districts across the country." He continued, "The right wing extremists’ use of things like devil horns on pictures of our elected officials, hanging members of Congress in effigy, breathlessly questioning the president's citizenship and the use of Nazi SS symbols and the like just shows how outside of the mainstream the Republican Party and their allies are. This type of anger and discord did not serve Republicans well in 2008 — and it is bound to backfire again." It is true that there’s nothing in the clips from 2005 about burning members of Congress in effigy or the use of devils’ horns. But Woodhouse’s group employed 28-foot gorillas, duck suits, plates of hot waffles and sheet cakes as props, according to an Aug. 13, 2005, report in the Albuquerque Tribune . So while the protests may be more intense this time (devils' horns instead of duck suits), it's clear that there was plenty of disruption inside town hall meetings in 2005, contrary to Krugman's assertions. We find his claim False.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2009-08-07T18:16:45	2009-08-05	['None']
pomt-07805	Welfare programs caused more long-term damage to Detroit than the atomic bomb caused to Hiroshima	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/18/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-welfare-programs-caused-more-lon/	You wouldn’t think there would be much connection between Detroit, a troubled rust belt city, and the bustling port city of Hiroshima, Japan. But trust us, countless bloggers see a link. Do a Google search of the phrase "Hiroshima and Detroit" and you’ll see hundreds of links to blogs, all displaying variations of a claim that’s been widely circulated by chain e-mailers for the last few years. The e-mails open with black and white photographs of an atomic bomb mushroom cloud and the ruins of Hiroshima that followed the U.S. attack on Aug. 6, 1945. As you scroll down, you see bright color photos of a skyline, with high-rise buildings and busy highways -- the modern Hiroshima. Then comes a series of grim photos of Detroit, showing abandoned and collapsing apartment buildings and houses. The e-mails include text that varies from version to version but conveys the same message: that welfare is the reason for Detroit’s problems. The email that reached our in-box ended with a question and a statement: "What has caused more long-term destruction -- the A-Bomb or U.S. Government (Democrat) welfare programs created to buy the votes of those who want someone to care for them? Japan does not have a welfare system. Work or do without." We wondered whether it was worth our time to fact-check something so seemingly preposterous. But when we realized how widely this e-mail is circulating and how much it seems to be accepted as fact, we decided to forge ahead. Clearly, Detroit is in trouble. When Mayor David Bing gave his first state-of-the-city address last year, he noted the city was nearly bankrupt and facing a $325-million deficit. Unemployment was approaching 30 percent, he said, and 50,000 homeowners faced foreclosure. But did welfare cause Detroit’s problems? We put that question to Margaret Dewar, a professor of architecture and urban planning at the University of Michigan. "That is ridiculous," Dewar said, adding that she has never heard anyone suggest welfare was a contributing factor. Since 1950, Detroit has lost more than 80 percent of its jobs, Dewar said, because manufacturers embraced new technologies and moved their businesses to the suburbs. That destroyed retail businesses and led to a drastic drop in the city’s population; from the 1950 peak of 1.85 million, the population had fallen to about 900,000 by 2009. Dewar’s conclusions were seconded by Thomas J. Sugrue, a professor of history and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, who wrote a prize-winning book called "The Origin of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit." Asked whether welfare played a role in the city’s troubles, Sugrue had a one-word answer: "No." Detroit’s decline began shortly after World War II, he said, for the same reasons Dewar cited. If welfare were the problem, Sugrue said, then one could expect to see hollowed out sections of Stockholm or Paris, cities in nations with generous welfare programs. Then, we examined the other half of the chain-email claim: that Japan has no welfare programs. Timothy S. George, a history professor at the University of Rhode Island who specializes in postwar Japan, said Japan actually has an extensive social welfare system -- though not as generous as programs in many European countries. Nicole Freiner, an assistant professor of political science at Bryant University who focuses on Asian politics, notes that the United States helped rebuild those cities with a portion of the Marshall Plan, which also helped rebuild Europe. Japan, she said, offers such social welfare programs as social security, pensions, national health care and coverage for unemployment and occupational injuries, and benefits for small children and the elderly. It also provides what many in the United States would define as welfare -- financial assistance to those in need. She referred us to an academic paper that finds Japan spending almost 16 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on social welfare programs. That’s less than the 21 percent the United States spends. But it’s not zero. George’s response to the e-mail: "Disgusting. A ridiculous comparison that’s really in bad taste. In fact, it’s outrageous." We agree. The Hiroshima-Detroit email utilizes a gallery of dramatic photos that attempt to distort history -- in two countries. The conclusion is ridiculous, the definition of Pants on Fire.

pomt-06153	"Following the catastrophic, cascading collapse of major investment banks on Wall Street in 2007.....Nobody was prosecuted, no hearings were held and no reforms were implemented."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/19/michael-doherty/state-sen-mike-doherty-claims-financial-collapse-l/	When former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine was ordered to appear Dec. 8 before a House committee investigating the collapse of brokerage MF Global, it was a landmark moment, according to one state senator. Corzine’s testimony marked the first time that federal officials had taken any action dealing with Wall Street in response to the financial crisis that rocked the world a few years ago, state Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) said in a Dec. 9 news release. "Following the catastrophic, cascading collapse of major investment banks on Wall Street in 2007, which caused the current global economic recession, the United States Government held no one accountable," Doherty said. "Nobody was prosecuted, no hearings were held and no reforms were implemented. "It is obvious to everyone on Main Street, from the Occupy camps to the Tea Party, that Wall Street is broken. Yet only yesterday did the U.S. Congress take any action." No prosecutions, no hearings, no reforms? PolitiFact New Jersey says: No way! Since the financial crisis began in 2008 -- not 2007, senator -- federal officials have held numerous public hearings and passed a financial reform law, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While high-profile executives on Wall Street have not faced criminal charges, federal officials have prosecuted cases against other individuals for financial crimes before and during the time of the economic collapse. Doherty told us his claims are supported by a Dec. 4 segment on 60 Minutes on CBS, which stated "there has not been a single prosecution of a high-ranking Wall Street executive or major financial firm." In an email, Doherty also responded to our charge about the Dodd-Frank Act: "Regarding reform, there has been no reform. If there was reform, how did MF Global take $1.2 Billion of client money from segregated client accounts and now they don’t know where the money went? Reform would have stopped that from happening." Let’s review what PolitiFact New Jersey found: It’s true that prominent Wall Street executives have not been prosecuted, according to various news reports. But it’s wrong for Doherty to say "nobody" has. For example, Lee Farkas was convicted in April of helping to commit a more than $2.9 billion fraud scheme that contributed to the collapse of Alabama-based Colonial Bank, one of the 25 largest banks in the country in 2009. Now, let’s talk about those hearings and financial reform. Charged with examining the causes of the financial crisis, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission "held 19 days of public hearings" in 2010, according to its website. Congressional committees and subcommittees also have held hearings about the financial crisis. In April 2010, a Senate subcommittee held four hearings about the causes and effects of the crisis, including one when Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein testified. About three months later, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act. The reform measures within that legislation include setting up a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. U.S. Senate Republicans recently blocked the nomination for the bureau’s first director. So, contrary to what Doherty claimed, it’s clear that federal officials have conducted hearings and passed financial reform in the wake of the financial crisis. Doherty also referred to the "current global economic recession," but economists with the National Bureau of Economic Research have said the recession in the United States ended in June 2009. Our ruling In a news release, Doherty claimed that following the collapse of major investment banks on Wall Street in 2007, "nobody was prosecuted, no hearings were held and no reforms were implemented." But major investment banks collapsed in 2008 and there have been some prosecutions, although not targeting high-profile Wall Street executives. Numerous hearings have been held and a financial reform law was enacted last year. Doherty has a point about the lack of prosecutions against high-profile Wall Street executives, but his overall argument about inaction by federal officials is flat-out wrong. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Michael Doherty	None	None	None	2011-12-19T07:30:00	2011-12-09	['None']
pomt-00771	Says Hillary Clinton "completely ignored" "dozens and dozens of requests for more security" for the Benghazi consulate.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/12/rand-paul/rand-paul-attacks-hillary-clintons-response-bengha/	With Hillary Clinton making her presidential run official, Republicans from Mitt Romney to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul jumped at the chance Sunday to revisit Clinton’s biggest controversies from her tenure as secretary of state. Paul, who entered the presidential race last week, turned to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by armed militants on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. The attack was "a 3 a.m. phone call that she never picked up," he told Dana Bash of CNN’s State of the Union. "She didn't provide the security, not just that day, for nine months," Paul said. "Dozens and dozens of requests for more security, all completely ignored by Hillary Clinton." Paul’s claim that Clinton herself ignored a litany of security requests for the Benghazi outpost does not completely check out, though it is true that the U.S. diplomats in Libya had warned of insufficient protection and the deteriorating climate in eastern Libya in the months ahead of Stevens’ death. The accuracy of his claim comes down to this: There is no hard proof that Clinton "completely ignored" "dozens and dozens" of requests for more staffing. Still, there is smoke. Clinton’s reason for not responding to requests from U.S. diplomats in Libya outlining the need for enhanced security staffing was simple: The requests did not make it up to her through the chain of command, she has said. To critics like Paul, Clinton assumes responsibility for what went wrong during her four years at secretary of state regardless of whether she was informed. "Did the State Department, under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's leadership, deny the request for additional security? The answer is yes," said Paul spokesman Eleanor May. Experts say we may never know what Clinton knew about the security shortfalls in Benghazi, which officials envisioned as a temporary outpost to monitor eastern Libya’s nation-building efforts after the collapse of the Moammar Gadhafi regime. "I would be suspect of anyone making firm conclusions one way or another," said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist and expert in Middle Eastern affairs at the RAND Corporation. What investigations found Multiple investigations of what went wrong that night revealed lower-level diplomats made repeated requests to boost security in Libya. The State Department’s Accountability Review Board in December 2012 noted "certain senior State Department officials within two bureaus demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in their responses to security concerns posed by Special Mission Benghazi, given the deteriorating threat environment and the lack of reliable host government protection." The board did not directly blame Clinton or any specific employee. Congressional Republicans, including Paul, have highlighted diplomatic cables bearing Clinton’s name between diplomats in Libya and State Department officials as evidence of turning a blind eye. Almost two years ago, PolitiFact rated a similar claim from Paul that Clinton "was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables," as Mostly False. Paul’s office reasoned that diplomatic cables, called "telegrams," sent from diplomats in Libya to Washington and addressed to "SECSTATE" in "WASHDC" were evidence of a direct message to Clinton about the security needs. But that markup appears on 1.4 million cables the department receives each year and is the standard "location indicator" for the entire State Department, including the Peace Corps, according to the Foreign Affairs Manual. So just because Clinton’s position was on the telegram doesn’t mean it was intended for her desk. When she testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January 2013, she said requests from staff in Libya never came to her and she "was not aware of that going on." Other Republican committee reviews of the Benghazi attack focused on the other side of diplomatic messaging. Any cable from Washington to an embassy around the world bears the name of the secretary of state, even if she did not personally send it. In April 2013, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released an interim report that highlighted "numerous communications" from U.S. officials in Libya asking for more security staff and Washington officials turning them down. This GOP report focused on two cables and two emails exchanged among diplomats in Libya who requested more security staff and Washington officials who said no, preferring training Libyan security staff instead, in the months ahead of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. The investigation held up Clinton’s "signature" on one cable from April 2012 as proof that requests for more protection at the vulnerable compound were "denied at the highest levels of the State Department." Again, just because Clinton’s name was on it doesn’t mean the rejection came from her desk. Any cable coming out of Washington would bear her "signature." (Here’s more on an "absurd" cable signature claim from the Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler, who covered the State Department for nine years.) In a May 2013 House Oversight Committee hearing, Republicans questioned the State Department’s former regional security officer in Libya, Eric Nordstrom, who authored some of the messages asking for more security staff. Nordstrom said he expected Clinton to have read his cable, or at least know about it, because she "had an involvement in the security process" and had toured the facilities. However, when asked if the State Department’s review board let anyone off easy for the security lapses, Nordstrom brought up the undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy — not Clinton. "There is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary," he said. ‘Dozens and dozens’ Paul said there were "dozens and dozens of requests for more security" that Clinton ignored. A firm number for the requests is elusive, experts said. Paul’s office directed us to 120 pages of declassified documents released by the House Oversight Committee as documenting the dozens of requests. The packet contains some of the emails already discussed, as well as weekly reports from the embassy detailing the "security vacuum" of the city, a 50-page report by Nordstrom detailing security issues in Tripoli and Benghazi from June 1, 2011, to July 2012, as well as other safety evaluations. But we only counted a half-dozen emails concerning requests for security for Benghazi. What the real number is is hard to say. "It may very well have been dozens and dozens, but we don’t know that information," Brennan said, saying Paul might have been "overplaying his hand" here. Our ruling Paul said Clinton "didn't provide the security, not just that day, for nine months," for the consulate in Benghazi, and she completely ignored "dozens and dozens of requests for more security." The numerous requests from officials on the ground in Libya for better security for the Benghazi compound are undeniable and well-documented, though saying "dozens and dozens" might be an overstatement. Paul is treading into uncertain waters in saying Clinton flat-out ignored those requests. No one has shown Clinton willfully ignored the cries for help from Libya. Paul did not claim cables went to Clinton directly as he has in the past, but he came fairly close. His statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08502	Says "Rep. Jim Weidner proposed a bill taking away health care for 80,000 of Oregon's children."	true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/08/blue-oregon/liberal-website-says-rep-jim-weidner-tried-take-he/	Forget taking candy away from children. Blue Oregon, a liberal political website, is accusing one Republican candidate of trying to take health care away from 80,000 of Oregon’s youth. In a postlooking for political contributions, Kari Chisholm of Blue Oregon describes the race in House District 24 as follows: "Susan Sokol Blosser (the Democrat) is one of the founders of Oregon's world-renowned wine industry where she’s a leader on environmental sustainability. Her opponent, Rep. Jim Weidnerproposed a bill taking away health care for 80,000 of Oregon's children." Ouch. Not exactly the sort of thing that wins you votes. Naturally, PolitiFact Oregon wondered if Weidner, who has four kids himself, really has it out for Oregon’s children. The claim on Blue Oregon was in reference to House Bill 3603, a bill that Weidner sponsored during the February 2010 special session. The bill, according to the summary, "repeals (the) health insurance premium assessment." That was nice and vague, so we did some more sleuthing and ended up with the staff measure summary for House Bill 2116. Why House Bill 2116? Well, that was the bill that, in part, instituted the "health insurance premium assessment" or, to put it comprehensible English, a 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums paid by the insurance companies but passed on to the customers. According to the staff measure summary, that 1 percent tax would be used to provide funding for health care for 80,000 children during the 2009-2011 biennium through Oregon Healthy Kids. Those 80,000 were in addition to the the children already covered by the state-run plan. So, it seems, Weidner does want to eliminate a tax that is being used to provide health care to children. We checked in with Weidner to see if he could explain his position. As it turns out, he’s not so much against health care for children as he is against the 1 percent tax. He says the tax disproportionately hurts small businesses. Weidner sponsored the bill, he says, because he wanted to bring attention to this and other issues. "I knew the bill wasn’t going to go anywhere." Before we settled on a ruling we wanted to check one other thing: Even if Weidner’s bill had gone through, are there really 80,000 children who would lose health insurance? We called Oregon Healthy Kids to find out. As it happens, since the bill passed, about 57,000 children have been enrolled in the program, according to Cathy Kaufmann, manager of the Healthy Kids Office. That’s as of August. Kaufmann expects that the full 80,000 will be enrolled before the end of the 2009-2011 biennium. So where does that leave us? Well, while we’re feeling pretty confident that Weidner isn’t anti-health care for kids, he did, as the website alleges, propose a bill that would have eliminated the funding for health care for 80,000 children. Whether he thought it would pass or not doesn’t much change things. And some context about how he was really targeting a tax would have been nice. Still, we rate this claim True.

pomt-04324	"Under President Obama: $4,000 tax hike on middle-class families."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/26/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-plans-4000-tax-hike-middle-class/	With jobs and other pocketbook issues the top concerns for most voters, the Mitt Romney campaign has been running ads that warn about rising taxes for the middle class if Barack Obama is re-elected. In a television ad called "Putting jobs first", a video clip shows Mitt Romney speaking during the Denver debate. Romney says "I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone." As he says that, these words appear on the screen: "Under President Obama: $4,000 tax hike on middle class families." The ad doesn’t say when this tax hike will take place or point to any plan from Obama to raise taxes on the middle class. In this fact-check, we’ll explore the roots of this claim and whether it’s what the middle class can reasonably expect from a second Obama term. The ad references a study from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The study focuses on the national debt, and in particular, on the payments needed to cover the interest on that debt. What the authors, Matt Jensen and Aspen Gorry, try to do is figure out how those payments might be spread across different income groups. The $4,000 figure comes from the results for households making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year. The study found that interest payments on the new debt added in Obama’s first term equal $1,600 for this group. It then takes the president’s 2013 budget plan and projects it out to 2022. It calculates that the added payments during this period would total $2,400. Add the two and you get the number in the ad, about $4,000. There’s only one problem with saying the study describes a tax hike: It doesn’t. It describes a cost that must be paid, but that is entirely separate from the question of how it is paid, by whom and when. We’ll get into some of the details in just a bit. A quick way to see the gap between the study and reality is to look at the $1,600 figure for Obama’s first term. By the logic of the Romney campaign, these households already would have seen an increase in their tax bills by that amount. In reality, those families enjoyed a variety of tax breaks during that period, from lower payroll taxes to tax credits for college tuition. The ad also puts responsibility for the whole $1,600 amount on Obama. As PolitiFact has shown, even with full accounting for the cost of the stimulus, the rising debt stems in part from policies that predate Obama, such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the economic recession that began before he took office. Let us note, none of this is a criticism of the study. One of the authorities on economic modeling is economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley. The study’s lead author, Matt Jensen, cites Auerbach. We asked Auerbach what he thought of the study. "I don’t see any obvious flaws in the way the calculations are done," Auerbach said. But he also called the work "hypothetical". The Romney campaign took an analytic exercise and presented it as concrete reality. This shift shows up in the different words used by the American Enterprise Institute and the campaign. The headline on the institute’s web site is "Obama’s big budget deficits could mean a $4,000 a year middle-class tax hike." The operative word is "could". The Romney campaign web site is less restrained. It says the cost of the debt under Obama "would require an additional $2,500 in taxes." More reasons to be cautious with the study One of the study’s assumptions is that tax revenues will cover future deficits. That drew a criticism from Jason Peuquet, research director with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors strong efforts to reduce deficits. Peuquet calls the study a useful exercise but says its approach is too narrow. "It only looks at the tax side of the equation," Peuquet said. "In reality higher debt could mean much lower spending on certain programs. Including spending in the equation could produce very different distributional outcomes from these illustrative scenarios." William Gale, a Brookings Institution economist who worked in the first Bush White House, expands on that point. Obama "might cut spending, he might raise taxes differently than the study's assumptions, he might let the debt ride," Gale said. In short, the study is not a prediction of the future. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org have noted that deficits would continue to rise under the House Republican budget plan championed by Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan. In their fact-check, they fault the Romney campaign for glossing over that Republicans too would add to the portion of taxes that would need to go to service the debt. The increase under the GOP plan would be much less than under Obama but it would still be an increase. Our ruling The Romney campaign ad says Obama’s policies are a $4,000 tax hike on the middle class. But their evidence is a study from the American Enterprise Institute that looks at public debt. The campaign makes a giant leap when it assumes the debt will be serviced with increased taxes on all income levels and in the time frame it suggests. We actually don’t know how the tax code will spread around the pain of paying for the debt; right now, Obama is proposing tax increases only on higher income households. Finally, we should point out that debt payments would rise even if Romney wins the presidency. If you accept the ad's logic, then you'd have to accept that Romney too plans tax increases for the middle class. The campaign distorts the meaning of the study to score political points.

pomt-01427	By voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan "voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/07/thom-tillis/thom-tillis-says-kay-hagan-voted-kill-equivalent-2/	In the second North Carolina Senate debate between Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan and Republican Thom Tillis, the challenger reached deep into the GOP playbook for an attack line about President Barack Obama’s health care law and its potential impact on jobs. "Sen. Hagan’s solution is spending more money," Tillis said. "It’s very simple. Government needs to get out of the way. We need to get our spending under control, and we need to reduce regulations. Sen. Hagan, when she cast the deciding vote for Obamacare, voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs." Critics of the health care law have long argued that the new regulations it created, particularly those on businesses, would hamper employment -- or, in the more explosive language of the campaign trail, that it would be a "job killer." The critics got what seemed to be a boost when the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan numbers-cruncher -- produced a report on this topic in February 2014. The CBO projected that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. However, most of the law’s critics glossed over some critical facts when citing these numbers. Why "kill" is the wrong word The biggest problem with Tillis’ characterization of the CBO’s findings is that he used the word "kill." This is inaccurate because it suggests that employers will be making 2.5 million layoffs, or because businesses aren’t going to be creating that many jobs. That's not what the report said; rather, the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by employers. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they don’t need to work as much. The report estimated that Obamacare would "reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor -- given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive." This would equal a "decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024," it continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in "an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week)." To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just won’t rise as much as it would if the health care law did not exist. We should note that the report did have some less sanguine observations about the health care law’s impact on employment. As more people choose to work less, the CBO concluded, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. In addition, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact earlier this year. "Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to," Sinclair said. "But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing." To his credit, Tillis -- unlike many of his Republican colleagues -- was able to avoid one linguistic pitfall. Tillis framed the CBO’s findings as projecting a reduction in the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs, rather than simply saying a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. That’s an important distinction because the CBO didn’t cite the number of jobs that will be reduced; rather, it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may seem deep in the weeds, but it’s worth noting. These job equivalents will be made up of lots of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. For instance, some of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. A final note: We’re also not wild about Tillis’ characterization of Hagan casting the "deciding vote" for Obamacare. In most cases when we’ve looked at that claim, we have rated them Mostly False, since any one of the 60 Senate supporters could have been described as having cast the deciding vote. But for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider the employment question in putting this claim to the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling In the debate, Tillis said that, by voting for Obamacare, Sen. Kay Hagan "voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs." The main problem with this claim is that Tillis used the word "kill." This mischaracterizes what is going on, since the reduction will come from voluntary actions by workers, rather than layoffs by employers. Indeed, the CBO said the law would not push up unemployment. On balance, we rate Tillis’ claim Mostly False.	None	Thom Tillis	None	None	None	2014-10-07T22:01:19	2014-10-07	['Kay_Hagan', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']

But now a rumor is spreading that his email password wasn’t much of a secret at all. It was simply "password." "What happened was John Podesta gave his password to a hacker. And guess what his password was. 'Password,' " said Fox News' Jesse Watters on Jan. 4. "It’s a true story. His password was ‘password.’ " That’d be funny, if it were true. The thing is, there’s no material evidence to support the claim that Podesta violated a very basic tenet of Internet safety. None shall pass The first person to say that Podesta’s email password was "password" was Julian Assange, whose website WikiLeaks published the emails stolen from Podesta. "We published several Podesta emails, which show Podesta responding to a phishing email," Assange said on Fox Jan. 3. "Now, how did they respond? Podesta gave out that his password was the word ‘password.’ " "So this is something a 14-year-old kid could have hacked," Assange added. We don’t know where Assange’s claim comes from. None of the emails published on WikiLeaks show Podesta’s email password. And of the cyber analysts examining the phishing emails used to infiltrate Podesta’s and others’ accounts, none have made similar claims. Further, Podesta was using a Gmail account, and Google doesn’t allow users to make their passwords "password." Go try for yourself. We did: Perhaps Assange is thinking of a February 2015 email in the WikiLeaks dump. In that email, a staffer tells Podesta that his Windows 8 login on what appears to be a new work computer is username: jpodesta and password: p@ssw0rd. Interestingly, in another email sent in May 2015, the same staffer tells Podesta his Apple ID password: Runner4567. So we have two of Podesta’s passwords, but neither are for his email account. In fairness to Assange, Watters and others pushing the email password claim: Both of these passwords are far too simple to be effective. So it’s possible Podesta similarly made his email password overly simplistic. But we don’t know that for sure, and we surely don’t know if his email password was just "password." Pro tip: If you don’t want to end up like Podesta, check out this guide to protecting yourself online, written by cyber crime expert Marc Goodman. Our ruling Watters said Podesta’s email password was "password." There is no material evidence to back up this claim. Google doesn’t even allow Gmail users to make their password "password."

pomt-04589	Says a voter-adopted constitutional amendment "instructed" a state board headed by Jerry Patterson to put $300 million in investment earnings into a fund supporting public school operations.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/sep/21/progress-texas/progress-texas-says-constitutional-amendment-instr/	In a recent newsletter update, a Democratic-leaning group touted its campaign to sway a board headed by a Republican to dispatch $300 million to a fund that supports public school operations. Progress Texas maintains that Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson is hoarding investment earnings despite a 2011 constitutional amendment intended to ease the flow of money to the Available School Fund, which helps pay for classroom instructional materials and technology. The group’s Sept. 7, 2012, email update says: "Proposition 6 instructed the three-person School Land Board, run by Chairman Jerry Patterson as part of the General Land Office, to put a portion of earnings -- $300 million, to be precise -- from investments on real estate assets into the Available School Fund as a way to soften the blow of $5.4 billion in cuts to public education." Patterson brought the update to our attention. We decided to check it out. For nearly a decade, the land office has invested in real estate using proceeds received from selling land or drawing on revenue from mineral leases and royalties associated with the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, the agency notes on a web page. In turn, the land board, consisting of the land commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases. In 2011, the board voted to release $250 million in earnings on investments in both 2012 and 2013 for school needs, as we noted in another fact check. The panel has yet to approve additional transfers to the school fund. So, did the 2011 amendment "instruct" the board to dispatch precisely $300 million in investment earnings to the Available School Fund? Not quite. The ballot language itself did not mention a dollar figure, while the amendment -- the language added to the constitution -- presented $300 million as the maximum amount that could be annually transferred. As described in a voter guide prepared by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, published in the Oct. 23, 2011, Austin American-Statesman, Proposition 6 on the November 2011 ballot permitted up to $300 million of revenues to be transferred to the school fund. Among other observers, the Texas Tribune and San Antonio Express-News each reported that as much as $300 million -- though not necessarily $300 million -- would be allowed to be transferred. However, the 2011 Legislature wrote the 2012-13 state budget including a provision for $150 million a year in such transfers, as noted in a July 25, 2012, Tribune news article pointing out the land board had not initiated a transfer at its latest meeting. Patterson has said the board has through August 2013, the end of the current fiscal year, to decide. He maintains that calls for him to shift earnings must be weighed against the long-term value of simply investing returns. The Tribune story quotes state Rep. Rob Orr, author of the constitutional amendment, as saying: "I was told that there would be $300 million going into the Available School Fund. Everything was put in place to allow to that to happen." The story also quotes Orr as saying the land office agreed to transfer the money if the amendment won voter approval. But the story quotes Patterson as saying he did not recall committing to a transfer of the money and that his office had been unable to find "any evidence or documents or memos or testimony" that he did. In a telephone interview, Orr, R-Burleson, said the amendment did not mandate a transfer amount after Patterson objected to an early version setting a minimum transfer level. Orr told us the amendment also did not instruct the board to transfer funds; it permitted or allowed such action. Regardless, Orr told us, legislative colleagues who drafted the state budget "would not put $300 million into a budget that they didn’t think they were getting." In emails, the executive director of Progress Texas, Matt Glazer, agreed it is up to the land board to approve transfers. Glazer said its update says the amendment "instructed" the board to act in the spirit of indicating guidance -- not an order. He pointed out Merriam-Webster’s definition of "instruct," which leads off with "to give knowledge to; to provide with authoritative information or advice." The next listed definition: "to give an order or command." Reminded that the amendment says the amount transferred is "not to exceed $300 million each year," rather than saying precisely $300 million, Glazer said the group’s claim reflects the state budget. The relevant budgetary provision provides for $150 million a year to be transferred to support the schools. But the stipulation, adopted before voters considered the proposition, also makes the transfers contingent on voter approval of the amendment as well as the land office moving to make the transfers. If either action doesn’t occur, the provision says, budgeted school aid is to be reduced accordingly. Our ruling The newsletter update said a 2011 constitutional amendment approved by Texas voters "instructed" a board headed by Patterson to put $300 million into a fund supporting public school operations. This claim distorts aspects of the amendment. First, the word "instructed" is misleading; the amendment only authorized such transfers. Second, the amendment did not specify that $300 million be dispatched. That’s the maximum annual amount allowed to be transferred. Finally, while lawmakers budgeted the cited $300 million in transfers during 2012-13, they also signed off on a reduction in budgeted school aid if the land office does not make the transfers -- signaling the result was out of their control. This statement has an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Progress Texas	None	None	None	2012-09-21T16:15:38	2012-09-07	['None']
pomt-09763	"The majority actually want single-payer health care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-majority-favor-single-payer-h/	On CNN's Larry King Live on Sept. 26, 2009, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore was asked if he thought President Barack Obama would get his health care plan through Congress. "Well, I certainly hope so," said Moore, whose 2007 film Sicko focused on health care. "Seventy-five percent of the American people are expecting it. That's what the polls show. The majority of this country voted for him in large part because they want universal health care. The majority actually want single-payer health care." Moore repeated the claim about support for a single-payer plan, with a couple of qualifiers, in a Sept. 29 news conference that coincided with the release of his new film, Capitalism: A Love Story . "Not only do three-quarters of the American people want universal health care and support the public option, a majority, depending on which poll you look at, either a simple majority or a plurality of Americans support single-payer, support health care for all. "You don't have to go out on a limb," Moore said, referring to politicians. "You don't have to take a risk. You've already got the people with you." First, let's explain some of the terms we're talking about here. The Democratic health care plan in the House calls for most people to keep the private insurance they have through their employer. But for people on their own, the government would create a national health care exchange, a kind of one-stop shop for people to compare plans from various insurance companies. Within that exchange, the House plan calls for a government-run plan that provides basic coverage at a price likely to be lower than private insurers. That's the so-called "public option." A single-payer health care system is one in which the government pays all health care bills. With the controversial public option floundering in Congress, is it possible a majority of Americans actually support a single-payer system with way more government involvement? Asked to back up his claim, Moore's people directed us first to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July 2009. The nonpartisan Kaiser is considered by many to be the gold standard of health care polling. In that July poll, people were asked about different ways to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance, and whether or not they favored (strongly or somewhat) or opposed (strongly or somewhat) those options. One of the options posed was: "Having a national health plan — or single-payer plan — in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan." In all, 50 percent said they favored it; 44 percent said they opposed it. So that's what the poll found in July. But Kaiser has posed this very question in six polls dating back to December 2008. The July poll is the only one that shows a majority of people saying they "favored" a single-payer system. In fact, more recent polls seem to suggest the public is getting less enamored of single-payer health care. In August, the same Kaiser poll showed a slightly higher percentage opposed single payer (49 percent) than favored it (48 percent) — still within the margin of error. And the September poll showed 40 percent favor it, while 56 percent oppose it. We'll cut Moore some slack regarding the September poll. It wasn't publicly released until Sept. 29, a couple of days after Moore first made the comment. But we'd like to note something else about the Kaiser poll. Among the eight options posed to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance, the single-payer option fared the worst. For example, 68 percent in the September poll said they favored a plan to require all Americans to have health insurance, either from their employer or from another source, with financial help for those who can’t afford it. And 67 percent said they favored offering tax credits to help people buy private health insurance. The same percentage said they favored a plan to require employers to offer health insurance to their workers or pay money into a government fund that will pay to cover those without insurance. In other words, people weren't asked directly to pick the one option they favored the most . But in an October 2008 Kaiser poll, they were asked just that. There, the public is all over the map. Fifteen percent said they most prefer that "all Americans get their insurance from a single government plan." A similar percentage said they prefer "requiring employers to either offer health insurance or pay money into a government pool." And 14 percent each said their top choice was "offering tax breaks to businesses that do offer health insurance" or "requiring all Americans to have health insurance, with tax credits or other aid to help those who can’t afford it." That's hardly a consensus for single-payer. We also came across a recent Rasmussen telephone poll in early August that contradicts Moore's claim. In the Rasmussen poll, people were asked, "Do you favor or oppose a single-payer health care system where the federal government provides coverage for everyone?" The results: 32 percent said they favored it; 57 percent oppose. Support generally fell along party lines, with 62 percent of Democrats in favor; and 87 percent of Republicans opposed. Moore's people cited two other polls to back up his statement. The first was a December 2007 poll commissioned by AP that asked: "Do you consider yourself a supporter of a single-payer health care system, that is a national health plan financed by taxpayers in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan, or not?" The result: 54 percent said yes; 44 percent said no. And a Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll in October 2007 found that 53 percent agreed with creating a "government-run, government-financed health insurance program that would cover all Americans. This program would be administered like the current Medicare for citizens 65 and over." Both those polls are nearly two years old, though, and we think it's safe to say Americans are far more tuned in to the health care question now than they were then. We also note that the Bloomberg poll doesn't use the word "single-payer" (even though it amounts to the same thing). "Single-payer is not a concept that people are very familiar with," said Karlyn Bowman, polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. Which brings us to this point: Words matter. Drop in the words "like Medicare" and some polls have found the public responds better. People generally like Medicare. Call it universal health care run by the government, and you often do better than calling it "single-payer." And if you call it a "socialized" system, well, you can guess the results. A fair reading of recent polls just doesn't support Moore's claim, Bowman said. "He's wrong." We have a few problems with Moore's claim. First, he cherry-picked the results from a July Kaiser poll. There have been five other Kaiser polls since last December, including two since July, that asked that exact same question, and only the July results showed a majority, slightly over 50 percent. But our bigger problem is that in the same Kaiser poll, people were much more supportive of plans that largely kept intact the private insurance model. Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans want some form of universal health care coverage — they want uninsured people to have insurance. But there's wide disagreement about the means to achieve that. Some think we ought to keep the system as is, but offer tax credits so that uninsured people can afford to buy private insurance. Some think companies ought to be required to provide insurance to employees, or else pay into a government fund that will pay to cover those without insurance. In the poll that Moore's people cited to back up his claim, the single-payer plan has consistently polled the worst among seven other posed options. We think it's misleading, at best, for Moore to cite that July study to back up his claim that a majority support a single-payer plan. In fact, one could make a strong argument that those very polls suggest there is more support for private insurance options than for a single-payer system. And so we find Moore's statement False.

pomt-02451	Says Nancy Pelosi said, "Waiting long hours in the emergency room will allow you to make new friends!"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/26/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-say-pelosi-supports-longer-er-wait-/	It’d probably be big news if House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., publicly stated that she favors extending emergency room wait times. And many Facebook posts seem to suggest she does. They claim Pelosi wrote in defense of criticism to President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, "Waiting long hours in the emergency room will allow you to make new friends!" Some Affordable Care Act critics have predicted that Obamacare will cause emergency room wait times to go up. PolitiFact wanted to put this claim to rest after a skeptical reader wrote in asking us whether Pelosi actually said this. Our own searches for news clips came up empty. A spokesman from Pelosi’s office told us she didn’t say it. Sure enough, we traced the Pelosi quote in question back to a satire website. Duh Progressive likens itself to a right-leaning version of The Onion. Most of the site’s articles are politically charged takes on the news. Their article, which purports to be written by Pelosi herself, is meant to poke fun at the way Democrats defend the Affordable Care Act from critics. The fake first-person narrative reads: "Naysayers claim the ACA will turn our nation’s emergency rooms into those similar to Europe’s, where people can sit all day in understaffed hospitals as they wait to get their feverish illnesses addressed, or their broken limbs fixed, their convulsions stopped, that knife removed from their skulls, or their fingers reattached. I doubt such dire fears will ever come true here. But for argument’s sake let us presume I am wrong (which I never am) and that '’Obamacare'’ will force Americans to wait in emergency rooms longer than they already do. In that case, has it ever occurred to people the great new friends that can be made while waiting for hours in abject misery alongside others also in abject pain and misery?" Pelosi, like most of her party, consistently supports Obamacare. And hey, she may also support making new friends. But there’s no evidence to suggest that she twisted potentially longer emergency room wait times into a good thing. Our ruling Facebook posts quoted Pelosi as saying, "Waiting long hours in the emergency room will allow you to make new friends!" We quickly traced back the claims to a satirical article. Pelosi never actually said this, or anything remotely similar. This claim is ridiculous and off-base, so we rated it Pants on Fire.

pomt-14849	Says Hillary Clinton and the Democrats "admitted there’s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that’s Sen. Marco Rubio."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/16/baby-got-pac/democrats-clinton-campaign-afraid-rubio-new-super-/	A Republican millionaire with an apparent fondness for '90s rap has thrown his support behind U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign. California winery owner John Jordan’s new super PAC released a one-minute commercial before the Nov. 10, 2015, GOP primary debate. The political action committee is cheekily named Baby Got PAC, a reference to the 1992 Sir Mix-a-Lot magnum opus Baby Got Back. In the ad, reportedly written by Jordan, a narrator explains the PAC is pulling for Rubio over the rest of the Republicans because the Floridian is the one that Democrats fear most in the general election. "It’s a tough choice. So you know who we asked? Hillary Clinton and the Democrats," the ad said while flashing three lines as proof of their point. "For once, they told the truth. They admitted there’s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that’s Sen. Marco Rubio." Cue Sir Mix-a Lot: Now, we like checking campaign statements, and we cannot lie! But is this a charge Democrats just can’t deny? (Sorry, we just had to get that out of the way.) We should note we didn’t find any instance of Hillary Clinton saying she was afraid of Rubio or any other candidate, and her campaign did not return our requests for comment. That’s important to keep in mind, since the ad mentions her by name. Saying "there’s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton" implies her campaign is unconcerned with the rest of the GOP field, which likely is not the case. A November 2015 story from the Daily Beast included Democratic donors and strategists saying Clinton’s campaign was until recently more occupied with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and is now focusing on Rubio as Bush fades. Florida-based Republican media consultant Rick Wilson produced the ad and confirmed with PolitiFact Florida where each of the three lines featured in the commercial came from. Let’s take them one at a time: "A Hillary Clinton match-up with Marco Rubio is a scary thought for Democrats." — the New York Times: On May 22, 2015, the New York Times published an article about Democratic strategists discussing Rubio, who announced his candidacy in April. The commercial’s quote is the headline word for word. Every source in the story at least acknowledged Rubio was a candidate worth addressing, while some said he would be a tough opponent. That’s not to say Rubio is the only candidate they are worried about, which the ad comes close to implying, but the article highlighted his strengths in contrast to Hillary Clinton. For example, the New York Times piece said Clinton is working harder on winning the Hispanic vote. The story included comments from 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle; Democratic strategist Christopher Lehane; former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and his millionaire donor John Morgan; former Florida House Democratic leader Dan Gelber and more. Crist, who lost a Senate race to Rubio in 2010, called Rubio’s story of a blue-collar upbringing "compelling," while Gelber said Rubio could make "young women swoon, old women pass out, and toilets flush themselves." The New York Times also interviewed Steve Schale, formerly Barack Obama’s Florida campaign director, who had written a blog post about the state’s Hispanic voters the same month the paper published its story. In that blog post, Schale wrote: "Marco Rubio scares me. I’ve been pretty consistent on this one. If you are a Democrat, he should be the one you don’t want to face, because I do think, if he is the nominee, he is the one who could significantly change the Hispanic math in Florida and the Latino math out west. Why? I truly believe he will benefit from the same identity politics that galvanized African American voters behind Obama." That brings us to the next piece of evidence ... "Marco Rubio scares me … If you’re a Democrat, he should be the one you don’t want to face." — Obama strategist to Cokie Roberts: This quote from Schale’s blog post appeared in one of Roberts’ syndicated columns with her husband, Steven. The headline on the column was "Why Rubio scares the Democrats." Now, we must note Schale didn’t say this to Roberts, as the PAC ad claims, and Schale told us he hadn’t spoken to her. She only quoted him and linked to his post. Roberts pointed to Rubio’s personality, storytelling ability and defense of his Hispanic heritage as strengths. "Rubio is the best storyteller in the Republican field. The tales he tells — of his father the bartender and his mother the hotel maid — send a powerful message: I know what your lives are like. I'm just like you," Roberts wrote. That jibed with what Schale thought, and still does. "I definitely did say I'm scared of Marco, and I still think he's our party's biggest threat," Schale told PolitiFact Florida. Keep in mind, however, that Schale worked for the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC to convince Vice President Joe Biden to run for president. He thinks Rubio is a threat not just to Hillary Clinton, but to any Democratic hopeful. "I believe he is their strongest candidate," he said. "Bill Clinton believes Marco Rubio is Hillary’s biggest threat." — Fox News: The ad is referring to author Ed Klein’s Oct. 14, 2015, appearance on Fox & Friends. After the first Democratic primary debate, Fox interviewed Klein, who wrote the book Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary. During the segment, Klein described an anonymously sourced story from the book, in which Bill Clinton allegedly said Rubio was his wife’s greatest challenger because of Rubio’s age and appeal to Hispanic voters. (Fox News’ online headline was "Author: Bill Clinton Believes This GOP Contender Is Hillary's Biggest Threat.") Klein’s description of the incident in his book quotes Bill Clinton thusly: "He’s young, Hispanic, and a good speaker. He’d pose a generational challenge (to Hillary, who will turn 69 in 2016) and a challenge for the Hispanic vote, which we need to win…. We’ve got to destroy him before he gets off the ground." The author previously had written very critical books about the Clintons and the Obamas, and has faced criticism from both liberal and conservative camps over thin sourcing and sensational allegations. Bill Clinton’s office told us it questioned Klein’s credibility, and therefore the claim. A Clinton spokesman called Klein’s version of events an "alternate reality." Baby Got PAC is putting a lot of faith in one anonymously sourced anecdote for its ad. The story also doesn’t constitute asking either Hillary or Bill Clinton directly whether they feel Rubio is a threat. But Klein insists the former president made the comment. "I stand by the quote, which was related to me by a very reliable source who was in the room and heard Bill Clinton talk about Rubio," Klein told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Baby Got PAC’s ad said Democrats "admitted there’s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that’s Sen. Marco Rubio." There’s no actual statement from Hillary Clinton saying as much, so that part of the commercial is a stretch. The commercial does share some sources that quote Democratic politicians and operatives, and leans heavily on former Obama campaign director Schale, who wrote a blog post expressing some anxiety about Rubio. Schale, it’s worth noting, favored Biden over Hillary Clinton initially. Baby Got PAC further puts a lot of faith in an anecdote involving Bill Clinton that is largely unsubstantiated. With those caveats, it’s still clear Rubio’s campaign is a concern to strategists on the left. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09842	"We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation on Earth."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/20/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-us-doubles-every-other-country-capita/	One of the common themes from supporters of the Democratic health plan is that the United States spends too much on health care and gets too little in return. But in a recent interview, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic majority, stretched the evidence too far. On the Aug. 19, 2009, Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, Sanders responded to a question about corporate interests' role in the health care reform debate by saying, "We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation on Earth. And there is a reason why the insurance companies, year after year, make huge profits and pay their CEOs tens and tens of millions of dollars in compensation salaries. And the reason for that is that these guys exert enormous influence over the political process in Washington." With this item, we'll address his international comparisons on health spending. We looked at two widely used sources of international health care comparisons — statistics from the World Health Organization, the public health arm of the United Nations, and from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that represents 30 wealthier, industrialized countries, most of them in Europe and North America. We also confirmed with three international health care experts that these were the best statistics available. According to the 2009 edition of WHO's World Health Statistics report, which uses figures from 2006, health care spending in the United States — both public- and private-sector — amounted to $6,719 per capita. Ranking next were Luxembourg and Monaco at $6,506 and $6,353 per capita, respectively. All told, either 11 or 15 countries told the WHO they spent more than $3,360 per capita, the point at which the United States no longer doubles their spending. (We provide two possible figures here because the WHO offers both raw figures and statistics adjusted for currency valuations.) The other nations that rank near the top with the United States include Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, in addition to tiny Malta and San Marino. The OECD's numbers tell a similar story. In 2007, the OECD said that the United States spent $7,290 per capita on health care, ranking it first among the 30 countries studied. Five other nations spent more than $3,645 per capita, the point at which the United States no longer doubles their spending. The highest is the Netherlands at $4,417. The other four were Austria, Canada, Norway and Switzerland. Sanders would have been on completely firm ground had he simply said, "We spend more per capita on health care than any other nation on Earth." But instead he said "twice as much." And for that reason we rate his statement False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2009-08-20T16:58:12	2009-08-19	['None']
pomt-02421	"All of Florida's four-year state colleges now offer bachelor's degrees for only $10,000."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/04/rick-scott/scott-says-all-4-year-state-colleges-offer-10k-deg/	In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Rick Scott criticized the high price of a college degree. "Parents saving for their children to get a four-year degree from a public university today have to save $53,000. $53,000," he said before pivoting to brag about Florida schools. "We can’t celebrate how successful higher education is until we can celebrate that it’s affordable. That’s why I’m proud that all of our four-year state colleges now offer bachelor’s degrees for only $10,000." We decided to check Scott's claim that each four-year state college offers degrees for $10,000? First a note, four-year state colleges do not include Florida’s large universities such as Florida State University, the University of Florida or the University of South Florida. You can't get a $10,000 degree at any of those places. Florida's state college system make up what were previously called community colleges. Back in November 2012, Scott issued a challenge to four-year state colleges to offer $10,000 bachelor degrees. All of the state colleges that offer bachelor's degrees -- 23 of them -- accepted, according to a press release from the governor’s office. A 24th school, Pasco-Hernando Community College, also accepted Scott's challenge, but isn't yet offering any type or price of bachelor's degree. So how's it going? Not as well as Scott let on. At least yet. A spokeswoman for the Florida College System said that out of the 23 eligible schools, only 10 had students enrolled in $10,000 degree programs as of the fall 2013 semester. The spokeswoman said three more schools were scheduled to begin enrollment this spring. That's only about half of the schools overall, short of what Scott said, and even those schools have other caveats in place that restrict who is eligible for the $10,000 degrees. What degrees students can receive for $10,000 vary by college. Many institutions will only enroll students for $10,000 degree programs in a few specific majors, such as technology development, supply chain management and mathematics education. Some colleges are considering the change for all areas of study, but none are offering every major to current students. The Tampa Bay Times reported that for St. Petersburg College, eligible students must have 12 to 15 accelerated credits before enrolling. Students have to take classes during fall, spring and summer semesters and earn Cs or better. Also, the $10,000 doesn't really get you a degree. That price only covers tuition costs for students -- not books, housing, meals, fees and other expenses that can add up over four years. Our ruling Scott said, "All of Florida's four-year state colleges now offer bachelor's degrees for only $10,000." The schools that make up the state college system have accepted a challenge from Scott to offer $10,000 degrees, but only about half currently do. Also, there are several other caveats as to who can get a cheap degree and in what major. Lastly, the $10,000 degree doesn't cover books, housing, meals, fees and other expenses. Scott left out important context in his remarks at the State of the State address. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-03-04T17:34:56	2014-03-04	['None']
pomt-03252	Says Virginia saved $300 million by rebidding a Metrorail construction project to exclude guaranteed union contracts.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/12/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-embellishes-savings-stopping-union-cont/	GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Democrat Terry McAuliffe will drive up transportation costs by steering road and rail construction contracts to labor unions. For proof, Cuccinelli has been describing Virginia’s experience this year soliciting bids for a construction phase of the Metrorail’s new Silver Line that will provide subway service from Washington to Dulles Airport in Loudoun County. "I keep trying to come back to transportation and spending for transportation and when you’ve got the kind of union ties (McAuliffe) does, that’s a concern," Cuccinelli said during a July 29 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. "I mean, the one specific example is in Northern Virginia where the governor forced the rebidding of half of one transportation project -- the Metro extension -- because they had done that with Project Labor Agreements. These are guaranteed labor contracts and the governor said, `If you want to get state money (for the project), you’ve got to rebid those contracts. So they did and the price came down $300 million. "Gov. McAuliffe won’t force the rebidding of guaranteed union contracts and Gov. Cuccinelli will," he said. Cuccinelli made the same claim during a July 20 debate with McAuliffe. So we decided to examine his contention that $300 million was saved by rebidding the contract without the union-friendly provision. Let’s start with some background. Construction of the 23-mile Silver Line began in early 2009. Phase 1, a $2.7 billion extension of Northern Virginia subway lines from Falls Church to past Tysons Corner, is expected to be completed this year. Work on Phase 2, an 11-mile expansion to Dulles Airport and slightly beyond, is scheduled to start next year and be finished in 2018. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is managing the project and last year estimated the second phase would also cost $2.7 billion. In April 2010, the MWAA Board of Directors ordered a Project Labor Agreement that would allow construction unions to determine the wages, benefits and employment conditions for all Phase 2 laborers -- whether they belonged to a union or not. The action was denounced by the state chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors and many Republican politicians, including Cuccinelli and Gov. Bob McDonnell, who said the agreement would elevate costs to depress bidding competition for Phase 2. Critics also said the agreement was inconsistent with the state’s libertarian culture, pointing to an academic study that found 95 percent of private-company construction workers in Virginia last year were non-union. Virginia is one of 24 states with a right-to-work law that bars compulsory union membership. In April 2012, McDonnell signed a bill banning state aid to projects requiring a Project Labor Agreement. Two months later, the MWAA rescinded the union-friendly policy. Now, let’s return to Cuccinelli’s claim that after the agreement was dropped, Phase 2 was rebid and taxpayers saved $300 million. Cuccinelli’s campaign defended the claim by sending us a May 2013 news release from the MWAA announcing its awarding of a construction contract for roughly half of the work in Phase 2. But there has been no rebidding in Phase 2, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton, so any savings from eliminating the union agreement is conjecture. The MWAA originally estimated that the contract it put out this spring would come in at between $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, but Capital Rail Constructors submitted a winning bid of $1.18 billion. That’s the basis of the savings Cuccinelli claims: A range of $222 million to $422 million compared to the original estimates. Connaughton said he believes the elimination of the union agreement reduced costs -- although he didn’t know by how much -- because it encouraged contractors weary of unions to bid on the contract. That expanded competition and bidders "sharpened their pencils," he said. Debate over the value of Planned Labor Agreements goes far beyond Virginia and there are many defenders of the arrangements. The Laborers’ International Union of North America pointed us to a report from Cornell University professor Fred Kotler that says PLAs have saved money on New York projects because they establish predictable costs, guarantee standards of excellence and management rights, and give contractors flexibility on starting times. A few final notes: Cuccinelli said that McAuliffe, if he was governor, would back union-guaranteed contracts. McAuliffe, in June, declined to say whether he supports such agreements. McAuliffe has reaped almost $1.2 million in contributions from organized labor this year, prompting Cuccinelli to portray him as a pawn for unions. Cuccinelli, in contrast, has received only $250 from unions. In July, we gave a False rating to a Cuccinelli claim that McAuliffe "opposes" Virginia’s right-to-work law. Our ruling Cuccinelli says Virginia saved $300 million by rebidding a Dulles Metrorail contract without a union-friendly agreement. But the project was not re-bid -- the "savings" was a reflection of preliminary construction estimates compared to the winning bid made by a contractor. The state’s transportation secretary believes that eliminating a requirement for union contracts expanded bidding competition and led to savings, but says there’s no way of knowing how much. The basis of Cuccinelli’s statement has merit; Virginia did force the repeal of the union requirement and project bids came in lower than expected. But he twists facts to suggest there was a tangible $300 million savings in killing the union agreement. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01122	New tax increases that went into effect on Jan. 1, 2015, "all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/05/chain-email/what-will-happen-taxes-january-2015-chain-email-wr/	The start of a new year traditionally offers the possibility of rebirth. Apparently, that goes for chain emails, too. It was last May when we first encountered a chain email that purported to list a wide variety of taxes that went up on Jan. 1, 2014. The email was littered with errors, so we rated it Pants on Fire. Now, readers are flooding the PolitiFact inbox asking whether a new version of the email -- keyed to a new date, Jan. 1, 2015 -- is accurate. It isn’t, and we’ll explain why. Here’s the text of the email that’s currently circulating: Reminder for those who forgot or for many that didn't know Here is what will happen on January 1, 2015 : Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35% Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2% Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28% Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6% Estate tax went from 0% to 55% Remember this fact: These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. If you think that it is important that everyone in the U.S. should know this, pass it on. If not, then delete it. We’ll take these claims in order: "Here is what will happen on January 1, 2015" To the extent that these tax rates were changed -- and as we’ll see most of them didn’t change in the way the email says -- the changes didn’t take effect on Jan. 1, 2015 (or, for that matter, on Jan. 1, 2014). They took effect on Jan. 1, 2013. That may seem like a minor difference, but in this case, it makes all the difference. The tax rates that changed on Jan. 1, 2013, were all passed as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. That was a bipartisan deal -- we’ll discuss just how bipartisan in a bit -- that passed after the 2012 presidential election to avoid the "fiscal cliff." The "cliff" refers to the expiration of tax cuts originally passed under President George W. Bush. The law made permanent many but not all of the Bush-era tax cuts that were set to expire anyway. So some people did see their tax rates go up, primarily upper-income taxpayers. That’s what the email is attempting to spotlight, but it does so in a way that introduces a host of inaccuracies. "Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%" This tax hike, unlike the others, did indeed stem from the Affordable Care Act, and the tax rates listed in the email are accurate. (Oddly, this line wasn’t included in the previous version of the email.) However, this hike, like the others, took effect on Jan. 1, 2013, not on New Year’s Day 2015. It’s also worth noting that most Americans won’t be affected -- it hits individuals earning $200,000 annually or married couples earning $250,000. "Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%" The timing is wrong, but the numbers are correct. For 2015, the 39.6 percent rate is for individuals earning over $413,200 in taxable income or married couples earning at least $464,850. "Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%" Usually, people think about income taxes and payroll taxes separately. But it’s not uncommon for tax experts to look at the combination of income and payroll taxes together, because they give a sense of the overall burden of direct taxation on individuals. That’s what the email did here. On Jan. 1, 2013, the top combined rate for the income and payroll tax went from 37.9 percent to 42.5 percent, or 43.4 percent due to the additional Medicare tax in the health care law. So if you just look at the federal rates, the email overstates the current top rate. If you take state taxes into account, the email is closer, but still inaccurate. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, calculated 2013 combined tax rates for each state. The group found that the top marginal tax rate, averaged across all states, is 47.9 percent. Of course, any state taxes would have been imposed by state governments, and thus were not part of the Affordable Care Act. And this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison; to make the comparison fair, the initial tax rate would need to be adjusted upward for state and local taxes as well. "Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%" On Jan. 1, 2013, the highest capital gains tax rate rose from 15 percent to 20 percent. The Affordable Care Act’s additional 3.8 percent Medicare tax for high-income earners can be added to make it 23.8 percent. Either way you calculate it, the email exaggerates the amount of the increase. (And most households still pay nothing or 15 percent for capital gains, depending on their income.) If you add in state and local capital gains taxes, the Tax Foundation says the current rate, averaged across the 50 states, is 28.7 percent, but Tax Foundation economist Kyle Pomerleau told us this is "sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison." "Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%" This line would have been correct if the Bush tax cuts had expired the way they were initially supposed to. But the December 2012 deal ended up going with a top marginal tax rate of 20 percent on dividend income instead of the pre-Bush rate of 39.6 percent on dividend income. It rose to 23.8 percent due to the high-income added Medicare tax under Obamacare. So the final rate cited in the email is far higher than the current rate. "Estate tax went from 0% to 55%" Both ends of this claim are wrong. The estate tax was gradually wound down by the Bush-era tax cuts, disappearing entirely, for one year, in 2010. For 2011 and 2012 it was reimposed at 35 percent, then raised to 40 percent on Jan. 1, 2013 as part of the "fiscal cliff" bill. Also, it’s worth noting that the estate tax is heavily targeted at the very richest Americans. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, in recent years, the top 10 percent of income earners paid virtually all of the tax, with over half of that paid by the richest 0.1 percent. Indeed, estates with a gross value under $5.25 million don’t even need to file a form with the Internal Revenue Service, and typically more than half of those who do have to file one are ultimately determined not to owe any estate tax. "These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare." Most of these changes were passed as part of the 2012 fiscal cliff deal, which was enacted with bipartisan support. Facing expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would have meant a massive tax increase up and down the income scale, both parties felt compelled to strike a deal that neither side was really enthusiastic about. In the Senate, the measure passed by an 89-8 margin. Forty Republicans voted for it, and just five Republicans voted against it. In the House, it passed by a 257-167 margin. While a majority of Republicans (151) voted against the bill, 85 Republicans did vote for it. So the email is flatly wrong to say that no Republicans voted for these taxes. It’s also incorrect to say that these taxes were all raised by Obamacare. The health care law did add marginally to three of the five taxes -- it was the source of the Medicare tax hike from from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent, and it added 0.9 percentage points to the top payroll tax rate and 3.8 percentage points to the the capital gains and the dividends tax. But the bulk of the increases came from the fiscal cliff deal. Less than a third of the total percentage-point increases cited by the email came from Obamacare. Our ruling The chain email said that new tax increases went into effect on Jan. 1, 2015, "all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare." The email gets many things wrong, most notably scaring people by saying their tax rates will go up on New Year’s Day 2015. In addition, most of the rates cited are wrong in some way, and are uniformly higher than the actual rates. And the email is flat-out wrong when it blames Democrats, and Obamacare for the increases. The bulk of the tax hikes stem from a different bill entirely -- one that received support from a large majority of Senate Republicans and a significant minority of House Republicans.

pomt-02704	"The commission form of government is definitely losing favor in the United States."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/31/kimberly-nelson/commission-form-statement-true/	An interesting discussion has begun in one of Georgia’s largest counties concerning what form of government is best to serve its 700,000 residents. DeKalb County interim CEO Lee May recently held a series of town hall meetings to talk about its current structure. May wants to end the county’s existing form of government, particularly the CEO position. He has said he’d explore the possibility of a full-time county commission or a full-time commission chair. Any such changes must be approved by the Georgia Legislature, which may review proposals in the upcoming session. May brought University of North Carolina School of Government associate professor Kimberly Nelson to the town hall meetings to explain the forms of government used across the country. One form of county government, she said, is as antiquated as the VCR. "The commission form of government is definitely losing favor in the United States," Nelson said at a Dec. 3 forum held at Rehoboth Presbyterian Church in Tucker. PolitiFact Georgia was at the meeting. We wanted to figure out if what Nelson told the audience was correct. DeKalb’s seven commission seats technically are part-time jobs, although many commissioners argue they work full time. In addition to the publicly elected commissioners, DeKalb has a chief executive officer who is elected by the voters and is in charge of the county’s operations. While commissioners approve some contracts and the annual budget, the CEO wields great power. For example, the CEO can change purchasing policy without the approval of commissioners. Many say that is the most unique form of county government in Georgia. Most U.S. counties use one of three forms of government. The largest number of counties use the "commission" form, in which a board of commissioners -- or sometimes a lone commissioner -- runs the county’s day-to-day operations. The second is the "administrator/manager" form of government, by which commissioners hire someone to run the county’s operations, like Cobb County’s current structure. The third is the "elected executive" form where county residents vote for someone to lead and run the government, much like DeKalb’s current structure. Nelson handed out fliers that contained a breakdown of which forms of governments were used by the nation’s 3,000 or so counties in 1989 and in 2001. Government type 1989 2001 Commission 61.5% 55.4% Commissioner-administrator/manager 25.4% 31.6% Elected executive 13.1% 13.0% "The CEO form and the administrator form are both considered reforms from the traditional commission form of county government. So, in most states, any change is a change away from the commission form," Nelson told us via email. The breakdown was done by the National Association of Counties. Nelson told PolitiFact Georgia she had a more recent breakdown, but she hadn’t had a chance to finish scrubbing the data for any potential errors. The National Association of Counties released its latest such report in March 2009, based on data collected in 2008. Our state-by-state review of the report found that the commission form of government was used by about 42 percent of U.S. counties. Approximately 34 percent of counties use the administrator/manager form of government, while 21 percent have an elected executive form of government. The remaining 3 percent have miscellaneous forms of government. Our review of the 2009 report shows, as Nelson said, there is a decrease in the percentage of counties that currently use a traditional commission form of government. An elected executive form of government is also on the rise. In Georgia, about two-thirds of the state’s 159 counties use the administrator/manager form, according to the 2009 report. "The transition has moved to more professional management and less traditional management," said Dave Willis, government relations manager of the Association County Commissioners of Georgia. More counties are moving toward hiring an administrator because of the array of duties associated with operating a county government, said National Association of Counties spokesman Jim Phillips. "As things get more complicated and counties have more services to provide, they move to an administrator instead of an elected board," he said. Some other metro Atlanta counties are having as much trouble as DeKalb concerning which form of government is best. In Clayton, for example, commissioners decided in January to remove the county manager position, which gave Commission Chairman Jeff Turner more power. Turner hired a chief operating officer and a chief financial officer. By November, commissioners were talking about restoring the county manager position. In Fulton County, leaders there have discussed elevating the commission chair's authority while making it tougher to fire the county manager. State lawmakers may take up both proposals in next year's legislative session, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. To sum up, Nelson said at a DeKalb County town hall meeting on the current structure of county government that "the commission form of government is definitely losing favor in the United States." Anecdotal information and the most comprehensive report on counties support her point. Our rating: True.	None	Kimberly Nelson	None	None	None	2013-12-31T07:14:28	2013-12-03	['United_States']
pomt-00808	"Florida has a law like (Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act)."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/31/jeb-bush/does-florida-have-religious-freedom-restoration-ac/	Likely presidential candidates have reacted to Indiana’s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act as Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, has had to defend the law against those who say it discriminates against gays and lesbians. Former Gov. Jeb Bush sided with Pence in a radio interview on Monday. "I think Gov. Pence has done the right thing," Bush said in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt on March 30. "Florida has a law like this. Bill Clinton signed a law like this at the federal level. This is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs, to be able to be people of conscience. I just think once the facts are established, people aren’t going to see this as discriminatory at all." How similar is the Florida law to the Indiana law, or the federal law before that? When we reached out to Bush’s office, they reiterated that Bush was describing the laws as "very similar." We decided to delve into the evidence for a complete picture. After federal law struck down, Florida’s law followed Today’s controversy goes back to 1993, when Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law’s intent was to protect religious practices from government interference, such as whether a Muslim prison guard could wear a beard, or Native Americans could use peyote as part of the religious practices. In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law didn’t apply to states, which kicked off a spree of about 19 states passing their own versions of the law. In 1998, a year before Bush took office, the Florida Legislature passed the Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act with broad support and little media attention. Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Christian Coalition backed it. It became law without Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles signature. Florida’s law stated, "the government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion." To be clear, it made no mention of same-sex marriage or gay rights. (Neither does the Indiana law.) At the time, state officials seemed most concerned about the protections they would have to provide prisoners. "We had one prisoner who wanted conjugal visits because he said his religion commanded him to 'go forth and multiply,’ "' said Marty Moore, deputy general counsel for Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, to the Lakeland Ledger. Over the years, churches and ministers have used the law to argue that they shouldn’t be subject to zoning laws or other actions from local government. They haven’t found much success due to "hostile judicial interpretation," said University of Virginia professor Douglas Laycock. In one case, Temple B’Nai Zion in Sunny Isles Beach -- a city in Miami-Dade County -- used the Florida law to challenge a decision by the city to designate their 1964 building as historic. The temple’s owners said the designation would stifle expansion plans. The lawsuit was dismissed by a Miami federal judge but reinstated by a federal appeals court. In 2014, the temple and the city reached a settlement that kept the historic designation but allowed some expansion. Differences in text and context In 2015, the context for Indiana’s law is different. Courts have been striking down same-sex marriage bans, including in Indiana, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of the bans this year. When Pence signed Indiana’s law in a private ceremony, people who work for groups that oppose same-sex marriage were in attendance. One of the lobbyists, Eric Miller of Advance America, heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty "for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples." In addition to that context, there are differences in the texts of Florida’s 1998 law and Indiana’s recent law. Indiana’s law says the law can be used to protect religious freedom in private disputes, even if the government is not a party. Florida’s law has no such language. Here’s the Indiana text: "A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding." Indiana’s law seems to be written to specifically cover a situation such as the New Mexico photographer who did not want to participate in a same-sex wedding, said Caroline Mala Corbin, a University of Miami constitutional law professor. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the photographer. Indiana’s law follows the Supreme Court case about Hobby Lobby, in which the court ruled that the federal law protects family owned corporations from being forced to offer insurance that covers contraception under the health care law. Under Indiana’s law, a "person" is extended to mean "a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association" or other entity. "Unlike the federal and Florida RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act), the Indiana one explicitly covers for-profit corporations," Corbin said. "It’s still an open question as to whether Florida’s RFRA extends to any for-profit corporation." University of Minnesota law professor Dale Carpenter pointed to two more differences between the laws in Florida and Indiana: • The Florida law specifically excludes claims made under the state's drug abuse prevention and control law (Chapter 893), which means you can’t get a religious exemption to drug laws in Florida. The Indiana law has no such limitation. • The Florida law requires that a person's religious exercise must be burdened before a claim can be made. The Indiana law says that it need only to be "likely to be substantially burdened." Robin Fretwell Wilson, professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois College of Law, said Florida and Indiana share something in common: Neither has a statewide ban against LGBT discrimination. Our ruling Speaking of the Indiana law, Bush said that Florida "has a law like this." Florida did pass its own version of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But the laws and the context for their passage are different. Indiana’s law says government doesn’t have to be a party to the case, and it extends protections to corporations, and that’s different from Florida’s law. Bush's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-03-31T16:49:31	2015-03-30	['None']
pomt-06524	Says Vince Polistina is "collecting nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries -- plus a government pension."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/10/new-jersey-democratic-state-committee/new-jersey-democrats-say-republican-vince-polistin/	A political mailer reaching homes in Atlantic County gives voters two choices for state Senate: a shiny, green apple and a rotten, brown one. The campaign literature, sent on behalf of state Sen. Jim Whelan, a Democrat fighting for re-election, paints Whelan as the apple you’d want to give a school teacher and Vince Polistina, the Republican candidate in the 2nd legislative district race, as a decaying piece of fruit. The literature, paid for and authorized by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, tells voters "Whelan won’t let some rotten politicians get in the way of reforming government." Polistina, the mailer claims, is a "backroom dealer looking to profit at taxpayer expense." "Polistina donated thousands of dollars to Atlantic County politicians. Then he raked in more than $6 million in no-bid government contracts paid for by South Jersey taxpayers. But that wasn’t enough for Vince," the mailer, which was sent to PolitiFact New Jersey on Oct. 1, says. "He’s also collecting nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries -- plus a government pension and all the perks he can pocket." All of the 120 seats in the state Legislature are up for grabs this November, but the state Senate race between Whelan and Polistina is one of the most hotly contested -- and each candidate has accused the other of siphoning funds from government coffers to boost their personal wealth. For this Truth-O-Meter item, PolitiFact New Jersey researched the Democrats’ claims that Polistina is banking nearly $70,000 in public salaries and collecting a government pension. The first part of that claim is correct. The second half is not only wrong -- it’s hypocritical. First, let’s note that Polistina owns an engineering firm. Polistina acknowledged the firm brought in more than $6 million from 2004 to 2010 through government contracts, but said that’s revenue with which he is paying employees and overhead expenses. He also works part-time for two public entities. As a state assemblyman, Polistina is paid $49,000. He is also the authority engineer for the Egg Harbor Township Municipal Utilities Authority, a position that pays $20,000 annually. So Democrats correctly stated that Polistina is collecting "nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries." But is Polistina also collecting a pension? Polistina isn’t eligible to enroll in the state’s Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS, as a state legislator because he was elected after July 1, 2007. However, Polistina is enrolled in PERS through his position with the municipal utilities authority. But he is not collecting a pension, according to state treasury documents. Those facts would leave us at a Half True. But Whelan is doing what the Democrats wrongly accused Polistina of -- collecting a government pension on top of "taxpayer-funded salaries." Whelan’s salary as a state senator is $49,000 and he made nearly $67,500 as an Atlantic City public school teacher, according to state records current as of Oct. 15, 2010. He draws a monthly pension payment through PERS of more than $2,600 for his previous work as a government official and is enrolled in state’s pension fund for teachers, according to state treasury documents and financial disclosure forms. Whelan did not return requests for comment. Jason Springer, a spokesman for the state Democratic committee, said the mailer "accurately reflects the salary Mr. Polistina is collecting and the pension credits he is banking." We asked Springer whether the committee acknowledges that the mailer implies Polistina is currently collecting a pension -- not banking pension credits -- and if they could explain why they were targeting Polistina for something Whelan is doing. Springer said in an email that the committee "stands by our previous response" and then repeated claims in the mailer. Our ruling The state Democratic committee said Polistina collects "nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries -- plus a government pension." Polistina is paid $69,000 for two part-time, public positions. He is in the pension system, but not collecting a pension. The Democratic committee made the accusation against a Republican, despite their candidate collecting a pension on top of two government salaries. That makes the claim outrageous. We rate it Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	New Jersey Democratic State Committee	None	None	None	2011-10-10T05:15:00	2011-10-01	['None']
pomt-09861	The Democrat-backed health care reform plan "will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/john-boehner/boehner-says-democrats-health-care-plan-would-lead/	In an already contentious health care debate, the last thing the Obama administration wants is a fight over abortion. The word "abortion" was never mentioned in the initial health care plans released by the House and Senate. The decision of whether to offer abortion coverage in the proposed public plan, then, would be left up to the health and human services secretary. Abortion opponents said that would allow Democrats to slip abortion into the plan as part of the standard coverage. In an op-ed piece on July 23, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio repeated the concerns of many who oppose abortion that the Democratic-backed health care reform plan "will require (Americans) to subsidize abortion with their hard-earned tax dollars." Although there are several versions of the health care bill kicking around in Congress, one thing has now become clear: Most envision a government-run health plan option that could include abortion coverage, as well as a health care exchange in which participating private insurance companies would be permitted to offer such coverage. But does that mean that federal tax dollars would be used to subsidize abortions? That's a more difficult question. Let's back up a minute and explain some background: Currently, the 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. President Barack Obama gave a nod to that precedent when asked in a July 21 CBS interview with Katie Couric whether he favored a government option that would cover abortions. Obama said, "As you know, I'm prochoice. But I think we also have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care. Rather than wade into that issue at this point, I think that it's appropriate for us to figure out how to just deliver on the cost savings, and not get distracted by the abortion debate at this station." Abortion opponents had hoped similar restrictions to those in the Hyde Amendment would be placed on any government-run health care option, and also be extended to any private insurance companies that participate in the government-sponsored health care exchange, which will provide health insurance for people who don't get it through their employer. To that end, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., offered an amendment to the House health care proposal that would prohibit the use of public money "to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion." The amendment was narrowly defeated. Donna Crane, policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Stupak's proposal a "radical departure from the status quo," because millions of women who currently have private insurance plans that cover abortions would be stripped of that coverage if their plan ultimately became part of the exchange — which seems likely. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women currently have health insurance that covers abortions. And so began the debate over how to make the health care reform bill "abortion neutral." A compromise plan offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents — particularly the issue of tax dollars being used to subsidize abortions — while specifically making abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange. Under the Capps amendment: • Abortion coverage would not be part of the required minimum benefits package. In other words, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. • The public plan could include abortion coverage, but the cost of the additional coverage could not be paid through public subsidies (tax dollars), only through the premiums paid by the insured. And with private plans in the exchange, again, federal subsidies could not be used for abortion coverage. • Public funding would only be permitted for abortions allowed under the Hyde Amendment — in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. • At least one plan in every region must offer full abortion coverage; and one must not. • Any insurance plan participating in the exchange cannot discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) that are unwilling to provide abortions. • The plan will not pre-empt any state laws regarding abortion, such as parental notification laws. Douglas Johnson, legislative director for National Right to Life, said the amendment is hardly a compromise, and the pledge not to prohibit the use of public funds amounts to little more than symbolic bookkeeping. The Capps amendment may claim to segregate funds used for abortions, he said, but the bottom line is you have the government paying subsidies to people who are then able to obtain abortion coverage. And, he said, "It's still the government running the whole plan." "The government would be participating in the killing of unborn children under the guise of a health care plan," Johnson said. But that's not the opinion of all antiabortion groups. Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, which opposes abortion, said his group doesn't want to see an important health care plan derailed by a "misleading campaign" that claims the health care plan would mean taxpayer-subsidized abortions. "The goal should be to maintain the current policies," Korzen said. "That Capps amendment accomplishes just that. It specifically prohibits taxpayers' funding of abortions. It disappoints me that there are people who are still making that claim." And, he said, "there's a lot to be happy about," including the fact that abortion coverage was not included as part of the required minimum benefits package. Crane said NARAL believes abortion should be treated like any other health service. But they think the Capps amendment at least maintains the status quo, and that it helped to alleviate many of the concerns expressed by abortion opponents. "We thought they got everything they wanted," Crane said. "We are confused why they continue to push." Obviously, there's a lot at stake in the health care bill for both sides in the abortion debate. The fact that several versions of the health care reform bill are floating around Congress makes it difficult to say with certainty what the final plan will or will not include. But while it appears likely the plan would allow for the coverage of abortions, we don't see anything in the plans that would require taxpayers to foot the bill for that. In fact, in a key version of the bill — the one passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee — members went to great pains to include an amendment to ensure that federal money is not used for abortion coverage. Again, things could change as the health reform package works its way through Congress, but for now, we don't see anything to support Boehner's claim that taxpayers would subsidize abortions. And so we rule his statement False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2009-08-07T18:38:45	2009-07-23	['United_States']
pomt-02024	"The Pentagon made up" the since-debunked heroics of POW Jessica Lynch as she tried to avoid capture in Iraq.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/05/rachel-maddow/maddow-pentagon-made-story-jessica-lynchs-heroism/	As controversy swells surrounding the decision to swap five dangerous Taliban commanders for POW Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow is trying to defend the prisoner exchange by comparing it to the rescue of Iraq POW Jessica Lynch. On her June 3, 2014, show, Maddow explained Lynch’s story -- how her convoy had taken wrong turns in Nasiriyah, Iraq, in 2003 and was ambushed. And Maddow cited dramatic details in a Washington Post report that Lynch "fought fiercely and shot several enemy soldiers after Iraqi forces ambushed the Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company, firing her weapon until she ran out of ammunition." But Lynch has since said that description is incorrect, saying her gun jammed in the chaos. Maddow highlighted the navigational mistakes of U.S. troops and the inaccurate story of Lynch’s heroics to draw a comparison to Bergdahl. "If the heroics that the Pentagon made up about her (Lynch) didn't really happen, and they didn’t, maybe the U.S. special forces who rescued her and the other Americans … maybe they shouldn’t have bothered," Maddow said, sarcastically. "After all, maybe it was sort of their own screw up that got them ambushed and hurt and captured in the first place. Is that how we think about these things now?" Some people who saw Maddow’s reporting questioned her assertion that "the Pentagon made up" Lynch’s heroism. The Pentagon is the building that houses the U.S. Defense Department and a quasi-official way to reference the Defense Department. Saying the Pentagon "made up" something is the equivalent of accusing George W. Bush's Defense Department. We decided to dig into Maddow's claim further. (We reached out to Maddow through an MSNBC spokeswoman but did not hear back by our deadline.) Genesis of the inaccurate stories There is no question that much of the original Washington Post report, dated April 3, 2003, (Lynch was captured March 23 and rescued April 1) is inaccurate. There were two main inaccuracies in the original Post report: The story said Lynch suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was stabbed. But doctors found no evidence of either. Lynch "was fighting to the death," a U.S. official told the Post, and she killed several Iraqis. But Lynch’s weaponed was jammed, and she killed no Iraqis. The Post reporting became the genesis "of a spate of stories that accepted the Post sequence of events," journalist Dante Chinni, who researched the issue, wrote for the Pew Research Journalism Project. "Many articles focused on the Rambo-like firefight Lynch reportedly engaged in — some even cited her valiant fighting as proof that women belonged in combat zones." Within a few weeks, however, the story had all but fallen apart. Chinni provides a good timeline: April 15, 2003: The Washington Post runs a piece questioning its earlier account. A physician from the Iraqi hospital that treated Lynch said, "There were no bullets or shrapnel or anything like that." April 18: An Associated Press story backs off earlier accounts. The AP quotes a military official who says the Lynch gunfight "has not been confirmed." May 15: A BBC News piece calls the Lynch story "one of the most stunning pieces of news management ever conceived." May 26: The Chicago Tribune continues to debunk the story of Lynch’s heroics. "The story of Jessica Lynch is the tale of how a modern war icon is made, and perhaps how easily officials and journalists with different agendas accepted contradictory, self-serving versions of what happened to her," the Tribune wrote. Source of the bad information The Post relied on anonymous sources only described as "U.S. officials" in its initial report. Maddow claimed the "Pentagon" made the story up. Actually, the story itself said the Pentagon couldn’t confirm the story. The original Post report, written by Susan Schmidt and Vernon Loeb, said that Pentagon officials "had heard ‘rumors’ of Lynch's heroics but had had no confirmation." Loeb provided many more details about the source of his reporting during a Dec. 15, 2003, NPR interview. (The Lynch talk starts about 30 minutes in.) Loeb described his sources as "some really good intelligence sources here in Washington." He said that after the information was proven to be false, the Post went back to reconstruct what happened. They found that the intelligence was coming from the battlefield and that U.S. officials had picked up on Iraqi "intercepts talking about a blind American firing back." Intelligence officials, who could include a number of people working at a host of different agencies, interpreted that blind American to be Lynch. Loeb was asked if he thought he was given the reports as part of an effort to mythologize Lynch. "No not at all," said Loeb, who is now managing editor of the Houston Chronicle. "I’ve been asked this over and over again. Our sources for that story were not Pentagon sources. In fact, I could not get anybody from the Pentagon to talk about those reports at all. I got indications that they had in fact received those intelligence reports, but the Pentagon was completely unwilling to comment on those reports at all. They wouldn’t say anything about Jessica Lynch. "I’ve never believed that, as least as the story we wrote goes, that it was a Pentagon attempt to create a hero there," Loeb said. (The Pentagon also was accused of romanticizing Lynch’s rescue for PR purposes, a separate charge Loeb also says he does not believe.) CNN's former senior Pentagon reporter, Jamie McIntyre, largely corroborated Loeb's account in a 2007 interview with Howard Kurtz. "Nobody in the Army could figure out where the information was coming from," McIntyre said. "There were no official statements that ever portrayed Jessica Lynch as going down fighting, and it appeared that the Post story was based on a single source who in retrospect may have confused the actions of other soldiers with Jessica Lynch. "Even in that original story it said that the Pentagon ... had heard rumors of this but couldn't confirm it." Our ruling Maddow said, "the Pentagon made up" the heroics of POW Jessica Lynch as she tried to avoid capture in Iraq. Maddow was making the point that the United States should have rescued Lynch whether or not she was a hero, just like it was right to bring Bergdahl home. That may be a popular opinion, but Maddow missed on the details of Lynch’s now-debunked story. First, the original report Maddow pointed to -- an article in the Washington Post -- specifically said that the Pentagon couldn’t confirm the story. And later, the author of the Post report made clear that his source was not the Pentagon. Loeb, the author, went further to say he does not believe he was fed false information "to create a hero." The reality is we don’t know who provided the information to Loeb; he and his colleague Schmidt won’t say. Maddow fails to have the evidence to back up her claim. We rate it False.

pomt-07094	"(New Jersey Network) is the only news station which covers New Jersey government."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/24/loretta-weinberg/sen-loretta-weinberg-claims-new-jersey-network-onl/	Sen. Loretta Weinberg may need to do some more channel surfing for news about government in New Jersey. After Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in early June to turn over control of the 40-year-old New Jersey Network to New York-based television station WNET, Democratic legislators called for a closer examination of the proposal. Assembly Democrats on Thursday rejected Christie's plans, however. As a result, the fate of the public broadcasting network is in limbo. Weinberg, a Democrat who represents Bergen County, raised concerns about the deal in a June 6 column on Bluejersey.com, calling it "a give-away of one of our state's greatest assets." Using bold and italics in the following statement, Weinberg went on to say: "NJN is the only news station which covers New Jersey government. Their public affairs and interview shows as well as the nightly news will be no longer. We still don't have the detail on this, and once the state report is officially released, the Legislature will have 15 days to respond or the ‘give-away’ is considered approved." The only news station covering New Jersey government? It didn’t take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to realize Weinberg was wrong. We found stories about New Jersey government on the websites of television stations based in the New York and Philadelphia areas. Some stories were written by the Associated Press, but others were covered by reporters working for those stations or their affiliates. Secaucus-based My9 News also runs a weekly political talk show called "New Jersey Now." In fact, Weinberg appeared on that program on Feb. 6 to discuss the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission. News 12 New Jersey provides news coverage for cable subscribers in northern and central parts of the state, as well as its weekly show, "Power and Politics," and its monthly "Capital Hotseat" interviews. While other stations cover the metropolitan areas, NJN and News 12 are comparable in the amount of time devoted to New Jersey news, according to Lawrence Londino, chair of the Department of Broadcasting at Montclair State University. "It’s certainly not the only game in town," said Londino, referring to NJN. Weinberg acknowledged in a phone interview that other stations provide news coverage and said she could have been more articulate in her statement. She maintained that NJN is the only network providing regular nightly news shows focused on New Jersey government. "I knew what was in my mind," said Weinberg, before referring to News 12 New Jersey: "Whatever news they cover is very sporadic." Janice Selinger, the acting executive director at NJN, also argued that News 12’s coverage is not comparable to NJN. "Other people do cover state government. They don’t cover it as extensively as we do and they don’t cover it for the whole state," Selinger said. "We’re not just there when the story breaks. We’re there every day." The NJN News broadcast appears at three regular times each weekday night, and other news programs such as "On the Record" appear on weekends. News 12 New Jersey runs a live broadcast for a total of nine and a half hours each weekday, and then two live newscasts on Saturday and Sunday. In a statement, News 12 New Jersey General Manager and News Director Randal Stanley responded to Weinberg’s comments. "With a full-time news bureau at the State Capitol, News 12 is dedicated to providing New Jersey’s communities and its local residents with daily coverage of events and issues on state government and other important topics," according to the statement. "In addition, News 12's election season includes live coverage on election night, a schedule of political debates, live coverage of the State of the State address, plus inaugurations, town hall meetings, and more." Let’s review: Weinberg said NJN is the "only news station which covers New Jersey government," but other television stations clearly cover government in the Garden State through news and political talk shows. Weinberg later praised the extent of coverage provided by NJN, but her statement was not about comparing coverage among different news stations. She said NJN was the only one doing the job, and that’s why we rate her statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11936	A viral image shows LeBron James wearing a T-shirt that reads, "We march, y’all mad. We sit down, y’all mad. We speak up, y’all mad. We die, y’all silent."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/12/viral-image/fake-photo-changes-social-message-lebron-james-t-s/	A viral image of National Basketball Association superstar LeBron James wearing a T-shirt about racial inequity gained lots of traction on social media, but the wording has been digitally replaced. PolitiFact first saw an image of James wearing the shirt on Oct. 9, 2017, on the Facebook page of Occupy Democrats, but the photo has spread all over the Internet. It shows the Cleveland Cavaliers player walking on a basketball court with a black T-shirt that reads, "We march, y’all mad. We sit down, y’all mad. We speak up, y’all mad. We die, y’all silent." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The post is ubiquitous on Facebook posts from across the country. The same goes for Twitter, where one tweet that used the photo was liked 291,000 times as of this writing. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com But the image is fake. James wasn’t wearing that shirt in that photo (although you can buy it from scads of online retailers). He actually was wearing a completely different tee with a message about social injustice. The photo was from warmups for James’ Dec. 8, 2014, game in Brooklyn. His teammate Kyrie Irving also wore the shirt, as did four members of the Brooklyn Nets. Here’s the unaltered photo: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com This Icon Sportswire photo from Dec. 8, 2014, had been altered and posted on the Internet. The players wore the shirts to pay tribute to 43-year-old Eric Garner, a black man who died while being choked by a New York police officer on Staten Island. His last words, "I can’t breathe," became a slogan at protests across the country. "I've been quoted over and over about what's going on as far as it's more of a notion to the family, more than anything. Obviously, as a society we have to do better. We have to be better for one another," James said in 2014. "It doesn't matter what race you are. It's more of a shout out to the family more than anything, because they're the ones that should be getting all the energy and effort." More recently, James chided President Donald Trump, who lashed out at the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry for refusing to visit the White House with his championship team. James called Trump a "bum"on Twitter and later added that Trump "doesn't understand the power that he has" as president. The older photo of James has been altered to make it look like he was wearing something he wasn’t. That earns this photo of a shirt a False.

pomt-05868	"Twenty-five or 24 million people" are "out of work or stopped looking for work."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/10/mitt-romney/romney-revises-claim-about-unemployed/	Super Tuesday is only one month away, which means the GOP presidential hopefuls are descending on Georgia to convince voters they deserve Barack Obama’s job. And speaking of jobs, they’re hammering Obama on unemployment. When Republican front-runner Mitt Romney stumped at an Atlanta custom countertop showroom Wednesday afternoon, he said that "25 or 24 million" people are "out of work or stopped looking for work." A PolitiFact Georgia team member stood among the crowd of 300, Truth-O-Meter in hand. It lit up and told us that Romney was doing a new take on an old talking point. Last month, during the Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Romney said that "we have 25 million Americans out of work" during the Republican presidential debate. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National ruled his statement Half True. Does Romney’s revised statement earn him higher marks on the Truth-O-Meter? First, let’s look at his statement from January. Officially, there were about 13.1 million unemployed Americans in December 2011, which put the unemployment rate at 8.5 percent. This is according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s source of employment statistics. Romney’s count was some 12 million higher. Here’s why: When PolitiFact National analyzed Romney’s statement, they pointed out that certain critics have long argued that the BLS definition of unemployment is too limiting. It doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for work or are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job. To address this concern, BLS offers an alternative measure (known to economists as "U-6") that includes these other groups. By this metric, an additional 2.6 million people in the U.S. were "marginally attached" to the labor force in December 2011, meaning they’d be ready to work if a job became available. Another 8.1 million were working part time but would prefer a full-time job. Together, these three categories added up to 23.8 million people in December 2011, for a total "U-6" rate of 15.2 percent -- well above the official unemployment rate. Romney’s data was a little high, but in the ballpark. Romney earned a Half True. His use of the term "out of work" was a stretch when about one-third of the "25 million Americans out of work" are actually working part time, PolitiFact National ruled in January. Now on to Romney’s statement in Atlanta. Romney described those "25 or 24 million" people as being "out of work" or having "stopped looking for work." The newest jobs data shows Romney’s calculation for the total number of unemployed, looking for work or are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job, remains more or less accurate. In January, some 12.8 million people were unemployed and 2.8 million people were marginally attached to the labor force, according to BLS figures. An additional 8.2 million were working part time even though they wanted a full-time position. Once again, that totals 23.8 million. But Romney’s latest description of these workers was a little off the mark. The BLS describes "marginally attached workers" as people not in the labor force who want to work and are available to do it, and who have looked for a job in the past 12 months, but had not done so in the past four weeks. These people want work, but have recently given up because they have family obligations, think they can’t get a job, or other reasons. The BLS calls people who are working part time even though they’d prefer a full-time job as working "part time for economic reasons." This is defined as those who worked one to 34 hours a week because they can’t find full-time work or business has slowed down. The BLS does not ask whether they stopped looking for work. Of the 24 or 25 million workers mentioned by Romney, only 15.6 million clearly match his description as being "out of work" or having "stopped looking for work." The remaining one-third may or may not be angling for more hours or a full-time slot at their current employer. They could have stopped looking for full-time work altogether. We don’t know. Romney’s statement is partially accurate, but he gets important details wrong. He therefore earns a Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-02-10T06:00:00	2012-02-08	['None']
pomt-10997	European allies "pay us $2.5 billion a year to keep our forces there. It would cost us more money to bring the troops home than to keep them in Europe."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/12/nicholas-burns/do-european-allies-pay-us-25-billion-yearly-keep-t/	President Donald Trump criticized fellow NATO members during a summit on July 11, saying they had spent too little on defense and in support of the alliance. But NATO backers lined up to push back against Trump’s criticisms. The United States maintains approximately 35,000 military personnel in Germany, 12,000 in Italy, 8,000 in the United Kingdom, plus smaller numbers in other European countries. The combined personnel levels in Europe fell after the end of the Cold War, but growing tensions with Russia in recent years have led to some refortification. Despite this, Trump has expressed skepticism about the scale of the U.S. troop presence in Europe, leading the Pentagon to study possible options for relocating or reducing the U.S. footprint on the continent, the Washington Post has reported. One commentator who appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe was Nicholas Burns, a Harvard University professor who served for almost three decades as a foreign-service officer, including a stint as undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2005 to 2008. Burns said Trump was "misrepresenting the facts" about NATO and spending by U.S. allies. The United States’ European allies, Burns said, "pay us $2.5 billion a year to keep our forces there. It would cost us more money to bring the troops home than to keep them in Europe." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com When we looked into Burns’ statistic, we found it was more complicated than it would seem. The $2.5 billion figure Burns told PolitiFact that he had obtained the figure from National Security Action, a newly created advocacy group founded predominantly by Democratic foreign policy specialists. The group tweeted an infographic that offered that number. A spokesman for the group, Ned Price, told PolitiFact that the number came from a New York Times article that said, "Allies cover 34 percent of the United States’ basing costs, worth $2.5 billion annually." This echoed a number we had found in the most comprehensive recent analysis of this topic -- a study the RAND Corp. released in 2013. The study found that the NATO allies’ combined support for U.S. military activities on their soil was more than $2.48 billion in 2002 dollars, or essentially $2.5 billion. The data is 16 years old and was initially calculated as part of a series of reports that the Pentagon published, but stopped producing in 2004. Garret Martin, a lecturer in the School of International Service at American University, said that "it is unlikely that the figure (from 2002) still applies to 2018. U.S. troop levels in Europe in 2002 were closer to 100,000, as opposed to 65,000 today." The $2.5 billion figure "is the best we can say today," said Patrick Mills, a RAND senior operations researcher who helped produce the report. "Publicly available burden-sharing data for NATO allies was very difficult to come by in the writing of that 2013 report, and it still is." The number also requires additional context. FIrst, 97 percent of the $2.5 billion in NATO support came from what are called indirect costs -- things like rent and foregone taxes and customs duties. Such streams of support are important in evening out the books, but they are not reimbursements for outlays that the United States has made. Rather, they enable the United States to sidestep things they would have otherwise had to pay for, and they are harder to characterize numerically. "Indirect contributions are less precise than hard dollars," Martin said. And second, NATO member support covers only about one-third of the U.S. military costs. The U.S. still pays two-thirds of the burden. Indeed, in 2002, NATO’s rate of support was lower than that of other nations that host U.S. troops. According to the RAND report, NATO’s 34 percent share was well below the share picked up by Japan (75 percent), Kuwait (58 percent), Qatar (61 percent), and Saudi Arabia (65 percent), and was modestly below the level in South Korea (40 percent). Price, of National Security Action, said the cautionary factors we offered were reasonable. "There will always be caveats when it comes to these sorts of issues." he said. That said, he added, "there’s nothing to suggest the burden-sharing balance has changed." Would it cost more to bring the troops home? Experts said this assertion is plausible but hard to either prove or disprove. On the one hand, the RAND report concluded that overseas bases cost more than domestic bases do, partly because costs of living for military personnel are higher in other countries. However, moving to all-domestic bases isn’t a guaranteed cost-saver, because there would be additional costs to travel to the battlefield if troops are stationed further away. Whether a move back home would save or cost money could also depend on how many existing facilities in the United States can be repurposed rather than built from scratch. Harder to put a price tag on -- but vitally important -- are strategic issues surrounding a move. "If you think forces overseas have deterrent value, bringing the forces home could make wars more frequent," Mills said. The many possible parameters for making the comparison Burns suggested further complicate the matter, said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "Is it just the Army, or is it the Air Force and Navy too?" Janda said. "Would we lose refueling and basing rights? Would that force us to pay for those services options in other countries? The ‘what ifs’ in all of this are insane." Our ruling Burns said European allies "pay us $2.5 billion a year to keep our forces there. It would cost us more money to bring the troops home than to keep them in Europe." The $2.5 billion figure is the most recent estimate -- but the data is 16 years old. It mostly encompasses hard-to-calculate "indirect costs," and it only covers about one-third of U.S. military expenditures in Europe. Meanwhile, experts said it’s conceivable that it would be more expensive to close up shop in Europe and bring troops back to the United States, but there are many variables surrounding that decision and it’s difficult to factor in the intangible strategic losses from giving up a European footprint. Ultimately, Burns’ assumption is speculative. We rate the statement Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Nicholas Burns	None	None	None	2018-07-12T09:38:41	2018-07-11	['Europe']
pomt-08616	"Florida spends more than $300 million a year just on children repeating pre-K through 3rd grade."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/21/alex-sink/alex-sink-florida-spends-300-million-students-held/	With Miami-Dade College and the New World School of the Arts as her backdrop, Alex Sink, Democratic candidate for governor, unveiled her education platform to supporters on Sept. 1, 2010. Her plans call for creating a statewide data system for tracing students at risk of dropping out and grading schools based on student progress throughout the school year, not solely on the current standard of Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test scores. "If we don't have a firm education system, I'm not going to be able to take Florida where we need to go," Sink said in an interview with the Times/Herald prior to the campaign event. Sink also proposes creating a uniform pre-K curriculum and ensuring that every pre-K classroom is equipped with a teacher who has earned a bachelor's degree. Improving early education would help eliminate costs associated with students being held back, Sink contends. "Florida spends more than $300 million a year just on children repeating pre-K through 3rd grade,’’ Sink says on her campaign website. We decided to look further into Sink’s claim. Is Florida in fact spending $300 million to educate children who had to repeat at least one of those grades? Sink campaign spokeswoman Kyra Jennings said the $300 million figure was arrived at by multiplying the number that Florida spends per public school student ($7,000) by the approximate number of students from pre-K through third grade who were held back a grade. The $7,000 in spending is actually $6,871 according to figures provided by the Department of Education. The campaign referred us to a February 2009 Florida Department of Education report that indicates nearly 43,000 public school students between kindergarten and third grade were held back during the 2007-08 school year. (The exact figure, according to the report was 42,885 students.) Using the multiplication essentials we learned in third grade, we were able to verify that Sink’s numbers did round up to the figure she cited on her website. (42,855 X $6,871 = $294,456,705) However, a more recent March 2010 report, provided by the Department of Education, shows a slight decrease in the number of students not promoted a grade level during the 2008-09 school year. Last year, 39,469 students in kindergarten through third grade were held back. Using the more current figure, the state spent close to $271 million on remediation of those students last school year. (39,469 x $6,871 = $271,191,499). Why are there so many elementary school students being held back each year? An analysis from the DOE points to "state laws requiring mandatory retention of third grade students who are not reading at grade level by the end of the school year." Still, it’s important to note that the number of students held back a year has started to drop since the 2005-2006 school year and the figures are in the third page of DOE’s report. If that trend continues, the state will continue to spend less on remedial education. So back to the claim. Does Florida spend $300 million on remedial education for students held back between pre-K through third grade. The report Sink’s campaign cited was not the most recent, therefore their numbers are off by a couple of million. But, with the state spending close to $271 million in education for those children held back, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-09-21T18:52:02	2010-09-01	['None']
pomt-14566	Says President John F. Kennedy released a star Green Bay Packer from military reserve duty so that he could play in the 1961 NFL Championship Game.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/09/j-jacobs/did-jfk-answer-vince-lombardis-call-spring-green-b/	Green Bay Packers fans didn’t need to be reminded that their team wasn’t playing in Super Bowl 50. But the National Football League’s smallest city and its biggest game are inextricably linked. After all, the Vince Lombardi-coached Packers won the first two Super Bowls and the game’s trophy bears Lombardi’s name. So, it wasn't surprising that on Feb. 6, 2016, the day before the big game, the Packers were mentioned during a discussion of Super Bowl trivia on National Public Radio’s "Weekend Edition." But what author A.J. Jacobs claimed about the team and President John F. Kennedy sounded surprising, at least to listeners more knowledgeable about politics than Green Bay football. Jacobs was asked by host Scott Simon -- who noted that Super Bowl 50 would be followed in two days by the New Hampshire presidential primary -- if he knew any trivia combining football and politics. Jacobs responded with a story about the NFL Championship Game, which was the game played for all the marbles before the debut in 1967 of what became known as the Super Bowl. Kennedy, according to Jacobs, "helped the Green Bay Packers win the 1961 NFL championship and beat the New York Giants, which is my team, so I hold a little grudge. "What happened was, this was 1961, the Berlin Wall crisis was underway. And one of the Green Bay Packers' star players had been called away on military duty. He was a reservist." Lombardi, who was friends with Kennedy, according to Jacobs, "called JFK and asked if JFK would release one of the players for the weekend. And JFK did. And the Packers won." So, did Kennedy release a star Packer from military reserve duty so that he could play in the 1961 NFL title game? Jacobs responded to our inquiry with the alacrity of a defensive player scrambling to pounce on a fumble. To back his claim, the four-time New York Times-bestselling author cited a book by Wisconsin native David Maraniss, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. In Maraniss’ book, "When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi," Paul Hornung tells the story about how he was able to play in the championship game, despite being put on active duty as a result of the Berlin Crisis, two months earlier. Lombardi had seen Kennedy earlier in the month at a football banquet in New York. Kennedy gave him his private number at the White House and said to call if he ever needed anything. When Lombardi learned that the Christmas leave policy at Fort Riley would keep Hornung in Kansas for the title game, he decided he would use the number. Kennedy then called Fort Riley and authorized that the holiday time off for Private Hornung be changed. It’s worth noting that Hornung, a Pro Football Hall of Fame halfback, has told the story any number of times. The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune and Time magazine are among various media that have relayed how Lombardi pulled strings with Kennedy. So does the Packers team website, noting that Kennedy was said to have said: "Paul Hornung isn't going to win the war on Sunday, but the football fans of this country deserve the two best teams on the field that day.’" But there’s more than Hornung’s word. Marannis wrote that "one document confirms the essence of the transaction." That was a letter Lombardi later wrote to a top aide of Kennedy's. Lombardi thanked the president for an autographed picture of Kennedy and Lombardi at the football dinner. And he thanked Kennedy for his "help in obtaining leave for Paul Hornung so he could participate in the Championship game." Lombardi was understandably grateful that Hornung made it to Lambeau Field for the game. Hornung tallied -- by scoring a touchdown and kicking extra points and field goals -- a record 19 points. The Packers whipped the Giants, 37-0. Our rating Jacobs said Kennedy released a star Green Bay Packer from military reserve duty so that he could play in the 1961 NFL Championship Game. Hornung has repeatedly told the story of how Lombardi made the request of Kennedy, and Kennedy arranged for Hornung to leave his Army post in Kansas in order to play in the game, which the Packers won. Maraniss has cited a letter from Lombardi to a top aide of Kennedy's, thanking the president for making Hornung available to play. We rate Jacobs’ statement True.	None	A.J.

pomt-15004	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly $225,000 from polluters."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/09/league-conservation-voters/environmental-group-claims-ron-johnson-voted-again/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is once again in the crosshairs of a national conservation group for his voting record. The League of Conservation Voters has run a series of television ads against Johnson, a first-term senator who is facing a 2016 rematch with Democrat Russ Feingold. The ads have aired in anticipation of possible action by Republicans in Congress to undo Obama Administration regulations limiting carbon emissions. The $1.6 million campaign includes an ad called "Disappear," and another dubbed "Lakes." Both make variations of the same claim: That "Ron Johnson led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution." The second ad includes this addendum: "... and took nearly $225,000 from polluters." Turns out the environmental groups are doing a bit of recycling. Support for the legislation We checked a similar claim in 2013 when the League of Conservation Voters aired an ad that said Johnson had taken "more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air." We rated the claim True. Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions. And, at the time that ad aired, he had received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his first campaign in 2010, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. The same votes are cited in the most recent ads. But the wording varies a bit. It says Johnson "led the fight," which is problematic. The group’s backup for the ad cites two measures that Johnson voted in favor of -- one in 2011 and one in 2013 -- that would have blocked the EPA from strengthening the carbon emission standards. However, he was not a sponsor or co-sponsor of either amendment, so it’s hard to consider him a leader. The group also noted Johnson "has co-sponsored legislation, written to President Obama, and spoken to the media regarding his opposition to the Clean Power Plan." The bill the group cites, the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, was introduced May 13, 2015. Johnson is among 35 co-sponsors. That’s nearly two-thirds of the 54 senators who are Republican. The letter cited was written to Obama June 4, 2014. It called on him to withdraw the EPA carbon rules. Johnson was one of 41 Republican senators who signed. Finally, the group cites a quote from Johnson in a June 18, 2014 article posted by the liberal blog Talking Points Memo. In it, Johnson said he'd be "totally supportive" of using government funding legislation to block the EPA rules. "I'm a manufacturer. You actually need power if you're going to manufacture things," he said. "Let's not drive, artificially, the cost of power up -- that's a self-inflicted wound. That's what this administration is doing and I have no idea why they'd want to do that." He was one of a half dozen GOP senators quoted in the story. So, while Johnson took the steps, the group provides little evidence he was out in front or somehow spearheading them. Campaign contributions Finally, the ad offers a new figure for campaign cash (nearly $225,000) and instead of "oil and gas," describes the contributors as "polluters." According to same campaign contribution database we previously reviewed, Johnson received $133,600 from the oil and gas industry, $63,428 from the mining, and $22,700 from electric power utilities. That tallies out to $219,728. Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger called the ads a "false partisan attack" and said they distorted Johnson’s position "that we can protect our economy and environment at the same time with a balanced national energy policy." Our rating The League of Conservation voters launched TV ads that claim Johnson "led the fight to let polluters release unlimited amounts of carbon pollution and took nearly $225,000 from polluters." Much of the ad’s content is recycled. The claim, however, is puffed up a bit this time because it says Johnson "led" the effort. We did not find much evidence of that. That knocks the claim down to Mostly True.	None	League of Conservation Voters	None	None	None	2015-10-09T09:00:00	2015-09-01	['United_States']
pomt-04487	"If Gov. Romney's plan goes into effect … the average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/05/joe-biden/biden-says-romneys-plan-will-raise-taxes-social-se/	Vice President Joe Biden used his podium in the retirement mecca of Boca Raton, Fla., to push the message that Mitt Romney plans to raise taxes on millions of seniors. At a rally on Sept. 28, 2012, Biden told the crowd, "If Gov. Romney's plan goes into effect, it can mean that everyone -- every one of you -- would be paying more on taxes on your Social Security. The average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security." The statement draws on an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that evaluates tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. The Obama campaign has used the study to make a number of claims about Romney’s plan, at times leaping to a worst-case-scenario conclusion. Here, we’ll check whether Biden’s statement accurately reflects how Romney’s proposal could impact Social Security benefits. Romney’s tax proposal Romney has not released a complete tax plan, but he has outlined some specifics on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax. He also has suggested these general guidelines: • The rate cuts would be paid for without adding to the deficit. • People at the high end "will still pay the same share of the tax burden they’re paying now." • Everyone would see tax rate reductions. Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent. To offset those cuts, Romney has indicated that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes, though he hasn’t said which ones would go away. Digging into the plan Knowing all that, the Tax Policy Center study attempted to discern the effect of Romney’s tax rate cuts combined with the elimination of several deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance. To keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs for top earners first. They determined that in order to reach the $360 billion needed to offset the rate cut, deductions would also have to be axed for people with incomes below $200,000. The effects of that were significant, the authors found. Many popular tax breaks are of greatest benefit to middle- and lower-income families, so eliminating them meant outright tax increases for everyone with incomes below $200,000. This is where Biden’s Social Security claim comes in. Couples making less than $32,000 pay no taxes on their Social Security income. Those making between $32,000 and $44,000 pay taxes on 50 percent of Social Security, while those above $44,000 are taxed on 85 percent of their benefits. The Obama campaign pointed out that in 2010, just over 29 million income tax returns were filed with untaxed Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits from individuals making $200,000 or less, for a total of about $29 billion in total benefits. So the average tax benefit was $987. Under Romney’s plan, the value of the tax benefit would be reduced to $789, the campaign reasoned. The Tax Policy Center study determined that 58 percent of middle-class taxpayers’ deductions would have to be eliminated to make Romney’s plan work. So by the Obama campaign’s math, when deductions are cut by that much, the average tax benefit on Social Security income would be further reduced to $331, the equivalent of a $458 tax increase. The problem with that math The bottom line of the Tax Policy Center study is that Romney can't keep all his goals based on what is known of his plan. Unless some factors are tweaked, many middle-class taxpayers would end up paying more. Romney has said repeatedly he won’t let that happen. In addition, there are factors the study, admittedly, does not take into account. It doesn’t factor in Romney’s proposed spending cuts, or the expected economic growth that would result from the rate cuts and lead to greater revenues. In a Frequently Asked Questions fact sheet, the study’s authors acknowledge that Romney’s plan cannot be fully scored because it lacks detail. Their study, they said, examines the "broad implications." They also state directly that the study does not say Romney wants to raise taxes on the middle class. "We said that simultaneously achieving all (of his tax goals) would result in lower taxes for high-income households and thus – because of the revenue-neutrality constraint – would require raising taxes on other households," the authors wrote. Donald Marron, the Tax Policy Center director, wrote on the center’s blog, "I don’t interpret this as evidence that Gov. Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class." Although Romney has not shown how he would pay for his rate cuts, he has said he will protect deductions for the middle class. His campaign has floated some vague ideas, such as capping the value of some deductions for high earners, which could be one way to keep the tax burden from increasing for those further down the income scale. Our ruling Biden said that under Romney’s tax plan "the average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security." That figure is just one way to fill in the blanks in Romney’s largely unexplained tax proposal. It’s an average of a hypothetical, and it’s at odds with what Romney has said he’ll do, which is to protect deductions for the middle class and not raise taxes. Biden’s comment leaps to several conclusions to arrive at the dollar figure he cites. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-10-05T18:08:13	2012-09-28	['None']
pomt-09138	"The Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/14/steny-hoyer/hoyer-says-gop-didnt-have-budget-2002-2004-2006/	On the June 13, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, got into a back-and-forth over how diligent lawmakers have been in passing a budget in recent years. Hoyer said that "the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06," while Boehner claimed "the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era." With dueling claims like these, we had no choice but to step in and play referee. In this item, we'll look at what Hoyer said; in a separate item, we'll look at Boehner's comment. First, a little background. The budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Both the Senate and the House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it. The budget process is distinct from the series of appropriations, or spending, bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes. Unlike the appropriations bills, the budget resolution doesn't carry the force of law. In fact, unlike a law, the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers. If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can still use parliamentary procedures to proceed to appropriations bills, but the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate. That's why the expected failure of the Democratic House majority to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011 has become a talking point for Republicans. According to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the House has indeed passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act first took effect for fiscal year 1976. So if the House does not pass a budget for fiscal year 2011, it will be the first time since the current rules went into force. So on this point, we rated Boehner's comment True. However, we should also note that the House has not always been joined by the Senate in passing a budget -- a factor that explains the difference between what Boehner and Hoyer said. Since 1983 -- the first year the House and Senate stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and began passing one per year -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, then under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind, and on three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007) the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress. Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, Hoyer is right that a unified Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in 2004 and 2006. Hoyer failed to mention the GOP's failure in 1998. Moreover, the Republicans can't be solely faulted for the failure in 2002 to pass a fiscal 2003 budget, because the Democrats controlled the Senate and were unable to pass a budget resolution. So Hoyer's comment is not entirely accurate, and is less precise than Boehner's comment because he didn't specify if he was talking about the House, the Senate or Republicans as a whole. As our related fact-check of Boehner's comment shows, the House Republicans did indeed pass an initial budget resolution every time they ran the process as the majority party, even though on three occasions the GOP was not able to pass a final budget through both chambers. For Hoyer, we rate his comment Half True.	None	Steny Hoyer	None	None	None	2010-06-14T15:32:23	2010-06-13	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01069	"Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said marriage is a fundamental right" and never said "it had to be between a man and a woman."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/18/ted-olson/ted-olson-supreme-court-never-said-marriage-was-be/	With the U.S. Supreme Court poised to decide whether same-sex marriage must be legal in all 50 states, Fox News Sunday pitted Family Research Council president Tony Perkins against former solicitor general Ted Olson for a Jan. 18 roundtable debate. There isn’t precedent for the Supreme Court justices to limit marriages to heterosexual couples only, said Olson, a Republican attorney who supports same-sex marriage and has argued 61 cases in front of the Supreme Court. "The United States Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said that ‘marriage is a fundamental right,’" Olson said. Perkins, a fervent opponent of same-sex marriage, interrupted: "Marriage, but not same-sex marriage." Olson continued, "Never once in any of those cases did it say that it had to be between a man and a woman. Fifteen times it said it was a matter of privacy, liberty, association, dignity and respect for the individual." We wondered about these 15 cases and if they really don’t define marriage as solely between a man and a woman. Olson pointed us to a brief he and his colleagues filed as the respondents in the 2013 case Hollingsworth vs. Perry, which the Supreme Court declined to hear, effectively sustaining a lower court decision to allow same-sex marriages in California. The brief says the Supreme Court has said marriage is a "fundamental right" in "more than a dozen" cases. "In fact, this Court has characterized the right to marry as one of the most fundamental rights — if not the most fundamental right — of an individual," the brief said of Loving vs. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court approved interracial marriage. The cases he cited cover a range of topics, including privacy and parental and reproductive rights, but all touch on marriage as a "fundamental right" in some way. Here are the cases cited in the brief in chronological order: Maynard vs. Hill (1888) Meyer vs. Nebraska (1923) Skinner vs. Oklahoma ex. rel. Williamson (1942) Griswold vs. Connecticut (1965) Loving vs. Virginia (1967) Boddie vs. Connecticut (1971) Roe vs. Wade (1973) Cleveland Board of Education vs. LaFleur (1974) Carey vs. Population Services International (1977) Moore vs. City of East Cleveland (1977) Zablocki vs. Redhail (1978) Turner vs. Safley (1987) Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania vs. Casey (1992) M.L.B. vs. S.L.J. (1996) Lawrence vs. Texas (2003) (They’re also listed with more detail in this blog post by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a marriage equality advocacy group.) Outside legal experts reviewed the cases for us and said they support Olson’s claim that the Supreme Court has generally not addressed whether marriage is confined to heterosexual couples. The experts also said there are likely more than just 15 examples. "The question was never asked," said Clifford Rosky, a law professor at the University of Utah. "(Olson’s) correct to say that they’ve never specifically said marriage is just a man and a woman." That is, until the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision to strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, ensuring same-sex couples get the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. In this case, Rosky said, the court had to address the definition of marriage and said homosexual couples can be considered married. Until recent decades, some experts told us, the court likely assumed that when they said "marriage," others would interpret that as meaning a heterosexual union, not a homosexual one, due to societal norms. "Not a single one of these cases (in Olson’s list) would have been assuming anything but opposite-sex marriage," said Michael Klarman, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University. "Before the 1990s, virtually nobody took the idea of same-sex marriage seriously." In the 1960s, states began revising their laws to have more gender-neutral language, which raised questions about whether marriages should be extended to same-sex marriages if statutes do not specify otherwise, said Martha Umphrey, a professor of American government at Amherst College. Rogers Smith, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania, said other Supreme Court decisions show the tendency of justices to assume marriage means a heterosexual relationship. For example, they have sometimes linked the right to marry with the right to bear children. And in the 1961 case Poe vs. Ullman, Justice John Harlan argued that "although the right to privacy protected rights of marital couples, it did not protect rights of homosexuals." Perkins’ Family Research Council, says the fact that the Supreme Court has tied the "right to marry" to procreation is proof that this right only applies to opposite sex couples. Smith added that the examples in Olson’s list up to the 1960s tend to link marriage to the survival of the species and family life. But over time, the justices started to discuss the right to marry more as a right of all individuals and essential to human dignity and happiness. He said this reflects changing norms and makes denying same-sex couples the right to marry seem much more unreasonable than it would have in years past. Umphrey compared the current debate to that of interracial marriage. Until the years leading up to the Supreme Court’s 1967 decision that interracial marriages should be legal, most people -- including the justices -- assumed marriage meant a union between two people of the same race. Still, the Supreme Court used its own prior comments on marriage as a "fundamental right" as precedent for its decision. Our ruling Olson said, the "Supreme Court 15 times over the last 120 years has said marriage is a fundamental right" and never said "it had to be between a man and a woman." Olson provided a list of 15 cases that addressed marriage as something like a "fundamental right" that did not specify marriage as a union between a man and woman. Several experts backed up his claim. Until recent years, though, the Supreme Court never had to address the question of whether or not marriage should be limited to a man and woman. Because of societal norms, they assumed that the decision would be interpreted as referring to a heterosexual relationship. Still, Olson’s claim is on point. We rate this statement True.

pomt-11909	"The Alamo has been consistently listed as one of the most disappointing landmarks in our nation."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/20/george-p-bush/alamo-consistently-listed-among-nations-most-disap/	A website intended to defend the master plan for spiffing up the Alamo says tourists remain far from wowed by the historically revered site. We paused at this specific claim in point No. 3 on the Alamo Truth site, which is funded by Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush’s political campaign: "The Alamo has been consistently listed as one of the most disappointing landmarks in our nation." The point closes: "It is our simple goal to improve the visitor experience for guests and all Texans, including our students." No doubt, the Alamo has ragged edges. It’s old, man. Has it consistently been named one of the country’s most disappointing landmarks? Bush, a Republican seeking re-election in 2018, has been overseeing redevelopment of the Alamo along with the private Alamo Endowment and San Antonio city officials including Mayor Ron Nirenberg, who has said, for instance, that he favors moving the cenotaph honoring defenders who died there from its place in front of the entrance to another spot on the site. Aide: Do a Google We inquired into how Bush reached his conclusion about the Alamo as a disappointment. Brittany Eck, a General Land Office spokeswoman, initially urged us to Google the words "Alamo," "disappointing" and "landmark." Eck said: "We have routinely heard feedback from people who came to the Alamo, folks saying: ‘Is this all there is?’" When we ran that web search in mid-October 2017, we landed several web posts describing the shrine from the Texas Revolution in unflattering ways, though positive statements also surfaced. We noticed that three Texas stories including a May 29, 2017, post by Austin Culture Map headlined "Legendary Texas landmark dissed as worst tourist trap," keyed off a story published May 19, 2017, on the Business Insider website specifying each state’s worst tourist trap. "Remember the Alamo?" the Texas part of the tourist-trap story says. "More like, spend a day at the Alamo and you'll remember to never go back. The building's remains are so small they consistently disappoint visitors. "History buffs might get a kick out of it for an hour or so," the snippet closes, "but looking at a picture will suffice for most." In contrast, a San Antonio Express-News rebuff of that story pointed out that as of May 2017, the Alamo, by one measure, was the most-Instagrammed Texas tourist site, far outpacing the Johnson Space Center. The Culture Map story further noted a May 8, 2017, commentary by Alyssa Morris of the Texas Architect, published by the Houston Chronicle. During an Alamo visit, Morris wrote, she noticed that few of the site’s original features remained aside from its iconic chapel and long barracks. "But these buildings seem curiously out of place and ignored by the high-rises and parking lots of the modern metropolis that grew up around them," Morris wrote. "I texted my co-worker: ‘I don't get the Alamo. There's so little educational information here. It refuses to teach me about itself.’" In May 2015, our search showed, the Thrillist website listed the Alamo among nine "disappointingly small" tourist sites including Mount Rushmore, Plymouth Rock and the Mona Lisa. Its story said: "The legendary last stand at the Alamo has achieved mythical status in American/Texas history, causing most people to picture the complex as a sprawling fortress. In reality, not so much -- at least not any more. The original part of this Catholic mission that everybody visits is pretty much an underwhelming 75ft by 62ft building." Also from our web search: Comments and ratings of the Alamo as a tourist site posted on the TripAdvisor.com website including, at the top of the comments when we peeked: "It's a landmark. It's history. It's also in the middle of town and not that informative. We thought there would be more to see. Glad there are other activities in the area." Generally, still, the site says that 14,300-plus visitor reviews have led to the Alamo averaging better than a four-star rating (out of five possible stars). Our search at Eck’s nudge otherwise turned up mixed comments about the Alamo on a 2007 Democratic Underground thread of comments including: "I went to see it during a day pass while I was in basic training. It was one of the great disappointments of my life." Six years later, also from our search, responses on neogaf.com about disappointing sites included this post about the Alamo: "Look at it for 5 seconds, then cross the street to eat overpriced tacos." So, the Alamo has proved disappointing to some visitors and to writers for a couple of online publications. Documented disappointment Following up, Eck shared an undated document she described as compiling feedback about the Alamo fielded by elected officials and others; negative articles and reviews from online publications; deeper analysis of the TripAdvisor.com ratings of the Alamo plus screenshots of negative ratings including expressions of disappointment; and negative reviews of the Alamo posted on Yelp and Facebook. For our part, we also queried Douglass McDonald, CEO of the Alamo Endowment. By email, McDonald said the Alamo is on his personal list of "the most disappointing historic sites in the United States. The commercialization of this area has compromised the most important historic site in Texas," McDonald wrote. By phone, McDonald called the Alamo the most compromised significant historic site in the nation. He asked: "Can you imagine having Ripley’s" Believe It or Not "150 feet from the front door at Mount Vernon? Or an ice cream vendor 50 feet in front of Monticello?" McDonald also emailed us an undated document he described as created in response to our queries. The document presents more than 30 individual comments posted online about the Alamo from September 2016 into September 2017, all on the negative side. Per the document, one person wrote: "Very crowded and underwhelming. Go to say you have, but don't expect it to be earth shattering." Another: "Glad it's free. Really not much to see. 20 minutes and you are done." And: "We did the audio tour and it just wasn't interesting. Of course, you can't go to San Antonio without seeing The Alamo. It was disappointing." McDonald summed up: "As a museum professional, all of this is disturbing, it should be disturbing to every Texan." Our ruling The campaign-funded website says: "The Alamo has been consistently listed as one of the most disappointing landmarks in our nation." We’re persuaded that plenty of visitors have commented on the Alamo’s surprising small size and how quickly a visit can pass, fueling disappointment. Of late, though, it looks like only the Business Insider and the Thrillist listed the Alamo among the nation’s most disappointing landmarks. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06926	Florida Democrats "put my Social Security number and my wife's Employment Identification Number in a mail piece."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/21/allen-west/west-says-democrats-distributed-his-social-securit/	Fox News nabbed an interview with Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West a day after he fired off the angry and now infamous e-mail calling his South Florida colleague U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz "the most vile, unprofessional and despicable" member of the House. West, a retired Army colonel and favorite of the tea party movement, sent the e-mail July 19, 2011, after Wasserman Schultz criticized him in a floor speech for supporting the GOP's "cut, cap, and balance" plan to sharply reduce spending and require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That plan, Wasserman Schultz said, "would increase costs for Medicare beneficiaries, unbelievable from a member from South Florida." Political blogs and talk shows got a lot of mileage out of West's subsequent outburst, in which he asserted Wasserman Schultz was "not a Lady." But on July 20, West told a Fox reporter that Wasserman Schultz and other Democrats have been attacking him "for quite some time." "She's not a victim," he said. Here's the entire sound bite: "This is something once again the Democrat Party (sic), when they put my Social Security number and my wife's Employment Identification Number in a mail piece, this has just been an ongoing thing. I've been called Uncle Tom, a sellout Oreo. It's not about Allen West. So once again, it's very interesting to me that we continually allow liberals to do whatever they want in attacking conservatives but all of a sudden, when a conservative stands up and says, 'Enough,' then people want to sit back especially liberals, want to play victim. She's not a victim. She's been attacking Allen West for quite some time." West has been known to make some provocative statements, including saying he had a security clearance higher than the president, so we wondered if claims about Democrats distributing his personal information in mailers was true. The blow-up started when the government hit West with a $11,081 tax lien in 2005. He paid it off a few months later, but the Florida Democratic Party feasted at the chance to highlight his financial problems in his 2010 race against incumbent U.S. Rep. Ron Klein. The party crafted a mailer to Fort Lauderdale-area voters depicting a photo of an IRS document showing the tax lien. The Democrats redacted West's address and his wife's name but left visible his Social Security number and her Employer Identification Number (an Internal Revenue Service code used to identify West's wife's employer). "I'm not yet sure the potential damage that might come to my wife and me, and it makes me sick to think of what could happen to my daughters," West said in a statement. "My entire family is at risk of identity theft." According to POLITICO, the Democratic Party chastised West for his "paranoia" but said the party would pay for two years of identity theft monitoring as a result of the "oversight." "After making every effort to remove all of Allen West's private information, unlike West who refuses to apologize to Florida's taxpayers for not paying his taxes and his bills, we apologize for the oversight of not redacting this information from the public record included in the mailer," spokesman Eric Jotkoff said in a statement. West would proceed to defeat Klein in the general election, but not before using the Democrats' blunder to raise some money. "Recently, incumbent Ron Klein's political cronies sent out a mailer revealing my Social Security Number. ... It makes you wonder what else Klein will do to me, or to you," West says in his video. "Join our cause today, and we can return character, honor and integrity to Congress." We won't weigh in on that last part. But the mailer episode was well-documented by reporters, and the party admitted and apologized. We rate West's claim True.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2011-07-21T11:14:14	2011-07-20	['None']
pomt-14425	When New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer wanted to "provide driver’s licenses to those who are undocumented. (Hillary Clinton) said don’t do it."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/09/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-hillary-clinton-opposed-driver/	Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders attacked each other’s records on immigration during the Democratic debate in Miami. Clinton bashed Sanders for opposing a 2007 immigration bill. He fired back that she opposed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. "Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do right thing and provide driver's licenses to those who are undocumented," Sanders said during the debate at Miami Dade College on March 9. "She said ‘don’t do it’, and New York state still does not do it." Did Clinton -- who has sought the Latino vote in Florida and elsewhere -- prevail upon Spitzer to not allow driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants in New York? Clinton on driver’s licenses in 2008 race In September 2007, Spitzer proposed giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. Supporters said it would allow those who simply wanted to get to work to get "out of the shadows," and get insurance while opponents saw it as a privilege for those who broke the law by illegally coming to the United States. "I know exactly what Gov. Spitzer's trying to do, and it makes a lot of sense, because he's trying to get people out of the shadows," Clinton told the editorial board of the Nashua Telegraph in October 2007, according to an article in the New York Daily News at the time. "He's trying to say, 'Okay, come forward, and we will give you this license.' " During an Oct. 30, 2007, debate, co-moderator Tim Russert asked her about her comments and Spitzer’s plan. She gave a muddled answer in which she made a case for it and against it. "You know, Tim, this is where everybody plays gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. What is the governor supposed to do? He is dealing with a serious problem. We have failed, and George Bush has failed. Do I think this is the best thing for any governor to do? No. But do I understand the sense of real desperation, trying to get a handle on this? Remember, in New York we want to know who's in New York. We want people to come out of the shadows. He's making an honest effort to do it. We should have passed immigration reform." About two weeks later, Spitzer dropped his plan, saying it faced opposition. During the March 2016 debate, Sanders’ campaign sent a November 2007 New York Times story about a statement Clinton made saying she supported his decision to drop the plan. "As president, I will not support drivers' licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration including border security and fixing our broken system." Spitzer, who resigned in 2009 amid a prostitution scandal, talked about Clinton’s past statements on driver’s licenses in an interview he gave to David Axelrod in 2015. "When Mr. Axelrod asked if the Clinton campaign had asked Mr. Spitzer to scrap the plan, he replied, ‘Yeah, we heard from folks who said they want this issue gone,’ " the New York Times reported. Clinton on driver’s licenses in 2016 race But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton changed her position. In April 2015, a Clinton spokeswoman told the Huffington Post: "Hillary supports state policies to provide driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants." Clinton herself addressed it during a town hall in February. "Back then, it was a state-by-state determination, and I'm happy that most states have understood and moved in the right direction," she said. PolitiFact contacted spokespersons for Clinton’s campaign during the debate and asked if she had any evidence to refute Sanders’ claim and did not get a reply. In a conference call with reporters the day before the debate, Clinton surrogates didn’t answer questions about why she changed her position. "Today our goal has moved well beyond driver's’ licenses," U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois said. "We are talking about citizenship. As president she will fight for that." Our ruling Sanders said that "Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do right thing and provide driver's licenses to those who are undocumented. She said don’t do it, and New York state still does not do it." Clinton waffled on driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants in a debate in October 2007. When Spitzer dropped his proposal, she came out with a statement supporting his decision to ax the plan to give the driver’s licenses. Sanders omitted that this occurred during her first presidential race and that during this campaign she has supported driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants.

pomt-12442	Says James Clapper "and virtually everyone else" said "there is no collusion" in the Russia investigation findings.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/12/donald-trump/trumps-mostly-false-claim-clapper-said-no-collusio/	President Donald Trump claimed that former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has definitively said the Trump campaign did not collude in Moscow’s interference with the 2016 election. Trump used his take on Clapper’s remarks as proof positive the FBI’s ongoing Russia probe is a witch hunt. "When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?" Trump said in a May 12 tweet. Clapper’s comments have not been as definitive as Trump said. Later that day, Clapper directly contradicted Trump’s claim in a TV interview. Here’s why Trump’s take is misleading. Trump mischaracterizes Clapper’s statement Trump appears to be referring to Clapper’s statement in a Meet The Press interview March 5 that he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Two months earlier, Clapper’s office released a report that expressed with "high confidence" that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump. As Clapper stated in his interview, however, the report did not include evidence of collusion. Chuck Todd of NBC asked him about that. Todd: "Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?" Clapper: "We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, ‘our,’ that's NSA, FBI and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report." Todd: "I understand that. But does it exist?" Clapper: "Not to my knowledge." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., quoted Clapper’s exchange on Meet The Press in a May 8 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and asked if it was still accurate. Clapper responded, "It is." That prompted Trump to issue the following tweet: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In his May 12 tweet, Trump referenced the judgment of "virtually everyone else" with knowledge. But some officials with knowledge of the FBI’s Russia probe have publicly declined to say there’s no evidence of collusion, citing ongoing investigations. During a March 20 hearing on Russian interference in 2016 election, recently ousted FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers refused to comment when asked specifically about whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Moscow. But when asked in general terms about whether or not any evidence exists, Comey explained that a case of this nature would have to reach a certain evidentiary threshold, and be considered high priority, before the bureau launched an investigation. Comey described the standard as, "a credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power." He added the central focus of the investigation would also have to align with "threats that the FBI is trying to prioritize (under) limited resources." Clapper: 'I don’t know if there was collusion or not' Asked about Trump’s tweet in a May 12 interview on MSNBC, Clapper explained that the director of national intelligence position would not necessarily offer a vantage point into FBI evidence. Clapper said that in his more than six years as DNI, he regularly deferred to the FBI when a counterintelligence investigation could possibly morph into a criminal investigation. "That was certainly the practice I followed here," he said of the FBI’s ongoing Russia investigation. "So it’s not surprising or abnormal that I would not have known about the investigation, or even more importantly, the content of that investigation. "So I don’t know if there was collusion or not," added Clapper, who resigned at the end of President Barack Obama’s term. Later in the interview, Clapper was asked if he agrees with Trump that the Russian investigation is a "witch hunt," to which he replied, "I don’t believe it is." Instead, Clapper compared it to a "dark cloud" that would continue to linger until the investigation is complete. "What needs to happen here is to clear this cloud that’s hanging over the administration, over the president, the White House," he said. "It would be in everyone’s best interest to get to the bottom of this." Our ruling Trump said, "When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?" Some of the public statements by those with knowledge of the FBI investigation do not support Trump’s claim that "virtually everyone" privy to the probe says there’s no evidence of collusion. While Comey has not described specific evidence, he has confirmed that sufficient credible information exists for the FBI to consider the Russia probe a high enough priority to warrant an investigation. As for Clapper’s statement, it’s apparent Trump has twisted the former DNI’s words to make it appear as if he’s ruled out the possibility that evidence exists showing the Trump campaign colluded with Russian interlopers during the 2016 election. But Clapper’s statement was that he had no knowledge of collusion -- not that collusion didn’t occur. Clapper has since stated that his capacity as DNI would not necessarily give him the kind of access to the FBI investigation that one would need in order to determine whether or not evidence of collusion exists.

pomt-13669	Says "Danny Tarkanian … wants to defund Planned Parenthood and would outlaw a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest."	true	/nevada/statements/2016/aug/04/jacky-rosen/democrat-correctly-points-out-tarkanians-long-held/	After a hard-fought primary battle in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, Republican candidate Danny Tarkanian is now taking flak from Democrats over his stance on abortion. At a recent roundtable with female congressional members, Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen attacked Tarkanian saying he "wants to defund Planned Parenthood and would outlaw a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest." As Tarkanian and Rosen vie for one of the most competitive House seats in the nation, we wanted to dig deeper into this line of attack. Tark’s record Despite never holding office, Tarkanian has nonetheless amassed a lengthy record of public positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood funding that largely align with Rosen’s claims. He is squarely pro-life, saying in a 2012 debate that he believes "life starts at conception, and if life starts at conception you have to do what you can to preserve life." Tarkanian has consistently said he’d support removing federal funding from Planned Parenthood and that he opposed abortion with the sole exception if the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. Most recently, he answered a pre-2016 primary voter guide saying he would support defunding Planned Parenthood and support legislation "to protect the right to life of every person from conception to natural death," with an exception if it’s necessary to save the life of the mother. In addition to the questionnaire, Tarkanian told a reporter in March 2016 that he would "absolutely" support defunding the reproductive health care provider. "Why do we have to give $800 million to an entity that is providing such a divisive service as abortions and then coming out and seeing how they’re selling body parts and all those other things?" he said. (PolitiFact rated a similar claim that Planned Parenthood sold aborted fetus body parts for profit as False, and the group has been cleared of any wrongdoing in many states, including Nevada.) Tarkanian has been been less direct on abortions for rape and incest victims. The closest he’s come to addressing the issue was during a June 2016 radio interview, where he reiterated his opposition to abortion with the only exception being if continuing the pregnancy would threaten the life of the mother. "That’s the only time I think there should be the ability to terminate the life of an unborn," he said. During his 2012 campaign for a different congressional seat, Tarkanian was the target of an ad that strongly implied he supported tea party Republicans who wanted to "criminalize a woman’s right to choose even in cases of rape or incest." Tarkanian’s campaign manager, James Fisfis, said the campaign didn’t disagree with the claims but emphasized the Republican isn’t pushing for any specific abortion-related legislation and would continue supporting full funding for women’s health programs through groups other than Planned Parenthood. Tarkanian hasn’t avoided using abortion as an issue in earlier campaigns — he ran radio ads attacking a Republican primary opponent in 2009 for allegedly flip-flopping on the issue. Our ruling Rosen said Tarkanian "wants to defund Planned Parenthood and would outlaw a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape or incest." Tarkanian is ardently pro-life and has consistently said on multiple occasions he’d support defunding Planned Parenthood and only supports allowing abortion access if continuing the pregnancy would threaten the mother’s life. This statement is accurate, so we rate it as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/477776ed-3467-4248-ae9e-c53684a3a4db	None	Jacky Rosen	None	None	None	2016-08-04T11:33:22	2016-07-20	['None']
pomt-08840	Despite the U.S. spending $10 billion on Iraq's electrical system, Baghdad still only gets five hours of electricity a day.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/10/george-packer/george-packer-says-despite-us-investments-baghdad-/	During the round-table discussion on ABC's This Week on Aug. 8, 2010, the New Yorker's George Packer was asked to comment on Vice President Joe Biden's boast, "I'm very optimistic about Iraq. I think it's going to be one of the great achievements of this administration." "It's a bit much," Packer said, especially considering how few Democrats supported the troop surge that has been credited for turning the situation around in Iraq. And he warned not to paint too rosy a picture of Iraq as the president prepares to remove combat forces by the end of the month. "It has stabilized," Packer said. "But let's not exaggerate what kind of Iraq we're going to be leaving as we leave in the next year and a half. I mean, we spent $10 billion on that country's electrical system. How many hours a day are there of electricity in Baghdad now? Five hours a day. It's better than it was three years ago; it's still a pretty intolerable level of daily life and violence for ordinary Iraqis." Electricity has been one of the key indicators of the success of reconstruction in Iraq, so we decided to check Packer's claim that, despite the U.S. spending $10 billion on Iraq's electrical system, the capital city of Baghdad still only gets five hours of electricity a day. Packer told us he got his figures from an Aug. 1. 2010, story in the New York Times. The story, written by Steven Lee Myers under the headline "A Benchmark of Progress, Electrical Grid Fails Iraqis" states that, "Iraq now has elections, a functioning, if imperfect, army and an oil industry on the cusp of a potential boom. Yet Baghdad, the capital, had five hours of electricity a day in July." According to the story, electricity shortages -- caused in part by war, corruption and a dysfunctional government -- have led to disillusionment and discontent among many Iraqis and sparked violent protests this summer. In an e-mail, Myers said the source for the five-hours-per-day figure for Baghdad was an interview with the deputy minister of electricity in Baghdad, as well as quarterly reports put out by the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction. Myers explained that the hours-per-day figure is a difficult number to pin down because it changes daily and by region, even by neighborhood. Some areas get as few as 1 or two hours of electricity a day in the summer, some get more. According to the Brookings Institution's latest Iraq Index, the average hours of electricity a day in Baghdad was 19.5 hours in March (15.5 hours in February), the most recent months for which data was provided. Part of the discrepancy is due to the time of year. Demand for electricity spikes in Iraq's hot summer months, but Brookings' figures show Baghdad's average available daily power supply consistently exceeding 10 hours since Aug., 2008. But Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., warned not to put too much stock in any of the hours-per-day numbers. "The hours per day figure is something the embassy stopped trying to track three years ago," Bowen said. "It is so difficult to assess and so unreliable." At best, he said, the figure of five hours a day in Baghdad is anecdotal, ever-changing, and different from neighborhood to neighborhood. In the alternative, Bowen's office decided to stick to tracking the daily power output on the grid. Nationwide, the average daily electrical output hit an historic peak in June at 6,700 megawatts. The quarterly average, down 2 percent from this time last year, is still more than 50 percent higher than pre-war electricity levels. That good news, however, is tempered by the grid's inability to keep up with soaring demand for electricity, which has nearly doubled. New prosperity in Iraq has increased access to goods that demand power. In addition, the country has failed to effectively manage demand through appropriate fees, Bowen said. Iraq charges very little for electricity, he said, and those fees are not effectively enforced, so Iraqis practically get their electricity for free. As a result, even with additional electricity purchased from neighboring nations, Iraq's electric supply meets just 62 percent of the demand. Packer's point about the tenuous future of electricity supply in Iraq is valid. As the U.S. begins its withdrawal of troops from Iraq, a number of serious challenges face the Iraqi government with regard to supplying electricity. The country needs to develop an automated distribution system, in part to stem some of the political manipulation of electricity distribution, Bowen said. It also needs to better maintain and oversee available electricity and better control unplanned outages plaguing the system. And the Iraqi government must jump-start and fund the behind-schedule "MegaDeal" purchases of dozens of turbines from General Electric and Siemens, which Bowen said would go a long way toward solving the country's electricity problems. Nonetheless, Bowen said, the U.S.'s investment in Iraq's electrical system has made a difference, as evidenced by the historic peak in electricity production in June. It's also important to note that, according to the July 2010 quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, and confirmed by Bowen, the U.S.'s investment in Iraq's electrical system has to date been $5 billion, not the $10 billion cited by Packer on Meet the Press. So in his remarks Packer doubled the amount of money spent on the power grid. Also, although the Brookings numbers only go through March, they put the average daily power supply in Baghdad at more than twice as high as Packer's number. While the five hours a day figure may have been an accurate anecdotal snapshot during the month of July, experts say any figure is highly speculative. As a result, we rate Packer's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03922	If the sequester hits, federal prosecutors will have to "let criminals go."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequester-could-force-prosecutor/	To pressure Congress to prevent the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration by the March 1, 2013, deadline, President Barack Obama gave a speech on Feb. 19 warning of dire consequences if it takes effect. "Emergency responders like the ones who are here today -- their ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded," Obama said. "Border Patrol agents will see their hours reduced. FBI agents will be furloughed. Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go." As we’ve noted, dire warnings about budget cuts are a popular tactic in the nation's capital. They’re sometimes known as the "Washington Monument strategy" because federal agencies threaten to close popular things, such as the monument, as a way of building public opposition. Still, the idea of letting criminals go is particularly scary, so we wondered whether it’s accurate for Obama to say that under a sequester, "federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go." First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.) The uniform cuts must be applied to any "program, project or activity" that isn’t otherwise exempted. The most obvious way the sequester could produce cutbacks in prosecutions is through the Department of Justice’s budgetary line, "Salaries and Expenses, United States Attorneys." According to the Office of Management and Budget, the amount in that category that is subject to the sequester is $1.9 billion. Assuming a 5.3 percent cut, that works out to about a $101 million reduction. The sequester would affect "every district, reducing the number of cases they can prosecute," the Justice Department said in a statement to PolitiFact. "The Justice Department anticipates U.S. Attorneys’ Offices will handle 1,600 fewer civil cases and 1,000 fewer criminal cases. Fewer affirmative civil and criminal cases will affect our ability to ensure that justice is served and impact funds owed to the government." Outside experts agree the cuts will be real. "It’s certainly a fair statement that budgetary constraints affect who gets prosecuted and what gets prosecuted," said Mary Graw Leary, a Catholic University of America law professor. "It’s fair to think there will be an effect on what cases will be pursued if there is a drastic contraction in budgets." That said, there are reasons to be cautious in jumping to conclusions: • Officials will have some discretion about how to make the cuts. Within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They can move money around within a program. In fact, Obama’s deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, wrote a memo on Jan. 14, 2013, offering "guiding principles" for federal managers to use as they make cuts such as minimizing impacts on the agency’s core mission, life, safety and health. To limit the most severe impacts, Zients urged managers to consider hiring freezes, releasing temporary employees, not renewing contract hires, and authorizing early buyouts. So officials at the Justice Department will have flexibility about how to meet that $101 million target. They could focus their resources on, say, criminal cases rather than civil cases, or violent crimes as opposed to property crimes. They could focus dollars on locations where crime is growing and trim in places where it is declining. They could allocate less money to complicated, expensive, long-term cases as a way of getting more bang for the buck. • Obama is exaggerating. Saying the sequester would mean letting criminals go is a stretch. For starters, Obama’s comment conjures images of prison gates being thrown open and inmates flooding out. That’s not the case. When the New York Times asked the Justice Department about the sequester’s impact on prisons, a spokeswoman said that the Bureau of Prisons "does not intend to let anyone go on March 1 because of the cuts." The spokeswoman said that instead, personnel could be furloughed and that vocational education programs and others might be curtailed to meet sequester requirements. Meanwhile, there are plenty of ways to cut back prosecutions without letting criminals go. A U.S. attorney’s office could save money by slowing its uptake of new cases and focusing instead on clearing its backlog of existing cases. Or it could scale back investigations that haven’t even produced any "criminals" yet. Finally, we shouldn’t gloss over the reality that, by framing it as he did, Obama ignored the bedrock of America’s criminal justice system -- that people are innocent until proven guilty. The cuts Obama is talking about would affect the investigatory and trial stage, when an individual’s criminality hasn’t yet been proven. At most, the sequester would force prosecutors to let "suspects" or "targets" go. • Budgetary factors have always shaped prosecutorial priorities. "It is not unusual for budgetary concerns to influence federal prosecutors' case selection," said Josh Bowers, a law professor at the University of Virginia. "It strikes me that limited resources are typically a significant -- if not the principal -- determinant of how prosecutors exercise charging discretion." In other words, the scope of the cuts may be somewhat bigger under a sequester, but living within budgetary limits isn't anything new for a seasoned prosecutor. Our ruling Obama said that, if the sequester hits, "federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go." It’s clear that U.S. Attorney’s offices are looking at a potential cut of $101 million, and a reduction of that size would almost certainly cut back on prosecutions in some fashion. However, the impacts are not as clear-cut as Obama’s bold language suggests. Officials will have a fair amount of discretion in prioritizing what types of cases prosecutors will pursue, possibly cutting back on civil cases rather than criminal ones. And the cuts taking place in U.S. Attorney's offices wouldn't directly affect "criminals" at all, but rather suspects and targets of prosecution who haven't had their guilt determined yet. These represent significant exaggerations, so we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-02-22T17:18:29	2013-02-19	['None']
pomt-11493	In comparing mass shootings, "France had a higher casualty rate in one year than the entire two administrations of Barack Obama."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/27/dana-loesch/nras-loesch-cherry-picks-terrorism-deaths-france-a/	With even some Republicans talking about an assault rifle ban, the National Rifle Association has been quick to reject the idea that it might help. On ABC News’ This Week, host George Stephanopoulos suggested that nations with stricter limits see fewer mass shootings. NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch challenged that before Stephanopoulos even fully asked his question. Here’s their Feb. 25 exchange: Stephanopoulos: "We are the only country that has wide access to these kind of weapons and no one else has the frequency or the intensity of these kind of mass shootings…" Loesch: "That’s actually not true." Stephanopoulos: "...mass shooting that we do." Loesch: "That’s actually not true." Stephanopoulos: "That is." Loesch: "France had a higher casualty rate in one year than the entire two administrations of Barack Obama. And they’re a fifth of our population." Really? France saw more casualties in a single year than America saw in eight? The NRA press office told us Loesch drew from an analysis by the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group that does research in support of policies favored by gun rights advocates. While Loesch didn’t specify the year, that article compared deaths and injuries in "mass public shootings" in France in 2015 with casualties from similar events in the United States between 2009 and 2016. In 2015, France had 150 deaths and 382 injured, for a total of 532. On the American side, between 2009 and 2016, there were 264 deaths, 263 injured for a total of 527. As many will remember, 2015 was a horrific year of terrorist attacks in France. In January, two men who claim allegiance to Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula opened fire in the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The death toll rose even higherwith a series of attacks on Nov. 13 by a well-organized Islamic State cell in and around the Bataclan Theater in Paris. A total of 132 people died. But 2015 was an aberration for France. The Global Terrorism Database at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism shows that between 2009 and 2014, attacks with guns killed eight people. In 2016, there was one victim. Our French fact-checking colleagues at Liberation found a steady rate of more conventional firearm deaths over the years. (The policy focus is on firearms but it’s important to add that a truck attack killed 86 people celebrating Bastille Day in Nice in 2016.) In contrast, mass shooting attacks in the United States occur regularly, punctuated by particularly horrific events. Loesch’s statistic cherry-picks one bad year and sets it against a more systemic pattern in America. Terrorism vs. American mass shootings Criminologists and terrorism experts agree that there are significant differences between mass shootings like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and the Bataclan attacks. The primary distinction is the motivations of the shooters. The motives of teenager Nikolas Cruz in Florida might never be fully understood, but the ISIS cell in Paris had a clear political agenda. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism includes an attack in its dataset if the act is "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal," and if there’s "an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience." Consortium director William Braniff said it’s likely "that some of the preventative steps we might take to mitigate the likelihood of one kind of violence will be different than for others." Terrorism researcher Jeff Gruenewald at Indiana University told us that terrorist acts generally take shape differently, giving law enforcement different ways to prevent them. "Terrorists may plan longer, farther away from their targets, or they may be more likely to communicate with other like-minded individuals and groups through channels that can be intercepted," Gruenewald said. "Terrorist shooters may also choose different forms of symbolic targets than other types of shooters, which has consequences for anti-terrorism measures." Gruenewald also noted that many state and federal laws explicitly target terrorism, pointing to a broad consensus that such attacks are different from other violent activity. Jaclyn Schildkraut at the State University of New York in Oswego echoed that point. Schildkraut has compiled mass shooting statistics across 11 developed nations in North America and Europe. She said in the United States, the response to terrorism and the response to mass shootings puts the difference in sharp contrast. "After 9-11, we saw massive changes in laws and programs," Schildkraut said. "We’ve seen few changes in response to mass shootings." Schildkraut, however, argued that access to weapons is not a critical matter. Criminals, she said, will find ways to get high-powered firearms. The issue too often in the United States, she said, has been a breakdown in existing control systems that ought to have blocked firearm purchases by shooters. France vs. United States non-terrorism mass shootings By cross-checking across three datasets, we can separate terrorism and non-terrorism shootings in France and the United States. We worked with the table in the article from the Crime Prevention Research Center, mass shootings in America tracked by Mother Jones magazine, and the Global Terrorism Database. If the Global Terrorism Database included the event, we flagged it in the other two datasets. Segregating those casualties eliminated all but seven casualties in France – four dead and three injured at a Roma encampment in Roye, France. On the American side, that process also flagged the San Bernardino, the Pulse nightclub and the Fort Hood shootings, to mention just few prominent examples. The net effect reduced American deaths to 165 and injuries to 160. We compared domestic mass shootings between the Crime Prevention Research Center table and the Mother Jones database. That comparison showed that the Center included some events that were not in the Mother Jones list, and vice versa. Counting only those events where there were at least four victims killed, the net change was not large – an additional 17 deaths and 17 injuries based on the Mother Jones figures. Counting only non-terrorism events, the numbers appear quite different from the picture Loesch painted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com On a non-terrorism basis, both deaths and injuries are about 40 times higher in the United States than in France. Our ruling Loesch said that in one year, mass public shootings caused more deaths and injuries in France than in the United States throughout the entire Obama administration. Loesch failed to mention that the year she had in mind was 2015, the bloodiest France has seen at the hands of terrorists. So the stat relies on extreme cherry-picking (by Loesch, not the underlying report behind her talking point). Criminologists and terrorism experts gave several reasons why the differences between mass shootings and terrorism matter, and those differences are enshrined in American law and policy. Separating out the terrorism casualties in both countries, the numbers show that mass shootings during the Obama years caused about 40 times more deaths and injuries than in France in 2015. We rate this claim Mostly False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Dana Loesch	None	None	None	2018-02-27T17:35:28	2018-02-25	['France']
pomt-06549	When he took office in 2009, President Barack Obama "had the biggest Democratic majorities in Congress since Lyndon Johnson."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/04/haley-barbour/haley-barbour-says-barack-obama-benefited-biggest-/	During the Oct. 2, 2011, edition of CBS’s Face the Nation, two governors -- Democrat Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Republican Haley Barbour of Mississippi -- faced off over a variety of political and policy issues. At one point, Barbour parried O’Malley’s criticism of Republican economic policies by noting the size of President Barack Obama’s congressional majorities after he took office in early 2009. His argument was that Obama had significant legislative advantages that should have enabled him to do what he wanted policy-wise -- meaning that Obama can’t legitimately blame the Republicans for blocking what he wanted to do. O’Malley, Barbour said, has "amnesia about the fact that Obama had the biggest Democratic majorities in Congress since Lyndon Johnson. They passed everything he wanted, including ramming health care, Obamacare, down the country's throat and now they complain, well, jeez, we didn't get everything we wanted, those mean Republicans. Bill Clinton never did that. Ronald Reagan never did that. When they had Congress in the other party, they led. And this president, he is going to learn how to lead, or he's going to go back to Chicago." We thought we’d check whether Barbour was right that Obama had larger Democratic majorities than at any point since the Johnson presidency, which took place from November 1963 to January 1969. The short answer: He’s wrong. On opening day in 2009, the Democrats had a 257-178 edge over the Republicans in the House, and a 57-41 edge in the Senate, with two Independents caucusing with the Democrats. (Eventually, the Democrats got to 58 votes in the Senate, plus the two Independents, when Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter switched parties.) Congressional margins typically change over the course of two years as lawmakers retire, die or win seats in special elections. So for simplicity, we’ll stick to the opening day numbers. Here are the Congresses in which the Democrats had more House members than they had in 2009. The year listed is the year of the start of that Congress. 1993: 258 Democrats 1991: 267 Democrats 1989: 260 Democrats 1987: 258 Democrats 1983: 269 Democrats 1979: 277 Democrats 1977: 292 Democrats 1975: 291 Democrats Now, here are the Congresses in which the number of Senate Democrats equaled or exceeded the 57 from 2009: 1993: 57 Democrats 1979: 58 Democrats 1977: 61 Democrats 1975: 61 Democrats 1969: 57 Democrats So, both the House and Senate simultaneously equaled or exceeded 2009 levels for significant stretches of four Congresses -- the ones beginning in 1975, 1977, 1979 and 1993. That’s about one-fifth of the Congresses since the Johnson presidency. And for three of those Congresses, there was also a Democratic president in office -- first Jimmy Carter, then Bill Clinton. Of course, internal splits within the Democratic caucuses made the party weaker than the numbers alone would suggest. But that was also true in 2009, the year to which Barbour was referring. Our ruling It’s true that Democratic strength in Congress at the beginning of Obama’s term was the strongest it had been in 16 years. But that’s not what Barbour said -- he said the numbers were the strongest going back to President Johnson in the late 1960s. And that was not the case. We rate his statement False.

pomt-04661	Wayne Powell has a "stated position of having no objection to taking `In God We Trust" off of U.S. currency."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/sep/10/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-wayne-powell-doesnt-object-taking/	On a list of risky political stands, this one would rank near the top. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, is charging that Wayne Powell, his Democratic opponent, has endorsed removing "In God We Trust" from U.S. currency. The controversy began in late August when Powell, a Chesterfield County lawyer, intensified his effort to draw conservative votes away from Cantor. Powell released his first TV commercial, which features him standing at front door telling a homeowner about his position on issues. The owner extends a handshake and says, "Wayne, you’re my kind of Republican." When Powell says he’s a Democrat, the owner slams the door. To make sure the message reached conservative viewers, Powell aired it all three nights of the Republican National Convention on Fox News. Cantor replied with an email blast on Aug. 29. "If Wayne Powell was a Republican, he would be very, very lonely," the email said. It listed five issues where Powell "would not find much company in the GOP." The last one particularly caught our eye. "And (Powell’s) stated position of having no objection to taking `In God We Trust’ off U.S. currency would probably alienate most everyone in our party," the email said. We asked Cantor’s camp to back its claim about Powell’s stance on the national motto. Ray Allen Jr., a Cantor strategist, directed us to an online question-and-answer session Powell held earlier this year on Reddit, a social media web site. Deep into the lengthy transcript, someone with the user-name "niloakash" asked: "Would you support an hypothetical endeavor to remove `Under God’ and insert the original `E Pluribus Unum’ in American currency? In short: are you atheist friendly?" Powell replied: "America has a place for all people, regardless of faith, religion or lack thereof. I wouldn’t object to replacing `In God We Trust’ with the first American motto E Pluribus Unum (Latin; `Out of many, one’)." We asked Powell about the statement. He told us he is responsible for the comment even though he never made it and opposes the removal of "In God We Trust" from currency. Powell said Eileen Burke, a young website designer who worked briefly for his campaign, convinced him early this year to do an interview on Reddit. Powell said he dictated answers to the online questions to Burke, who typed them into a computer. After about two hours, Powell said he left while Burke remained logged on. The next day, Powell said Burke told him, "There was so much in this question-and-answer session that it went on after you got offline." Powell said he didn’t give another thought to Burke’s comment until last week, when we sent him a copy of the statement about the national motto. "She wrote it," Powell said. "I did not answer it. I was not aware of it." Powell said his aide "took too much prerogative on the web site" and he should have monitored her more closely. "I’m responsible" for the posting, he said. Powell, who describes himself as a "lifelong Southern Baptist," said he would oppose removing "In God We Trust" from currency or any other government activity. "Why would we change the currency?" he asked. "Everytime I say the Pledge of Allegiance, I don’t have any compunction about saying `God.’" Powell said Burke left his campaign early last year, lives in New England and he does not know how to reach her. Burke’s name appears once on finance reports Powell has filed with the Federal Election -- she received a $1,000 payment from the campaign on Jan. 14, 2012. The document lists a post office box address for her in Portland, Me. Our efforts to contact her were unsuccessful. We should note there is no movement afoot in Congress to remove the national motto from currency. Our ruling Cantor said Powell "has a stated position of having no objection to taking `In God We Trust’ off of U.S. currency." As proof, Cantor offers Powell’s comments in a question-and-answer session held on a social media website. Powell acknowledges answering queries on the website for about two hours early this year this year with the help of a campaign worker. He says the question about the national motto came up after he left and the aide, exceeding her authority, wrote a response that he renounces and was unaware of until we contacted him last week. Powell takes responsibility for not keeping a closer eye on things. There’s no doubt that when Cantor made his accusation, Powell’s stated position was, "I wouldn’t object to replacing `In God We Trust’ with the first American motto, `E Pluribus Unum.’" So we rate Cantor’s statement True.

pomt-04016	40 percent of U.S. gun sales "are occurring outside of" licensed gun dealers.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/04/tom-barrett/40-us-gun-sales-made-sellers-who-arent-required-do/	The implicit call to arms made by Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. led to a nationally televised quarrel over guns between Clarke and one of his political rivals, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. The two appeared Jan. 29, 2013 on Piers Morgan's prime-time talk show on CNN. Clarke spoke about the Milwaukee radio ad he aired five days earlier, in which he urged citizens to consider taking a firearms safety course in order to protect themselves from crime. Barrett, who defeated Clarke and eight other candidates in the 2004 mayoral election, criticized the ad and what he characterized as the sheriff's position on gun control. "Right now, he is defending laws that have a loophole that allow those individuals -- those individuals who have criminal record, mental health records, that are involuntary or domestic violence orders -- to go buy guns on private sales," Barrett said of Clarke. "I need our sheriff to support the initiative that says that individuals who sell guns ensure that those guns are not being sold to criminals, they're not being sold to people of domestic violence orders and they're not being sold to people of involuntary mental judgment commitments. "And I need that because 40 percent of the sales are occurring outside of gun dealers." Barrett was making the point that many gun sales -- such as those done at gun shows or over the Internet -- don't involve a criminal background check of the buyer because only licensed firearm dealers are required to do the checks. But if so many gun sales are done without creating a government paper trail, is it even possible to know what percentage of guns aren't sold by licensed gun dealers? Let’s see if Barrett is on target. Barrett's evidence Barrett is a founding member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which supports background checks for all gun sales. The group, though, hasn't always been as bold in making the claim Barrett did. In one statement, the group said "experts estimate" that "perhaps" 40 percent of all sales are made by unlicensed private dealers who aren't required to do background checks. In another statement, the group puts the figure at more than 40 percent, but characterizes it as an estimate. Like Barrett, scholars and news reports often state the figure without citing a source. When we asked for Barrett’s evidence, the mayor’s chief of staff, Patrick Curley, cited a December 2011 statement by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The statement attributes the 40 percent figure to the U.S. Department of Justice, but does not cite a particular source or study. Curley also pointed out that in July 2012, when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check, PolitiFact National rated it Mostly True. But new information has since emerged. Newer claims, different ratings Less than a week before Barrett made his claim, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., made the same claim Bloomberg had. PolitiFact National rated Gillibrand’s claim Half True and at the same time changed the rating on Bloomberg’s claim to Half True. Our colleagues said that after the Connecticut school shooting in December 2012, new criticism of the 40 percent figure emerged. Here are the highlights of what they found in assessing Gillibrand’s claim: The 40 percent figure grew out of a 1997 National Institute of Justice study that found that 35.7 percent of respondents in a 1994 telephone survey reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. People citing the study have rounded up the figure to 40 percent. One of the authors of the study said he had "no idea" whether the 35.7 percent -- which he called a "very old number" -- was a reliable estimate for today. Two scholars said there is no way to know what the percentage is and one said the study was flawed. Two other experts said 40 percent is probably accurate. Also in January 2013, The Washington Post Fact Checker reassessed a claim by President Barack Obama, who said "as many as" 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check. Initially, the Fact Checker did not issue a rating on the statement. But after further review, Obama was given "two Pinocchios" out of a possible four -- the Fact Checker’s rating for a statement that contains "significant omissions and/or exaggerations." Our rating Barrett said 40 percent of U.S. gun sales "are occurring outside of" licensed gun dealers. Like others, Barrett made the claim without saying that the study he relies is from 1997. And expert opinion on the figure he cites is mixed, at best. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2013-02-04T09:00:00	2013-01-29	['United_States']
pomt-03149	"The Kenosha casino would be one of the state’s largest employers and pay more to the state than any other company or Tribe – essentially, it would be Wisconsin’s biggest taxpayer."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/11/menominee-indian-tribe-wisconsin/menominee-tribe-says-kenosha-casino-would-be-one-w/	Since 1998, Wisconsin’s Indian tribes have won more than $15 billion from gamblers at 25 sites scattered throughout the state. About a nickel on the dollar from that revenue haul was sent back to the state through agreements that vary depending on the tribe. In essence, that money represents what is known as a payment in lieu of taxes, since the tribes -- as sovereign nations -- are exempt from taxation. The state’s piece of the pie was in the news in late August 2013 when plans for an $800 million casino in Kenosha, to be operated by the Menominee tribe, won approval from federal officials. That put the project in the hands of Gov. Scott Walker, who has sole veto power over it. Opponents, most notably the Forest County Potawatomi tribe, which runs an off-reservation casino in Milwaukee, quickly argued that its facility will lose market share and suffer job losses if the Menominee plan advances. But Menominee officials say a new casino complex fits "hand-in-hand" with Walker’s goal of creating 250,000 new jobs in his four-year term. It is especially important, the tribe’s casinokenosha.com site says, when "recent statistics show Wisconsin lags behind the rest of the country in private-sector job creation" and "Illinois comes ever-closer to putting a new casino on its side of the state line." On the website, the tribe makes this claim: "The Kenosha casino would be one of the state’s largest employers and pay more to the state than any other company or Tribe – essentially, it would be Wisconsin’s biggest taxpayer." Let’s take this claim out for a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. A note before we deal the first hand: For this item, we are not checking the projections on the jobs or payments, which depend on a host of future events. But we can examine whether the predicted size would, in effect, make the casino a leading employer and payer to state government. Employment In Kenosha, the Menominee tribe says that if the multi-phase project is completed, it will mean an estimated 3,300 full-time jobs in the casino itself and related retail and hotel facilities. It won’t be fully up and running for several years under the best-case scenario. By way of comparison, the Potawatomi Bingo Casino operation in Milwaukee -- where revenues are smaller than those projected at the Menominee facility -- has 2,631 full-time jobs and expects to add 230 more at a hotel it is building at the site. That casino is the largest in the state in revenue produced. To make its case that it would be "one of the state’s largest employers," the tribe points to a 2013 ranking of Milwaukee-area private sector employers based on a survey by The Business Journal. Based on that, the Kenosha facility would rank as the 21st largest employer in Milwaukee, Kenosha, Racine, Walworth, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties. We found no statewide rankings, and privacy laws block state and federal officials from publishing precise employment figures by company. But only 100 of the state’s more than 150,000 private employers have more than 1,000 workers. And only 21 of the state’s more than 5,000 local governments employ more than 1,000. So the tribe’s claim that it would be "one of the state’s largest employers" is on target, though we note the tribe is comparing current jobs figures at private companies to casino projections down the road. State payment The compact between the state of Wisconsin and the Menominee tribe spells out how much of the tribe’s gambling revenue would be sent to the state. The state is guaranteed 7 percent of the facility’s "net win" -- the amount lost by gamblers -- in year one of operations. Over the next four years, the payment is 7 to 7.5 percent, depending on revenue. Beyond five years, it’s 7.5 percent. (By comparison, the Potawatomi have paid between 6 percent and 8 percent, and are currently at 6.5.) The Menominee would also make payments to local governments, but the statement was "pay more to the state," so that is what we are looking at. We found three different projections for the would-be casino’s "net win." The federal report that approved the Kenosha casino quoted a market study prepared for the tribe. That study predicted a $440 million net win in year three at the Kenosha casino. An earlier study for the tribe put the figure at $482 million. Both estimates were in 2004 dollars, however. Factoring in inflation, the revenue figure grows to more than $540 million in today’s dollars. By our calculations, the Menominee tribe could be paying the state more than $40 million a year within a few years of opening -- if its projections hold up. Even using the lowest of the three figures, and not accounting for inflation, the payment could top $32 million. The Potawatomi revenue haul is smaller right now than those Menominee projections -- $363 million in fiscal 2013 plus its state payment of between $20 million and $30 million, according to Journal Sentinel estimates. It’s impossible to know what the Potawatomi payment would be if the Kenosha casino opens. But the Potawatomi tribe says a Kenosha casino could cut into its market and reduce its revenue by roughly one-third at the Milwaukee casino. Experts quibble with that estimate but don’t doubt the Milwaukee casino will take a hit of some size. It’s reasonable to conclude the Menominee payment would be larger than that paid by the Potawatomi. That would make its payment the largest from any tribe, based on estimates. But would its payment be larger when taxes from all private companies are factored in? We’ll look only at the income tax, because the tribal payments -- while not called a tax -- are in effect a charge against income. Again, there’s a timing problem here. We have the projected Menominee payment starting several years for now if the casino gets all needed approvals. We don’t know what private companies’ tax bills will be at that point, since such bills can vary widely year by year. Drawing a conclusion, though, is made easier by looking at what we do know about corporate tax payments. In Wisconsin, net income tax payments are public, for a fee and subject to various limitations. Jack Norman, a consultant and former research director for the Institute for Wisconsin’s Future, purchased hundreds of reports of company tax payments from the state over more than a decade. In doing so, Norman obtained tax data on many of the largest companies in Wisconsin through tax year 2009. The largest tax payment Norman discovered was $26.59 million paid by Harley-Davidson in 2004. The figure was an aggregate of Wisconsin income taxes collected from three units under the Harley umbrella. The second-largest payment Norman found was by Wisconsin Power & Light (and parent company Alliant Energy): $15.37 million. The projected Menominee payment easily tops those numbers. We can’t be certain a company has not paid more since Norman’s research ended. But we purchased the record of Harley-Davidson’s payments for 2011 and 2010, the latest available. They were $1.27 million and $704,625, respectively. And a utility spokesman told us that Wisconsin Power and Light (and its parent, Alliant Energy) paid a total of $170,000 in 2012. Tax payments can vary widely year to year based on fluctuations in taxable income, tax strategies and the availability of tax breaks. Our rating The Menominee contend that "the Kenosha casino would be one of the state’s largest employers and pay more to the state than any other company or Tribe – essentially, it would be Wisconsin’s biggest taxpayer." It’s a difficult claim to assess, but we found compelling evidence it’s accurate when comparing the projections for a future Kenosha casino with the biggest taxpayers and employers in the state in recent years. If we get new information on corporate tax payments that is relevant to this item, we’ll revisit our ruling. For now, with the clarifications noted concerning the timing problem inherent in the tribe’s comparison, we rate this Mostly True.

pomt-06342	The United States sends "$300 billion -- half our trade deficit -- overseas for oil to unstable and unfriendly regimes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/08/jon-huntsman/jon-hunstman-says-us-sending-oil-dollars-unstable-/	Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. delivered a speech on energy policy at the University of New Hampshire that said the United States is "drowning in energy resources" and outlined a proposal to "unshackle ourselves from the scourge of foreign oil." To make his case, the former U.S. ambassador to China and Singapore said the U.S. needs to end "our heroin-like addiction to foreign oil" and asserted that money flies out of the country to less-than-solid allies. "Every year we send $300 billion – half our trade deficit – overseas for oil to unstable and unfriendly regimes," Huntsman said in the Nov. 1, 2011, speech. "Three hundred billion dollars to our competitors and nations with whom we have nothing more than a transactional relationship. I want that money going to American energy suppliers, spent in American stores, saved in American banks and invested in American communities to create American jobs," he said. With international trade and the loss of American jobs overseas a major concern, has Huntsman identified a real winner when it comes to spurring the U.S. economy? And do the numbers hold up? The Huntsman campaign cited U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data that show that the U.S. trade deficit in 2010 was just over $500 billion. And the gap is getting worse, deepening by $40 billion through August 2011. And, as Huntsman suggested, the U.S. imported $323 billion worth of energy-related petroleum products, including crude oil, in 2010, and had already spent $283 billion on the black gold overseas through August 2011. But drill into the numbers and it gets a bit murkier -- two of the top oil exporters to the United States aren’t Persian Gulf monarchies; they are America’s next-door neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Countries in the Western Hemisphere accounted for 49 percent of U.S. crude oil and petroleum product imports in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while 18 percent came from the Persian Gulf. Canada supplied 25 percent, Saudi Arabia 12 percent, Nigeria 11 percent, Venezuela (a Western Hemisphere unfriendly) 10 percent and Mexico 9 percent last year. Crude oil import figures through August 2011 show Canada still in that 25 percent range, with Mexico now second, accounting for about 12.7 percent of the imported supply. Saudi Arabia was third (11.9 percent), and the rest of the top 15 importers of crude oil were Nigeria, Venezuela, Iraq, Colombia, Angola, Ecuador, Russia, Brazil, Kuwait, Algeria, Congo and Oman. Canada is hardly unstable or unfriendly, and Mexican President Felipe Calderon, while grappling with terrible drug violence, was elected in 2006 and has been a solid ally. Several of the other top importers might also be surprised to be considered anything but stable, friendly trading partners. To give Huntsman credit, he did identify Canada later in his speech as a key and loyal supplier, as he came out in support of the Keystone pipeline, which would carry oil from Canadian oil sands into the U.S. "Every barrel from a friend is one less from a foe," Huntsman said. His speech also called not just for more offshore domestic drilling and fracking (a method used to recover both oil and natural gas); he also spoke favorably of coal-to-liquid fuel, a new generation of nuclear power technology, and policies that would create a more level playing field for other potential transportation fuels, such as natural gas. Huntsman also supported ending various energy subsidies, outside of basic research, to give emerging technologies a chance to compete in the energy market. Robert Kaufmann, chairman of Boston University’s Department of Geography and Environment, who follows world oil markets and global climate change, said it doesn’t particularly matter who supplies oil to the U.S., because it is a global market. "Of course we have transactional relationships," Kaufmann said. "Anyone who has ever run a business knows you don’t have to be best buddies with your customers -- that’s what capitalism is. It’s a series of transactional relationships." He also said the idea of making the U.S. self-sufficient in terms of oil -- though Huntsman didn’t go quite that far -- was impractical, both because of the high cost of investment for domestic production compared to the available global supply and the threat to the environment. "Yes, there’s a lot of natural gas, but that’s not going to displace oil," Kaufmann added. Our ruling Huntsman was a little more nuanced than some of his "drill, baby, drill" Republican colleagues, and correct in identifying, as others have before him, the high cost of American dependence on foreign oil. But much of the oil the U.S. imports is from friendly nations, including Canada and Mexico, rather than "unstable and unfriendly regimes." We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-14894	Says that in polls about 2016 candidate leadership skills, he comes out "two and three and four times higher than anybody else."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/08/donald-trump/trump-my-numbers-leadership-its-two-or-three-or-fo/	Polls show that Americans think Donald Trump has the best leadership skills out of the 2016 candidates, according to the real estate mogul himself. On CNN’s State of the Union Nov. 8, host Jake Tapper asked Trump why voters should pick him to be their president. "I’m the one who’s going to make this country great again," Trump responded, adding, "When you do polls, and in fact when CNN does polls, you look at my numbers on leadership, it’s two and three and four times higher than anybody else." With other candidates nipping at Trump’s heels in the polls -- notably retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson -- we wondered if it’s accurate that Trump is so far ahead on the question of which candidate would be the strongest leader. We went through all of the national Republican primary polls collected by Real Clear Politics, from May through November (about 50 polls). We found only a handful that surveyed people about candidates’ leadership qualities, and just one that asked respondents to compare candidates in terms of leadership. As far as polling goes, that’s a fairly small sample. But Trump does have a point. Here’s what we found: Washington Post/ABC poll, conducted Oct. 15-18 This poll asked Republican-leaning respondents who among six candidates is the strongest leader. Nearly half of respondents -- 47 percent -- selected Trump. Twelve percent said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (11 percent), Carson (9 percent), Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (8 percent), and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (6 percent). This poll comes the closest to matching Trump’s talking point: Nearly four times as many respondents said Trump is the strongest leader compared to Bush, the candidate with the next-highest results. However, this is the only poll we could find that asks people to choose the best leader among several candidates. Trump led the Washington Post/ABC poll overall with 32 percent support; Carson was second with 21 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, released Nov. 1 This poll asked, "Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?" When presented this question about Trump, 60 percent of respondents answered "yes" -- the highest percentage of yes answers. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed, each receiving 56 percent. Rubio and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., each received 48 percent. Carson got 47, and Cruz got the lowest with 45 percent. CBS News poll, released Oct. 11 CBS asked Republican voters about various qualities held by the three outsider candidates: Trump, Carson and Fiorina. Among respondents, 84 percent said Trump has strong qualities of leadership. Carson followed, at 72 percent, and 60 percent said Fiorina has strong leadership qualities. Quinnipiac poll, released Sept. 24 Like the other Quinnipiac poll, this one asked, "Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?" When presented this question about Trump, 58 percent of respondents answered "yes" -- the highest percentage of yes answers. Clinton followed, receiving 55 percent. Next was Vice President Joe Biden (54 percent), Bush (52 percent), Fiorina (52 percent), Carson (48 percent), and Sanders (45 percent). (Quinnipiac has released a few other polls that ask this question over the past few months, with similar results.) What about that CNN poll Trump specifically mentioned a CNN poll, but searching through Real Clear Politics’ collection and on the CNN website, we couldn’t find one that asked about leadership qualities. We also reached out to Trump’s campaign but didn’t hear back. Our ruling Trump said that in polls about 2016 candidate leadership skills, he comes out "two and three and four times higher than anybody else." Only a few polls so far have asked about candidates’ leadership qualities, but Trump has a point that he usually comes out on top. One poll in particular supported Trump’s claim: Compared to the candidate with the next-highest results, about four times as many people said Trump had the best leadership skills among a group of candidates. But that was just one poll. Most polls have asked respondents to say whether each individual candidate has strong leadership qualities -- not comparing the candidates against each other. In these polls, Trump beats out his opponents by a handful of percentage points, not two, three or four times higher. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-02158	"Health care premiums up 90 percent in New Hampshire."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/may/01/americans-prosperity/afp-says-health-care-premiums-90-percent-new-hamps/	A new ad by the free-market group Americans For Prosperity takes a swipe at Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for her support of President Barack Obama’s health care law. The ad, released in April, proclaims, "Health care premiums up 90 percent in New Hampshire." New Hampshire residents may have heard this claim before. Earlier this month, the New Hampshire GOP said in a press release that "health care premiums are ‘skyrocketing’ and have increased 90 percent in New Hampshire because of ObamaCare." The release went on to say that "ObamaCare is an unmitigated disaster that is raising the cost of health care for the middle class." Nearly identical claims were tweeted by GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn and by former Sen. Scott Brown, who is running against Shaheen. A 90 percent increase seemed like a lot, so we decided to check the numbers. The claim stems from a blog post at Forbes.com, which was based on a study by the investment firm Morgan Stanley. The Morgan Stanley study takes a look at "individual and small-group rate increases." Respectively, those categories of health insurance refer to plans purchased by individuals on their own, and by smaller companies. A third category of private insurance -- large-group plans -- were not included in the study, even though those typically represent the most commonly held form of insurance. So, the first thing to note is that while the study only looked at a subset of all health care premiums, the ad’s claim doesn’t make that distinction. Another issue: Individual plans, and to a lesser extent small-group plans, have long been expected to produce larger premium increases than large-group plans. This is because existing individual- and small-group policies were less likely to include all of the requirements enacted under Obama’s law, such as free preventive care. To make up for those shortfalls in benefits, these plans were expected to raise premiums. In fact, while the Morgan Stanley study pegged individual plan increases at 90 percent in New Hampshire, it said that small group plans increased by 15 percent. In other words, the ad cherry-picked the bigger increase statistic and ignored the other. Then there’s the methodology of the study itself. Morgan Stanley surveyed 148 insurance brokers nationally, with only one being from New Hampshire, as reported by Factcheck.org. That’s too small a sample to produce a reliable statistic, experts say. Using just one respondent is like "calling one person up on the phone and asking their opinion," Robert Santos, chief methodologist at the Urban Institute told FactCheck.org. The survey also reported a 100 percent increase in Delaware’s health care premiums, where only one broker was surveyed. In fact, the statistic caught the eye of officials at the New Hampshire Department of Insurance, who asked to see the Morgan Stanley survey. They were told "it was proprietary and confidential," according to department spokeswoman Danielle Barrick. "We don’t understand how Morgan Stanley is able to generalize what’s going on in the New Hampshire market based on talking to 158 brokers nationally," Barrick said. We reached out to Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire, who stood by the claim. "Forbes has not updated, corrected or retracted its original story," AFP-NH state director Greg Moore said. " Accordingly, one must assume that the news outlet is standing by its work." Unfortunately, hard data on any premium increases since people were allowed to sign up for the Affordable Care Act does not exist, the insurance department said. However, the Morgan Stanley study, if it were reliable, would suggest premium increases far beyond projections in an earlier study by the state insurance department. That study said the Affordable Care Act would increase premiums on the individual market by about 30 percent. And costs would actually fall, not rise, once federal subsidies are taken into consideration. Income-based subsidies are available to consumers who purchased health care through the marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act. After subsidies, the study projected, individual premiums would decrease by 9 percent. Premiums, however, were projected to go up by a "significant" amount for people without subsidies. By the end of February, 22,000 Granite Staters had purchased a plan through the marketplace. The department said that 83 percent of consumers with marketplace plans have been eligible for financial assistance. As for "small group" plans, their increases were expected to range between 1 percent and 3 percent. Finally, we asked the Department of Insurance whether they thought it was possible for an individual in New Hampshire to experience a 90 percent rise in their own premiums. Barrick said it’s hard to know for sure, since premiums vary based on age, tobacco use and the number of people covered under a certain policy. The department said it’s possible for a resident -- especially someone older, who smokes and earns too much to get a federal subsidy -- to move from an employer-sponsored policy with a low employee-contribution rate to a policy in the individual market and find themselves "paying much more." "However," Barrick added, "the fact that the person is paying more does not mean premiums went up in the aggregate" for all New Hampshire residents, as the ad says. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said that health care premiums are "up 90 percent in New Hampshire." The claim cited a Morgan Stanley report that based its New Hampshire numbers on data from just one insurance broker in the state. Experts say that’s far too small a sample to say anything definitive about what’s happening to premiums in the state. It’s possible for some individuals, given the wrong combination of income and health factors, could see premium increases of 90 percent. But that’s a far cry from saying that such increases are typical in the state. This statement is not accurate. We rate it False.

pomt-11721	"This new gas tax does not increase (road) capacity anywhere in the state. It will build no new lanes of freeways. If Californians didn’t like their traffic before, they’re going to like it even less when they’re stuck in the exact same traffic and paying more for their gas."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/dec/14/travis-allen/travis-allen-claims-californias-gas-tax-increase-w/	Top Republicans in California have strongly opposed the state’s gas tax increase, saying it’s a costly burden on drivers. Orange County Assemblyman Travis Allen is a GOP candidate for governor and a leading critic of the 12 cent per gallon tax hike. He claimed in a June 15, 2017 article on the Repeal the Gas Tax campaign website that the increase does nothing to solve California’s notorious traffic woes: "This new gas tax does not increase (road) capacity anywhere in the state. It will build no new lanes of freeways. If Californians didn’t like their traffic before, they’re going to like it even less when they’re stuck in the exact same traffic and paying more for their gas." The repeal campaign, led by Allen, is one of two efforts to eliminate the tax increase. Other Republicans have made similar claims. "Practically none of the new money raised by the gas tax will build new lanes," Assemblyman Chad Mayes said in November 2017. "There was no clear creation of more capacity," said John Cox, a San Diego businessman who is also running for governor and leads the other repeal effort, speaking at a forum in December. Both repeal campaigns are working to qualify their initiatives for the November 2018 ballot. Since Allen’s statement goes the furthest in claiming the tax increase builds no new lanes and won’t ease traffic, we decided to hit the gas on a fact check. Did he get his facts right? And did he accurately frame the goals of the tax increase? File photo / Capital Public Radio A tax to build new roads or repair them? The gas tax increase is a key part of The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. It was signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown in April, with the goal of raising $52 billion over the next decade largely for road repairs. It passed the Legislature and with a Democratic majority and the help of one Republican state senator. From the start, supporters pitched the measure as way to address California’s massive road repair and maintenance backlog -- not to necessarily build bigger freeways as Allen and other Republicans have implied. Democratic Sen. Jim Beall of San Jose introduced the legislation in December 2016 saying in a news release: "Without action soon, our crumbling roads will severely affect California’s economy,’’ while suggesting repairs could reduce commute times. Beall didn’t mention anything about expanding freeways. The package includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gasoline tax increase and a 20 cent per gallon diesel tax hike, both of which started on Nov. 1, 2017. It also includes a new "transportation improvement fee" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one’s vehicle. We wrote this summer about how the law will affect the state's already high gas tax rate and gas prices. In common speech, some politicians simply call this whole package "the gas tax." Allen’s specific claims Given the repair goals of the legislation, Allen’s framing of the measure is misleading. But we also examined his specific assertions that it won’t build new road lanes or ease traffic gridlock. We found these are also problematic. The bulk of the new tax money, 65 percent, goes to repair projects. But 35 percent can be spent on "expanded capacity," including highway and transit improvements, according to Mark Dinger, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation. The biggest pot of money for those projects is the $250 million that will be available each year to improve congested corridors across the state. Dinger said that money can be used to make freeways more efficient by improving ramp meters and adding real-time electronic message boards showing precise travel times. Efficiency measures alone, he said, can improve traffic flow by 25 percent. Dinger said the money can also pay for new freeway lanes, though he estimated those projects would not start until 2019 or 2020. State and regional agencies would need to submit applications for the money. Type of new lanes limited Here’s where Allen has a point: His spokeswoman pointed out that the congested corridor program can not fund general purpose freeway lanes, which are the main lanes used by most drivers. The legislation does, in fact, prohibit spending this money on those "to mitigate increases in vehicle miles traveled, greenhouse gases, and air pollution," the text of the law reads. Still, the measure does allow for spending on new carpool and toll lanes, plus auxiliary lanes which can ease the flow of traffic at backed up freeway interchanges. The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office found the tax measure also pays for new local roads. "The funding package includes about $1.8 billion annually specifically for local streets and roads," the LAO reported in June 2017. It specified that about $100 million annually would be set aside for "capacity expansion," primarily on local roads and streets, though some could be used for transit projects. Dinger said the tax measure, which also funds bicycle and pedestrian projects, reflects the state’s more holistic approach to solving traffic. "Just adding lanes is simply not the way out of traffic congestion. That’s the old way of thinking in terms of transportation planning. You have to offer multi-modal choices and reduce people’s dependency on their cars," the Caltrans spokesman said. Our ruling Republican Assemblyman and candidate for governor Travis Allen claimed California’s gas tax increase won’t build new roads or freeway lanes nor will it ease traffic congestion. His statement distorts the goal of the gas tax increase. Its purpose was to tackle the state’s backlog of transportation repairs -- not to build bigger roads and highways. Allen also misses the mark on the details. It’s correct to say one of the measure’s big pots of money prohibits spending on general purpose freeway lanes. But it allows funding for freeway carpool and toll lanes along with efficiency projects that can ease up bottlenecks. Additionally, the measure sets aside $100 million annually for the expansion of local roads. Allen’s claim balances on a sliver of truth, but has a freeway full of problems. We rate it Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-04183	"More than 50 percent of those people getting minimum wage in this state are high school students."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/13/robert-singer/sen-robert-siner-says-most-people-jersey-earning-m/	Raising the minimum wage so soon after Hurricane Sandy could create another round of casualties, according to state Sen. Robert Singer: businesses along the Jersey Shore. During a Senate hearing Nov. 29, Singer (R-Ocean) argued against a measure to increase the hourly minimum wage to $8.50 from $7.25. Senate Democrats passed the bill 23-16; Singer voted against it. The minimum wage last got a bump in 2005. Singer’s statement focused on the financial hit Shore businesses would face by raising their labor force costs on top of trying to rebuild in time for summer 2013. "More than 50 percent of those people getting minimum wage in this state are high school students," Singer said. "Many of them work the Shore area." While a good number of working high school students are likely being paid minimum wage, it’s a bit of a stretch to claim that more than half the population earning $7.25 an hour in New Jersey are in high school. Let’s review the data. New Jersey is one of 23 states with minimum wage set at $7.25 an hour, the same as the federal government. In its most recent annual report, the state’s Minimum Wage Advisory Commission noted that 16,000 people ages 16-21 were paid minimum wage on average for a year-long period ending September 2011, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That amounts to 40.2 percent of minimum-wage earners in the state -- the largest group of workers being paid $7.25 an hour, according to the report. Brian T. Murray, a state Labor Department spokesman, said more recent data for the period of October 2011 through September 2012, shows that 24,400 people (52.4 percent of the state’s minimum-wage earners) were in that age group, according to the Current Population Survey and the BLS. The more recent data, however, has not yet been released officially, Murray said. So, Singer can’t accurately claim that more than half of New Jersey’s minimum-wage earners are high school students. The closest age range to high school in the New Jersey data is 16-21, meaning people not in high school are lumped in with students. Singling out high schoolers isn’t critical to the overall discussion about raising New Jersey’s minimum wage, according to Singer. "I don’t think the statement is really crucial in the entire discussion," Singer told us, adding that there’s no way to count high school students who may be getting paid ‘off the books,’ or in cash, without tax deductions. "If it’s 40 or 50 percent, 10 percent doesn’t change my comments or the gist of my comments." There’s also a difference in the weight minimum wage carries in a family when a teenager is getting it versus an adult. "The idea to the extent that teenagers are second workers or third workers in a household where there’s other income, then raising the minimum wage is not necessarily for those households an anti-poverty program," said Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "The real effect of helping the working poor is to raise the income of those people who are heads of households." Our ruling During a speech on the state Senate floor about raising New Jersey’s minimum wage, Singer said, "More than 50 percent of those people getting minimum wage in this state are high school students. Many of them work the Shore area." Data shows that high school-age students are part of the largest percentage of New Jerseyans earning minimum wage, but the data is for an age range of 16 to 21. That means nonstudents are included. Singer said his figure doesn’t include students who may be paid ‘off the books,’ but there’s no way to quantify that group. As a result, there’s no clear proof that more than half those in New Jersey earning minimum wage are high schoolers even though it’s likely some high school students are included. We rate Singer’s statement Mostly False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com. Update: The minimum wage bill that Singer voted against also included a provision providing automatic annual increases in the minimum wage, starting in September 2013, according to Senate Republicans spokesman Jeremy Rosen. Further, Singer voted in the same hearing against tabling an amendment to increase New Jersey's minimum wage to $8.50 an hour, over three years, Rosen noted.

pomt-14167	"When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-raul-castro-snubbed-barack-obama/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said President Barack Obama had been disrespected during his recent trip to Cuba -- the first visit by a sitting president since 1928, as well as a landmark step in the evolving relationship between bitter Cold War enemies. "Our rivals no longer respect us," Trump said during a major foreign policy speech on April 27, 2016. "In fact, they're just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don't take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don't respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One." This was not the first time Trump had raised this concern. He sent this tweet the same day Obama landed in Cuba: Is Trump right that this is an unprecedented snub? After checking with diplomatic and presidential historians, we found that Trump has a point, but his claim is far from airtight. Airport greetings aren’t only from heads of state On March 20 at José Martí International Airport near Havana, the president was "greeted by a delegation of American and Cuban officials, including … Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, the Cuban foreign minister," the New York Times reported. So neither Fidel Castro, the communist government’s founding leader, or Raul Castro, his brother and successor, was at the airport to greet Obama. Fidel Castro is in poor health, but Raul Castro met Pope Francis at the airport in February. And he also met the Russian Orthodox Patriarch at the airport when he arrived that month. Trump has "a legitimate point," said Paul Kengor, a biographer of Ronald Reagan. "It did make Obama look bad, especially given that the Castro brothers should be enormously grateful" that an American president would agree to start warming relations between the two countries. That said, Trump’s wording in his speech -- that "no leader was there, nobody, to greet him" -- wasn’t really accurate. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, the foreign minister, is a high-ranking official in the Cuban government. So is Cuban Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Cabanas, who was also there. Indeed, the White House said at the time said that it was never envisioned that one of the Castros would come to the airport to greet Air Force One. "The White House says it's taking no offense that Cuban President Raul Castro didn't greet President Barack Obama upon arrival in Havana," the Associated Press reported. "Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, says it was ‘never contemplated or discussed’ that Castro would be at the airport. He said the Cubans consider Monday morning's ceremony with Obama and Castro to be the official welcome event." White House spokesman Ned Price told PolitiFact that there is "not a standard recipe" for how protocol of this sort is handled. "If the official arrival ceremony is separate from the airport arrival, as was the case in Cuba, it's certainly not atypical for someone other than the head of state to greet Air Force One," Price said. Independent experts agreed. Nick Cullather, a diplomatic historian at Indiana University, said he doubted any snub was felt when Obama recently traveled to the United Kingdom and was met at Stansted Airport by Essex Lord Lieutenant Lord John Petre, a designee of Queen Elizabeth II. And lots of factors can play a role in who comes out to greet the president, said Alan K. Henrikson, a diplomatic historian at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. "The time of day can be important, depending in part on the itinerary and destination," he said, "If the president is traveling to several places on one trip, he might be arriving at an odd hour, late in the evening or early in the morning. … There are regional and cultural, as well as constitutional, variations." And the fact that there were no recent visits to Cuba may have made protocol more malleable. "There's no precedent for Air Force One landing in Cuba," said Price of the White House. "The fact that the president was welcomed with an official arrival ceremony, an unprecedented press conference, and full state dinner, among other elements, speaks to the level of respect the president was afforded." There’s at least one precedent: When Nixon went to China There is no single online clearinghouse that tracks presidential overseas arrivals, and we couldn’t find an expert who was familiar with all such historical events. However, we did find one case that serves as a precedent: President Richard Nixon’s first trip to China in 1972. Like Obama’s trip to Cuba, Nixon’s journey marked the first time an American president had visited a longstanding enemy in several decades. Both nations were communist countries, with the founding leader still alive at the time. Both were highly anticipated media events. So how was the China arrival handled? It was Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai -- not Mao Zedong, China’s top leader -- who greeted Nixon at the base of the steps from Air Force One. Here’s the official White House photograph by Byron Schumaker. Winston Lord, the special assistant to Nixon’s National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, was instrumental in planning the trip. He shared recollections of the visit with a diplomatic oral history project, describing the arrival ceremony as disappointing. "I remember that when we landed at Beijing Airport, maybe naively I was somewhat disappointed at what I considered the strained nature of the Chinese reception. We had expected thousands of people in cheering crowds after 22 years of hostilities. There was a very small crowd, including a Chinese Army honor guard. Looking out the window at the welcoming ceremony, I thought that it was a fairly grey day, too. This didn’t look like a monumental event, as it ought to have been. "Of course, everyone was wondering how the first encounter would go between the President and Zhou Enlai, who was at the airport to meet him. They all remembered that Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had snubbed Zhou Enlai in Geneva in the 1950s when he refused to shake his hand. That initial handshake this time was clearly going to be important. Nixon left the plane, walked down the steps, and went over and shook Zhou En-lai’s hand. This was a famous photograph. ... Then there was a restrained reception at the airport, with the band playing, the national anthems, review of the honor guard, and so on. There were not many people there. The reception was very cool." Our ruling Trump said, "When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him -- perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One." While there appears to be some variation in protocol for presidential arrivals, it’s credible to view the absence of one of the Castro brothers at the airport as something of a snub, particularly since Raul Castro had met two visiting religious leaders there just months earlier. However, Trump exaggerates here when he says "no leader was there, nobody, to greet him," since Cuba’s foreign minister and other high government officials were present. And there is at least one "precedent" for the foreign minister greeting a visiting president -- Nixon’s trip to China in 1972, which is actually a pretty good comparison for the type of trip Obama was making.

pomt-07819	The Obama administration "actually cut out the democracy in Egypt funds inside the State Department."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-accuses-obama-administration-cutting/	Just days after Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak yielded to a popular uprising and relinquished power, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., took a shot at the Obama Administration for its handling of Egyptian democracy issues. On the Feb. 13, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Gingrich -- a possible 2012 presidential candidate -- said that "this is an administration which for reasons I don't understand actually cut out the democracy in Egypt funds inside the State Department." We thought we’d check to see whether that’s accurate. First, a little background. The federal government offers two primary sources of democracy funding to Egypt -- through the U.S. Agency for International Development, and through the State Department. It's a small portion of all the aid it gives to Egypt and includes funding for "civil society" programs, "good governance," and efforts to advance the "rule of law and human rights." Some of this money goes toward independent democracy-building groups, some to the government to improve its transparency, and some to anti-corruption and human-rights efforts. Under U.S. AID, there’s a category called "Governing Justly and Democratically." Meanwhile, under the State Department, the federal government funds two programs that benefit Egypt -- the Middle East Partnership Initiative and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Here’s a description of funding for the U.S. AID portion of that funding since fiscal year 2006, according to a summary by the Project on Middle East Democracy: Fiscal year 2006 actual funding: $50.0 million Fiscal year 2007 actual funding: $50.0 million Fiscal year 2008 actual funding: $54.8 million Fiscal year 2009 actual funding: $20 million Fiscal year 2010 estimate: $25 million Fiscal year 2011 presidential request: $25 million The fiscal year 2012 request will not be out for another few weeks, experts said. For the sake of context, we should point out that for 2011, democracy funding under these programs accounted for just 2 percent of the U.S. government money that went to Egypt. The rest was for military and security assistance (84 percent) and for other economic assistance (14 percent). As the table above shows, the funding level for U.S. AID’s Egyptian democracy programs did go down significantly between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2009, but assigning responsibility for this decline is tricky. Officially, the cut for fiscal 2009 was enacted by Congress in March 2009 and signed by Obama. But the funding change stemmed from a broader cut put in motion by the administration of George W. Bush. As if that wasn’t murky enough, it gets even more complicated, said Stephen McInerney, the executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, an advocacy group that closely tracks democracy funding in the region. Initially, the Bush Administration wanted to cut overall economic aid to Egypt from $415 million in fiscal year 2008 to $200 million in fiscal year 2009. But the Bush Administration wanted to protect the fraction of the funding being spent on democracy from cuts. By the time Congress approved the funding, however, the democracy budget had been slashed by roughly the same percentage as the entire Egypt aid budget. This is the decline Gingrich was referring to. "The Obama Administration can claim that had the Bush Administration not cut overall economic aid, then the democracy and governance portion would not have gotten cut," McInerney said. "But the Bush Administration could retort that they had specifically designated that the democracy and governance portion not be cut. And both sides would be correct." Now, let’s shift gears and look at the State Department funding. The two State Department programs serving Egypt and other countries have increased during the Obama administration, but country-by-country figures are not available. In fact, the State Department programs picked up some slack from the declining U.S. AID budgets, said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. "After the Obama administration took office, U.S. AID decided to terminate direct grants to unregistered Egyptian pro-democracy groups -- that is, those that did not have official approval from the Egyptian government," Malinowski said. "It was not clear if this was a decision made by the U.S. embassy in Cairo without the knowledge of the very new political leadership in Washington or a decision that had high-level blessing in the new administration. In any case, it did happen on Obama’s early watch. But the Obama administration decided to continue funding the same unregistered Egyptian democracy groups through a different budget account, administered by the State Department, to the tune of $7 million." So let’s summarize. Funding from U.S. AID for Egyptian democracy did fall by about half, but that resulted from actions taken by both the Bush and Obama administrations. Meanwhile, democracy funding under the State Department’s budget rose. The Obama administration later sought to increase U.S. AID funding, but neither this increase nor the increase in the State Department’s budget was enough to replace the lost U.S. AID funds. How does this square with Gingrich’s statement that the Obama administration actually "cut out the democracy in Egypt funds inside the State Department"? We see a few problems. First, the Obama administration bears some of the responsibility for the cuts, but the Bush administration does as well. Second, using the term "cut out" makes it sound like the funds were eliminated, rather than reduced. Third, the funds that were inside the State Department’s budget actually increased; the ones that were cut were inside U.S. AID’s budget. Still, Gingrich does have a point. On an overall basis, democracy funding did decline rather significantly during the first two years of the Obama administration, and the administration played a role in that decision. Gingrich’s statement is "not too far off from a true statement," McInerney said. "If he had dropped the words ‘out’ and ‘inside the State Department,’ then I would consider it to be a true statement." We agree, so on balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Half True.

pomt-10621	"I believe, Senator Clinton, you've raised more money from those people (the oil and gas industry) than any candidate, Democrat or Republican."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/16/john-edwards/not-as-much-as-republicans/	John Edwards has targeted Clinton before for taking money from federal lobbyists. (Edwards and Barack Obama do not.) We've previously checked his allegations here that she gets the most money from the health industry, pharmaceutical companies, health insurance companies and defense companies. He was mostly right on those claims. At the Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Edwards charged Clinton with raising the most money from the oil and gas industry. But Edwards is a bit off here. Clinton is No. 1 among Democrats, according to the latest data analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics. Analyzing contributions from political action committees and individuals filed through Sept. 30, 2007, the center found the following totals from oil and gas companies: * Rudy Giuliani $545,058 * Mitt Romney $309,933 * Hillary Clinton $220,550 * John McCain $189,935 * Barack Obama $106,112 * Ron Paul $34,102 * John Edwards $27,850 So it's true that Clinton has gotten significantly more than her Democratic rivals, but so far she's also been outraised by Republicans Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. For this reason, we give Edwards' statement only a Half True.

pomt-06720	"The United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources. … We are the king daddy dogs when it comes to energy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/31/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-us-no-1-world-energy-resourc/	During an Aug. 27, 2011, appearance in the central Florida town of Poinciana, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination -- made a striking claim about the United States’ energy resources. According to an Associated Press story, Bachmann said that "the United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources," arguing that, in shale deposits alone, the United States easily outstrips the total oil supply of Saudi Arabia. "That doesn't even include … all the oil in Alaska." Bachmann added, "Instead of thinking we are beggars out here begging for oil and for energy, we are the king daddy dogs when it comes to energy. The radical environmentalists have demanded that we lock up all our energy resources. President Bachmann will take that key out of the door. I will unlock it." Several readers asked us to look at whether the U.S. is in fact "the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources." First, some background on how energy resources are measured. We found a concise explanation in a report issued on Nov. 30, 2010, by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. (According to a different Associated Press article, Bachmann actually cited the CRS report during her Poinciana event.) "It is important to keep in mind that naturally occurring deposits of any material, whether it is fossil fuels, gold, or timber, comprise a broad spectrum of concentration, quality, and accessibility (geologic, technical, and cultural)," CRS wrote. The report’s authors suggested visualizing this notion as a pyramid -- a small amount of easily recoverable resources at the top, with increasingly large deposits that are more and more difficult to extract toward the base of the pyramid. Energy experts use a variety of technical terms that describe how easily and how economically feasible it is to extract a given resource. Here are a few of the more common terms, in descending order of cost-effectiveness: • Proved reserves. This refers to estimates made with "reasonable certainty" to be "commercially recoverable" under current economic and governmental conditions. • Undiscovered, economically recoverable resources. These are resources that are expected to be found eventually based on geological features of a given location and which are likely to be economically feasible once recovery proceeds. • Undiscovered, technically recoverable resources. These are resources that are expected to be found eventually based on geological features of a given location and which are likely to be recoverable but which will not necessarily be recoverable on an economically feasible basis. We looked at detailed international comparisons compiled by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical office of the U.S. Department of Energy. We’ll look at the data for three fossil fuels -- petroleum, natural gas and coal. We won’t look at renewable energy (such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar or wind) because it’s difficult to make international comparisons for renewable energy that countries could potentially harness. Petroleum: U.S. petroleum reserves are relatively small -- less than 21 billion barrels. By comparison, the top four are Saudi Arabia (263 billion barrels), Venezuela (211 billion), Canada (175 billion), and Iran (137 billion). Natural gas: The U.S. does better on this score. It has 273 trillion cubic feet of proved reserves, ranking fourth in the world behind Iran (1,046 trillion cubic feet), Qatar (896 trillion cubic feet) and Saudi Arabia (276 trillion cubic feet). All told, the U.S. accounts for 4 percent of the world total. Coal: This is where the U.S. can lay its most plausible claim to be "king daddy dog." The EIA’s international comparison -- which uses the more relaxed standard of recoverable coal rather than proved reserves -- the U.S. has 260 billion short tons of coal. Its closest competitors are Russia (173 billion short tons) and China (126 billion short tons). The U.S. possesses a whopping 27 percent of the world total. Using a different data set, we also looked at the world reserves of uranium, the material used for nuclear reactors. According to the World Nuclear Association, the U.S. has 342,000 tons of "known, recoverable" uranium. That’s 6 percent of the world total, ranking sixth in the world behind Australia (23 percent of the world total), Kazakhstan (15 percent), Russia (10 percent), South Africa (8 percent) and Canada (8 percent). In its report, CRS made a couple attempts to make the kind of comprehensive, international comparison Bachmann made. Doing so requires some mathematical adjustments so that the figures for oil, natural gas and coal can be added together. This is done by adjusting the numbers for the amount of energy each resource produces. The unit of measurement CRS used is "barrels of oil equivalent." CRS concluded that the U.S. had about 973 billion barrels of oil equivalent in its reserves, which ranks first in the world. Russia was a close second at 955 billion and China a distant third with 475 billion. The U.S. also ranked first using a different measurement -- one that takes the reserves total from the previous calculation and adds to it technically recoverable (but not necessarily economically feasible) undiscovered oil and natural gas. CRS did not include technically recoverable, undiscovered coal in this calculation, even though it could be a substantial resource, because it found the data too speculative. By this measurement, the U.S. also ranked first in the world with 1.3 trillion barrels of oil equivalent, once again narrowly leading Russia, which had 1.2 trillion. Saudi Arabia, China and Iran ranked third, fourth and fifth, trailing the U.S. and Russia by large margins. These two comparisons demonstrate that Bachmann has justification for saying that "the United States is the No. 1 country in the world for energy resources." "Directionally, I think she is right," said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy Forum at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. "We have giant energy resources here." At the same time, the CRS report offers caveats that undercut such a broad-brush conclusion. Here are some of them: • Uncertain measurements. Not only is the science of estimating reserves and potentially recoverable resources subject to conjecture, but there’s no guarantee that every country’s data is reliable, since not every nation has put the same effort into researching the question -- or, if they have, they may not be interested in sharing accurate information with economic rivals. In addition, the data is old, CRS says. "There has been no reliable source for estimates of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources internationally since the U.S. Geological Survey completed its World Petroleum Assessment in 2000," CRS wrote. • The role of coal. The United States’ top ranking owes much to its lead in coal. But coal’s uses are limited since, barring some undiscovered technological advance, it cannot be used to power automobiles and other vehicles. "Not now nor in the near future will coal be a fuel source for transportation, as oil is," said Robin Dutta, research associate at the University of Delaware’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy. Because of this, Dutta called it "a false comparison" to compare, say, Saudi Arabia’s reserves to those in the United States. In addition, coal’s future viability as a fuel is somewhat in question because it is believed to be a major contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Many scientists believe that the impact of carbon dioxide emissions poses a serious ecological threat by promoting climate change, particularly on a long-term time scale. • How economical will extraction be? There are large and potentially recoverable troves of fossil fuels in the United States, but there’s a question about whether, and how soon, they’ll be economically viable. Citing oil shale and methane hydrate resources as examples, CRS said that "the uncertainty associated with estimates of those deposits is too great to produce meaningful comparisons. … The final tally would have very little meaning considering the difficulties in estimating those resources." Also unknown is how much of an environmental cost there would be to extraction, or how much government investment would be necessary if the industry considered it uneconomical on its own terms. • Non-fossil fuels. We noted that the CRS study didn’t measure nuclear energy or conventional forms of renewable energy such as solar, wind or biomass. Nor did it include more experimental technologies, such as energy from ocean waves, or even nuclear fusion. In the long term, one or more of these technologies may become more important than the fossil fuels we’re assessing here -- but we don’t know which one, or what nation will be best positioned to take advantage of the new methods. With its many windy and sunny locations, the U.S. could conceivably continue as the "king daddy dog" into a new era of renewable energy. But saying that today would be more speculative than certain. Our ruling Bachmann can point to some very specific numbers from a credible source -- CRS -- that place the United States first in the world in fossil-fuel reserves. But while she cited this big number from the CRS report at Poinciana, she also glossed over a number of caveats that raise questions about the significance of the No. 1 ranking. The U.S. lead is predominantly due to its large stores of coal, yet coal’s environmental effects pose a question mark for the future use of these resources. Meanwhile, for both coal and other fossil fuels, there’s continuing uncertainty about whether the U.S. will be able to exploit these resources in a way that’s economically feasible. Finally, there’s no way of knowing which renewable or experimental energy sources will become important in the future, and as a result, whether the U.S. will be well placed to dominate the field. We find Bachmann’s statement supportable based on available statistics, but the statistics may not be completely reliable. Some of the estimates include resources that would not be tapped if companies found it more profitable to exploit resources outside the U.S. We consider Bachmann's statement to be accurate, but find that it leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-08-31T14:05:38	2011-08-27	['United_States']
pomt-15160	"More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/27/nicholas-kristof/more-americans-killed-guns-1968-all-wars-says-colu/	In a column published shortly after the on-air slayings of two TV journalists in southwestern Virginia, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof offered some "data points" about the pervasiveness of gun violence in the United States. One of them was: "More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history." That sounded familiar. Really familiar. As it turns out, the web version of Kristof’s column sourced a PolitiFact article from Jan. 18, 2013, that fact-checked commentator Mark Shields’ claim that since 1968, "more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history." (Shields used the year 1968 because it was the year presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated by gunman Sirhan Sirhan.) We rated the claim True. Two and a half years later, we wondered whether the statistic still held up, so we took a new look at the data. Deaths from warfare We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for up-to-date deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org. Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of "death" — that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat. The one change we’ve made since our initial fact-check is to revise upward the number of Civil War deaths. As several readers pointed out after we published our earlier fact-check, the CRS report cited 525,000 Union and Confederate dead, but a subsequent study revised that estimate upward to 750,000. The study’s author acknowledged a great deal of uncertainty about the proper figure, and some experts later questioned whether it’s wise to include so many deaths from disease — perhaps two-thirds of the 750,000 figure — since disease in an era of relatively primitive medicine was so widespread that it’s unclear what share of fatal disease during that period was really a result of the war. Still, we’ll err on the side of the higher estimate and use the 750,000 figure this time. Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict: War Deaths Revolutionary War 4,435 War of 1812 2,260 Mexican War 13,283 Civil War (Union and Confederate, estimate) 750,000 Spanish-American War 2,446 World War I 116,516 World War II 405,399 Korean War 36,574 Vietnam War 58,220 Persian Gulf War 383 Afghanistan War 2,363 Iraq War 4,492 Other wars (includes Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti) 362 TOTAL 1,396,733 Gunfire deaths As we did in our previous fact-check, we used a conservative estimate of data from a 1994 paper published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to count gun-related deaths from 1968 to 1980. For 1981 through 2013, we used annual data sets from CDC. Finally, for 2014 and the first eight months of 2015, we estimated that the number of gun-related deaths were equal to the rate during the previous three full years for which we have data — 2011 to 2013. Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms: Years Firearm-related deaths 1968 to 1980 377,000 1981 to 1998 620,525 1999 to 2013 464,033 2014 (estimated based on rate from 2011-2013) 33,183 2015 (estimated based on rate from 2011-2013) 22,122 TOTAL, 1968-2015 1,516,863 So the statistic still holds up: There have been 1,516,863 gun-related deaths since 1968, compared to 1,396,733 cumulative war deaths since the American Revolution. That’s 120,130 more gun deaths than war deaths -- about 9 percent more, or nearly four typical years worth of gun deaths. And that’s using the most generous scholarly estimate of Civil War deaths, the biggest component of American war deaths. We’ll offer some added thoughts for context. These figures refer to all gunfire-related deaths, not just homicides. In fact, homicides represent a minority of gun deaths, with suicides comprising the biggest share. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun-related deaths were from suicides, 33 percent were from homicides, and roughly 1 percent each were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes. There’s a risk in using a statistic like this to decry mass homicides carried out with guns. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone. However, in our view, Kristof framed this comparison with care. He mentioned suicides not once but three times in his column, and he referred broadly to the "unrelenting toll of gun violence," not specifically to the toll of gun homicides. Indeed, at one point, Kristof specifically referenced the impact that stricter gun laws can have on gun suicides, writing that in 1996, after a mass shooting in Australia, lawmakers tightened gun laws. "The firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved," according to data published in the Journal of Public Health Policy, Kristof wrote. Finally, we’ll note that Kristof’s wording differed ever so slightly from the claim by Shields that we checked previously. While Shields said that "more Americans have died from gunfire," Kristof wrote that "more Americans have died from guns." Some may argue that guns don’t kill people, people do. However, that’s a philosophical judgment and beyond our ability to fact-check. Here, we’ll stick to the numbers, and we find they’re on Kristof’s side. Our ruling Kristof wrote, "More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history." Even using a significantly higher estimate for Civil War deaths than we did the last time we fact-checked this claim, the comparison still holds up. The number of gun deaths since 1968 — including, as Kristof was careful to note, both homicides and suicides — was higher than war fatalities by roughly 120,000 deaths, or almost four years’ worth of gun deaths in the United States. We rate the claim True.	None	Nicholas Kristof	None	None	None	2015-08-27T16:13:12	2015-08-27	['United_States']
pomt-09721	"President Bush never did one interview with the New York Times during his entire presidency."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/27/rachel-maddow/president-bush-new-york-times-interviews/	Calling the Fox News Channel "the communications arm of the Republican Party," White House aides have been complaining about slanted coverage from the cable network. Fox was pointedly excluded from a series of interviews President Barack Obama gave other networks on Sept. 20 about health care reform. Conservative critics and some independent pundits have said the president is guilty of freezing out a legitimate news network because he doesn't like its coverage. If that's the case, then President George W. Bush did it, too, said liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow of MSNBC. She said the Bush administration frequently excluded liberal columnists and talk show hosts from meetings Bush held with conservative media. "Would it surprise you to learn that President Bush never did one interview with the New York Times during his entire presidency? Not one in eight years?" she asked. That sounded suspicious to us, given that the New York Times is one of the largest newspapers in the country. Sure enough, we were able to find at least three interviews that Bush gave the New York Times . (We'll update this item if we find more.) • On June 5, 2001, New York Times reporter Frank Bruni had what he described as Bush's first "one-on-one interview" since Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont switched parties and threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. "We're looking at a different landscape, but still on the same continent," Bush said. "The same votes. The members haven't changed." • On Aug 26, 2004, Bush gave a half-hour interview to the New York Times as he campaigned through New Mexico. Bush told the newspaper that he did not believe Sen. John Kerry lied about his war record, as some groups alleged during the campaign. • On Jan. 27, 2005, a week after he started his second term, Bush spoke with New York Times reporters for 40 minutes, discussing troop levels in Iraq and domestic issues such as gay adoption, abortion and Social Security. We couldn't find any interviews after that date, though we did find comments complaining about a lack of access from New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg on the newspaper's Web site on Nov. 9, 2008. A reader asked Stolberg if the White House played favorites when it came to press access. Stolberg wrote that the New York Times had had a standing request to interview Bush, "since well before I came on this beat in May 2006. So far, no interview — and the reason why is hardly a secret. White House officials are quite open about the fact that we have not gotten an interview because they don't like our coverage. I get e-mails to that effect from them all the time. But the request still stands, and we are hoping for an interview before Mr. Bush leaves office." That might sound on first blush like the New York Times never got an interview ever , but the newspaper did have interviews prior to 2006. The Rachel Maddow Show told us they were going off a Los Angeles Times blog post that was based on Stolberg's comments. The blog post was incorrectly headlined, "Nine years later the N.Y. Times still awaits its Bush interview." The show did try to research the issue, "but obviously our fact-check fell short," Maddow said in a statement to PolitiFact. "We'll air a correction." To be clear, we're not checking Maddow's broader point that Bush played favorites with the press. Is there any president who hasn't? Rather, we're checking Maddow's statement that President Bush "never did one interview with the New York Times during his entire presidency." That's not the case, so we rate her statement False.

pomt-15259	Says in 2002, he "won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/31/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-won-60-hispanic-vote-2002-electio/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush is courting Hispanic voters to build momentum for his presidential run, pointing out that he relied upon the demographic during his gubernatorial campaign. "In my re-election in 2002, I won the majority," he told Telemundo’s Jose Diaz-Balart in Spanish during a July 27, 2015 interview. "I won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state. It can be done." Bush has some advantages over most of his GOP rivals when it comes to Hispanic voters: He speaks Spanish fluently and his wife, Columba, is a native of Mexico. But did he really win re-election as governor with 60 percent of the Hispanic vote, higher than his percentage with white voters? We decided to revisit the polls and find out. Demographic shift The percentage of the vote is important, because the majority of registered voters in Florida are white. In 2002 there were 7 million white voters, with other ethnicities totaling 2.3 million. The Florida Department of State told PolitiFact Florida that it’s tough to say exactly how many Hispanic voters were registered in 2002, because Division of Elections record-keeping has since changed. Registrations then were recorded as either "white," "black," "other" or "unknown/not given." In 2013, the percentage of the electorate that is Hispanic was between 14 and 18 percent, a number that has probably grown since 2002. Bush cruised to re-election that year, winning 56 percent of the vote over Democrat Bill McBride. His campaign focused on Hispanic voters, with Bush giving interviews in Spanish and running Spanish-language campaign ads. Afterward, analysts and media coverage credited Bush with taking anywhere from 57 to 65 percent of the Hispanic vote. That would usually be an oddity for a non-Hispanic, Republican candidate, but not necessarily Bush. In 1998 he garnered 61 percent of Hispanic voters against Buddy McKay, versus 60 percent of white voters. But breaking down 2002’s numbers isn’t as clear cut as it would be for other years. Voter News Service, a joint poll by ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN and the Associated Press, stopped providing numbers on Election Night 2002 after it decided its computer analysis was flawed and couldn’t give reliable results. That meant a dearth of data for national and state races, and no exit polls that dissected the race, gender or economic status of Florida’s voters. That left independent analyses to pick up the slack. But most of those generally accepted Bush had won the Hispanic vote handily. Fernand Amandi, managing partner of Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi, said a combination of low turnout and a strong, older Cuban electorate gave the Republican an advantage. Some estimates said 80 percent of Cuban voters rallied around Bush. "The 2002 exit poll was flawed and not kept for reference, but targeted precinct analysis suggests he did clear the 60 percent threshold," Amandi said. "Without the benefit of a definitive exit poll, I would speculate he did as well or better against Bill McBride." One widely cited study from the Center for Immigration Studies pegged Bush’s support among Hispanics at 57 percent in 2002. University of Texas government professor Daron Shaw provided data from a Fox News poll for that analysis. Shaw also thought the Cuban population favored Bush, a factor that's especially in play in Florida. "I do recall the number and wasn’t particularly surprised," he said. "The Cuban population in Florida makes it a unique Hispanic cross-section, one that is much more friendly to Republicans than the national cross section." Our ruling Bush said in 2002, he "won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state." While Bush historically had enjoyed a strong Hispanic voter base, we found there actually aren’t the usual exit poll results from his 2002 re-election to support this conclusion. However, most media analyses from the election do suggest Bush carried about 60 percent of the Hispanic vote, as he did in 1998. Experts we consulted said that was most likely the case. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-07-31T11:24:32	2015-07-27	['None']
pomt-02818	Florida’s proposed amendment for medical marijuana would allow "people who alleged minor ailments such as muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and even menstrual cramps (to qualify) for government-sanctioned pot-smoking."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/nov/25/grady-judd/medical-marijuana-easy-get-under-proposed-florida-/	According to the latest poll, public support for legalizing medical marijuana in Florida is high (pun intended). If the language for the ballot initiative gets past the Florida Supreme Court, voters will have their say in November 2014, when they’re asked to approve an amendment to state Constitution. But the initiative as a whole still has its fair share of critics, including many law enforcement officials. Grady Judd, president of the Florida Sheriffs Association, wrote an editorial opposing the amendment in the Sun-Sentinel, criticizing the ballot measure as essentially marijuana legalization. "Authors of the amendment have included a truck-sized loophole in the definition of debilitating diseases, which changes the word disease into ‘condition.’ And what constitutes a valid ‘condition?’ " Judd wrote. "Any condition where the ‘use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks’ of someone who claimed to be sick. This means people who alleged minor ailments such as muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and even menstrual cramps have qualified for government-sanctioned pot-smoking." PolitiFact Florida wanted to check out what conditions patients could get medical marijuana licenses for under the proposed Florida law. The amendment Let’s start by taking a look at the proposed medical marijuana amendment text. The ballot summary reads: "Allows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients’ medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana." So when a doctor prescribes cannabis, the Department of Health will issue the patient a license. Under Florida law, patients would not be able to grow their own plants. Approved patients could purchase marijuana from registered, state-regulated centers. The amendment says how the centers will operate with regard to registration, record-keeping and safety would be determined by the department after passage. Because medical marijuana would be legally dispensed, the program is government approved. However, saying it’s "government-sanctioned" isn’t quite right, because government officials are not encouraging marijuana use, as the definition of the word "sanction" would imply. In the amendment text itself, which goes beyond the ballot summary, we get a list of qualifying diseases: Cancer Glaucoma HIV/AIDs Hepatitis C ALS Crohn’s disease Parkinson’s disease Multiple sclerosis And here’s the part that Judd referred to: "or other conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient." That means it’s up to doctors to determine if patients could benefit from using medical marijuana. Judd draws a comparison between what the proposed amendment in Florida would allow and what patients in other states have experienced. Out of the 20 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have legalized medical marijuana, only California and Massachusetts have requirements similar to Florida’s proposal that allow for physician discretion when it comes to qualifying conditions. Most other states have a finite list of conditions, but say that the health department could add more or assign waivers. So Florida’s amendment would have a more relaxed standard than most states. When we reached out to Judd, his spokesman told us that it’s clear medical marijuana access would not be limited to what he referred to as "debilitating" illnesses. Other critics of medical marijuana have pointed out that any system, even in states with stricter rules, is not immune to loopholes and abuse. For example, an Arizona TV station reported that 90 percent of cardholders in the state claimed chronic pain. However, the biggest age group claiming chronic pain was 18- to 30-year-olds, even though chronic pain is more common in older adults. So we can understand why Judd’s editorial speculates about the possibility that some healthy individuals will try to acquire licenses. Experts say So we know Florida has a flexible definition of which conditions qualify a patient for medical marijuana, which supports Judd’s point. But should the conditions he lists really be considered "minor ailments"? University of California, San Francisco doctor Donald Abrams has studied the effects of cannabis on cancer and HIV patients. Based on his experience treating and studying chronic illnesses, he said the conditions Judd listed are often serious. "Some of these things that your sheriff considers to be trivial require people to take opiates," Abrams said, adding that these medications (such as morphine) are less safe than marijuana. Several experts pointed out that muscle spasms are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that would already be greenlighted for medical marijuana treatment if the Florida amendment passes. Neck pain, back pain and menstrual cramps are also frequently treated with prescription pain medication. Today chronic pain affects about 100 million U.S. adults, according to the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Oh, and as for menstrual cramps, ladies? Abrams said Queen Victoria opted for a little marijuana therapy to relieve her pain in the 19th century. So yes, Judd is right that someone with one of these ailments would be eligible for a medical marijuana license at a physician’s discretion. But it’s a misleading generalization to describe these conditions as "minor." Our ruling Judd said that people with "minor ailments" could get access to marijuana if Florida’s proposed amendment passes next year. He mentioned spasms and other chronic pain as a minor condition, when sometimes those conditions are quite serious. But compared to most other states, Florida’s ballot language is flexible because it allows for physicians to determine whether a patient’s condition qualifies for a license. We rate Judd’s statement Mostly True.	None	Grady Judd	None	None	None	2013-11-25T18:16:13	2013-11-19	['None']
pomt-02096	The media "widely overlooked" comments made by former President Bill Clinton that Hillary Clinton had a terrible concussion that took six months to recover from.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/18/brit-hume/brit-hume-media-overlooked-terrible-concussion-com/	The top political story from the week was Karl Rove’s comments about Hillary Clinton’s health following a concussion she suffered in December 2012. On the Sunday shows, there was much talk about whether the country should spend much time talking about Clinton’s health. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said there is more to be learned and noted that former President Bill Clinton himself revealed that the concussion was "terrible" and required six months of treatment. Hume said that is "new news" that had been "widely overlooked." While Bill Clinton’s quip that Republicans thought Hillary Clinton is auditioning for a part on The Walking Dead "was reported everywhere," Hume said, "the part where he said that she underwent what I guess was six months of physical therapy to recover from the concussion, a ‘terrible concussion,’ was new news. And of course, it was widely overlooked." In this fact-check, we examine whether, as Hume said, much of the media failed to report those additional details from President Clinton. Television and cable Fox News had an interview segment specifically about Clinton’s reference to six months and a terrible concussion but fans of other networks got a similar message. ABC News said Clinton went beyond defending his wife. "The former president revealed that his wife’s injury 'required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said during a question-and-answer session at the Peterson Foundation in Washington. "'They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said. 'It’s something she never low-balled with the American people, never tried to pretend it didn’t happen.'" CNN noted that Clinton had shared details that guaranteed the issue would remain alive. "But he went on to say this, proving this was no minor fall: 'She had sustained what was a terrible concussion. Required six months of very serious work to get over.'" CBS News presented Clinton’s words in full. "'She certainly seems to have more stamina now and there's nothing to it,' Clinton said during a question and answer session with PBS' Gwen Ifill. 'I was sort of dumbfounded. They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over, something she never lowballed with the American people, never tried to pretend didn't happen.'" NBC News, MSNBC, and PBS all presented similar accounts. NBC Nightly News included Clinton’s quote during its broadcast as did PBS NewsHour. We also found mentions on CNN’s Out Front and MSNBC’s PoliticsNation and The Ed Show. Major newspapers and wire services Ditto basically for major U.S. newspapers and wire services. The Associated Press led with Bill Clinton’s reference to a long recovery. "Former President Bill Clinton said Wednesday his wife Hillary took six months to recover from a 2012 concussion, adding she is now 'stronger than I am' as he dismissed GOP strategist Karl Rove's comments about her health." Hundreds of print and broadcast services across the country carry the AP’s stories. The New York Times noted in its coverage the significance of everything Clinton said. "He did acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton had suffered a 'very serious concussion,' and that it had taken her months to fully recover." The Wall Street Journal: Mr. Clinton, speaking at a forum on budget issues Wednesday in Washington, also offered some fresh insights into the December 2012 incident, saying that Hillary Clinton suffered a 'terrible concussion' that entailed 'six months of very serious work' toward recovery. The Los Angeles Times did not give top billing to the detail about six months of recovery but did report it. The New York Daily News included the former president’s description, writing, "She endured six months of ‘very serious work’" to recover from a concussion and blood clot but now ‘she is strong; she is doing great,’ he (Clinton) said." Online news services Ditto, too, for major online websites. The liberal Huffington Post had a story with this headline: "Bill Clinton Insults Rove, But Acknowledges Hillary's Health Is 'Serious Issue'." "The 42nd president also revealed that he knows questions about his wife's health and age can't be ignored as the 2016 presidential race comes into focus. In fact, he called it 'a serious issue.'" A few sentences later, the article quoted Clinton in full, speaking of "a terrible concussion" that "required six months of serious work to get over." Politico also provided Clinton’s complete description in the third paragraph of its article. Talking Points Memo mentioned the six-month recovery period, although further down in its story. Our ruling Hume said much of the media overlooked that Bill Clinton said his wife had suffered a terrible concussion that required six months of work before she recovered. While Bill Clinton’s Walking Dead zinger may have gotten more airtime (we didn’t check), Hume is wrong to assert that the media ignored Clinton’s substantive comments. Clinton’s comments were covered in print by the nation’s biggest newspapers, in online articles, and on the TV networks and elsewhere. We rate the claim False.

pomt-00719	"I’m the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200."	true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/27/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-he-no-1-house-small-donations/	A day after a Florida man landed a gyrocopter on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol to demand campaign finance reform, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson talked up his own efforts to focus on small donations and his potential U.S. Senate bid. Grayson, an Orlando Democrat, told a reporter for Democracy Now on April 16 that he will "probably" run in a primary against U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, for Marco Rubio’s Senate seat in 2016. As Democratic Party activists and leaders consider their best path to winning that seat, Grayson wants to remind them of his populist fundraising: "I’m the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200," he said. We decided to check if Grayson holds a record in the House for contributions of less than $200. (A spokesman for Grayson told PolitiFact Florida that he is likely a few weeks away from making his decision but reiterated that he has said he will "probably run.") Counting small donations The Federal Election Commission considers donations of less than $200 as small donations, which don’t have to be individually reported. Instead, candidates report a total amount of money from small donors. In the House for the 2013-14 election cycle, those who received the largest share of their campaign revenue from small contributions were Democrats -- and Grayson was indeed No. 1, according to a November 2014 analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Grayson’s small donations totaled about $1.8 million and equaled 57 percent of his $3.1 million donations. The House member who raised the next highest amount in small donations was Florida’s Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, and head of the Democratic National Committee. She raised $1.2 million in small donations, which equaled 47 percent of her contributions. (Wasserman Schultz recently ruled out running for Senate in 2016.) The third place House finisher was U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota who raised about $850,000 in small donations, or 41 percent of his pot. On the Senate side for the 2013-14 cycle, Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota topped the list with $11.7 million in small donations, equaling about 40 percent of his donations. (During his Democracy Now interview, Grayson mentioned U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as a leader in the Senate in raising small donations. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and was re-elected in 2012, raised almost $5 million in small donations, or about 61 percent.) Who racks up small donations and why? So why are some member of Congress small donor leaders? In the case of Franken, a former Saturday Night Live star, the Center for Responsive Politics noted that "name recognition in combination with hailing from a state with a strong grassroots tradition doesn’t hurt." Grayson’s persona as a Democratic firebrand likely contributes to his fundraising abilities. "The most successful small-money fundraisers mix media exposure with partisan taunting and ideological appeals," Adam Bonica, a Stanford political science professor, wrote in 2011. Grayson is famous for his provocative taunts against Republicans, such as describing the GOP health care plan as "if you do get sick, die quickly," or comparing Dick Cheney to a vampire. Michael J. Malbin, director of the Campaign Finance Institute and a political science professor at the University at Albany, said polarization alone won’t get candidates a lot of money in small donations. In many cases, candidates are tapping into political organizations with an existing network of small donors. Grayson, for example, has received money bundled through ActBlue, an online Democratic fundraising group that focuses on competitive races. Candidates "got their boost from national organizations that created support for the candidates by recommending them to donors who trusted the bundling organization(s) and who probably would not otherwise have known who the candidates were," Malbin wrote. Our ruling Grayson said, "I’m the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200."

pomt-07584	Says Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser "has prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/27/joanne-kloppenburg/kloppenburg-says-wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-p/	"The hallmark of a good judge," says Marquette University law professor Janine Geske, who served as a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, "is somebody who is impartial. "And what that means is somebody who goes into a case without any prejudgments." So, when Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg accused incumbent Justice David Prosser of not being impartial, it amounted to more than mere campaign rhetoric. In a videotaped interview on March 16, 2011, Kloppenburg declared that Prosser had "prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court." She repeated the charge in a debate six days later, saying: "I, unlike my opponent, will approach cases with an open mind and without having prejudged the matters that come before the court." The Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judicial candidates from making statements that commit them regarding "cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court." It would be a serious matter if Prosser has prejudged cases, such as the court challenge to Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s collective bargaining law. (On March 24, 2011, the state appeals court panel asked the state Supreme Court to take the case. Prosser has indicated he will not recuse himself.) So, let’s evaluate Kloppenburg’s claim. Since the campaign has only begun to take on a high profile as the April 5 election approaches, let’s first lay some foundation. Prosser, 68, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1998 and was re-elected three years later to a full 10-term term. He previously spent 18 years in the state Assembly representing the Appleton area; for eight of those years he was the Republican leader. Kloppenburg, 57, of Madison, has been an assistant state attorney general since 1989, working both as a prosecutor and a litigator. This is her first run for public office. Kloppenburg has made contributions to Democratic candidates, but not Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign database. Groups that have endorsed her most recently include the Sierra Club, the Madison police union and a union that represents public employees in Milwaukee County. Since 2008, Prosser has been part of a 4-3 conservative majority that controls the Supreme Court. A win by Kloppenburg, who is backed by many people upset with Walker’s collective bargaining law, would create a 4-3 liberal majority. We asked Kloppenburg campaign spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence that Prosser has prejudged matters that are likely to be brought to the high court -- more specifically, which matters. Mulliken said there were none. Kloppenburg’s allegation against Prosser, she said, was made as a broader statement. Accusing Prosser of prejudging matters, but providing no examples … well, that takes a lot of the steam out Kloppenburg’s claim. Her campaign did cite four statements -- three by Prosser’s campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, and one by Prosser himself -- as evidence to back up the accusation. We treat a statement from a spokesman as having been made by the candidate himself. So let’s examine what Kloppenburg cited. "Complement" In a Dec. 8, 2010, news release announcing Nemoir as Prosser’s campaign spokesman, Nemoir said Prosser would be a "common-sense complement to both the new administration and Legislature." The reference was to Walker, who had been elected governor but not yet taken office, and Republicans who would control the Senate and Assembly in January. Prosser disavowed the statement weeks later, saying he had not seen it before it went out. But the statement left a clear impression that, rather than being part of an independent judiciary, Prosser saw himself as in league with Republicans who controlled the executive and legislative branches of government. "Closely mirrors" After Kloppenburg blasted the "complement" comment, Nemoir responded with an e-mail the next day describing Prosser as an independent, "rule-of-law judge." In the same statement, however, Nemoir said Prosser’s "personal ideology more closely mirrors that of the incoming administration and Legislature." The Kloppenburg campaign cited that as evidence of prejudging. But Kloppenburg ignored the rest of Nemoir’s quote, which was that Prosser’s "impartial approach to applying the law won't deviate" -- in other words, that he would not prejudge cases. "Conservative majority" Nemoir said Feb. 9, 2011, that the Prosser-Kloppenburg race "is about a 4-3 common-sense conservative majority vs. a 3-4 liberal majority, and nothing more." This statement essentially reiterates that Prosser is a conservative who could hold a swing vote on the Supreme Court. It doesn’t support Kloppenburg’s claim that Prosser has shown he would prejudge cases. "Political conservative" Kloppenburg’s campaign cited instances in which Prosser also described himself as a political conservative, and claimed that indicates prejudging. At a March 22, 2011, debate, Prosser acknowledged being a political conservative. But he said that since becoming a justice, he has "tried very hard to withdraw from the political process, move to the center of the political spectrum, and view each case impartially on the facts of the law." As with the earlier comments, Prosser calling himself a political conservative is not evidence that he would ignore facts and the law in how he votes on the Supreme Court. Time for a verdict. The statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to Walker and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a "complement" to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases. But Kloppenburg didn’t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had "prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court." Yet she could provide no examples. We rate Kloppenburg’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05752	Says he "did the very best" in a recent poll in Iowa matching up each of the major Republican presidential candidates against President Barack Obama.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/02/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-he-did-best-gop-candidates-iowa-poll/	Ron Paul of Texas says he’s battling a false impression that he can’t triumph in a general election. John King of CNN asked the candidates at the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate to help "the voters who still have questions about you" and explain the "biggest misconception about you" in the public debate. "I would say the perpetuation of the myth by the media that I can't win" while some statistics show the contrary, said Paul, a Lake Jackson congressman. "Just recently, there was a poll in Iowa, and it matched all the four of us up against (President Barack) Obama. And guess what? I did the very best." Nationally, at the end of February 2012, Obama was outpacing each of the Republican hopefuls in one-on-one matchup polls, according to aggregations of results by RealClearPolitics.com. The "spread" was smallest for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (4-point lead for Obama), followed by former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (5-point lead for Obama) and Paul (6.6-point lead for Obama). Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was the furthest behind Obama, down 12.4 points. But did Paul accurately recap an Iowa poll? Paul spokesman Gary Howard told us that Paul was referring to a Des Moines Register poll, the results of which the newspaper wrote about on its website Feb. 19, 2012. Selzer & Co., a West Des Moines firm, conducted the telephone survey of 800 Iowans Feb. 12-15, 2012. As part of the poll, 611 likely voters were asked to indicate who they would vote for in matchups between Obama and each of the four major Republican candidates. The questions were phrased this way: "If the election for president were held today, and the candidates were Barack Obama for the Democrats and (name of GOP candidate) for the Republicans, for whom would you vote?" The results show all the candidates except Gingrich beating Obama in Iowa, with Paul winning by the greatest margin, as noted in the Register’s articles. The details: ** Paul 49 percent, Obama 42 percent (7-point difference) ** Santorum 48, Obama 44 (4-point difference) ** Romney 46, Obama 44 (2-point difference) ** Gingrich 37, Obama 51 (14-point difference) Straightforward, right? Not entirely. Interviews of pollsters led us to realize that there’s at least debate over the significance of the poll’s margin of error, which for the matchup questions in the Iowa Poll was plus or minus four percentage points. Margins of error hint at every poll’s built-in weakness: It’s impossible to survey every voter. In a write-up about polling, Selzer & Co. President J. Ann Selzer defines the margin of error as the estimated difference between a percentage obtained from a survey of a sample of voters — for example, the 49 percent in the Iowa Poll who said they would vote for Paul in a contest with Obama — and the percentage the firm theoretically would find if it interviewed every likely voter in the state. She explains further: Consider, she says, a report from her firm that a candidate has captured 60 percent of the vote in a survey with a margin of error of plus or minus four points. That means, she says, that if the survey were repeated in the same way at the same time with different samples of voters, 95 percent of the time, the percentage of support for the candidate would fall between 56 percent and 64 percent (a range of four more and four less than the reported percentage). Applying the margin of error in the Iowa Poll’s matchup questions demonstrates how much the actual results could swing. For Paul vs. Obama, the possibilities range from a 15-point Paul lead — Paul 53 (reported result plus four), Obama 38 (result minus four) — to a 1-point Obama lead — Paul 45 (result minus four), Obama 46 (result plus four). For Santorum vs. Obama, the matchup range goes from a 12-point Santorum lead (Santorum 52, Obama 40) to a 4-point Obama lead (Santorum 44, Obama 48). For Romney vs. Obama, the range is from a 10-point Romney lead to a 6-point Obama lead. And for Gingrich, the possibilities range from a 6-point Obama lead to a 22-point Obama lead. We asked five polling experts about Paul’s characterization of the Iowa results. There was no argument from anyone that Paul had accurately recapped the poll’s reported results. Still, Charlie Leonard, a visiting professor at Southern Illinois University who conducts polls for the school’s Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, told us that in his view, there’s no statistical difference between Paul and Santorum’s performance against Obama. However, Selzer, head of the firm that conducted the poll, aligned with Paul’s interpretation of the results. She said the best estimate of Paul’s support — and that of the other Republicans and Obama — is the percentage found during the survey and reported in the poll. She acknowledged that Paul’s percentage of support, for example, could be one, two, three or four points lower — or higher — than 49 in a matchup with Obama. But, she said, technically speaking, that’s less likely to be the case, because each point you move away from the reported number has a lower probability of being true. Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas and co-director of joint polling projects for the university and the Texas Tribune, described the difference between the Paul-Obama and Santorum-Obama matchup as marginal and said Paul’s statement "ignores the underlying statistics of those numbers" while being literally correct. Henson’s take on the margin of error: "What it tells you is that the most probable outcome is the two numbers (reported in the poll), and the farther you go off those numbers, the less likely they are to be true — but they might be." Our ruling Paul had the largest lead on Obama of any of the major Republicans in matchup polling in Iowa in February 2012. Still, experts raised questions about how statistically certain that conclusion is, considering how close the poll’s results were. To us, that is additional information needed to evaluate Paul’s claim, and so, his statement rates Mostly True.

pomt-10955	"There are billboards in Central America in the Northern Triangle countries advertising how to grab a kid to get into the United States illegally."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/23/kirstjen-nielsen/dhs-kirstjen-nielsen-falsely-says-there-are-billbo/	Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the Trump administration is frustrated by a lack of congressional action on "loopholes" incentivizing illegal immigration. Not making things any better are billboards in Central America that she claimed give tips on how to migrate illegally to the United States. "There are billboards in Central America in the Northern Triangle countries advertising how to grab a kid to get into the United States illegally. Because that loophole is so big. Billboards," Nielsen said during a July 19 interview with NBC’s Peter Alexander at the Aspen Security Forum. Poverty and gang violence are top reasons why many people flee Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador (a region called the "Northern Triangle") and seek asylum in the United States. Do billboards really suggest taking a kid to ease admission? PolitiFact was unable to find any evidence of the billboards Nielsen described. We repeatedly asked Nielsen's agency for billboard photos or any other evidence that would support her claim. We did not hear back. Several experts who study immigration and have traveled to Central America told us they have never heard of or seen such billboards. There were U.S.-sponsored billboards in Central America during the Obama years, but their goal was to deter illegal immigration, not encourage it. A quick point of clarification: Immigrants don’t need to "grab a kid to get into the United States illegally." Many come in without a child, and traveling with a child does not guarantee entry into the United States — legal or illegal, nor a path to citizenship. Also, the law allows parents and children to apply for asylum in the United States, even if they entered the country illegally. Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, said she returned this month from Guatemala after three weeks traveling around the highlands, the coastal lowlands, Guatemala City and the center of the country for fieldwork specifically on the causes and dynamics of outward migration to the United States. She said she was on the lookout for any migration-related signs. "I did not see a single billboard related to migration, and definitely not promoting migration," Leutert said. "The only thing I saw/heard while on the country's highways was an announcement on the bus radio warning would-be migrants of the dangers of traveling to the United States and how smugglers might abandon them in the desert." There does seem to be an understanding in Guatemala that if you come to the United States as a single adult and seek asylum, you will be detained for the entirety of your case; and if you come with a child your detention may be temporary and you may be released with an ankle monitor, Leutert said. "However, this was 100 percent not due to any potential billboard, as this is not how people get their information related to U.S. migration policy," Leutert said. Central Americans learn about U.S. policy — and trust the information — from their social networks; for instance, when they hear that a cousin who went alone seeking asylum is still detained but a family who went together are fighting their case outside detention with ankle monitors, Leutert said. Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor of government at George Mason University whose expertise includes Mexico-U.S. relations, immigration and border security, agreed that other methods are more effective: "If you get in a taxi in Guatemala City and ask the driver if they know a smuggler, most of them know." In countries like Guatemala or Honduras, the presidents are in line with U.S. policy and have been big supporters of the U.S. administration, said Correa-Cabrera, whose most recent trip to Guatemala was in late 2016. "I’m sure if some billboards would be placed, they would disappear quickly." "I’ve traveled extensively in Central America and have never seen these billboards," said Eric L. Olson, deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Latin American Program and senior advisor to the Center’s Mexico Institute. "This is not to say they do not exist, just that I’ve never seen any and find it’s highly unlikely that there would be such billboards, that is, if what is meant by billboards is large signs along a highway or thoroughfare." Handbills in a poor community sounds more plausible, Olson noted. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute told PolitiFact it consulted with several of its researchers who did fieldwork in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador between February and May this year, and they were not aware of any such billboards in those countries. Immigration experts pointed out past U.S. government-sponsored billboards in Central America. Their goal: prevent illegal immigration, not promote it. Obama-era billboards to deter illegal immigration As the United States had an influx of Central American unaccompanied minors arriving illegally, the Obama administration led public information campaigns to dissuade citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras from coming to the United States. Campaigns in 2013 and 2014 focused on the dangers of the journey, while the 2015 campaign intended to increase awareness about the implementation and eligibility requirements for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — point being that new arrivals would not benefit from the deportation reprieve program available to young immigrants already in the United States. The campaigns included ads on radio, TV stations, billboards, bus stops, and buses, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (DHS 2014 Dangers of the Journey campaign poster. Poster said: "I thought it would be easy for my son to get papers in the North… That wasn’t true. Our children are the future: We (must) protect them.") Amnesty International billboard on asylum rights The closest and most recent billboard we found about messaging to immigrants was raised by Amnesty International in April at the San Ysidro port of entry on the U.S.-Mexico border. Amnesty International said its billboard sought to remind U.S. and Mexican authorities of their obligations to facilitate asylum claims and invited asylum seekers to tell Amnesty International if they were turned away by officers. The billboard was raised around the time some people in a caravan sought entry into the United States. That billboard did not advertise how to get into the United States illegally with a child. Also, it was placed in Mexico, not within the Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com (Amnesty International billboard at the San Ysidro Port of Entry on the US–Mexico border in Tijuana, Mexico.) Our ruling Nielsen said, "There are billboards in Central America in the Northern Triangle countries advertising how to grab a kid to get into the United States illegally." DHS did not provide any material to corroborate Nielsen’s claim. We did not find any evidence, and experts who research immigration and have traveled to Central America (including one who did fieldwork in Guatemala this month) said they’ve never seen or heard about the billboards Nielsen described. The Obama administration raised billboards to discourage illegal immigration. Amnesty International had a billboard in Mexico (not the Northern Triangle countries) to remind authorities about immigrants’ asylum rights and to tell immigrants to report to the organization if they were turned away. Those two examples aren’t in line with Nielsen’s description. The burden of proof rests with the speaker. In the absence of evidence to support Nielsen’s claim, we rate her statement False.

pomt-07604	Ohio Director of Job Creation "Mark Kvamme just clawed back about $900,000 from companies that made promises and they didn't keep them."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/23/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-state-just-clawed-back-about-/	Gov. John Kasich can’t seem to stop talking about JobsOhio, his new private economic-development corporation that replaced part of the state Department of Development. He gives the department a lot of stage time when he’s promoting his budget plan. And Kasich heaps praise on the JobsOhio architect and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mark Kvamme (pronounced KWAH-me), who is working for $1 a year. Kasich refers to him as "The Great Kvamme" and introduces his presentations as "Kvamme Time." (Kasich moved Kvamme into a new position March 18 to avoid a legal challenge stemming from Kvamme’s out-of-state residency.) In his State of the State speech on March 8, Kasich said "Mark Kvamme just clawed back about $900,000 from companies that made promises and they didn't keep them." The governor’s claim about efforts to recoup money got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given that the state’s budget is tight as a drum. So we invested some time in his statement. Kasich is referring to state’s efforts to recoup portions of aid packages the Department of Development gives companies that agree to locate, expand or remain in the Buckeye State. The department, for example, just gave American Greetings a package of grants, loans and tax rebates worth a maximum $93.5 million over 15 years. Like any deal, this one has strings. American Greetings promises to stay in Ohio and keep the equivalent of 1,750 full-time jobs at its headquarters. If the card maker falls short, the state can recoup a portion of its aid package. "We're not going to give taxpayers' money to people who are not going to keep their promise," Kasich said during his speech. "We're going after the money. That's the way it ought to be." When Kvamme started in January, he sent out what the department informally refers to as "clawback" notices to 11 companies that received state aid but haven’t lived up to their end of the deal. Specifically, Kvamme is trying to recoup from these companies all or portions of "rapid outreach grants," which are used for infrastructure improvements, including water, sewer, road, and rail improvements on or near a company’s property. The state is after a total of $900,312. Leedsworld Inc. of Warren, which makes promotional business products, received a $250,000 rapid outreach grant. But state is trying to clawback $162,875 from the company, which fell short of its job creation goal by 65 percent. The company is out of business. The state also wants back an entire rapid outreach grant worth $250,000 that went to Haden Prism, a paint shop in Toledo that worked with DaimlerChrysler. Haden Prism sought bankruptcy protection in federal court. So, with this background in mind, let’s circle back to Kasich’s State of the State claim and evaluate it on the Truth-Meter. Kasich said Kvamme "just clawed back about $900,000 from companies." We think the average listener would get the impression that the state has recouped $900,000 and not understand that Ohio has only begun an effort to chase a refund. Kvamme’s actions started a specific process that began with the notices he sent in January to those 11 companies. The distinction is important because not a penny of the $900,000 target is in hand and it’s difficult to predict how much the state might ever recover. For example, Leedsworld went out of business in 2009 and Haden declared bankruptcy in 2006, making it challenge for the state to get money from either company. At the moment, the Department of Development does not have a statistic to reflect its success rate in recovering money. Department spokewoman Bethany McCorkle said that because of the individual nature of each deal and company, the department can’t predict how much money it can recover or when. In interviews, Kvamme has been more precise than Kasich on the clawbacks, specifying the state is just beginning to chase the money. He also makes the larger point that the new administration is trying to be more aggressive than past ones in recouping money. But it was Kasich who delivered the State of the State address and the clawback claim. His words -- "just clawed back about $900,000" -- do contain some element of truth. And we’re assuming here that he’s referring to the specific process by which the state sends clawback notices to companies that have not lived up to their agreements. But Kasich spoke in the past tense, as if it was a completed action. And he gave no hint that the process just underway with no guarantee of what can be recovered. Those details might have lessened the dramatic flair of his address, but are important for the listener to fully understand his statement. On the Truth-O-Meter we rate his claim as Half True.

pomt-02854	Says the number of Democrats who voted for the GOP measure allowing health plan renewals is close to the number who voted on GOP bills to delay mandates on employers and individuals.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/17/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-39-democrats-who-joined-gop-bill/	David Gregory opened NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday with a pointed question for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi about a "crisis of confidence" among Democrats in President Barack Obama. "Has it reached a point where Democrats don’t believe the president can pull this off and can make Obamacare work?" Gregory asked. Two days before the show, 39 House Democrats joined Republicans to pass the Keep Your Health Plan Act, which would allow insurers to continue to offer individual market health insurance policies that do not meet the standards of the health care law through 2014. It would also allow insurance companies to sell the plans to new customers. The bill passed 261-157. Obama announced a narrower "fix" a day earlier, letting insurers offer plans to existing policyholders through 2014 if state insurance regulators allow it. The White House said Obama would veto the House proposal. Pelosi said the Democratic defections on that bill weren’t as remarkable as D.C. watchers made them out to be. "No, I remind you that 39 voted for this resolution the other day. The number has been in the 30s when it was to agree with them on the mandate for businesses, the mandate for individuals," Pelosi said, "so this is approximately the same number." It’s clear from Pelosi’s statement she was not talking about the more than 40 House votes to repeal or gut Obamacare, which have not attracted sizable Democratic support. She isolated two votes on two measures: one to delay the health care law’s employer mandate, and another to delay the individual mandate. We wanted to know if she was right that the number of Democratic votes on those measures was about the same as the Friday, Nov. 15 vote. Back in July, the Obama administration announced it would postpone until 2015 the part of the law requiring larger employers to offer health insurance coverage to employees or face fines. A Treasury Department blog post cited "concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively." House Republicans, some peeved Obama did this without going through Congress, eyed a new, populist anti-Obamacare strategy. They figured they could earn more Democratic votes by tying a bill that would codify the delay for big employers, since Obama already okayed it. They also scheduled a vote to delay the individual mandate for everyday Americans. "Is it fair for the president of the United States to give American businesses an exemption from his health care law’s mandates without giving the same exemption to the rest of America? Hell no, it’s not fair," the New York Times quoted House Speaker John Boehner as telling House Republicans behind closed doors. On July 17, the House took two votes. The first, on the delay for the employer mandate, passed 264-161, with 35 Democratic yeas. The second vote on delaying the individual mandate was not as close to the vote on policy renewals. It passed 251-174, with 22 Democrats joining the Republican majority. We created a Google spreadsheet outlining which Democrats voted for the two July proposals and the proposal they just considered. Twenty-one House Democrats voted for all three measures: Ron Barrow (Ariz.), John Barrow (Ga.), Julia Brownley (Calif.), Cheri Bustos (Ill.), Bill Enyart (Ill.), Elizabeth Esty (Conn.), Pete Gallego (Texas), Joe Garcia (Fla.), Daniel Maffei (N.Y.), Sean Maloney (N.Y.), James Matheson (Utah), Mike McIntyre (N.C.), Patrick Murphy (Fla.), Williams Owens (N.Y.), Gary Peters (Mich.), Scott Peters (Calif.), Collin Peterson (Minn.), Nick Rahall (W.V.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Paul Schneider (Ill.), and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) When we noted the disparity to Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill, he said, "She was making the point that people have made these votes on this before." Pelosi does have a point about the Democratic votes on the employer mandate being close to the recent roll call on insurance policies, but she’s off on the vote to delay the individual mandate. That attracted only about half as much support from Democrats (22 versus 39). Her statement is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-01120	Says President Barack Obama got "a pass" over controversal remarks by Rev. Jeremiah Wright, while a 12-year-old speech by House Majority Whip Steve Scalise has blown up into a national story.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/06/newt-gingrich/gingrich-obama-got-pass-rev-wright-controversy/	News that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., allegedly gave a speech to a white supremacist group a dozen years ago is pulling attention away from the game plan Republicans had in mind as they take charge of Congress. While Scalise says he didn’t know the group’s ideology when he spoke about tax policy in 2002, some are calling on him to step down from his leadership post or resign altogether. Newt Gingrich, on the other hand, said the entire matter has been blown out of proportion. Speaking on CBS' Face the Nation Jan. 4, 2015, Gingrich compared Scalise's situation to what happened in 2008 when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama was confronted with his association with Rev. Jeremiah Wright. "The fact is, you have a president who for years went to a church whose pastor said stunningly hateful things about Americans," Gingrich said. "The president explains he didn't hear any of them. Okay? And we all gave him a pass. He gave a great speech in Philadelphia as a candidate. We said, okay, we got it." Gingrich went on to paint a picture of a "one-sided view of reality" where the left and its supporters ignore mistakes made by its allies but pounce on conservatives for similar trangressions. As for Scalise, Gingrich said, "To the best of our knowledge, (he) gave a speech on taxes 12 years ago. Now, for a 12-year-old speech to be blown up into a national story, I think, is frankly one more example of a one-sided view of reality." We wondered about Gingrich's description that Obama got "a pass" in the context that Scalise's problems have "blown up into a national story." We reached out to Gingrich through his production company to learn more and didn’t hear back. A Wright recap Obama credited Wright with introducing him to his Christian faith. Wright officiated Obama’s wedding to Michelle and baptized both of their children. The couple attended Trinity United Church of Christ where Wright preached. On March 8, 2008, ABC News aired a report that included excerpts of Wright’s sermons against racism. In the most controversial video, which was played on network and cable news, Wright exhorted blacks to reject the government that had treated them so badly. The government "wants us to sing ‘God Bless America.’ No, no, no, not ‘God Bless America.’ God damn America — that's in the Bible — for killing innocent people," Wright said. "God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America, as long as she tries to act like she is God, and she is supreme. The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent." Following the news reports, Obama called Wright’s views "completely unacceptable and inexcusable." Wright resigned from a committee of African-American clergy who supported Obama. The candidate continued to distance himself from Wright, but the story grew and on March 18, Obama delivered an extended speech on race in America at Independence Hall in Philadelphia (the speech referenced by Gingrich in his comments). The level of news coverage We used the Nexis news database to search for newspaper articles that mentioned Wright. In the week before the ABC News broadcast, Wright’s name appeared 15 times, most of them focused on whether his political work endangered his church’s tax status, or on his ties to Louis Farrakhan, the head of the Nation of Islam. After the ABC News story, the number skyrocketed, more than doubling every two days. By the time Obama spoke in Philadelphia, there had been over 250 stories and editorials in U.S. publications. On top of that, the topic was on every network and cable news channel. By the end of that month, the number of articles topped 2,000. This chart, which measures two-day periods in March 2008, shows how the story grew. Voter awareness According to polling by the Pew Research Center, Obama’s relationship with Wright dominated the news. Less than a week after the ABC News broadcast, Pew found that two-thirds of Americans said that they had heard at least a little about Wright’s inflammatory comments. In a follow-up survey after Obama’s speech on race, about half of the public said they had seen video of Wright’s sermons, and about half said they had watched Obama’s speech itself. It was far and away the most visible event of all the campaign coverage, with 85 percent of the public saying they had heard at least a little about it. Pew’s Project on Excellence in Journalism wrote at the time, "The high-risk Philadelphia speech came after several days of what one network correspondent described as Obama ‘damage control’ to try and counter political fallout from the Wright sermons." While the speech earned Obama much praise, the headlines a few days later show that it was hardly universally well received. The Buffalo News had "Wright's hate speech spurs serious questions." In Florida, the Naples Daily News wrote, "Obama's disavowal of minister's anti-America rant unbelievable." The Charleston Daily Mail said, "Obama's denials just don't ring true." Our ruling Gingrich claimed Obama got a pass on his association with the controversial Wright, while saying a 12-year-old speech by Scalise has blown up into a national story. You can argue that the Wright controversy didn't sway the majority of people's opinions about Obama -- he won election in 2008 and 2012 -- but it's wrong to claim the Wright story wasn't covered the way Scalise's troubles have made national news. In the days after ABC News first reported the Wright-Obama connection in 2008, the story littered print and TV media. Meanwhile, a poll found that 85 percent of Americans had at least some knowledge of the matter. We rate Gingrich's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b79b98c-ed32-4f7d-a253-c76c37556f86 Help fund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.

pomt-02233	"The big Wall Street banks, the big corporations" give "many times more" political donations to Democrats than Republicans.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/16/jim-demint/not-many-times-more-democrats-sometimes-do-raise-m/	When Politico Magazine ran an article about Jim DeMint, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, it posed this question with its headline: "Is Jim DeMint the Most Hated Man in Washington?" The former U.S. senator from South Carolina, according to the article, had made a sport of bashing fellow Republicans. Four days later, on March 7, 2014, conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes asked the same question of DeMint during an interview on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee. DeMint called the label a badge of honor. And when the conversation turned to connections between the federal government and big business, he contradicted conventional political wisdom. "The big Wall Street banks, the big corporations," DeMint asserted, give "many times more" in political contributions to Democrats than Republicans. The "many times more" made us curious. DeMint's take Here's the part of the interview where DeMint made his statement. Sykes: "It’s an interesting point when we talk about the crony capitalism, because I think that the Left would like people to believe that somehow that big government is a rival to big business. And your point is, no, in fact, big business likes big government, big government likes big business and they conspire together against the little guy. "You are describing crony capitalism here. But isn’t this kind of a problem that conservatives and Republicans have faced -- that, particularly in 2012, the Left rather successfully characterized conservatives as the party of big business, as the party of that kind of crony capitalism. What do Republicans and conservatives need to do to shake that image?" DeMint: "Well, it’s so false. I mean, it amazed me while I was in Congress to see the big Wall Street banks, the big corporations -- they give more to Democrats, many times more, than they do to Republicans because the big government, and the more it grows, the more it advantages them." DeMint essentially made a present-tense claim, but he also referenced his time in Congress -- he served in the Senate from January 2005 until April 2013, when he left for the Heritage Foundation. We’ll also note that the context of his remarks were of all Washington, not just the House or Senate. So, we will evaluate contributions going back to 2005 to see if Democrats received "many more times" in political contributions than Republicans from both groups: Wall Street banks and corporations. DeMint’s evidence When we requested information to back the Wall Street banks part of DeMint’s claim, Heritage Foundation spokesman Jim Weidman cited several articles, most of which highlighted the fund-raising success of Barack Obama, both during his run as the Democratic presidential candidate in 2008 and his run for re-election in 2012. None of the articles, however, said that on the whole Democrats were raising several times as much money as Republicans in the financial sector. For the corporations part of DeMint’s claim, a 2008 article said that for the first time in a decade, corporations were spending more money to elect Democrats than Republicans. But again, no evidence that Democrats were collecting many times more in donations than Republicans. Some of the articles DeMint cited quoted figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which runs the OpenSecrets.org website to track political donations. The center is a widely quoted authority. Let’s see what they have. Digging into the data Here are breakdowns of the center’s data over the past five two-year election cycles, dating back to when DeMint first entered the U.S. Senate in 2005. Cycles begin with an odd-numbered year. So, the 2006 cycle encompasses 2005 and 2006, 2008 encompasses 2007 and 2008, etc. Wall Street, or Wall Street banks, are not a specific category of donors. But the center told us that people interested in political contributions from Wall Street typically look at three categories: securities and investment, hedge funds and commercial banks. Securities & Investment Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $42.3 million $37.1 million 2008 $100.5 million $74 million 2010 $49.1 million $50.8 million 2012 $59.3 million $130.9 million 2014 $17.6 million $30 million So, in securities and investment, Democrats led Republicans in two of the five cycles, but Republicans led in the three most recent cycles. And the largest margin for Democrats was 58 percent to 42 percent in 2008 -- nowhere near the "many times more" DeMint claimed. The largest for Republicans was 69 percent to 31 percent in 2012. Hedge Funds Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $4.17 million $1.44 million 2008 $13.3 million $6.6 million 2010 $5.88 million $6.4 million 2012 $4.06 million $12.5 million 2014 $1.75 million $3.69 million In hedge funds, Democrats did have nearly a 3-to-1 advantage -- 74 percent to 25 percent in 2006. But that is just one cycle, dating back eight years. As in the much larger securities and investment category, Republicans led in the three most recent cycles. The Republicans’ best margin was 75 percent to 25 percent in 2012. Commercial Banks Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $9.91 million $15.8 million 2008 $18.5 million $19.9 million 2010 $8.28 million $13.6 million 2012 $10.7 million $26.4 million 2014 3.3 million $7.63 million Democrats didn’t lead in the commercial banks category in any of the five election cycles. As for calculating corporation money, that is more complicated. The broadest classification of political donors separates them into business, labor, or ideological interests. according to the Center for Responsive Politics. "Business" contributions from individuals are based on the donor's occupation/employer. Since nearly everyone works for someone, and since union affiliation is not listed on FEC reports, totals for business are somewhat overstated, while labor is understated. Still, the base of large individual donors is predominantly made up of business executives and professionals. Contributions under $200 are not included in these numbers, as they are not itemized. Here’s a breakdown for total business contributions -- from individuals and political action committees: Business Election cycle Donations to Democrats Donations to Republicans 2006 $510.4 million $645.1 million 2008 $1.1 billion $917.4 million 2010 $654.6 million $632.1 million 2012 $883.4 million $1.27 billion 2014 $228.5 million $316.4 million There’s a similar pattern here, with Republicans leading in the two most recent election cycles and three of the five cycles overall. The Democrats’ best edge was 55 percent to 45 percent in 2008, far from even a 2-to-1 margin. The Republicans’ best advantage was 59 percent to 41 percent in 2012. Our rating DeMint said that the "big Wall Street banks, the big corporations" give "many times more" political donations to Democrats than Republicans and he referred to his time in the U.S. Senate from 2005 to 2013. Democrats raised nearly three times more than Republicans in one financial sector in one election cycle. But for the most part, when they led their margins were much smaller. And in recent cycles, Republicans have led in money from Wall Street and business. We rate DeMint’s statement False.

pomt-09773	Barack Obama and the Democrats have "proposed a tax for not having health insurance."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/28/republican-national-committee-republican/tax-not-having-insurance-health-reform/	The Republican National Committee launched a new ad attacking health care reform as a big tax increase. "Barack Obama and Democrats promise that health care reform will lower costs, but their plans deliver increased taxes," the ad says. It then lists several taxes it says the Obama plan will increase. Here we're checking the claim that "they've even proposed a tax for not having health insurance." The ad then flashes to video of Obama and George Stephanopoulos arguing over the meaning of the word tax on This Week with George Stephanopoulos , with Stephanopolous reading the dictionary definition. Obama said the measure is necessary to make sure that everyone takes responsibility for having health insurance. He also said that a tax penalty is not the same thing as raising people's taxes. The tax in the Democrats' bills won't affect anyone who has insurance. But if health care reform passes, it will be an issue for those who don't have insurance. The tax is the mechanism that Democrats want to use to prod people to get health coverage. If they fail to get insurance, they would have to pay it. We've studied the health reform proposals being considered in Congress right now, and the main Democratic versions propose a tax penalty on people who don't carry health insurance. Policymakers usually call this provision the "individual mandate." Among Democrats, there is much consensus that an individual mandate is needed to make sure everyone is covered, especially when coupled with other measures to make affordable coverage more widely available. Obama opposed the individual mandate when he was a candidate, but he has since changed his mind and now supports it, as long as it contains a hardship exemption for individuals who are truly unable to find affordable coverage. The proposals in Congress each handle the individual mandate differently. In the bills in the House of Representatives, a person who failed to get coverage would face a penalty of 2.5 percent of their modified adjusted gross income up to the cost of basic health insurance, as defined by the new national health insurance exchange. The House grants exemptions for dependents, religious objections and financial hardship. In the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee caps the penalty at $750. It exempts residents of states that don't establish health insurance exchanges, those for whom affordable coverage is not available, and those without coverage for fewer than 90 days. The Senate Finance Comittee specifies a tax penalty of $950 for an individual and a maximum penalty of $1,900 per family. The penalties are a little lower if the person's income is below 300 percent of the poverty level. People are exempt from the mandate if they live below the poverty level, if the lowest cost insurance exceeds 10 percent of their income, or if there is financial hardship or religious objections. We should note that the bills tend to leave the definitions of financial hardship up to other officials, such as the secretary of Health and Human Services. We're going to duck, for now, the question asked by Stephanopolous, about whether Obama is breaking his promise on raising taxes. If health reform passes, then we'll evaluate the mandate with respect to our Obameter campaign promises database . Promise No. 515, "No family making less than $250,000 will see 'any form of tax increase,'" is currently rated Compromise . The details for these mandates are very much a work in progress, and Congress will ultimately have to vote on one set of standards for the mandate. But all of the Democratic plans include the mandate, which is a tax penalty on those who don't have insurance. The RNC called it "a tax for not having health insurance," and there's no doubt that it is a form of tax. There are provisions for those who face hardship, but absent special circumstances, everyone will have to have coverage. We rate the RNC's statement True.

pomt-03356	"Private prison systems are calculating how many new beds (they will need) based on the ... number of third graders."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/jul/16/kathleen-ford/kathleen-ford-says-private-prisons-use-third-grade/	St. Petersburg, Fla. mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford said recently that among the top issues facing her city is the need for improving graduation rates. Ford offered a disturbing statistic to back up her point. "We know that our private prison systems are calculating how many new beds (they will need) based on the third grade, number of third graders, and that’s just wrong," said Ford, a former City Council member who is running for mayor for the third time. "And I think waiting until kids are ready for kindergarten to begin to intervene is too late." PolitiFact Florida plans on keeping an eye on St. Petersburg’s mayoral candidates ahead of this November’s election and thought Ford’s claim merited more scrutiny. In this case, Ford mangled an oft-repeated, inaccurate talking point about prisons using third grade reading scores to predict future bed needs. It has been wrongly cited by Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell, and opinion columnists for the Post and New York Times and debunked by FactCheck.org and the Washington Post. Ford went one step further by focusing on private prison operators and the number of third graders, not academic performance. Her claim is "nonsense," said Peter Leone, a University of Maryland education professor who specializes in behavioral disorders and school discipline. Leone was the director of the National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice, which during its operation from 1999 to 2006 produced a report touting that "at least one state" uses third-grade reading scores to project future prison bed needs. Leone told us the statement was made by a colleague "before he got the facts." "It is an urban legend that politicians like to trot out to claim that either the schools are failing or that we are not tough enough on crime," he said. We ran Ford’s words by two of the largest private prison operators in the country, Corrections Corporation of America, a Tennessee company that manages five prison facilities in Florida, and Management and Training Corporation, which manages one prison in Florida. Spokesmen for both companies denied Ford’s claim. Private prisons respond to inmate projections from the state government, so it would not make sense for them to do their own forecasting. "This is truly the urban myth that will not die," said CCA spokesman Steve Owen. Ford directed us to the spring 2012 newsletter of the Nevada Department of Corrections. The newsletter does not speak to her exact point, but it does mention children who do not read on grade level are more likely to dropout, use drugs or end up in prison. So many nonreaders wind up in jail that officials have found they can use the rate of illiteracy to help calculate future prison needs. Indiana’s former governor has stated that determining the number of new prisons to build is based, in part, on the number of second graders not reading at second-grade level. In California they plan how many jail cells they will build in the future by how many children are not reading on grade level by third grade. But neither Indiana nor California does what Nevada claims it does, officials at those states told us. Neither does Nevada. Mike Schmoker, an independent education consultant, made a similar claim in a 1999 Education Week article. He told us he could not verify the claim and does not make it any longer. Mike Tikkanen of Invisible Children, whose website and book use the statistic, said "no state today admits to it, nor have I been able to find those references." In Florida, the Office of Economic and Demographic Research estimates future inmate populations through a variety of factors, including historical trends using the state crime rate and the number of arrests and convictions. "Educational attainment is not one of them," said EDR director Amy Baker. Our ruling In making the case for focusing more on education, St. Petersburg mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford said, "We know that our private prison systems are calculating how many new beds (they will need) based on the third grade, number of third graders, and that’s just wrong." That’s a spin-off of an urban legend. Some of the largest private prison operators in the country say they get their estimates from the states. And the states tell us that what a third-grader does isn’t a factor. It’s certainly not happening in Florida, which is the only place St. Petersburg’s mayor might have some level of control.

pomt-02344	"Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/23/matt-damon/matt-damon-every-20-seconds-child-dies-because-the/	When we woke up Sunday morning to catch the political talk shows, we expected plenty of talk about Ukraine and the lost Malaysian airplane. We didn’t quite anticipate a conversation about clean water with Matt Damon. Or a startling statistic worth fact-checking. How do you like them apples? (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.) Damon appeared on ABC’s This Week to discuss the serious issue of clean water scarcity in developing countries, a plight he has personally sought to impact through the charity he co-founded, Water.org. "Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation," Damon said. "Every 20 seconds, three kids every minute somewhere on planet Earth. Not here. Our kids aren't going to die from diarrhea. That's just an inconvenience to us in the West. But it is a stark, terrifying reality to billions of people on the planet." One child dying every 20 seconds amounts to 4,320 deaths every day, or roughly 1.5 million deaths a year. It’s a jarring statistic, but is it accurate? We decided to investigate. We reached out to Water.org to see if they had source material to back up Damon’s stat. We didn’t hear back. But we did find the number on their website. There, the organization put the figure at one death every 21 seconds. Water.org cited research from UNICEF and the World Health Organization, and a report released by the two agencies in 2009. It paints a pretty stark picture of the issue. Due to poor sanitation conditions in much of the developing world, millions of people are risking their health virtually every time they take a sip of water. Infection in the intestinal tract from tainted water often leads to diarrhea, defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day. It can last days or weeks, and if persistent can cause death due to fluid loss. Young children are especially at risk because of their weaker immune systems. According to the report, there are 2.5 billion (yes, that’s billion with a "b") cases of diarrhea every year in children under the age of five. It’s the second leading cause of child deaths in the world after pneumonia, taking the lives "more young children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined," it says. Half the cases are in South Asia and Africa. Just how many lives does it take? The report put the total at 1.5 million. Water.org on their website acknowledged that this statistic – deaths from diarrhea among children under five – is the number they used to claim a death every 20 seconds. So that’s where the figure comes from. But it’s outdated, we found. The report came out in 2009, but it was referencing World Health Organization statistics from 2004. There has actually been considerable adavancement since then, in part because of an international effort to improve sanitation and hygiene awareness in developing countries. More recently, the World Health Organization has estimated deaths from diarrhea have fallen to about 760,000 a year, half of what it was less than a decade ago. UNICEF has cited the newer statistic as well, as does the Center for Disease Control in the United States. That would mean a child dies every 40 seconds from water-related illness. Still a harrowing statistic, but not quite what Damon said. Our ruling Damon said, "Every 20 seconds, a child dies because they lack access to clean water and sanitation." The Bourne series star appears to be using an outdated statistic in his ABC appearance that claimed 1.5 million deaths from diarrhea caused by tainted water. More recent reports put the number at about 760,000 deaths a year. That said, Damon is accurately highlighting a little-known problem to an American audience. The statement ignores subsequent improvements but does not give viewers a different impression of the seriousness of the issue. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01094	"The name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent" since the debut of 'House of Cards' on Netflix.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/12/matt-lauer/matt-lauer-says-name-frank-more-popular-after-kevi/	Hollywood red carpet interviews are reliably substance-free safe zones for fact-checkers, a rare opportunity to turn on the TV and turn off our ears for misleading claims. That’s what we thought, anyway, going into Sunday’s Golden Globes. We tuned in for the pre-show, with a beverage in one hand and our phone in the other. Our only care was coming up with snarky tweets about the rich and famous. Then Today host Matt Lauer had to go and kill our vibe with an apparently researched question for Kevin Spacey, who plays the conniving House Majority Whip Frank Underwood on Netflix’s House of Cards. "You know, we were sitting together at breakfast, and we saw a fact," Lauer said, ticking us off because now we had to put our beverage down and give him our full attention. "Do you know that the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent since this show debuted? What does that say about parents across America?" "Well," Spacey said, "if the parents also have last names that start with a ‘u,’ then, F.U. as initials has risen dramatically as well." "We are live, Kevin," Lauer said, fearing an expletive. "Where’s that seven-second delay when you need it?" joked co-host Savannah Guthrie. Spacey went on to have a pretty great night, winning his first Globe for Best Actor in a TV Series (Drama) for his role as Underwood. We still had work to do. We wanted to know if Lauer was for real about the name Frank taking a leap into popularity since the world was introduced to House of Cards (the third season premieres Feb. 27, 2015). What the numbers say We turned first to a super glamorous source: the Social Security Administration. The agency, which maintains a list of baby names going back to 1880, receives information on names from parents when they apply for a child’s Social Security number at his or her birth. Frank, a form of Francis as you would know from watching the show, used to be a really big name near the turn of the 20th century. From 1880 to 1892, it was the sixth-most popular name of U.S. males. It remained in the top 10 of baby names for boys until 1923, the year it started its long, slow slide to the 327th spot in 2013. The chart shows Frank was never more unpopular than in 2013, the same year subscription-based Netflix released the first season of House of Cards (Feb. 1, 2013, to be exact). The greater the ranking number, the lower the popularity of the name. Ranking of the male name Frank 2013 327 2012 319 2011 308 2010 302 2009 291 2008 278 2007 262 2006 246 2005 231 2004 230 2003 230 2002 216 2001 213 2000 208 1999 187 Source: Social Security Administration So Frank had become pretty unpopular before House of Cards started running. And now? This is where we have to introduce a major plot twist to this fact-check: The Social Security Administration has not yet released its 2014 data. The agency releases that information on the Friday before Mother’s Day in May. Without the last year’s data, we can’t discern if there was a possible increase -- much less what really drove it. We do, however, have an idea of what Lauer is talking about. BabyCenter.com, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is a popular pregnancy and parenting website that releases an annual Baby Names Survey and Top 100 Names list. The names list is based on 406,000 babies born in 2014 to mothers who are registered BabyCenter users. BabyCenter global editor in chief Linda Murray hailed 2014 as the "year of the binge-watching baby name" because of the influence of TV shows that about 20 percent of surveyed moms said had on their baby name choice. The press release doesn’t just single out Frank, which saw a 19-percent increase from the 352nd ranking to No. 297 among BabyCenter users, but also House of Cards characters Claire (Frank’s wife, up 14 percent), journalist Zoe (up 13 percent), and lobbyist Remy (up 11 percent). Another Netflix show, Orange is the New Black, inspired a rash of baby-naming after characters from its female-centric cast, including Galina (up 67 percent), Nicky (up 35 percent), Piper (up 28 percent) and Dayanara (up 19 percent), BabyCenter says. To be clear, these increases are just the percentage that the names moved up the list from the year before. The BabyCenter survey doesn’t include information on how many people named their children Frank (or any other name) year by year. The naming effect is similar for characters in the Shonda Rhimes-produced shows Scandal (Olivia), Grey’s Anatomy (Meredith) and How To Get Away with Murder (Annalise), BabyCenter said, as well as the movie Frozen and its star Elsa. Murray called the correlation between trending baby names and binge-worthy shows "undeniable." Other experts weigh in That doesn’t mean we should take the word of BabyCenter as gold. Some of its user-generated information mirrors federal name data, but there are discrepancies. BabyCenter’s most popular male name in 2013 was Jackson, and the federal winner was Noah. Sophia remained the most popular girl name according to both sources. For instance, the popularity of the name Frank varied pretty significantly when you compared BabyCenter and Social Security information from years past. (We looked so you didn’t have to.) Basically, experts say we need to wait for the Social Security Administration list to know for sure. It isn’t inconceivable that Frank or Francis is turning a corner after the popularity of House of Cards, said Laura Wattenberg, author of Baby Name Wizard and the website of the name. But it may also have to do with parents who want to honor Pope Francis (but don’t want to call their children Francis). "It’s hard for one use to really move the needle," Wattenberg said. "Frank has been so unpopular for so long that you could get what looks like a really big jump just from a couple dozen names." Echoing Social Security’s 2013 press release about hot baby names, Wattenberg said the reality is that "obscure" Spanish TV shows are more likely to have the hottest name of the year than a Netflix hit. In 2013, the girl’s name Daleyza, the name of a young woman’s character on the Spanish-language show Larrymania, increased in popularity by more than 3,000 places. Who would do this Then we got curious about the name Frank itself. As Lauer prodded, what does naming a child after the murderous, conniving character say about American parents? Parents are "desperate for fresh name ideas" these days, and are not choosy about the source, Wattenberg said. Gone are the days when all-American parents name their offspring in tribute to the new president. "They just want something that sounds fresh and creative," she said. "That includes villains, video game characters." Albert Mehrabian, professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA, wrote the books The Name Game and Baby Name Report Card based on his studies of the attractiveness of names. His studies aimed to capture the impressions left by names isolated from any other factor, such as appearance or personality. Participants in his studies were asked to imagine themselves meeting someone for the first time knowing just their first name, its spelling and the person’s gender. The participants gave numerical scores on a range of adjectives describing the name, and their responses were averaged and categorized into four areas that defined the name’s attractiveness -- ethical/caring, popular/fun, success and femininity/masculinity. The name Frank scored a 65 of 100 overall, doing really well in terms of giving a successful, ambitious impression but lacking substantially in ethics, Mehrabian said. (Sounds a lot like Spacey’s character, don’t you think?) The given name Francis, meanwhile, scores higher at 78 overall. The increase comes from the stronger impression of ethics and compassion for people named Francis, a score of 99 versus 22 for Frank. "So Frank, I would say, it’s a so-so name," Mehrabian said. "But it does have high implications of success." A spokeswoman for Lauer’s Today show did not get back to us. Our ruling Lauer asked Spacey if he knew that "the name Frank has risen in popularity by 20 percent" since the debut of House of Cards in 2013. Lauer seems to be referencing a 2014 press release from the website BabyCenter.com that played up the influence of Netflix shows on new children’s names.

pomt-08517	Arkansas Democratic congressional candidate Chad Causey "was a Washington, D.C. bureaucrat."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/06/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-blasts-arkansas-democratic-candidate-chad-cau/	The federal government is a convenient villain in many campaigns. But who can fairly be labeled a government bureaucrat? That's what we wondered as we watched an ad placed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans. The ad targets Chad Causey, a Democrat who is running to succeed the man who was until recently his boss -- retiring Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark. Here's the narration: "Washington, D.C. -- that's where Chad Causey lived and worked until very recently. He was a Washington, D.C., bureaucrat. Causey left the D.C. payroll and came straight to Arkansas to become a politician himself. Now guess who's helping fund Chad Causey's campaign? You guessed it - Washington, D.C., liberal labor unions and Nancy Pelosi's team. Remember, you can't spell Chad Causey without 'D.C.'" We were immediately struck by the ad's use of the term "bureaucrat." Could a former Congressional aide really be described as a bureaucrat? We first looked up Causey's background and found his government work has been exclusively in the legislative branch. According to an Associated Press biography, Causey was born in Jonesboro, Ark. He earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Arkansas and a law degree from Catholic University in Washington. He spent 10 years with Berry, from 2001 to 2010, until Berry announced his retirement, and Causey became a candidate to succeed him. During his time with Berry, Causey served as a field representative, a legislative assistant, legislative director and district director. Starting in 2006, he served as Berry's chief of staff. Now, let's go to the dictionaries. We first looked at the one sitting on our desk, Webster's New World Dictionary, third college edition. It defines "bureaucrat" as "an official in a bureaucracy, especially one who follows a routine in a mechanical, unimaginative way, insisting on proper forms, petty rules, etc." It defines "bureaucracy" as "the administration of government through departments and subdivisions managed by sets of appointed officials following an inflexible routine" or "the concentration of authority in a complex structure of administrative bureaus." We then turned to Safire's Political Dictionary, a trenchant glossary written by the late William Safire, the former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon and longtime New York Times columnist. It calls bureaucracy "administrative agencies of government ... manned for the most part by career personnel and characterized by rigid adherence to rules and established procedure; almost always used in a derogatory sense. ... King or president, mayor or mandarin, every ruler needs help running things. The first echelon below the top has typically been a kind of aristocracy, whether by appointment, heredity or election. Below that comes the civil service, or bureaucracy." To us, the discussion of "departments," "subdivisions," "administrative bureaus," "administrative agencies" and supreme leaders of various types sounds a lot more like the executive branch than Congress. Experts we spoke to agreed with us. "'Bureaucrat' is not an official term, but it is commonly applied to executive branch civil service employees, rather than to the staff of the legislative or judicial branches," said Senate historian Donald Ritchie. Stephen Hess, a scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution who once worked in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations, said he's "never heard a congressional staffer referred to as a bureaucrat." Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institue, agrees. "If one uses the technical definition of bureaucrat, ... it is someone appointed for a position because of his or her specific, technical qualifications, in a job that can be for a career," Ornstein said. "A congressional staff member, often appointed for reasons that have little to do with 'technical expertise' and in a job that can disappear every two years, would not meet that definition. A broader definition -- someone who is a cog in an organization -- could be stretched to fit, especially for a chief of staff. But the term here is being used not as a descriptive but as an epithet." Jock Friedly, whose website Legistorm was cited on screen as the source of the "bureaucrat" description, also objects. Legistorm is a database that allows users to look up publicly available information about Congressional staffers, including their salaries. "To call Chad Causey a ‘D.C. bureaucrat’ might mislead some viewers," Friedly said. "The term ‘bureaucrat’ is usually reserved for an official working for the executive branch, and often used derogatorily to imply someone devoted to enforcing proper procedures at the expense of sensible results. Instead, Causey worked for congressional offices, which are usually -- for better or worse -- much more entrepreneurial in their approach of focusing on results more than the process." In fact, two of the positions that Causey held -- field representative and district director -- are based in the lawmaker's home district, not in Washington. Serving as chief of staff, meanwhile, is a job based in D.C. that requires frequent travel to the district. The other two positions mentioned -- legislative assistant and legislative director -- typically are based in Washington. When we contacted the NRCC, a spokesman pointed us to two online dictionary entries. He pointed out that the Merriam-Webster site defines "bureaucrat" as "a member of a bureaucracy" and, in turn, "bureaucracy" as "a body of non-elective government officials." Meanwhile, the spokesman also cited "The Growth of Congressional Staffs," an academic paper published in 1975 in the Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science by Harrison W. Fox Jr. and Susan Webb Hammond. In the paper, the authors discuss the expanding size of Congress' personal, committee and related staff, calling it "a growing Congressional bureaucracy." But we don't think their passing use of the phrase "bureaucracy" justifies the NRCC's decision to use the word to describe Causey. (We wanted to ask Hammond, who's now retired from her job as a professor at American University, if she thought that was a valid justification for calling Causey a bureaucrat, but we were unable to reach her. We weren't able to track down Fox.) The NRCC does have a point that Causey has spent a lot of time in D.C., and specifically working for Congress, an institution that isn't so popular these days. (The RealClearPolitics average of recent congressional job approval polls shows 21 percent approval and 72 percent disapproval.) In general, we have no quarrel with candidates who try to portray their opponents as out of touch with constituents -- it's a venerable tradition in electoral politics. "It’s entirely fair to say he is a D.C. insider," said Friedly of Legistorm. "As a decade-long congressional staffer, he has played the political game from the inside for a lot longer than most staffers remain in that position. And, as someone with experience on the Appropriations Committee, Causey has had the potential for not-inconsiderable influence on how Washington spends taxpayer dollars." Even so, notwithstanding the NRCC's efforts to find scholarly precedent, we feel that being a Washington insider is not the same thing as being a "bureaucrat." And we agree with Ornstein that a legislative employee is not a bureaucrat. So we rate the statement False.

pomt-15155	"How do Jeb Bush and Donald Trump differ on immigration? Spoiler alert: They don't."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/28/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-jeb-bush-and-donald-trump-sha/	While Donald Trump and Jeb Bush have been arguing about immigration policy, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton says the competing Republican candidates actually hold the same views. "How do Jeb Bush and Donald Trump differ on immigration? Spoiler alert: They don't," her campaign wrote in an Aug. 25th tweet. That tweet included a campaign video released a day after Bush visited the border in McAllen, Texas. The video shows clips of Bush and Trump saying they would repeal President Barack Obama’s actions related to immigration, expressing concerns about "anchor babies" and calling for a path to legal status, not citizenship. "Don’t let the surface distract you," Clinton says. "Most of the other candidates are just Trump without the pizzazz or the hair." We won’t compare the personality (or hair) of Trump and Bush, but we will fact-check Clinton’s statement that the two candidates share the same views on immigration. Spoiler alert: the candidates’ statements on immigration policy cover a broad range of laws and topics and can’t be boiled down to a tweet or short video. While Bush and Trump agree in some areas, they have also shown sharp contrasts on immigration policy. Where Bush and Trump are similar Let’s look at the areas Clinton cited in her video as evidence that Bush and Trump overlap. Obama’s executive action: "I will immediately terminate President Obama’s illegal executive order on immigration," Trump said in his June 16 announcement. In his speech ,Trump didn’t make it clear if he was referring to Obama’s 2012 program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, or the 2014 program aimed at parents, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, or DAPA. In an interview on Meet the Press in August, Trump said he would rescind DACA but he wasn’t asked point blank about DAPA. Then, the video shows Fox News’ Sean Hannity asking Bush, "Would you repeal Obama’s executive amnesty?" and Bush replies "yes." Bush has said he would get rid of both DACA and DAPA, but a spokesman said he’d do that after after comprehensive immigration reform passed. Legal status: Trump told CNN’s Dana Bash that if elected his plan for illegal immigrants would be to "get the bad ones out." But he also called for having immigrants leave and then come back legally: "I would get people out, and I would have an expedited way of getting them back into the country, so they can be legal. Let them be legal. .... I love the idea of immigration, but it's got to be legal immigration." Here is the back-and-forth that followed about legal status: Bash: "When you say legal, do you mean legal status, or can they be eligible for citizenship?" Trump: "Legal status." Bash: "No citizenship?" Trump: "No citizenship. We will see. Later down the line, who knows what is going to happen, but legal status." Clinton’s video then shows Hannity summarizing Bush's position as "legal status, but not citizenship" and Bush replies "exactly." Bush told Hannity that his plan as outlined in his book calls for earned legal status and "over an extended period of time, you earn legal status." If we compare recent statements, Trump and Bush agree on providing legal status to certain immigrants and not citizenship, but that was not always the case with Bush, because at times in the past he expressed support for path to citizenship. Anchor babies: "I’ll use the word anchor baby," Trump said Aug. 20. Then Clinton’s video cuts to an interview in which Bush on Aug. 19 called for "better enforcement so that you don't have these, you know, 'anchor babies,' as they're described, coming into the country." In another clip Bush defends his use of the term "anchor babies" -- a term some immigration activists find offensive. Asked by a reporter about using the term Bush said, "No, I don’t regret it. Do you have a better term?" So both have used the term "anchor babies." The Clinton campaign told us the tweet on Trump and Bush agreeing referred only to these areas. But we found many other specifics where Trump and Bush didn't agree that were not mentioned in the video, and that makes the tweet misleading. Where Bush and Trump are different We asked spokespersons for the Bush and Trump campaign to cite areas where they differ on immigration policy but did not get a reply from Trump’s campaign. Here’s a few key examples of where they differ: Mass deportations: Trump has called for mass deportations. He said on The O’Reilly Factor on Aug. 24: " If I’m elected, they’re going to be out of here day one. We’re going to get them the hell out of our country. They’re going to be out so fast your head will spin." Bush has repeatedly said that mass deportation is an unrealistic solution. On his campaign website Bush said it would cost as much as $600 billion, would step on civil liberties and is "a border plan that could be best described as a fantasy." A wall between Mexico and the United States: Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall between the two countries and impound remittances which Bush says is unrealistic. "So who is going to decide who is legally remitting money back to their families in other countries? Are we going to go door-by-door and just do this? It’s just not practical at all," Bush said at a town hall in Englewood, Colo., on Aug. 25. Birthright citizenship: Trump calls for ending birthright citizenship and argues that it could be done despite the 14th amendment. Bush defended birthright citizenship. "That’s a constitutional right. Mr. Trump can say that he’s for this because people are frustrated that it’s abused. But we ought to fix the problem rather than take away rights that are constitutionally in doubt," Bush told CBS’ Major Garrett on Aug. 18. Rhetoric: Trump has made some statements about immigration that Bush has criticized, including Trump’s comments about Mexicans: "They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people" Trump said. Bush has said such rhetoric is "way out of the mainstream and "To make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this." Our ruling Clinton said, "How do Jeb Bush and Donald Trump differ on immigration? Spoiler alert: They don't." Bush and Trump agree in some areas, including getting rid of Obama’s executive action. Both also call for a pathway to legal status and not citizenship, although Bush in the past has spoken in favor of citizenship. But in many other areas they disagree. Trump calls for mass deportation, ending birthright citizenship and building a wall between Mexico and the United States, all major policy changes that Bush has denounced. Clinton’s overall message here that there is no daylight between Bush and Trump is misleading, although there is a kernel of truth here in that they overlap a few immigration policies. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-28T14:35:19	2015-08-25	['Jeb_Bush']
pomt-08084	The Democrats' health care reform law is a "government takeover of health care."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/16/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-calls-health-care-reform-law-governmen/	Among the chorus of conservatives lauding a Virginia federal court ruling last week that declared a piece of the health care reform law unconstitutional was Congressman-elect Robert Hurt. Hurt, R-5th, hailed U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson’s decision as "a step in the right direction to preserving and protecting our Constitutional liberties and putting a stop to an overreaching federal government." He added: "I fully support Attorney General Cuccinelli and his efforts in challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate provision in the health care legislation, and I look forward to working to repeal and defund the government takeover of health care in the 112th Congress." Hurt is certainly not the first to label health care reform a "government takeover," but he’s the first PolitiFact Virginia has had occasion to check on the claim. And he’s wrong. As previous national PolitiFact checks have shown, no matter how you look at it, the legislation cannot reasonably be considered a government takeover. The government will not take over hospitals or other privately-run health care businesses. Doctors will not become government employees, like in Britain. And the U.S. government intends to help people buy insurance from private insurance companies, not pay all the bills like the single-payer system in Canada. The legislation is, in fact, designed to set up new systems to encourage private health insurance companies to provide more coverage and better services. That coverage would be paid for the same way it is now -- by private employers and individual premiums. That's not a government takeover. The key parts of the current U.S. system -- employer-provided insurance, Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor -- would stay in place. The government has been running those programs for decades.The law would create health insurance exchanges for people who have to buy coverage on their own, so they could more easily compare plans and prices. The biggest new element in the plan is a health care exchange that is supposed to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now -- people who are self-employed or work for small companies. The government (or the states) would create the exchanges, which would be virtual marketplaces where people could shop for the best coverage. One component that would have lent a small measure of credibility to Hurt’s claim -- the public option -- was stripped from health care legislation in the Senate. The public option would have required a government-run insurance program, which many conservatives said would have grown the government's role. The other element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the law, Medicaid is enlarged to cover anyone at or below 133 percent of poverty level, which would not include undocumented workers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that will add 16 million new people to Medicaid on top of the roughly 60 million now in it. But that certainly doesn’t make it a "government takeover." "It does increase government regulation of the health insurance industry and public funding for health care for lower and middle income uninsured Americans," said Timothy Jost, a health law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. "It does not create a government insurance program, however, and has little impact on health care delivery. ‘Government takeover’ is simply political rhetoric." In summary, yes, government regulation of the existing system increases under the new legislation. More people will be insured. The government will create exchanges to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now. Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor, will be expanded. But it is not, as Hurt says, a government-run plan. The public option, which would have added a government-run plan to the mix, was dropped from the bill. Coverage would be paid for the same way it is now, by private employers and individual premiums. The claim is False.

pomt-15142	"The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/01/rick-santorum/santorum-cites-flawed-climate-change-figure-and-mi/	Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum sparred with liberal talk show host Bill Maher on a topic near and dear to both men’s hearts for different reasons: climate change. Maher kicked off the debate by naming climate change as one of his main concerns for the 2016 election and challenged Santorum’s skepticism. Santorum, who has repeatedly called climate change "a hoax," shot back by arguing that there really isn’t scientific consensus. "I’m not alone," Santorum said on Maher’s Aug. 28 HBO show. "The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2." Santorum, pressed by an incredulous Maher, repeated the claim: "There was a survey done of 1,800 scientists, and 57 percent said they don’t buy off on the idea that CO2 is the knob that’s turning the climate. There’s hundreds of reasons the climate’s changed." "Rick, I don’t know what ass you’re pulling that out of," Maher retorted. "I’m not! I’ll send you the survey," Santorum promised. Several readers wrote to us asking about Santorum’s numbers, so we asked his campaign to send us the survey as well. They didn’t get back to us, but we did find the figure. In short, Santorum’s claim commits "two orders of mischaracterization," said Anthony Leiserowitz, who studies climate change public opinion at Yale University. He not only uses a flawed statistic, but also misstates what it’s allegedly disapproving. Santorum’s sloppy reading To begin with, Santorum inaccurately describes the "idea" that he says 57 percent of scientists "don’t agree with." What he’s referring to is a finding by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its fifth report. The IPCC has said it is "extremely likely" (meaning a 95 percent confidence level) that humans are causing climate change. The IPCC also said it is "very likely" (meaning a 90 percent confidence level) that greenhouses gases are the driver. Santorum restated IPCC points wrong. They never said 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2. In fact, no one has ever made that statement, according to Leiserowitz. "There are several other greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor, as a amplifier. CO2 is the most important of these and others, but no one to my knowledge has ever claimed that CO2 caused 95 percent of the warming," he said. The closest IPCC comes to what Santorum claimed is saying that there’s a 90 percent chance that greenhouse gases are driving climate. That’s a far cry from what Santorum actually said. Even still, the 57 percent figure doesn’t hold up. Fuzzy math The figure likely comes from the blog Fabius Maximus (and repeated by the prominent climate change skeptic Joanne Nova), which re-analyzed the findings of a 2014 survey by the Dutch environmental research agency PBL. According to Fabius Maximus editor Larry Kummer, the survey’s findings disprove the IPCC's confidence level finding. He walked us through how he got the 57 percent: 1. About 65.9 percent of scientists said they agreed that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change. 2. Of those scientists, 65.2 percent reported "virtually certain" or it was "extremely likely" that their estimate was correct (corresponding to a 95 percent or higher confidence level). 3. That means, according to Kummer, about 43 percent (65.2 percent of 65.9 percent) were extremely confident that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change. In other words, 57 percent weren’t 95 percent confident. We ran Kummer’s analysis by a few experts, including the survey authors themselves, who said his interpretation is flat-out wrong. The survey’s lead author, Bart Verheggen, told us that Kummer — and, by extension, Santorum — made a few mistakes. First, 22 percent of climate scientists surveyed didn’t directly answer a question as to what extent greenhouse gases were causing climate change, says Verheggen. Verheggen said it would be more accurate to consider only those who answered the question. (He goes into more detail in a blog post.) Second, Kummer only counts scientists who were 95 percent or more confident that greenhouse gases drive climate change, when the actual IPCC statement reports a 90 percent certainty, Verheggen pointed out. "Basically, Santorum’s claim is not consistent with the results from our survey," Verheggen concluded. "This is like something out of that book, How to Lie With Statistics," said Stephen Farnsworth, who studies climate change and political communication at the University of Mary Washington. "What we’re talking about here is extraordinary cherry-picking. You’re only counting one question in one survey, and you’re talking about a very high (confidence level). Once you start stacking up numbers like this, you’re really distorting the real finding of this research." What the survey (and others) actually say The real finding of the survey actually backs the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, despite varying levels of confidence, said Verheggen. "It is clear from our survey that a strong majority of scientists agree that greenhouse gases originating from human activity are the dominant cause of recent warming," he said. That’s consistent with most of the literature on scientific opinion about climate change, experts agreed. "You don't get anywhere near 57 percent when surveying the broad earth science community, and you get very close to full consensus when you ask the experts in climate science," said Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. National Science Board member James Powell surveyed what’s actually published in scientific journals, finding that the consensus in the literature is about 99.9 percent. And multiple independent studies have "asked scientists directly" and found consensus levels of around 97 percent, said William Anderegg, who studies climate change at Princeton University. "Those studies were rigorously peer-reviewed and thus should be considered more credible than a blog post that misreads an institute report," he said. Our ruling Santorum said, "The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2." He’s not pulling the numbers out of thin air, as Maher suggests more bluntly, but the claim is inaccurate and misleading. Essentially, Santorum garbles a blog’s textbook misinterpretation of a survey. In reality, the survey actually supports the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, the lead author told us. We rate Santorum’s claim False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2015-09-01T17:26:18	2015-08-28	['None']
pomt-13114	Says Donald Trump "wants to undo marriage equality."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-wants-undo-marri/	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump in a campaign speech of wanting to reverse the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage. During a Nov. 2, 2016, rally in Las Vegas, Clinton gave a laundry list of ideals she said Donald Trump opposed, including equal rights for LGBTQ members. "If you care about LGBT rights, he wants to undo marriage equality," she said of the Republican presidential candidate. She repeated the claim hours later at a rally in Tempe, Ariz. Trump has spoken out against marriage equality before, but we wondered if he still held that view. While he’s said gays and lesbians deserve protection under the law, he has also said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would want to overturn the law. ‘I am for traditional marriage’ The first indication of Trump’s feelings on same-sex marriage go back to an interview in The Advocate in 2000, when Trump was allegedly considering running for president. "I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman," Trump said. He added that he favored a domestic partnership law that would give same-sex couples the same legal benefits as married couples. (He voiced support for Elton John’s 2005 civil union with David Furnish in a post on his now-defunct Trump University blog, however.) More than a decade later, in a March 2011 interview as he mulled a presidential run, Trump told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly that he was against marriage equality. "I just don't feel good about it," Trump said. "I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage." Two years later, Trump hedged a bit: "I think I’m evolving, and I think I’m a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage. I am for traditional marriage, I am for a marriage between a man and a woman," he told MSNBC in 2013. Then Trump announced he really was running for president on June 16, 2015, and he quickly reiterated he didn’t support marriage equality. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling came out on June 26, Trump tweeted, "Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!" Two days later, Trump told CNN’s Jake Tapper on CNN that he was "just for traditional marriage." Trump said the next month that he thought pushing a constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage would not be a realistic approach. But by October 2015, he began to indicate that he would seek to overturn the Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. "We have some very terrible Supreme Court justices, and frankly, they should have at least had that as a state's right issue," he told CBN News. He also said he considered the ruling the law now. He told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on Jan. 31, 2016, that he disagreed with the court’s 5-4 decision. "If I'm elected, I would be very strong on putting certain judges on the bench that I think maybe could change things," Trump said. "They have ruled on it. I wish that it was done by the state. I don't like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court from the standpoint they should have given the state — it should be a states' rights issue. And that's the way it should have been ruled on, Chris, not the way they did it." Looking for a concise answer, Wallace asked Trump if he would "try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage." "I could strongly consider that, yes," Trump said. His position didn’t change during the litany of GOP primary debates, although he hasn’t strongly reiterated how he wanted to appoint judges who would reverse the decision. In March 2016, he said at a Detroit debate that he agreed with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s opposition to the ruling. "I would certainly have rather left it to the states," Trump said. "I was very surprised when they came up with that decision. I would preferred it had been left to the states, and I think most people would have preferred that." Since then, Trump has said little about same-sex marriage. Trump's campaign didn't respond to our request for comment, and Clinton's spokesman didn't add any further comment. His stump speeches tend to avoid same-sex marriage, and we couldn’t find any instance of a traditional media outlet directly asking him about it since the debates. When the GOP unveiled its party platform during this summer’s Republican National Convention, which urged the reversal of "the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage," Trump’s influence was downplayed. Trump "has not really tried to weigh in on the platform," Wyoming Sen. John Barasso, the platform committee chairman, told NPR in July. Our ruling Clinton said Trump "wants to undo marriage equality." While he’s waffled slightly at times, Trump has said repeatedly that he supported "traditional marriage." He also has said he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices that would reverse the 2015 ruling allowing same-sex marriage. He has not said much on the subject in recent months, other than to reiterate he felt it should have been a state-level decision. But he has not recanted his earlier views, either.

The rambling quote admonishes essentially anyone who mistreats, objectifies, ignores, takes advantage of or otherwise abuses someone else: "I cannot be part of a world where men dress their wives as prostitutes by showing everything that should be cherished," the diatribe began. "Where there is no concept of honor and dignity, and one can only rely on those when they say ‘I promise.’ Where women do not want children, and men don’t want a family. Where the suckers believe themselves to be successful behind the wheel of their fathers’ cars, and a father who has a little bit of power is trying to prove to you that you’re a nobody." And on and on; In other words, be excellent to each other. You can read it all for yourself, but we first saw the quote in an April 26, 2017, post on BestThings.us. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fabricated news. The same quote has appeared on several other websites, going back to 2016, always attributed to Reeves. It even appeared on an English-language Pakistani newspaper’s website. We also found the quote attributed to him in a Russian-language video that appears to show him saying it (we used the translated captions) — but it actually shows him talking about a Paul Gauguin exhibit in Switzerland. Another video example used a computerized voice to recite the quote. It’s also appeared on Facebook. And we mean, it’s appeared all over Facebook, again credited to Reeves. But while that seems like a deep message from the guy who played John Wick, we can’t find any record of Reeves saying it. As best we can tell, the quote’s association with Reeves came from a Facebook fan page called "Keanu Reeves - the actor." The page posted the quote, wherever they got it from, on Feb. 21, 2016. The page’s About section said Reeves was allowed to post on the page or moderate as he saw fit. There was no contact information. But Reeves’ publicist, Cheryl Maisel of talent agency PMK-BNC, said the actor had no affiliation with the page. "Keanu does not participate in any form of social media," she said via email. "This Facebook page is fake." Maisel told us she had the entire fan page removed from Facebook. It wouldn’t be the first time a famous person was misquoted on the Internet, of course. And Reeves knows a little something about being on the Internet. But he wasn’t The One who made this protracted speech. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-13788	"[Hillary Clinton]'s not trusted -- virtually at all."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/20/tom-marino/pa-congressmans-claim-hillary-clinton-trusted-virt/	Hillary Clinton has long had trust issues -- as in, voters tell pollsters her perceived lack of honesty is one of the reasons they’d avoid casting a vote for her. Her general election opponent Donald Trump has taken advantage of it and branded her "Crooked Hillary," whether it’s true or not. But how severe are Clinton’s trust issues? For Congressman Tom Marino, one of Trump’s biggest backers in Pennsylvania, it’s apparently an all or nothing proposition -- almost no one trusts her, if what he said Monday during a Pennsylvania GOP breakfast at the Republican National Convention is any indication. "Secretary Clinton has so much baggage that the luggage industry could name a line of suitcases after her," Marino, R-10th District, said during the breakfast, according to PennLive. "She's not trusted -- virtually at all." Clinton has admitted that she has concerns that voters don’t think she’s honest. But the idea that she’s not trusted "virtually at all" seemed a little off. How do you measure trust? And is that number at or close to zero? Here’s what we could find. Believe it or not, lots of national and state polls ask voters about whether or not they perceive candidates to be honest or trustworthy, largely because it’s one of the character traits voters consider most. A Quinnipiac poll from late June showed 28 percent of voters said honesty and trustworthiness was the most important character trait, the highest rate of any trait including integrity and leadership. And though more voters roundly trust Clinton over Trump in areas like foreign policy and leadership experience, they don’t trust her as a person as much as they do him. A poll commissioned by the Washington Post and ABC in March found only 37 percent of voters found Clinton to be honest and trustworthy. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll from June showed 69 percent of voters were concerned Clinton had a reputation of dishonesty. And a CBS poll from around the same time 63 percent of voters found Clinton to be dishonest. These ratings are just a few points higher than Trump’s. And yes, Trump leads Clinton in the forthcoming category. Only a third of voters think Clinton says what she means while more than half of voters think Trump does. If, during his GOP breakfast speech, Marino was talking about Republicans trusting Clinton, he’s in luck: That Quinnipiac poll from late June shows just 6 percent of Republicans polled think Clinton is trustworthy. But Marino’s camp didn’t respond to a request for comment. Voter perception of Clinton’s trustworthiness started dwindling even during her days as First Lady following the Whitewater scandal, a fraud investigation into the real estate investments the Clintons made while Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas. Neither Clinton ever faced charges over it, but their close associates did. Today, the controversy over the email server she used while Secretary of State appears to be what’s contributing to voters’ lack of trust. That’s been compounded since FBI Director James Comey directly contradicted statements Clinton made about what was sent on the server during a press conference announcing that charges wouldn’t be filed against the presidential candidate. Michael Hagen, an associate professor at Temple University and a former director of the Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, said the email situation has had a substantial impact on the percentage of the electorate that regards her as dishonest and untrustworthy, driving those numbers up to about three in five voters. "There are even a number of Democrats who have reservations about her trustworthiness," Hagen said, noting that trustworthiness is "important to lots of folks, but it’s not the only thing that people are talking about or concerned about." Clinton’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. But she knows this is hurting her. She’s admitted that she has work to do to bring back voters in the "honesty" arena, but has also blamed decades of facing criticism from the right. "I take this seriously, as someone who is asking for your votes, and I personally know I have work to do on this point," she said during a talk in June, according to The Washington Post. "A lot of people tell pollsters they don't trust me. I don't like hearing that, and I've thought a lot about what's behind it… You know you hear 25 years worth of wild accusations, anyone could start to wonder." Whether they’re wild accusations or not, the big news that turns into scandals that revolve around Clinton seem to have a different effect on voters perception of trustworthiness compared to a steady drumbeat of criticism over statements made by Trump. While most of Clinton’s statements rated by PolitiFact have been True or Mostly True, the majority of Trump’s have been False or Pants on Fire. Hagen said scandal sticks in the minds of voters more than those daily stories criticizing Trump’s dishonesty. "Fact-checking stories appear inside newspapers," he said, "but scandals make front-page headlines." Our Ruling Marino said with regard to Clinton: "She's not trusted -- virtually at all." This is clearly hyperbole when it comes to all voters, but not far from the truth when looking at the polling of Republican voters. Clinton's admitted herself that she's struggled when it comes to voters trusting her, so the sentiment of this claim makes sense. Still, to say she’s not trusted "virtually at all" isn’t accurate. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Tom Marino	None	None	None	2016-07-20T08:51:53	2016-07-18	['None']
pomt-05133	"Gov. Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/22/david-plouffe/mitt-romney-said-he-would-veto-dream-act-says-davi/	Since President Barack Obama announced a new policy to suspend deportations for some young illegal immigrants, his campaign has been touting that policy and putting down his Republican rival, Mitt Romney. Obama adviser David Plouffe answered a question on Fox News Sunday on June 17, 2012, about why Hispanics should vote for Obama. "So, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants, and that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that," Plouffe said. "Gov. Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act. Gov. Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home. They ought to self deport. So, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust." We wanted to know if Romney specifically said he would veto the DREAM Act because we often find distortions when one campaign describes its opponent’s position. A little background: The DREAM Act is the federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, a bill proposed several times over the years but never passed. Generally speaking, it pertains to children brought to the U.S. illegally by parents or relatives. If the young people have stayed out of trouble and were in school or in the military, they would be allowed to move to a legal status and not be deported. The idea has been around since at least 2001, when a bipartisan bill was introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, though details of the bills have varied over the years. We should also note that the term "DREAM Act" has been applied to some state legislation that gives in-state tuition to young illegal immigrants who had been long-time state residents. In the context of this fact-check, though, the most applicable legislation is the federal DREAM Act of 2010. The bill wasn’t able to win the 60 votes needed for a full consideration, failing a cloture vote on Dec. 18, 2010. We went back to the archives of the Republican primary and soon found what Romney had to say about the DREAM Act. (We contacted the Romney campaign but didn’t hear back.) In 2011, the DREAM Act and other immigration issues were hotly debated topics in the Republican primary. Romney took a hard line on illegal immigration and attacked his primary opponents Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry on the issue. When asked about the DREAM Act in 2011, Romney said he would veto it, but he also said he supported part of the DREAM Act -- the part that allowed people who had served in the military to achieve legal status. Here’s Romney's answer to a voter on Dec. 31, 2011, in Le Mars, Iowa, who asked if he would veto the DREAM Act if Congress passed it: "The answer is yes. I’m delighted with the idea that people who come to this country and wish to serve in the military can be given a path to become permanent residents in this country. Those who serve in our military and fulfill those requirements, I respect and acknowledge that path. For those that come here illegally, the idea of giving them in-state tuition credits or other special benefits I find to be the contrary to the idea of a nation of law. If I’m the president of the United States I want to end illegal immigration so that we can protect legal immigration. I like legal immigration." (We should note that the DREAM Act did not automatically award in-state tuition to anyone, though some states have those laws on the books.) Romney recently repeated support for the military portion of the DREAM Act in remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando on June 21, 2012. However, Romney declined to say whether he would renew the executive policy of Obama. "Some people have asked if I will let stand the president's executive order. The answer is that I will put in place my own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the president's temporary measure," he said. He also criticized Obama for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform when there were Democratic majorities in the Congress: "For two years, this president had huge majorities in the House and Senate – he was free to pursue any policy he pleased. But he did nothing to advance a permanent fix for our broken immigration system. Nothing. Instead, he failed to act until facing a tough re-election and trying to secure your vote. … I think you deserve better." Our ruling Plouffe said, "Gov. Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act." Romney did say that, without equivocation, during the Republican primary. He has not indicated a change in that position. It’s worth pointing out, though, that Romney does support one element of the DREAM Act: allowing young illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children "to become permanent residents, and eventually citizens, by serving honorably in the United States military," according to a statement from the campaign. The DREAM Act, though, provided a path to legal status to young people who are in school, without serving in the military. We rate Plouffe’s statement True.

pomt-02531	"The CBO’s latest report confirms what Republicans have been saying for years now. Under Obamacare, millions of hardworking Americans will lose their jobs."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/07/eric-cantor/cantor-says-cbo-predicts-obamacare-will-cause-mill/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, says his description of Obamacare as a job killer has been validated by a new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Shortly after the study was released on Feb.4, Cantor issued a news release saying, "The CBO’s latest report confirms what Republicans have been saying for years now. Under Obamacare, millions of hardworking Americans will lose their jobs and those who keep them will see their hours and wages reduced." Cantor is hardly the only Republican to hail the report; House Speaker John Boehner tweeted that Obamacare is "expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs." Democrats replied that conservatives were misrepresenting the CBO’s projections. We looked at the CBO report to see if Cantor’s statement is accurate. The agency estimates that Obamacare will lead to a decline of about 2 million full-time equivalent workers in 2017, 2.3 million in 2021 and 2.5 million by 2024. Cantor suggests the CBO is saying businesses will eliminate existing jobs. But the report refers to employees who decide on their own to leave the workforce because of various Obamacare provisions. "The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor," the CBO says on pages 117-118 of the report. House Budget Committee Chairman. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., phrased the CBO’s findings correctly during a Feb. 5 hearing with CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf. "Just to understand this, it’s not that employers are laying people off, it’s that people aren’t working in the workforce, aren’t supplying labor, to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024 and as a result that lower workforce participation rate that less labor supplied lowers economic growth?" Ryan asked the CBO director. "Yes that’s right," Elmendorf responded. Because Obamacare allows people to get subsidies for health care coverage or find insurance outside of an employer setting, the CBO says some folks won’t feel the need to work as much to get health care benefits. Some lower-income workers who receive health care subsidies under Obamacare gradually will get lower federal subsidies as their incomes rise. That, the CBO said, will end up "discouraging work." Remember, the CBO is talking about a loss of full-time equivalent jobs. These job equivalents are of a lot of bits and pieces of work hours each week that people will chose to drop. Some people working several jobs, for example, will decide to cut back. Other provisions in the health care law will lower the cost of insurance plans offered to older workers outside the workplace, the CBO said, and that will cause some senior citizens to retire earlier. The report notes that under Obamacare, employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent workers must provide health care coverage to those working 30 hours or more a week. That, the CBO says, may cause some businesses to limit full-time hiring or put more part-time workers on the payroll. But, the CBO added, "there is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the ACA (Affordable Care Act)." The future impact of the employer mandate is still unclear, the CBO said, noting that it does not go into effect until next year. When we asked Cantor’s office for comment, press secretary Megan Whittemore emailed, "We stand by the assertion that millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Virginians will lose their jobs as a result of Obamacare..." She provided no reference to findings in the CBO report. Our ruling Cantor says the CBO confirmed a long-standing Republican talking point -- that millions of people would "lose their jobs" as a result of the health care reform. But the statement is misleading. The CBO projected the law will lead to 2.5 million fewer full time equivalent workers by 2024, but the report does not say that those legions will "lose their jobs." That implies the employees will be laid off or forced out of work. To the contrary, the report takes pains to note that virtually all of those people will be working less due to their own choices, such as opting to receive higher federal subsidies for care rather than working more to boost their wages. The CBO said it’s not projecting the law would cause a bump in unemployment or underemployment. The report does not paint a rosy picture of the economy and it can be easy to miss the distinction between people leaving jobs because they want to as opposed to being laid off. But Cantor’s statement is deeply flawed and we rate it Mostly False.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2014-02-07T15:33:02	2014-02-04	['United_States', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09820	"It took Obama six months to pick out a family dog," but he's "cramming health care reform down the country's throat in a fraction of that time."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/03/haley-barbour/barbour-claims-obama-took-longer-choose-dog-hes-gi/	Republicans have been complaining for weeks that President Barack Obama is trying to rush his health care reform bill through Congress. To make their point now, they've gone to the dogs. In an Aug. 13 op-ed in the Washington Examiner , Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour invoked Bo, the White House dog, to illustrate how quickly Obama has tried to pass the 1,000-page bill. Barbour, who chairs the Republican Governors Association and has been mentioned as a possible 2012 presidential contender, wrote, "It took Obama six months to pick out a family dog. Cramming health care reform down the country's throat in a fraction of that time scares people who have been told, accurately, the various bills contain a billion-dollar combination of tax increases and Medicare spending cuts." To judge whether Obama tried to pass the bill "in a fraction" of the time it took him to choose the Portuguese water dog requires examining the timeline for both the health care bill and the selection of Bo. And that's not as easy it might sound. We could choose various dates for the beginning of the dog selection. We could go as far back as Obama's mention of his dog promise in an interview with Men's Health magazine in August 2008, or as recently as his inauguration on Jan. 20, when he and his family moved into the White House. But we believe it's fair to say the process started with the Obama election night celebration on Nov. 4, 2008, when Obama declared that his daughters Sasha and Malia "have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House." It was at that point that speculation began in earnest about what kind of dog they might get. The end date for the puppy hunt is a little imprecise as well. According to the definitive Washington Post account of the dog search, Bo had a "clandestine White House visit in which he won over the Obama girls and their parents" some time in March or early April. Not knowing exactly when it took place, we'll date the end of the search on April 12, when word of the new pooch became breaking news. Total elapsed time: 160 days. That's a bit less than the six months Barbour cited, but we think it's a reasonable estimate and won't knock Barbour for being a bit off. Now, on to more serious matters: health care reform. Here too we face some choices about the start and end dates. We could go all the way back to May 29, 2007, when candidate Obama first unveiled a comprehensive health care proposal in Iowa. Or we could use March 5, 2009, when Obama invited lawmakers and industry leaders to the White House for a forum that included "breakout sessions" and a question-and-answer period to discuss the possible elements of health care legislation. Or we could use July 14, 2009, when House Democratic leaders formally introduced H.R. 3200, the massive bill that's still under discussion. After much internal discussion, we settled on March 5, the date of the forum. That was the point when the Obama administration signaled that health care reform was a key priority. Obama told participants that the forum was "the first discussion in this effort, but it was not the last." As for the end date, Democratic leaders and the White House tried to have the bills passed by the House and the Senate by the start of the August recess — July 31, 2009, for the House and Aug. 7, 2009, for the Senate. It didn't happen, but that seems to be what Barbour was referring to when he said Obama had tried to "cram" the legislation through. (Barbour's office did not respond to our request for more details.) If you start the clock on March 5 and stop it at Aug. 7, it works out to 156 days. That is just a smidgen less than the 160 days it took to find Bo, but it's very close, so it is a stretch to say, as Barbour did, that the health care effort took "a fraction" of the time it took to find a dog. A more favorable comparison from Barbour's perspective would be to start the clock with the introduction of the House bill on July 14. That would make the total duration of the debate a mere 25 days. Using those dates, Barbour would be right to call it a fraction of the 160-day-long dog search. However, choosing such a late start date strikes us as cherry-picking. The health care discussion among lawmakers, the media and the public was well under way by July 14, and the details of the bill had been swirling for weeks, even if they were not in legislative language yet. Ultimately, determining whether Barbour is right depends on which dates you choose. Let us propose an additional caveat, however. No one ever promised that a bill would be ready for the president to sign by the start of August recess. Even if the original goal was to have a bill through both chambers by then, it would still require a House-Senate conference committee to iron out what were sure to be significant differences. Once lawmakers managed to hammer out a consensus bill, both chambers would need time to debate the new measure, pass the bill individually, and send it on to the president. That would likely take several weeks. Given this reality, another conceivable ending date would actually be Oct. 30, 2009 — the target date for the House to adjourn. Using that as the end date, the duration of the health care debate would be 240 days (when starting with March 5, which would be much longer than picking the dog) or 109 days (when starting with July 14, or shorter than the dog selection but not really "a fraction."). So this is one where reasonable people can reach different conclusions. We examined three scenarios and found his claim is only right under the most extreme one — when you start the clock at the July introduction of the bill and stop it at the August recess. But under what we consider the most realistic scenario, starting with the March forum and ending with the October adjournment, Barbour is wrong. So we find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09479	"I left the city with $43 million in the bank."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/01/maurice-ferre/ferre-says-he-left-miami-43-million-bank/	Maurice Ferre, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, wants to convince voters that he will be a good steward of their tax dollars. He served as Miami's mayor from 1973 until he lost in 1985 and says that he left the city in good financial shape. That's notable because, these days, the city is plagued with budget shortfalls and under a federal investigation about its finances. In an interview posted on Newsmax's Web site Jan. 14, 2010, Ferre said: "I'm going to bring the common sense that I used when the city of Miami jumped from being a nothing type of city to being an important American city which is what it was when I left in 1985 and in those days I left the city of Miami with $43 million in the bank." Ferre may have kept the city's financial house in order, but his campaign couldn't get us the right numbers when we asked for proof. Campaign spokeswoman Melissa Agudelo said Feb. 22, "I am having difficulty finding the information from our sources. Maurice has them at a warehouse." She suggested that we call the city of Miami's archives. Things got more confused. In a brief interview with us Feb. 22, Ferre said he was referring to the city's fund balance -- which is government-speak for reserves -- and got the number wrong. "I think it was $34 million,'' Ferre said. "I made a mistake and inverted the numbers." We then got the "combined balance sheet" from the city which shows it ended the 1985 fiscal year with $14,371,267 in the general fund balance. We used that number because Diana Gomez, the city's current finance director, said that typically when people refer to reserves, they usually mean the general fund. "That is the main operating accounts of the city where operations come from," she said. There are other pots of reserves that are designated for special purposes -- for capital projects, for example. By combining all the reserve pots, the city ended that year with $106,905,252 in reserves. When we told Ferre that the city of Miami's financial statement showed about $14 million in general fund reserves, he said his campaign would continue to research the matter. We interviewed him again on Feb. 23, and he said he wasn't only referring to the general fund reserves. "I obviously made a mistake, didn't I? It was not the fund balance, I am trying to figure out and get the exact figure for you. .... How do you expect me to remember numbers 30 years later? I have someone down at City Hall trying to figure out those numbers. I accept I probably made a mistake when I said $43 million, I think I meant $34 million. The issue is not whether it was 34, 43, or 23, the issue is I left the city of Miami solvent." Ferre said that in the Newsmax interview he was referring to "the sum amount of money left in various accounts in the city of Miami that make up cash in the bank." We could do the math ourselves and combine various city accounts to get different sums, but given Ferre's conflicting explanations, we were as perplexed as he seemed to be. And there's more: The night of Feb. 24, Ferre again called us to offer a new analysis after he tracked down the same financial statement we got. Ferre then concluded the amount was more than his original claim of $43 million. Ferre said that "in the bank" refers to the section on the city's financial statement about "equity in pooled cash and investments." That adds up to more than $53 million -- Ferre did not include the money strictly set aside for capital projects. "I don't know where the hell I got the $43 million,'' Ferre said. "What I'm saying is banking and cash in hand funds were actually more than that." So almost a week after our first inquiry, Ferre and his campaign aides seem as confused as we are. Was it $43 million, $34 million, or now $53 million? He keeps changing his definitions -- and effectively moving the goal posts. So we'll dock him for his repeated lack of precision but acknowledge that his underlying point is right that he left the city in the black. We find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00078	"President Donald Trump even referred to one of (Kevin) Cramer’s health care repeal bills as 'mean' because the bill gutted protections for North Dakotans with preexisting conditions."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/01/heidi-heitkamp/did-donald-trump-call-republican-health-care-plan-/	As the midterm elections draw closer, Democrats are increasingly focusing their messages on affordable health care. Heidi Heitkamp, the incumbent Senator in North Dakota, has made her Republican opponent’s voting record on this issue one of her main talking-points. In a Bismarck Tribune op-ed published this week, Heitkamp argued that her opponent, U. S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, "looks at health care through a strictly political lens." Heitkamp attacked Cramer for voting for several bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, and wrote that "President Donald Trump even referred to one of Cramer’s health care repeal bills as 'mean' because the bill gutted protections for North Dakotans with preexisting conditions." Although Trump praised the American Health Care Act (AHCA), when it was passed in the House in May 2017, he later said that the Republican bill was "mean." The bill didn’t make it out of Congress. What Trump said about Trumpcare The American Health Care Act was passed by House Republicans on May 4, 2017, by a narrow majority of 217 to 213. We have analysed the AHCA, and found that it had the potential to allow insurers to set premiums based on the health status of an individual, making costs higher for consumers who are sicker. When the bill was passed in the House, Trump expressed his support of the Republican plan. "This is a great plan," Trump said in a White House announcement with House Republicans. "I actually think it will get better. And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and replace of Obamacare." However, in June 2017, the Associated Press reported that Trump told 15 Republican senators that the House bill was "mean, mean, mean," and that they needed to make the Senate version of the bill "more generous." On June 25, in an interview on "Fox and Friends", Trump was asked about about a Facebook post by former President Barack Obama, who criticised the GOP plan and said that the amendment made to the Senate bills would not change "the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation." Fox News’ Pete Hegseth told Trump that it was "unprecedented for a former president to come out the way President Obama has" and asked, "What do you say to the former president?" Trump responded by saying that Obama "actually used my term, mean. That was my term, because I want to see -- and I speak from the heart, that’s what I want to see -- I want to see a bill with heart." Shortly afterward, Trump said again that he was pleased with his party’s health care plan: "Honestly, nobody can be totally happy, even without the votes, forget about votes, this has nothing to do with votes. This has to do with picking a plan that everybody is going to like. I'd like to say love, but like. But we have a very good plan, we have a few people that are, I think you could say modestly, they're not standing on the rooftops and screaming. They want to get some points. I think they'll get some points." Our ruling Heitkamp said that a House bill to repeal Obamacare supported by Kevin Cramer was referred to as "mean" by President Donald Trump. Trump did say that the American Health Care Act, which was passed in the House on May 2017 and which Cramer voted for, was "mean." It’s worth pointing out that Trump also said the the Republican health plan was a "great plan." Trump didn't specifically say it was mean because of how it handled pre-existing conditions, but that was certainly one of the controversial aspects of the bill. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Heidi Heitkamp	None	None	None	2018-11-01T13:22:35	2018-10-28	['North_Dakota']

But House Speaker John Boehner says it's Republicans, not the Democratic administration, that are truly committed to achieving America’s energy independence through a diverse portfolio. In an op-ed for USA Today, Boehner said that Obama’s new carbon restrictions will hurt existing coal plants, while Democrats are standing in the way of House efforts to ease rules on excavating and exporting American natural gas. The White House is also blocking the Keystone XL pipeline, which Republicans — and some Democrats — continue to support. "The nearly six-year delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs and nearly a million barrels of oil a day," Boehner wrote. The House has passed a bill that would fast-track the pipeline. We’ve taken a number of looks at claims about the economic impact of the 1,179-mile Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries. But Boehner’s estimate of 100,000 jobs was so far above anything we’ve checked in the past, we wondered if new information had surfaced. We asked Boehner’s office for supporting evidence. They pointed us to the website of an August 2011 press release from TransCanada Corporation, the company jockeying to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The release says "independent studies" estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 direct jobs — 13,000 construction and 7,000 manufacturing — and "an additional 118,000 total spin-off jobs." We talked to TransCanada. At the time, they were referring to a study by the Perryman Group, a financial analysis firm they hired. But TransCanada spokesman Davis Sheremata told PolitiFact that the study is "no longer relevant." Why? "In this case, the referenced report dealt with Keystone XL as it was proposed in 2008," Sheremata said. "The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application." The Perryman Group analysis has been removed from TransCanada’s website and links to the study don’t work. There were other important caveats with the Perryman study even before it was discarded by TransCanada. Most notably, the 13,000 construction jobs the pipeline would supposedly create were calculated per person, per year. That means that if the job lasted two years, 6,500 people would be employed each year. A study by Cornell University Global Labor Institute into the Keystone pipeline also said that the Perryman Group report is "flawed" because it "wrongly includes over $1 billion in spending and over 10,000 person-years of employment for a section of the Keystone project in Kansas and Oklahoma that is not part of Keystone XL and has already been built." So Boehner was citing a 2011 study that was criticized and has since been scrubbed from the website of the people who commissioned it. But are there other credible estimates? The study most often cited is the analysis from the State Department, which is in charge of reviewing the Keystone XL pipeline for the administration. It found that the pipeline itself would directly create 3,900 construction jobs — 1,950 if the project took two years. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). When we asked TransCanada for a more recent study into the job creation potential of the Keystone pipeline, the company quoted figures from the State Department study. As we’ve noted in the past, though, most of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Finally, the Cornell study estimated the project would create about 2,500-4,500 construction jobs, and includes a total economic impact of about 33,000 to 44,000 jobs likely spread across multiple years. Meaning, it’s possible that 11,000 to 14,600 are employed each year if the project takes three years. We told Boehner’s office that TransCanada was no longer promoting the Perryman Group study. They then directed us to a 2011 study by the Canadian Energy Research Institute, a group that includes energy company executives, as well as government and academic representation, on its board of directors. The institute found that employment would go up in the United States by 80,000 jobs to a peak of 179,000 jobs. But those projections were over a 30-year period, and it includes jobs created by existing Canadian energy projects. Our ruling Boehner said Obama’s "delay in approving Keystone is costing Americans more than 100,000 jobs." He was citing a study that experts said was "flawed" and the company in charge of the project, TransCanada, said was "no longer relevant." The State Department estimated a much lower amount, and TransCanada cited that study to PolitiFact. We rate Boehner’s statement False.

pomt-13597	Says there was a "NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/paul-manafort/trump-campaign-chair-misquotes-russian-media-makes/	Donald Trump’s comments about "Second Amendment people" doing something to stop Hillary Clinton continued to dog his campaign in interviews on the Sunday news shows. But when CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper brought up Trump’s seeming inability to stay on message, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort insisted it’s the press who can’t lay off of Trump. "I mean, there's plenty of news to cover this week that I haven't seen covered," Manafort said Aug. 14. "You had the NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists. You had a number of things that were appropriate to this campaign, were part of what Mr. Trump has been talking about. ... Instead, you took an aside that the Clinton narrative told you was something, Mr. Trump told you he didn't mean, and you played it out for two days." We hadn’t seen the terrorist attack covered either and wondered if the media had neglected a major story in order to wax on about Trump’s comments. Indeed, reputable news outlets didn’t cover this story — because it didn’t happen as Manafort said. Manafort seems to be fumbling an errant story from Russian state media. The weekend of July 30, RT.com and Sputnik reported 7,000 armed police with heavy vehicles had surrounded Incirlik air base in Adana, Turkey, where 2,500 U.S. troops are stationed and some 50 U.S. nuclear weapons are stored. The two Kremlin-funded outlets suggested that the lockdown was in response to another coup attempt after a faction of the Turkish military failed to overthrow Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. So already Manafort is wrong about two key points: The incident occurred two weeks before Trump’s Second Amendment remarks and did not involve terrorists. What’s more, the Russian outlets’ reports were not exactly reliable. There were anti-U.S. demonstrations outside of Incirlik the night before the maneuver, but Turkish authorities said these were small and largely peaceful. They also dismissed speculation of a second coup and explained that police were conducting safety inspections in preparation for a top U.S. military official’s visit, according to Stars and Stripes and Bloomberg. "It does appear that RT and Sputnik exaggerated their stories. Perhaps Putin was attempting to inflame emotions between Turkey and America. Which is certainly believable," said the conservative blog Right Scoop. Granted, Incirlik’s stockpile of nuclear weapons has been a cause for concern, especially after the July 15 coup. Media reports have also documented how the internal Turkish struggle caused some logistical headaches for U.S. troops stationed at Incirlik (including, for example, power outages). But that’s a far cry from a terrorist attack that flew under the news radar. Officials at the Pentagon and NATO told us there have been no terrorist attacks at Incirlik or NATO’s Allied Central Command (LANDCOM) in Izmir, Turkey. The NATO official also pointed out that Incirlik is actually not a NATO base, though U.S. and Spanish troops are stationed there. Our ruling Manafort said there was a "NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists" the week Trump made his comments about "Second Amendment people." Russian media speculated that there was a second attempted coup at Incirlik air base in Turkey. That incident was exaggerated and occurred two weeks before Trump’s comments. Furthermore, though it houses NATO troops, Incirlik is not a NATO base. Neither Incirlik or NATO’s central headquarters in Izmir, Turkey, have been attacked by terrorists.

pomt-13095	Democrat Stephen Webber "voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/06/caleb-rowden/rowden-claim-webbers-votes-dont-account-bills-chan/	In October, Republican Caleb Rowden’s campaign uploaded a video to its YouTube channel attacking Democrat Stephen Webber for voting against a bill that would ban sex offenders from playgrounds and child care centers and from coaching children under the age of 17. The Missouri Republican Party also sent out mailers advertising the same claim. Webber "voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches," the video said. Rowden and Webber, both former state representatives, face each other in a battle to fill the 19th Senate District seat vacated by Kurt Schaefer, who couldn’t seek re-election because of term limits. The bill in question, Missouri House Bill 62 from 2009, was a lengthy crime bill that changed a number of laws. Among these were the introduction of laws banning child sex offenders from knowingly being within 500 feet of a public park with a playground or swimming pool, or from a child care facility when those under the age of 18 are present, and from serving as a coach, manager or athletic trainer for a sports team with children under 17 years of age. History of the bill Rowden is correct that Webber voted against the final version of this bill when it came back from the state Senate. But Webber voted in favor of the bill before the House sent it to the Senate. So what made him change his vote between April 16 and May 15, 2009? Webber’s campaign manager, Emily Waggoner, explained the reasoning in a phone interview. "Stephen voted for the original version of the bill that they’re talking about that prevents all those things from happening, and then it came back from the Senate with this weird exemption language allowing people to exempt themselves from sex offender registries. So he voted for the strongest version of that bill; it came back and it was a bill that had a new exemption in it and he refused to support a weaker version of that bill." So we took a look into the actual legislation to confirm these changes between the version of the bill that was sent to the Senate and final bill, and found that those changes did exist. The specific part the Webber campaign cites as the reason for voting against the final version of the bill is explained in the bill summary this way: "Allows an offender of certain misdemeanor sexual offenses to petition to exempt his or her name from the sexual offender registry if he or she meets current qualifications for the removal or exemption and was younger than 19 years of age at the time of the offense." This text did not exist in the summary of the bill prior to it going to the Senate. Webber wasn’t the only member of the House to change his vote after the bill came back from the Senate. The bill that was sent to the Senate was agreed to in the House by a margin of 141 to 9. The final version of the bill was passed in the House by a slightly tighter margin of 124 to 34. Our ruling Rowden said Webber "voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches." That’s a misleading version of events. Webber actually supported the House version of the legislation in question. But the bill was amended in the Senate to include a provision that allowed some sexual offenders to have their names removed from the sexual offender registry. Webber opposed that addition, his campaign said, and voted against the final bill. There is an element of truth to this claim but not much more. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e329d85c-6bc2-49af-9f07-810d965736d0	None	Caleb Rowden	None	None	None	2016-11-06T00:39:16	2016-10-12	['None']
pomt-10914	"Trump just gave a $12 billion bailout to farmers hurt by his failed tariffs. This will cost every household in the U.S. $95 … Trump is borrowing the money from China since his tax cuts blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/01/other-98/facebook-graphic-misrepresents-trumps-12-billion-a/	President Donald Trump has recently faced criticism for his decision to authorize $12 billion in programs to assist farmers hurt by tariffs. One critic of that decision was The Other 98% in a Facebook post. The graphic in the post reads: "Trump just gave a $12 billion bailout to farmers hurt by his failed tariffs. This will cost every household in the U.S. $95. And by the way, Trump is borrowing the money from China since his tax cuts blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit. Does this feel like winning yet?" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The post has generated a lot of discussion on Facebook — more than 43,000 reactions and 126,000 shares — so we decided to fact-check it. It turns out that the post distorts information about how the aid package is being funded. Let’s break down each claim in the graphic, one by one. "$12 billion bailout" It’s true that U.S. Department of Agriculture did recently "authorize up to $12 billion in programs," according to a recent press release. That money is meant to help farmers who were hurt as a result of China increasing its tariffs in retaliation to Trump’s increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. However, one expert we reached out to took issue with the emergency aid package being dubbed a "bailout." "I would not use the term ‘bailout’ … since the term connotes the recipients will be compensated for actions they took," said Steve Suppan, a senior policy analyst at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. In the past, we’ve referred to monetary aid packages to Wall Street entities and the auto industry as "bailouts." That’s because those companies were being compensated for risky mistakes they made. But unlike those Wall Street workers and automobile companies, "farmers did not initiate the U.S. tariffs that triggered the Chinese and other tariffs," Suppan said. "This will cost every household in the U.S. $95" In tackling this claim, we began with a bit of math. Trump’s relief package authorizes up to $12 billion of aid. Divided by the 126 million U.S. households (as reported by the market and consumer data website Statista.com), that works out to roughly $95 per household. So from a very simple standpoint, the math checks out. But the experts we talked to agreed that the $95-per-household figure has its limits, and won’t affect every taxpayer the same. "The $12 billion must either come from reduced government spending, higher taxes or increased debt," said Aaron Smith, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. "Increased debt suggests that future households will pay for it in the form of higher taxes, reduced spending or higher inflation. Households pay tax at different rates and they would be affected differently by … what, if any, reductions in spending occurred." Brian Wright, a professor of agricultural economics at University of California, Berkeley, agreed that the monetary burden is likely to be distributed unevenly. He told us it will probably "fall more on the younger part of the population (since they) will have to deal with the deficit for some time." "Trump is borrowing the money from China" From there, the post gets more interesting. Would the package spurred by Chinese retaliatory tariffs be financed by money borrowed from China? The USDA press release specified that the authority required to administer and fund the aid package comes from a piece of legislation known as the Community Credit Corporation Charter Act. The Community Credit Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury for this purpose, an amount that more than covers the $12 billion aid package. The Facebook group may have been referring to the fact that China holds the most Treasury securities of any foreign country. Treasury securities can be purchased by both individuals and other entities, like foreign governments. When someone purchases a Treasury bond or a note, they’re agreeing to hand over their money to the federal government in return for being handed back that same amount at a later date. In between their initial purchase of the bond or note, the purchaser is paid interest at a predetermined rate. Because these debt obligations are backed by the U.S. government, many foreign countries purchase a large amount of Treasury securities, since they’re relatively safe investments. China, in particular, buys them in order to depreciate its own currency and make its exports cheaper. But it’s inaccurate to suggest the aid package is financed specifically by Chinese purchases of Treasury securities. That’s because the revenues generated from bond sales "go into the general fund that finances all U.S. government activity," said Suppan, the trade policy analyst. Meanwhile, there’s another logical flaw to consider. "It can't be that current households will pay for this bailout and the money will come from increased borrowing from China," Smith of UC-Davis said. "It must be one or the other." Trump’s "tax cuts blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit" After looking at the Congressional Budget Office’s records of the federal deficit by year, we found this claim to be inaccurate. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The last time the federal deficit exceeded one trillion was in 2012, when it was $1.087 trillion. The CBO projects that the 2018 deficit will be $804 billion. That’s a step up from 2017’s deficit, which was $665.4 billion. In saying that Trump’s tax cut legislation "blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit," it’s likely that The Other 98% was referring to a report released by the CBO after the legislation was passed that projected the deficit would rise to over $1 trillion by 2020. But that hasn’t happened yet, so the post is imprecise in using the past tense when saying that the tax cuts "blew" a "hole in the deficit." The Other 98% did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A recent Facebook post calls Trump’s recent announcement of an emergency aid package to farmers a "bailout." It also claims that the package will cost each household $95, and Trump borrowed money to finance it from China because his tax cuts left a trillion dollar hole in the deficit. The USDA did recently announce a $12 billion aid package for farmers, but some would consider the labeling of it as a "bailout" to be misleading since farmers were not responsible for the tariffs and other factors that led to the aid package being necessary. It’s also not fair to declare that the package would cost each household $95, since different households pay taxes at different rates. In addition, the government isn’t directly borrowing the money to finance the aid package from China. They’re borrowing the money from the U.S. Treasury. China buys and owns Treasury securities, but those securities have a very remote connection to the aid package. Lastly, the federal deficit hasn’t been over $1 trillion since 2012. The CBO doesn’t project it to be over $1 trillion until 2020. We rate the claims in the post Mostly False.

pomt-06741	The Central Falls fire department is "one of the lowest, if not the lowest, paid fire departments in the state and entire region."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/28/joseph-andriole/union-leader-says-central-falls-firefighters-are-a/	When the City of Central Falls filed for bankruptcy on Aug. 1, Robert Flanders Jr., the state-appointed receiver, said in court documents that collective bargaining agreements with police, fire and municipal employees’ unions were interfering with the city’s efforts to reduce expenses through outsourcing, privatization and sharing services. The next day, Joseph Andriole, vice president of the Rhode Island State Association of Firefighters, defended Central Falls firefighters -- and their contract with the city. In a story by WPRI-Channel 12 on the station’s web site, Andriole, who has been negotiating with Flanders, is quoted as saying that Central Falls’ small size belies its big-city challenges for firefighters. The one-square mile, densely populated city is filled with old mills and aging triple-deckers. Central Falls firefighters are among the "hardest working" in the state, Andriole said. "When you look at what they get paid, they are one of the lowest, if not the lowest, paid fire departments in the state and entire region." We wondered if that was true. So we decided to check it out. First, we called Andriole, who faxed us a three-page chart he and the union’s business manager use in contract negotiations which shows the annual wages for 33 Rhode Island fire districts whose firefighters have union contracts. The list compares the top "base pay" rate for firefighters. These "Private First-Class" firefighters comprise the bulk of most local forces. (Firefighters with less than a year on the job typically earn less; lieutenants, captains, battalion chiefs and other officers earn more.) In Central Falls, the top base pay for those firefighters is $44,892.08 per year. (That’s after the state-receiver this month reinstated a 2 percent pay raise that the firefighters had agreed to forgo last January.) Based on the union’s list, Central Falls appears to have one of the lowest base pay rates in Rhode Island. (We spot-checked the list for accuracy.) We found two fire districts where the base pay was lower than in Central Falls: North Providence ($90 a year less) and the Lime Rock Fire Department in Lincoln ($1,200 a year less). The firefighters with the highest base pay on Andriole’s list are in Warwick, where the top base pay rate as of July was $62,422. But the comparison leaves out other compensation, including one of the biggest pay boosters: overtime. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, Central Falls firefighters received a total of $545,339 in overtime pay -- an average of about $13,300 per firefighter. (The overtime pay in fiscal 2009 and 2010 averaged about $413,000, or roughly $10,000 per firefighter.) Short-staffing tends to drive up overtime pay because of minimum-staffing rules. Central Falls isn’t unusual in that regard. In North Providence, overtime pay for firefighters during the same period was roughly $21,000, on average, per firefighter -- more than double the average in Central Falls. But Andriole says that overtime shouldn’t be factored into the pay comparisons, since it’s not guaranteed. He conceded, though, that one could argue that other forms of pay guaranteed under union contracts -- such as longevity, holiday pay -- should be included. Central Falls firefighters with five years on the job get longevity pay of $1,500 a year. Those with 20 or more years on the job get $3,000 a year. And then there’s holiday pay. Central Falls firefighters currently get an additional 10 paid holidays a year, or roughly $2,100 a year. Firefighters also get annual allowances for uniforms and, in some cases, clothing. Until recently, Central Falls firefighters got a uniform allowance of $975 a year plus a $1,000 a year clothing allowance. (The uniform allowance was recently eliminated under an agreement between the firefighters’ union and the state-appointed receiver.) So if you add in overtime, holiday pay, longevity pay and clothing allowances, the annual pay for a firefighter in Central Falls with five years on the job climbs to more than $58,000 a year. That’s significantly more, for example, than firefighters in the Lime Rock Fire Department in neighboring Lincoln. Lime Rock is one of two fire districts in the town with paid firefighters; the others are all volunteer. The department responds to about 600 to 650 fire calls per year -- just under half of the calls the Central Falls department handles. Lime Rock’s top-paid privates earn $43,680 per year. No overtime. No longevity pay. And their uniform allowance is $700. As far as how Central Falls firefighters’ pay stacks up with the rest of the region, that’s harder to say. (Nationally, the median annual income for firefighters last year was $45,250 -- $358 more than the Central Falls’ base pay -- according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.) By "region," Andriole explained, he’d meant Massachusetts and Connecticut. We found no master lists, but did some spot-checks. The base pay for firefighters in Hartford, Conn., -- a city more than six times the size of Central Falls -- is $45,857. That’s $965 a year more than Central Falls firefighters are paid. After five years, Hartford firefighters’ base pay rises to $68,073 -- $10,000 more than in Central Falls. The base pay for firefighters in Holyoke, Mass., -- an old mill city similar to Central Falls, -- is $49,011 -- about $4,100 more than in Central Falls. But Holyoke’s firefighters earned, on average, less than half of what firefighters in Central Falls earned during each of the last three fiscal years in in overtime pay. The point is that firefighters can, and often do, earn a lot more than their "base pay." In short, Andriole was right when he said that Central Falls firefighters’ pay is among the lowest in the state and region -- but he was talking only about base pay. He left out some important context - namely, all of the other compensation firefighters receive -- which is why we rate his statement Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-14600	"I’ll be running against a career politician."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/04/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-claims-russ-feingold-career-politi/	A rematch awaits voters this fall in the race for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Republican Ron Johnson. As with such contests, we’ll hear some of the same issues that were raised when the two squared off in 2010. That’s when Johnson, a first-time candidate, ousted U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, who had served three terms in the Senate. In a Dec. 17, 2015 appearance on "Upfront with Mike Gousha" on WISN-TV, Johnson raised what is certain to be a central theme of his campaign. "I’ll be running against a career politician," he said -- twice -- in the interview. We asked Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger to explain the senator’s statement. After all, Feingold’s been out of office for about five years and passed up opportunities to run for governor in 2014 and, before that, Wisconsin’s other Senate seat, which was open in 2012. "Senator Feingold is obviously a career politician – one who has pursued his profession for decades," Reisinger said in an email. "Anyone who doesn’t believe it should do the math and listen to his own words." Fair enough. Let’s take a look at the Feingold file. Feingold, 62, served 10 years in the Wisconsin state Senate, until 1992 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate. That means he was an elected official for about 64 percent of his adult life. But what about before he won his first election? Feingold graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1975, then was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1979 when he was 26. He then worked at a law firm until he won the state Senate seat, at age 29. So, at the start of his working life that’s about three years when he was not in office or in school. Then there’s the five years following the 2010 loss to Johnson. Shortly after leaving office, Feingold set up a political action committee, Progressives United Inc., and was paid by that group a total of $59,500 from 2011 to 2013. Feingold then served from 2013-15 as a U.S. State Department diplomat to the Great Lakes Region of Africa. Not long after leaving that post, he announced in May 2015 that he would challenge Johnson. So for at least part of the past five years -- some would argue virtually all of it -- Feingold was involved in politics. (He also taught several college courses, at Marquette University, Lawrence University and later Stanford University, and wrote a book.) In summary: In the 36 years since he finished law school, he was in office for 28 and engaged in political or diplomatic work for another 5. That’s about 92 percent of his career spent in politics. An additional note: Feingold is currently receiving both his state and federal pensions. "Should the people of Wisconsin elect him to the U.S. Senate, he would stop taking his federal pension or take a corresponding reduction in salary," Michael Tyler, his campaign spokesman, told us. Feingold addressed the "career politician" charge in a 2010 appearance at the Milwaukee Press Club. He said he had chosen public service as a career and was proud of it. "I make no apologies for it," he said. We asked Feingold’s campaign for their take on the career politician charge this time around. "While he has a breadth of experience working as an attorney, an author, a teacher, and serving our nation as a diplomat, Russ is proud to have served the people of Wisconsin," Tyler said. Our rating Setting the stage for his 2016 election rematch, Johnson said he would face a "career politician" in Feingold. Other than a short stretches, it’s clear the lion’s share of Feingold’s career has been in politics or government. He’s got the pensions to show for it, and makes no apologies for it.

pomt-07682	"I delivered to you a budget that ... cuts taxes by $2 billion."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/08/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-budget-cuts-taxes-2-billion/	Gov. Rick Scott asked Florida legislators to pass his proposed budget during his first State of the State speech on March 8, 2011. It's a budget that cuts spending to balance the budget as required by the state Constitution. And, it cuts taxes. "I delivered to you a budget that ... cuts taxes by $2 billion," Scott told legislators on the first day of its 60-day legislative session. Let's walk through the math of his budget. Scott proposed a two-year budget that cuts a host of taxes and fees. Here's a breakdown from the governor's office. Scott's budget proposal would: • Reduce the corporate income tax from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2011-12 and from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012-13. The rate cut will save those who pay the tax $459 million this year and a little more than $1 billion in 2012-13; • Reduce the required local effort, a property tax to fund schools, saving taxpayers around $600 million in 2011-12. The tax cut would carry forward in 2012-13; • Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts 25 percent for two years, saving taxpayers $180 million annually; • Reduce unemployment compensation taxes by shortening how long Floridians can collect benefits and making it more difficult for them to be eligible. Scott's office says that will save $630.8 million over two years; • Roll back 2009 Legislature-approved fee increases for driver licenses, vehicle registrations and other motor vehicle fees. Scott says the rollback would save drivers $492 million over two years; • And repeal or alter other small taxes on ammonia, pesticides, fertilizer, solvents, dry cleaning, tires and lead acid batteries, among other things. The changes would save $77 million over two years, Scott's office says. Taken together, that is a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 -- slightly below the figure he claimed in his speech. (Scott's office, by the way, claims a total of $4.1 billion over two years, but that number is deceiving because most cuts in the second year of Scott's budget aren't additional cuts; they are just the same cuts rolled over.) Scott said his budget cuts taxes by $2 billion. But really, the number is about 15 percent high, based on the estimates of his own budget office. We rate this claim Mostly True.

One post, from the morning-herald.com, offered this bogus headline: "Jeff Flake’s office leaks names of those charged in Mueller’s Russian probe." The story keys on another name in the news lately, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. Flake, a Republican, has said he will not run for re-election in 2018. Flake has been critical of Trump. The post, which was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to crack down on fake news, claimed Flake’s office leaked the results of Mueller’s investigation. It’s a fabrication because, among other things, the spokesman the blog quotes does not exist. "Robert Mueller’s grand jury returned indictments in the 2016 election meddling case against three members of the Clinton Campaign, two members of the Sanders campaign and Paul Manafort from the Trump campaign, who seems to have been working on behalf of the Democrats," the post quotes a made-up Flake spokesman named Art Tubolls. "Nobody in the current administration is under any further investigation." Tubolls is the same name used in another piece of fake news describing how President Barack Obama left a threatening letter for Trump when Trump moved into the White House.

pomt-07738	"The right-to-work states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/28/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-unemployment-lower-right-work-st/	On the Feb. 24, 2011, edition of Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor, host Bill O’Reilly said that the jobs picture is better in "right to work" states -- that is, states in which workers can refuse to pay dues or fees to the union that represents them in bargaining. "The right-to-work states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do," O’Reilly said while interviewing Caroline Heldman, a political scientist at Occidental College. We thought we’d check to see whether O’Reilly is correct. First, some background. According to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, 22 states have passed some form of right-to-work law (the exact provisions can vary) -- Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. The other 28 states do not have such laws. To test O’Reilly’s claim, we turned to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which is the official source for unemployment statistics in the United States. BLS’ most recent state-by state data is for December 2010. We consulted with Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, about the fairest way to look at the data. We agreed that it was best to compare right-to-work and non-right-to-work states through data weighted according to state population. That way, California’s unemployment rate would be given more weight than, say, Wyoming’s. When we did the math, we found that the unemployment rate in the 22 right-to-work states was 9.17 percent, compared to 9.65 in the 28 non-right-to-work states. (The national unemployment rate that month was 9.4 percent that month -- right in the middle.) So O’Reilly is basically correct. His only shortcoming was his use of the phrase "much lower level of unemployment." The difference for December 2010 was only about half a percentage point, which is fairly modest, given that the range of state unemployment figures stretched from 3.8 in North Dakota to 14.5 in Nevada. As always, there’s a question about causation -- that is, whether right-to-work status actually produces low unemployment. Of the 11 states with the lowest unemployment (there was a tie for 10th place) eight were right-to-work states. Of those, seven states -- North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma -- are from the Great Plains and the Mountain West, which have in general been less hard-hit during the recent recession. To see whether today is an unusual situation, we asked the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation whether they had historical data on the unemployment gap. They said they did not. James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that numbers he’s run suggest that in 2008, before the worst of the recession set in, the gap was slightly larger -- about eight-tenths of a percentage point -- but was in the same general ballpark. In any case, none of the economists we spoke to thought the gap was especially surprising, either now or historically. So where does that leave us in terms of O’Reilly’s claim? He said that "right-to-work states have much lower level of unemployment than the union states do." To say it’s "much lower" is a stretch, but he's right that it is lower. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2011-02-28T17:40:15	2011-02-24	['None']
pomt-00556	"Twenty-five percent of people in the country have said they changed their email and phone habits because of" the collection of data allowed by the Patriot Act.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/15/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-says-25-percent-americans-have-changed-/	When former government contractor Edward Snowden leaked information about federal data collection in 2013, he drew attention to the extent the federal government is gathering information about U.S. citizens. Much of that data collection grew out of the Patriot Act, which was signed by President George W. Bush shortly after the 9/11 attacks, allowing government to monitor communication activity to prevent further acts of terrorism. The act set many provisions to expire in 2005 but the sunset was renewed and extended to June 1, 2015. The following day, a new act passed to again extend surveillance, but with some limitations placed on phone data collection. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan would have gone further. He voted against the extension and in March 2015 introduced a measure that would repeal the Patriot Act. Pocan tried to illustrate the effect of government surveillance on everyday Americans during an appearance on Devil's Advocates radio in Madison. In the May 20, 2015 interview, he said: "The Pew Foundation did a poll and what's interesting and I think a chilling effect -- 25 percent of people in the country have said they changed their email and phone habits because of this kind of collection." Is Pocan right? Polling results When asked for backup, Pocan's people directed us to the survey conducted by the Pew Research Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, about technology use post-Snowden. The survey asked American adults for their thoughts on government surveillance programs and whether they have changed their communication technology habits since learning details about the surveillance. Pocan claimed the poll showed 25 percent of Americans changed their email and phone habits because of the data collection allowed by the Patriot Act. But that’s not exactly what was found by the survey. And Pocan overstated the breadth of the changes. The survey asked if respondents had heard of government surveillance programs. Then, the poll offered readers a list of technologies, such as email and cell phones, and asked how -- if at all -- their use of the technologies had changed. The percentages below represent how many said they had changed their use of an individual technology "a great deal" or "somewhat." Email accounts 18 percent Search engines 17 percent Social media sites 15 percent Cell phones 15 percent Mobile apps 13 percent Text messages 13 percent Landline phones 9 percent At least one of the above 25 percent So, the 25 percent is not for any single category, or even from combining cell phones and email. Rather, it comes from tallying how many people listed at least one of the examples. Behind the numbers That is the number Pocan cited, but in doing so he missed some important nuances. First, the question about changing technology habits wasn't asked of everyone in the sample. An earlier question asked how much respondents had heard about government collecting information about "telephone calls, emails and other online communications as part of efforts to monitor terrorist activity." The 87 percent of respondents who said they had heard "a little" or "a lot" were then asked about changing technology habits. So that means, in the end, 22 percent -- not 25 percent -- of all of those surveyed said they had made such a change. Pocan also said the 25 percent of people "changed their email and phone habits." But, as noted, the list had seven categories and did not pair any two of them together. Pocan also suggested a cause-and-effect relationship between government surveillance programs and people changing their technology habits. But the poll only asked whether respondents had changed their technology use "since learning about U.S. phone and Internet monitoring." For instance, someone may have dropped their landline phone service to save money, but did so some time after they heard of government surveillance. Research methodology Beyond Pocan's fumbling with the survey data, some aspects of how the survey was done could have affected the results. Pew used GfK Group’s national KnowledgePanel survey of 475 adults conducted between November 2014 and January 2015 for the analysis. KnowledgePanel is a national research sample, weighted to represent the country's demographics. Respondents were invited to participate in a series of three surveys in the course of a year, all of which would be about current events technology issues. Participants were told the survey questions would be about technology, which could draw people more interested in technology than the general public. And since the questions about technology use came in the third survey, the previous surveys could have sensitized respondents to pay more attention to technology issues and increase their concern. Those who are more interested and concerned about technology would be more likely to stick around, said Robert Griffin, professor at Marquette University’s Center for Mass Media Research. One in 5 dropped out between the first and third surveys. GfK did try to account for participants who drop out of the survey by adding in new participants and weighting their responses. Overall, experts said the methodology followed industry standards and wouldn’t have had a great affect on the results. Our rating Pocan said 25 percent of Americans changed their phone and email habits in response to federal data collection. He pointed to a Pew Research study as evidence, which our experts said checked out, but he misrepresented and overstated the statistic on the radio show. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.

pomt-00741	"Medicaid expansion isn’t necessarily a very popular issue on the street."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/20/steve-crisafulli/polls-medicaid-expansion-florida/	The Florida Legislature is split on what to do about Medicaid expansion, but House Speaker Steve Crisafulli said that isn’t the case for many constituents. "If you go into a federal program like that, you will soon find out what it means to be married to Washington. There's folks that are not in this chamber today because of that very issue," he told radio station WUSF’s Health News Florida. "People spoke in those districts, and we feel like Medicaid expansion isn’t necessarily a very popular issue on the street." The Florida House and Senate are currently debating whether to expand the program to insure the very poor as part of contentious budget negotiations. Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, opposes Medicaid expansion and was speaking broadly about how discussing it had doomed some candidates’ political ambitions. His office said he "was speaking as a matter of his perspective." But we at PolitiFact Florida thought his statement can be verified or contradicted by public opinion polls. And since it's such a critical issue in Florida, we decided to take a look. It’s all in the wording The Legislature is debating whether to accept billions from the federal government to increase the number of people eligible for Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. More than 800,000 currently uninsured Floridians would join the program’s rolls. The federal government would pay 100 percent of the expansion at first, gradually shifting to 90 percent by 2020. (The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 the expansion was optional for states; 28 states and the District of Columbia have expanded the program as of April 2015.) The Florida Senate now favors an expansion while the House opposes it. Senators have proposed the Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program, which would create a state-run private insurance exchange for low-income Floridians with federal dollars. Residents using the exchange would pay premiums and be required to either have a job or attend school. The House has not set forth a proposal of their own. Several polls over the years have looked at whether Floridians favor making the program larger. In 2013, three polls showed support for expansion as high as 62 or 63 percent, although one from the James Madison Institute was as low as 30 percent. One 2014 University of Florida poll put approval of expansion at 67 percent. That’s a pretty wide range, but it likely had a lot to do with how the poll questions were worded, according to Alan Reifman, a Texas Tech University professor who specializes in social science research methodology. The James Madison Institute poll’s question focused on how the state’s budget would grow with a bigger Medicaid program, with no mention of how many Floridians would be covered or that the federal government would be paying the lion’s share, Reifman said. A Public Policy Polling question that included state and federal costs, plus the number of people who would benefit through coverage and new jobs was "probably the most balanced question-wording of those I’ve seen," he said. That poll tallied 62 percent in favor of expansion. Updated for March 2015, the Public Policy Polling survey used a shorter question focusing on federal funding, but still found 58 percent in favor of expansion. Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, said wide support for expansion in most polls shows that once people understand the issue and how expansion would be implemented, attitudes tend to shift. A state solution like what the Senate is offering tends to be particularly popular in Florida, she said. What’s generating headlines from Tallahassee now isn’t so much overwhelming voter opposition, but rather an ideological debate in the Legislature. "This is not a partisan issue in the strictest sense," Alker said. "This is a fight within the Republican Party." In April 2015, Gov. Rick Scott’s Let’s Get to Work PAC released a poll that referred to "significantly expanding the federal Medicaid program under Obamacare here in Florida." Scott has recently renewed opposition to the expansion and is threatening to sue Washington over pressure to accept federal expansion money. His PAC’s contentious poll wording may have influenced responses, Reifman said, and sampled likely voters, which favors Republicans. That poll found a 44-44 percent split between those who favored and opposed expansion. Partisan attitudes were more apparent when Let’s Get to Work polled a sample of 500 Republican primary voters -- they opposed Medicaid expansion by 75 percent. Our ruling Crisafulli said, "Medicaid expansion isn’t necessarily a very popular issue on the street." He was speaking broadly about how constituents don’t want the expansion. Several polls give the edge to a majority of Floridians favoring the expansion, although results vary depending on how the questions are worded. A recent conservative poll found that Republicans don’t like the expansion by a wide margin. Taken together, those numbers present a more nuanced picture than what Crisafulli suggested.

pomt-07848	Joe Straus is the "first Jewish speaker of the" Texas House.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/12/john-oliver/daily-show-correspondent-john-oliver-says-rep-joe-/	Are Jewish Republicans in Texas as rare as a pork rib on a prairie mule? John Oliver, a correspondent for Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, says so, but we noticed a more testable observation he made after his January "pilgrimage to Tejas." Two years ago, Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, "became the first Jewish speaker of the" Texas House, Oliver said during a segment on the House speaker’s race that aired Feb. 3. "But that meant trouble when he came up for re-election." In January, Straus withstood Republican challengers backed by GOP activists who said Straus wasn’t conservative enough to repeat as speaker, especially after Republicans dominated November’s elections, upping their House majority to 101 of its 150 seats. Oliver’s report falls short of demonstrating that Straus’s religion put a drag on his political fortunes. Yet the spoof features people praying for a "godly, humble leader of the Texas House." And it closes with schoolchildren marking a new "high holiday" in Straus’s honor with a celebratory song that opens with a reference to anti-Semites. Out-of-state humor aside, we wondered if Straus is indeed the first Jewish Texas House speaker. An Austin American-Statesman news article from January 2009, just before House members elevated Straus to the speaker’s post, said he appeared poised to become "the first Jewish speaker of the Texas House since statehood." Before Texas was a state, the article says, David Kaufman served as speaker of the House in the Congress of the Republic of Texas from 1839 to 1841. Kaufman was of Jewish descent, "but historians have found no evidence he was a practicing Jew and he did not receive a Jewish burial, said Hollace Ava Weiner, editor of ‘Lone Stars of David: The Jews of Texas.’" Rabbi Jimmy Kessler of Temple B’nai Israel in Galveston told us that "usually a person of the Jewish faith will buried in a Jewish cemetery." He also pointed to the 1990 book, "Deep in the Heart: Lives and Legends of Texas Jews: A Photographic History," which says that Kaufman "was of Hebrew descent but not a practicing Jew." Finally, Bryan Stone, an associate history professor at Del Mar College in Corpus Christi and author of the book, "The Chosen Folks," about Jewish Texans, told us: "There have been many Jewish members of the Texas Legislature going back to early statehood, but Straus is definitely the first Jewish speaker." We rate Oliver’s statement as Mostly True. CORRECTION, 12:30 p.m., Feb. 12, 2011: The story below has been amended to remove a description of a 19th century speaker of the Texas House as the sole Jewish member of the Texas Legislature until the 1970s. That’s incorrect. After he served as House speaker, however, David Kaufman was the only Jewish Texan to serve in the U.S. Congress until the 1970s, according to the Handbook of Texas Online.

pomt-11925	"State government spending is at an all-time high. The state is on track to spend more in this fiscal year — more than $17.9 billion — than at any time in state history."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/17/oklahoma-council-public-affairs/oklahoma-spending-more-ever-only-if-you-ignore-inf/	As Oklahoma’s elected officials wrestle to close a budget gap, a recent op-ed from the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs argued that tax hikes shouldn’t be part of the solution. "Why do we need to raise taxes if the government is already spending more than ever before," the conservative think tank wrote. "State government spending is at an all-time high. The state is on track to spend more in this fiscal year — more than $17.9 billion — than at any time in state history." Where does the state money go? Well, schools, both K-12 and higher education, account for one of the heftiest lines in the budget. Another big ticket item is SoonerCare, the state’s Medicaid program. It all adds up. We wondered if it’s truly the case that the state is spending more money than ever before. The answer depends on whether you think inflation matters. Most economists, bankers and corporate CFOs do, and when you factor in that a dollar today is worth less than a dollar in the past, the council’s claim falls short. The council got its spending numbers through 2016 from the state’s Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The state hasn’t closed out the books for 2017, but preliminarily, expenditures hit about $17.9 billion. (Technically, we’re now in FY 2018.) Based solely on the raw dollars, that part of the council’s statement is on the mark. Here’s how the official totals look in the years for which we have final numbers: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current dollars (billions) 12.85 14.14 15.02 16.08 16.62 16.65 16.71 17.04 17.52 17.40 17.96 But the numbers change when you take inflation into account. We used a very common yardstick -- constant 2009 dollars based on the changes in the national Consumer Price Index. Viewed that way, spending today amounts to about $15.83 billion in 2009 dollars. It was clearly higher at the height of the recession in 2009 ($16.08 billion) and 2010 ($16.35 billion), and a smidge more in 2011. This chart shows the constant (in red) and nominal or current dollars (in blue) side-by-side. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Spokesman David Autry at the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs said the inflation adjustment had the biggest impact on the results, but he discounted its importance. "Working Oklahomans (taxpayers) aren’t allowed the luxury of adjusting for inflation when the mortgage or rent comes due," Autry said. "The taxpayers who foot the bill for state government are forced every day to live within their means." Adjusting for inflation does have a place in the council’s toolkit. Autry said that the council adjusts for inflation when it looks at numbers over a longer period of time, because "because readers may not have that kind of knowledge." He also noted that the results shift depending on the choice of an inflation measure, and sent us three alternatives. But even using his options, spending in 2010 topped 2016 for the two that looked at what consumers pay. Only by limiting the measure to what producers pay (the producer price index) did 2016 come out the highest. Autry sent this table: Other ways to measure spending We can round out the spending burden picture by looking at spending compared to the state’s population and its economy. When there are fewer people, the burden falls on fewer shoulders. If the economy is smaller, even the same amount of spending would require a bigger economic effort. The state gained about 330,000 people between 2006 and 2016. Its economy grew by about $33 billion in real terms in the same period, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Based on population, constant dollar spending was higher in seven of the past 11 years. Measured against the size of the state’s economy, it was higher in eight out of the past 11 years. 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Per capita constant dollars 3790 4021 4080 4324 4346 4183 4070 4043 4050 3985 4034 Spending as percent of GDP 9.6% 10.1% 10.2% 11.2% 11.4% 10.5% 9.7% 9.3% 9.0% 8.7% 9.0% Our ruling The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs said that spending this year is on track to be the highest ever. While the raw numbers show that, the statement ignores the impact of inflation, a standard practice when comparing dollars over time. Factoring in inflation shows that real spending was higher in 2009 to 2011. When population and economic growth are added in, spending has been higher over most of the past decade. The statement contains an element of truth but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12828	"Back when Ted Cruz called Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate floor, nobody invoked Rule 19 to censor him."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/08/jeanne-shaheen/senate-republicans-didnt-use-rule-19-cruz-when-he-/	Senate Democrats attacked their GOP colleagues for using a procedural regulation to shut down Elizabeth Warren’s criticism of a fellow senator, but not when Texas Republican Ted Cruz did the same thing two years ago. During a Feb. 8 CNN interview, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., excoriated Republicans for invoking Rule 19 the day before to force Warren to stop her floor speech against Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. Warren, D-Mass., had been reading a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that protested Sessions’ failed appointment as a federal judge in Alabama. The letter from King said Sessions "has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge." During Warren’s speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky cited Rule 19, which prevents senators from impugning one another. Senators voted along party lines to silence Warren, a move Shaheen said was hypocritical. "Back when Ted Cruz called Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate floor, nobody invoked Rule 19 to censor him, so this has been a very subjective process," Shaheen said. Cruz did take to the Senate floor in 2015 to accuse McConnell of lying to him. While other Republicans did admonish Cruz for doing so, the rule that silenced Warren was not invoked. ‘A simple lie’ According to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, Rule 19 says in part that "no Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator." Shaheen and other Democrats argued that if the rule applies to Warren, it also should have applied to a July 24, 2015, speech by Cruz. He took to the Senate floor to castigate McConnell for allegedly making a private deal with some senators to allow a vote to renew the charter for the Export-Import Bank in exchange for votes on a trade deal. Cruz and many other Republicans oppose the bank, which acts as the nation’s official credit agency to help businesses find foreign markets. After McConnell moved a proposal to reauthorize the bank through a transportation bill, Cruz went on the attack. Cruz said McConnell had told him there was no such deal — "Like Saint Peter, he repeated it three times," Cruz said — but Cruz’s office staff had said McConnell was lying. "I cannot believe he would tell a flat-out lie. ... What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again, was a simple lie," Cruz said. So Cruz didn’t specifically use the word "liar" to describe McConnell, an important caveat. But he did make it very clear that, according to Cruz’s account, McConnell had told him and others a lie. McConnell denied the charge, saying he had held the position that the transportation bill would be the best opportunity to hold a vote on renewing the bank’s charter (it passed). We didn’t find any evidence that anyone in the Senate moved to silence Cruz with Rule 19. But Republicans did denounce his attack on the party leader as improper in the days following. "I think it was outside the realm of Senate behavior," Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told CNN a couple of days later. "I would never contemplate going to the floor of the Senate and impugning the integrity of another senator. Just not something we do here. I really think it was a very wrong thing to do." Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, then the Senate president pro tempore, suggested in a date floor speech that Cruz may have been grandstanding to draw attention to his presidential bid. "Squabbling and sanctimony may be tolerated in other venues — or perhaps on the campaign trail — but they have no place among colleagues in the United States Senate," Hatch said. "The Senate floor has even become a place where senators have singled out colleagues by name to attack them in personal terms, to impugn their character, in blatant disregard for Senate rules." No senator defended Cruz’s speech, and he was defeated by his own party on several procedural maneuvers in the days after he spoke. His Texas colleague, GOP Sen. John Cornyn, even questioned Cruz’s recollection of events, noting he "would have to say he's mistaken" about what McConnell said. Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political science professor, further noted to us that the Senate majority leader isn’t the only senator who can invoke Rule 19. "(What Cruz said) was definitely a violation of the norms of the Senate and he was not called to account," Koger said. "I would just say that any senator — including any Democrat or any Republican — could have called him on it." Our ruling Shaheen said, "Back when Ted Cruz called Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate floor, nobody invoked Rule 19 to censor him." Cruz didn't call him a "liar," exactly, but he did say in a 2015 floor speech that McConnell had told him a lie about whether the Senate majority leader had made a deal to renew the Export-Import Bank’s charter. Republicans chastised Cruz afterward, saying it was not the proper thing to do. But he was not silenced under Rule 19.

Her four-count, part of a Sept. 28, 2013, public interview at the Texas Tribune Festival, aligned with a similar claim made in August 2013 by former Republican U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina of California, who said in defense of the change in Texas law: "There are only four countries in the world that have -- that legalize abortion after five months -- China, North Korea, Canada and the U.S." Setting five months as equal to 20 weeks, after which the changed Texas law restricts abortions, PolitiFact rated Fiorina’s claim as Half True after identifying wrinkles including a couple of additional countries allowing abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. What the laws say U.S. requirements for legally obtaining an abortion vary by state, but the national standard was handed down from the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Lawmakers and physicians refer to the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus as "viability." The decision sets the standard that women can choose to have an abortion until the point of viability. In citing the leading obstetrics publication as a guide, the ruling suggests viability starts at 24 weeks into the gestation period, which starts on the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period. So women in the United States can get an abortion for any reason, not necessarily medical, until at least 24 weeks of gestation. This is known as elective abortion. After 24 weeks, or whenever the resident’s state prohibits elective abortion, the woman can get a therapeutic abortion under a few exceptions: life in danger, physical health or mental health. China, North Korea and Canada do not have federally enforced limits on elective abortion. Gestation period restrictions in Canada, unlike the other two nations, are regulated at the local level, Johanna Fine, a Center for Reproductive Rights spokeswoman, told PolitiFact. Provinces can range from 10 to 20 weeks for the maximum gestation period. So this gets us to the mentioned four nations. However, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which published a 2013 chart that several reproductive rights experts referred PolitiFact to, Singapore and the Netherlands also fit the criteria. Both nations allow unrestricted abortion through Week 24 of gestation, after which therapeutic abortion is possible. Anita Perry’s statement, like the claim by Fiorina, also leaves off an important qualifier. She did not mention that dozens of countries permit abortions after 20 weeks for different reasons. Common exceptions to the gestational period requirement mean women may be able to get therapeutic abortions based on physical health, mental health or socioeconomic status. Just 29 countries (meaning independent states and semi-autonomous regions whose populations exceed 1 million) outlaw abortion entirely, with no exceptions to save the woman’s life. Thirty-seven other countries that routinely outlaw abortion, including Paraguay, Afghanistan and Uganda, make clear exceptions to save mothers. Another 59 will do so in general to preserve pregnant women’s physical health on a broader scale, with Israel, New Zealand and others also accepting mental health reasons as valid exceptions. India and Japan belong to a group of 13 countries that grant even wider exceptions that include access to the procedure for socioeconomic reasons based on factors like age of the woman or very low income. The remaining 61 countries legalize elective abortions with varying gestational period requirements, with the United States, Canada, North Korea, China, Singapore and the Netherlands being the six countries with the widest acceptable time periods. "It’s not so much whether abortion is legal; it’s under what circumstances it's legal," Mindy Roseman, the Human Rights Program academic director at Harvard Law School, told PolitiFact. "Even where abortion is highly restricted, it’s legal for the health of the woman." By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens said the initial PolitiFact article on Fiorina’s claim "pretty much covers" the Anita Perry claim. Our ruling Perry said only four countries allow legal abortions past 20 weeks into the gestational period. The United States, Canada, North Korea and China fit that measure, but Singapore and the Netherlands do as well. Also, far more countries permit abortions in certain circumstances in which the pregnancy would damage the woman’s well-being, be it physical, mental or economic.

pomt-01128	Graduation rates of players at major football colleges "are still twenty points below their male campus peers and worsened in the past three years."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/30/jim-moran/moran-says-college-football-players-have-low-gradu/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is trying to clean up college sports as he finishes his 24-year congressional career. Moran, who retires Jan. 3, introduced legislation this fall that would create a commission to look into the policies of the NCAA after myriad college sports scandals. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve "the interaction of athletics and academics" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes’ abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs. "The graduation rates of players in the Football Bowl Subdivision are still twenty points below their male campus peers and worsened in the past three years," Moran wrote in a Facebook post. We’ve already fact-checked two Moran statements about big-time college sports but we thought this was worth a look, too. We gave Moran a True rating for to his claim that only 20 colleges athletic departments generate bottom-line profits. We gave him a Mostly True for his claim that a college coaches is the highest- paid public employee in 40 states. We’ll start our look at Moran’s statement about graduation rates with a definition of Football Bowl Subdivision -- the term the congressman used to qualify his statement. There are 1,083 colleges and universities competing in sports that fall under the NCAA’s governance. The Football Bowl subdivision is the top tier of college sports competition, comprised of 123 schools that are eligible to compete in bowl games and have average attendance of at least 15,000 at their home games. Moran’s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, said the congressman’s statement was based on 2011 and 2014 reports from the College Sport Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. The institute has published reports on the graduation rates of students and athletes since 2010-11. The institute analyzes two sets of graduation data -- one from the federal government for all students and one from the NCAA for college athletes -- and adjusts them into comparable statistics. The greatest difference is that the federal graduation rate tracks part-time as well as full-time students. All school athletes are required to carry a full-time load. The institute computes the percentage of athletes and regular students who complete their undergraduate degrees in six years. The 2011 report compares football players to other male students who started college from 2000 to 2003. The study focused on FBS schools that belong to Power 5 conferences -- the Big XII, Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten and Pac-12. FBS football players graduated at a rate 17.8 percentage points below other male students -- 55.1 percent for the players compared to 72.9 percent for the others. The 2014 report compared male students and football players who started college between 2003 and 2006 and found the numbers had not changed dramatically. The athletes graduated at a rate 17.5 percentage points below other male students -- 57.4 percent for the athletes compared to 74.9 percent for the others. Scanlon acknowledged Moran erred in saying the graduation gap between the football players and other students had widened. "It’s been pretty static," said Richard M. Southall, director of the institute. "One of the more troubling findings is that the gap for black players at the Power 5 conferences is negative 26 percent while for white players it is negative 7 percent. Football is driven a great deal by African American males at the FBS level and the gaps are very pronounced for black players. The same is true for Division I basketball." Southall said the demands of playing FBS football are equivalent to having a full time job and leave athletes limited time for study. He said that academics and athletic success have an inverse relationship. "There’s a strong relationship between athletic success and a greater graduation gap," he said. "This makes sense because the demands on the athletes are greater. For example, for the FBS teams now in the playoff format, they are playing more games and the season takes more time … The demands are greater." Our ruling Moran said that FBS football players graduate at a rate 20 points below male students and that it has worsened. Moran is close enough on the graduation rate. But the gap hasn’t gotten worse, it’s pretty much stayed the same. So Moran gets a Half True.	None	Jim Moran	None	None	None	2014-12-30T00:49:28	2014-11-22	['None']
pomt-13772	"Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-homicides-are-17-percent-50-bigg/	Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination with a speech full of concern about a breakdown in law and order. "Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement," he said. "Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years." We’ll give Trump credit for sticking close to what we presume is his source material. We located an almost identical passage in an article published in January 2016 by the Wonkblog team at the Washington Post: "The number of homicides in the country's 50 largest cities rose nearly 17 percent last year, the greatest increase in lethal violence in a quarter century," the article began. The article cited Wonkblog’s own calculations. However, Trump ignored some significant cautionary notes in that same story. The Post article said that a close look at the figures "suggests no single explanation for the increases and reveals no clear pattern among those cities that experienced the most horrific violence." For instance, the article noted that other data shows a more modest increase. "A preliminary FBI report released last week showed that the overall number of violent offenses increased just 1.7 percent nationally during the first half of the year while the number of property crimes declined 4.2 percent," the Post article noted. The article also noted that the increases are scattershot. "There were more killings in Nashville, but the total in Memphis declined by 1 percent," the Post article noted. "The number of homicides increased 25 percent in Houston, but decreased 9 percent in San Antonio. There were seven fewer homicides last year than in 2014 in Fresno, Calif., a decline of 15 percent. Meanwhile, up Highway 99 in Sacramento, there were 43 killings last year, an increase of 54 percent." "There's no national pattern," Franklin Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Post. Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, agreed. "Everything is basically anecdotal," he told the Post. "There's not a clear national picture that I've been able to discern of what might be contributing to the changes." James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University, told PolitiFact that the most recent data is heavily driven by four large cities with disproportionate increases -- Chicago, Houston, Washington and Baltimore. Fox and others urged PolitiFact not to make too much of changes in data over the course of a single year. It’s better to look at a range of years to spot lasting trends. "There is volatility in numbers like these," he said. For instance, he said, in 2012, there were more than 500 homicides in Chicago. That fell to the lower 400s each of the next two years before rising again to the high 400s in 2015. "Ironically, some of the time when the numbers go up it may be because there was an unusually low number the previous year. A one-year change is not a reliable trend," Fox said. And over the long term, rates of violent crime have moved in the right direction. As we have previously noted, FBI data shows that violent crime has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available. "Homicide rates have declined steadily since 1993, through both Republican and Democratic presidencies," said Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist. And as a result of this long-term decline, the crime rate has been "low for so long that a tiny increase becomes a large percent increase," said Alan Lizotte, criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Our ruling Trump said, "Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years." The statement comes from a credible source -- calculations made by the Washington Post. However, in painting a bleak picture, Trump cherry-picks the Post’s overall findings -- and makes mistakes criminologists warn about. The Post article acknowledged that FBI data found a smaller increase in recent years, with contradictory results for many cities. And experts caution against putting too much stock in short-term changes, since year-to-year data can be volatile for hard-to-discern reasons. Lost in Trump’s formulation is that, overall, violent crime has been falling consistently for about a quarter century. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate his claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/729fe9ae-3336-4971-8c96-52b25f6b4e25	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-21T22:30:51	2016-07-21	['United_States']
pomt-09307	"We have constitutional amendment that says that there's a ban on drilling right off Florida's coast."	false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/20/paula-dockery/state-sen-paula-dockery-says-state-constitution-ba/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Paula Dockery said in a video interview that there’s a constitutional amendment that protects Florida’s coastline from oil drilling. She made the claim in an April 5, 2010, interview with Kathleen Walter on the conservative Newsmax.TV website, as part of a wide-ranging interview in which she discussed the state's economic challenges and the need to proceed carefully with plans to tap offshore oil resources. "First of all we have constitutional amendment that says that there's a ban on drilling right off Florida's coast," she said. "So the devil's in the details …" Offshore drilling is a hot topic in Tallahassee this year because of now stalled legislation that would allow drilling in state waters that extend about 10 miles into the Gulf of Mexico and 3 miles into the Atlantic Ocean. The federal government generally controls waters more than 10 miles offshore, while Florida and other states control the waters inside 10 miles and could reap a windfall from new oil leases. Fueling the debate is President Barack Obama's plans to lift drilling barriers farther from the shore. He wants to open up the Atlantic from Delaware to central Florida and plans to ask Congress to repeal a ban on drilling in the gulf within 125 miles of Florida's beaches. Statewide candidates in Florida walk a difficult tightrope on drilling. They want to appeal to voters who are paying $3 a gallon for gasoline and support new offshore sources of oil, but the candidates don't want to alienate coastal voters who oppose drilling because of the possible impact on beaches and tourism. Dockery, a state senator from Lakeland, was trying to talk along that thin line when she made her comment. But we consulted the Florida Constitution, and several experts, and could find no such amendment. Rather, the experts told us that the fate of near-offshore drilling is in the hands of the Florida Legislature, which in the 1980s adopted a ban in state waters. It was passed "in the wake of the Exxon-Valdez spill by the Florida Legislature" and designed to protect their coastal waters, said Mark Ferrullo, executive director of Progress Florida, a drilling opponent. The lack of a constitutional protection is "why they’re trying to do it through legislation" in a bill that was tabled April 16. So we checked with candidate Dockery, who explained why we couldn’t find the relevant constitutional amendment: Because it doesn’t exist. "I meant to say a statutory ban but I misspoke," the state senator wrote in an April 19 e-mail. She cited the Florida statute that specifies the restrictions. The statute prohibits oil and gas drilling leases within Florida's ocean boundaries, while the feds have jurisdiction outside that boundary. One expert we consulted, advocate Adam Rivera at Environmental Florida, which likewise opposes drilling, wondered if the senator’s soundbite was actually "wishful thinking on her part -- and ours. Hey, if she’s looking to get that process started, we’re right there with her." To be sure, it was an error. But Dockery owned up to the mistake when PolitiFact Florida inquired about it. So we rate the claim False.	None	Paula Dockery	None	None	None	2010-04-20T18:35:26	2010-04-05	['None']
pomt-10942	"Barack Obama: I'm 'the First Sitting American President to Come From Kenya.'"	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/25/supremeinsidercom/did-obama-admit-being-born-kenya/	A website revived suspicion of Barack Obama’s birthplace by using a quote from the former president’s recent visit to Kenya out of context. The headline published on Supremeinsider.com says, "Barack Obama: I’m ‘the First Sitting American President to Come From Kenya’ (Video)." Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961, to Barack Obama Sr., who is Kenyan, and Ann Dunham, of Kansas. The story comes with a one-minute video from Obama’s visit in Kenya in mid July 2018. Obama was in the country for the launch of a sports and training center founded by his sister, Auma Obama, through her Sauti Kuu Foundation. The next stop on his African trip was South Africa where he delivered the annual Mandela Lecture in Johannesburg. The clip from the grand opening of the center in Kogelo shows him saying, "Three years ago, I visited Kenya as the first sitting American president to come from Kenya." He’s talking about a July 2015 trip to Kenya and Ethiopia for the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit. Obama did use those words (check the 5:50-minute mark of this video). But it doesn’t support the impression the article gives, which is that birther claims should be re-investigated because Obama admitted he "comes from Kenya." The article frames his comment as a "slip." The article goes on to cite an Economist/YouGov.com poll — from Decembrer 2016 — that found one-third of Americans don’t believe Obama was born in Hawaii. Of the 1,345 people polled about the statement "President Obama was born in Kenya," 12 percent responded Definitely True and 24 percent responded Probably True. The article uses this doubt coupled with Obama’s admission in his speech to suggest that there’s some truth to claims that he was born in Kenya. The article later calls for an investigation into the matter to find out if Obama was ever eligible to be president. "I still want it investigated if he was even born here and eligible to be President! He could be thrown in jail and all he owns confiscated and sold!!" Alex Hall wrote. We wanted to look into the claim and see if Obama really said he was the first sitting president to come from Kenya. It turns out he did. Obama released a birth certificate back in 2011 when he was pressured by Donald Trump and the birther movement. The article also includes a tweet from Obama’s brother Malik Obama that includes a Kenyan birth certificate that’s supposed to document birth details of the former president. We debunked this back in 2009 with a fact-check where a Kenyan official confirms the certificate is phony. The article doesn’t consider that the former president is describing his heritage rather than alluding to his father’s home country being his actual place of birth. (We reached out to Obama’s adviser Eric Schultz for a comment and received no response.) The article takes his statement of being "from" somewhere to mean that he literally grew up there. Obama has denied being born outside of the United States on several occasions. Part of our process is to reach out to the author of claims we’re checking. The author of this story, Alex Hall, has authored nine other stories for Supreme Insider but none of them have contact information. A reverse image search of his profile photo revealed that it’s a generic photo of a man wearing a t-shirt that’s found on several other sites across the internet, such as Pinterest. Our ruling A story on Supremeinsider.com says "Barack Obama: I’m ‘the First Sitting American President to Come From Kenya’ (Video)." In the video from his speech in Kenya Obama does say he’s the "first sitting American president to come from Kenya." The article, however, goes on to suggest that this comment invalidates any past efforts Obama has made to assure that he was born in the United States and call for an investigation. The message from Obama’s speech was misinterpreted to mean he was born and/or raised in Kenya when he was actually saying that he is of Kenyan heritage. There’s no evidence to prove Obama was not born in the United States. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13410	Hillary Clinton said, "with a straight face, that the terrorist attacks this weekend were caused by Donald J. Trump"	half-true	/georgia/statements/2016/sep/23/newt-gingrich/gingrich-spins-clintons-words-trump-and-terrorism/	The recent terrorist incidents in New York City, New Jersey and Minnesota immediately became part of the backdrop of the 2016 president campaign. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton jumped into the fray along with their surrogates, including former Georgian and U.S. Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich, who is backing Trump, said Hillary Clinton had tried to somehow blame the attacks on Trump. Gingrich was making a larger point about how the war on terror began with the Iranian hostage crisis in the late 1970s and accelerated up through the growth of ISIS. All of this, Gingrich said, was before Trump came on the political scene. "How deranged does Hillary Clinton have to be to say, with a straight face, that the terrorist attacks this weekend were caused by Donald J. Trump," Gingrich wrote Sept. 29 on a Facebook post accompanied by video of his speech. "We're in a life and death struggle with extremists who seek to destroy us, and this is Hillary's response?" The rhetoric was indeed flying fast and furious in wake of the weekend attacks. But did Clinton really say Trump caused the bombing? PolitiFact decided to take a look. We contacted the Clinton campaign and got this response from spokesman Josh Schwerin: "She never said that." The Gingrich camp said Gingrich based his comments on Clinton’s statement at a press event on Monday, which focused on the terror attacks over the weekend. A bomb exploded in New York City injuring several dozen people. Pipe bombs were also found in New Jersey and a man stabbed several shoppers at a Minnesota mall by a man who asked several if they were Muslim. The Minnesota stabber was shot and killed. A suspect in the New York and New Jersey incidents, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was shot by police and taken into custody. Gingrich spokesman Joe Desantis emailed that in the aftermath of the attacks Clinton launched into a "tirade" at a press event in which she connected Trump to terrorist recruiting and by inference to the attacks. "We know that a lot of the rhetoric we’ve heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS, because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam rather than a war against jihadists, violent terrorists, people who number in the maybe tens of thousands, not but tens of millions," Clinton said. She added that some of Trump’s incendiary comments about Muslims have been used as an online recruiting tool for terrorists. PoiltiFact has looked at that allegation previously and ruled it True. Desantis said the specifics of what Clinton said connected to the context in which they were said backs up Gingrich’s statement. "She is clearly arguing that Mr. Trump is making it easier for ISIS and other terrorist groups to recruit and conduct attacks on the United States like the ones carried out in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota this weekend," he said. "Hence she is blaming Trump for the attacks this weekend." We ran both arguments by a couple of political scientists types with no dog in the fight, including Kerwin Swint of Kennesaw State in metro Atlanta. "Typical politics, from both sides," Swint said. "Although Clinton didn't use those exact words, she has pretty clearly said that Trump's words are helping ISIS and leading to greater danger. Gingrich's comments, although exaggerated, are not inaccurate, especially when all of Clinton's comments are put into context." Political scientist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, said Gingrich veered off base when he used the verb "caused." "Her point was that Trump’s call for a ban on Muslims and other statements (such as his preferred policy of killing the family members of terrorists and using waterboarding) hand ISIS some propaganda arguments to employ in their recruiting and communications with Muslim populations," Sabato said. Our ruling Trump surrogate and former Georgian Newt Gingrich recently posted on Facebook that Hillary Clinton said the New York terrorist attacks were caused by Donald J. Trump. She certainly did not say that directly. Clinton did link past Trump comments about Muslims to recruiting efforts that aid terrorists in a general sense. Gingrich takes Clinton’s attack and applies a bit of political spin to come up with the charge that Clinton accused Trump of causing the recent attacks. We rate Gingrich’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e7389b4e-5d4c-488f-a965-bd524be4df31	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2016-09-23T06:00:00	2016-09-19	['Donald_Trump']
pomt-12635	"As an undocumented immigrant, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/29/florida-immigrant-coalition/do-undocumented-immigrants-have-constitutional-rig/	As the Florida Legislature considers legislation to increase penalties for undocumented immigrants who have committed certain crimes, legislators and activists have pondered this question: What are the constitutional rights of these immigrants? HB 83 would increase penalties for certain violent offenses -- including sexual battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, murder, and the use of a destructive device such as a bomb -- if the defendant was in the country illegally. The bill still has several hurdles before it reaches Gov. Rick Scott’s desk. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, argued at a March 27 House subcommittee hearing that the courts will ultimately have to rule on whether the legislation is constitutional. Based on some court decisions, Eagle said it is "unclear if non-citizens can enjoy the same constitutional rights as citizens" although he said that everyone is entitled to constitutional protections for due process. Francesca Menes, director of policy and advocacy for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, disagreed with Eagle. "As an undocumented immigrant, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States," she said, "and that has been said over and over in the courts, that they do have constitutional rights." We found that undocumented immigrants do have constitutional rights -- but not all of the rights of citizens. (We have previously fact-checked a claim about whether unlawful presence in the United States is not a crime, a claim we ruled Mostly True.) Some rights, but not all A spokeswoman for the Florida Immigrant Coalition pointed to an article by an author of immigration books about constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants. We interviewed several legal scholars who agreed that undocumented immigrants have many constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, and if arrested, a right to a Miranda warning. "There is no question that all persons in the United States including unauthorized migrants enjoy the protections of the Constitution," said Gabriel (Jack) Chin, law professor at University of California-Davis. "There is no debate about that among legal scholars." The Fifth Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment protects everyone from deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law, Chin said. There have been several court decisions dating back more than a century that outline the rights of undocumented immigrants. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Zadvydas vs. Davis (2001) that "once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the due process clause applies to all persons within the United States." In a Texas case, Plyler vs. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that non-citizen children must get a free K-12 education. But undocumented immigrants don’t share all of the rights held by citizens -- for example, they can’t vote in state and national elections. And Fordham law professor Jennifer Gordon said that some undocumented immigrants get almost no due process in removal proceedings. In 1996, Congress created expedited removal for undocumented immigrants without a hearing. Initially it only applied at the U.S. border. Then it was expanded to within 100 miles of a border for undocumented immigrants who had been in the country less than 14 days. President Donald Trump announced in January that his administration will apply the program anywhere in the United States to undocumented immigrants present less than two years. "In the past, the government has largely prevailed when such programs have been challenged," Gordon said. "However, the Trump administration is proposing to expand some of these programs to include many more undocumented immigrants; it remains to be seen if the expansion will be upheld." The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule by June on whether undocumented immigrants in custody for deportation proceedings have a bond right to a hearing if their cases haven’t been dealt with in a timely manner. The ACLU filed the case on behalf of immigrants detained for more than six months. While defendants in criminal proceedings have a Sixth Amendment right to a government-appointed attorney if they are poor, that right doesn’t extend to immigration court, where the violations are considered civil and not criminal, said Cornell law professor Stephen W. Yale-Loehr. "Yes, immigrants do have constitutional rights, but those rights are not equal to U.S. citizens," he said. "They have due process rights, but when it comes to immigration court proceedings, those rights are often watered down by courts." Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, said that although undocumented immigrants have constitutional rights, the question with the Florida law is whether it "intrudes into the federal regulatory scheme." When ruling on a case involving Arizona’s immigration law, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states can't enhance penalties for immigration violations but can ask for immigration status or ask the federal government to verify a suspect's status. "Now, if the bill punishes criminal felonies, not immigration infractions, giving harsher punishments to illegal aliens, then I think it would be vulnerable to an equal protection challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment," Shapiro said. Our ruling Menes, speaking on behalf of the Florida Immigrant Coalition said, "As an undocumented immigrant, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States." Undocumented immigrants have many constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and religion. But they don’t share all the constitutional rights of citizens. For example, some undocumented immigrants in removal proceedings have not gotten due process in court, and they don’t have a right to a government-paid lawyer in immigration court.

The company did not admit wrongdoing, but paid $450 million in settlements to resolve the claims. Washington University Law professor Kathleen Clark said that referring to the settlement as a victory is accurate, and characterized the settlement sum as an impressive feat. Was it one of the biggest in Medicare fraud history, though? When we asked Evans’ campaign what they meant by private lawsuit, they said they were referring to lawsuits filed under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers’ main vehicle to sue on behalf of the federal government for Medicare fraud when the government does not intervene. Justice Department spokesperson Nicole Navas confirmed Evans’ statement. "DaVita recovery was one of the largest ever obtained by a relator in a matter declined by the United States," Navas said. There have been larger settlements, but only when the government has gone after fraud directly. In this case, the Justice Department chose not to intervene. Navas declined to comment on why they didn’t participate. "It shouldn’t be taken as a government determination that the case doesn’t have merit," Clark said, noting the government has limited resources to pursue such cases. Lin Wood, the lead counsel on the case, said the government likely was unaware of all the details of the case when it decided not to pursue a lawsuit. "We developed a tremendous body of factual evidence that I believe the government was unaware of at the time they made their decision," Wood said. He said the government would have likely intervened otherwise. When the government doesn’t intervene, clients are entitled to no less than 25 percent and no more than 30 percent of the settlement; according to Wood and Evans, they received 28 percent. The remainder, 72 percent or $324 million, went to the government. Wood called Evans an integral part of the case, and characterized the other two firms as having played a minor role. We wondered if that money went directly to taxpayers, as Evans said in the video. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed with Evans’ wording that the money went to taxpayers, which he called a proxy for the treasury. Reducing the treasury’s deficit translates to a benefit to taxpayers. "The taxes that individual citizens pay is not reduced nor does the money go directly into service benefitting people," Ellis said. "But a smaller deficit means it is less likely that taxes are raised or services cut." Our rating Evans said that she "helped win one of the biggest private lawsuits against Medicare fraud in history." The lead counsel on the case corroborated her role in it, and the Justice Department confirmed its historic importance. Her claim that they recovered $324 million for taxpayers also checks out.

pomt-11823	The Republican tax bill is "not being scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as it is traditionally."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/13/richard-durbin/dick-durbin-wrong-gop-tax-bill-hasnt-had-independe/	Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., offered several arguments against Republican efforts to pass a tax bill during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union, including the impact of the deduction for state and local taxes and its effects on the balance of federal revenues and spending. But one criticism was procedural, echoing earlier Democratic complaints that Republican bills to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act had been crafted behind closed doors and without normal steps such as committee hearings. "And let me tell you, there is a reason why this plan has been prepared in secret, why it's not being scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as it is traditionally," Durbin told host Jake Tapper. "It's because it doesn't add up." Does Durbin have a point that the CBO has been unusually absent in this process? Not by the way ordinary viewers would hear it. The Senate Democratic whip, Dick Durbin of Illinois, appeared on CNN's State of the Union on Nov. 12, 2017. The CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching office, best known for its detailed analyses of pending legislation. However, there’s one exception to CBO’s role in vetting proposed legislation: tax bills. That duty falls instead to a similar, nonpartisan congressional office known as the Joint Committee on Taxation. "The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the Joint Committee (on Taxation) to provide revenue estimates for all tax legislation considered by either the House or the Senate," the committee’s website explains. "Such estimates are the official congressional estimates for reported tax legislation." And by the time Durbin had made his comment to Tapper, the joint committee had already published analyses of the House version of the tax bill. On Nov. 9, the committee published an analysis of the bill’s revenue impact. Two days later, the committee published two other analyses, including one on how the bill would affect various segments of the income spectrum. The joint committee "has scored versions of both the House and Senate bills," said Eric Toder, a co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "And they are the official scorekeepers for tax legislation." As it happens, CBO has also published one analysis of the bill, addressing estimated deficits and debt. But even this is based heavily on the Joint Committee on Taxation’s work, said Douglas Elmendorf, a former Democratic-appointed CBO director who now serves as dean of Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. The joint committee "provides the official estimates to Congress of the effects of proposed changes in the Internal Revenue Code," Elmendorf said. "When a tax bill is voted out of committee, CBO releases an official cost estimate because CBO’s statutory responsibility is to provide estimates for all bills voted out of committee – but that estimate is simply JCT’s numbers with a CBO letterhead, and with due credit given to JCT in the text of the estimate." In other words, Elmendorf said, "the Republicans are doing their duty." Durbin’s defense When we contacted Durbin’s office, spokesman Ben Marter pointed to a narrower interpretation of Durbin’s words. He said that in the Senate, Republicans have a potential problem with the Byrd rule, which determines whether a bill can be taken up under "reconciliation," a process that effectively requires only 51 votes rather than 60 votes for passage. That violation would have to be fixed before their bill can move in the Senate, but the "fix" to address future revenue projections "is being written in secret, and we likely won’t see that until the bill is on the floor in the form of a substitute amendment, as they did with their health care bill," Marter said. Such a substitute amendment would become the bill, Marter said, and under the budget resolution, Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., "could waive the requirement for a full score analysis before it’s voted on." An important point to remember about the Durbin team’s analysis: It’s based on speculation about future events. Durbin’s literal words gave viewers a different story -- that the Republicans are already blocking CBO from scoring the bill -- and that is incorrect on at least two levels. Our ruling Durbin said the Republican tax bill is "not being scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as it is traditionally." Under the most obvious interpretation of that statement, Durbin is incorrect. The nonpartisan analysis for tax bills is actually a task handled by the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the committee has been actively analyzing the Republican tax bills. We rate the statement False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Correction, Nov. 13, 2017: This fact-check previously misstated Durbin's title.

pomt-00085	"Pipe bomber suspect pictured last year with Izzy Hernandez. ... a Democrat Donor/Supporter."	mostly false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/01/blog-posting/viral-photo-does-not-show-pipe-bomb-suspect-cesar-/	A viral photo depicting Cesar Sayoc, a supporter of President Donald Trump who was charged Monday with five federal crimes in connection with 14 explosive packages sent to Democrats and CNN, claims he’s pictured with a "Democrat Donor." The photo shows Sayoc smiling next to a man, and has been shared thousands of times by users on Twitter, Facebook and 4Chan. In an Oct. 27 Facebook post that was shared over 44,000 times, a user named Alan Reynolds posted the photo and wrote: "PIPE BOMBER SUSPECT pictured last year with Izzy Hernandez. Sayok does not appear destitute. In addition, why would a Trump enthusiast attend a banquet and have a photo OP with a Democrat Donor/Supporter? Facebook keeps trying to take down this photo,,,pls share this ASAP!" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Reynolds’ did not immediately reply to a message asking for evidence to justify his claim. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter even shared the image on Oct. 28, retweeting a tweet that included it, and wrote, "Why do Facebook & Twitter immediately delete accounts of nuts at all? So we can rely on the media to tell us what they've posted? Why not let everyone see?" Facebook and Twitter removed Sayoc’s social media accounts Friday, The New York Times reported. Here is what we know While the image appears to show Sayoc, it’s unclear who the man smiling next to him in the photo is. Users on message boards like 4Chan have pointed out that it’s possibly a North Carolina soccer coach named Israel Hernandez. Indeed, it appears Sayoc did have a personal relationship with a man named Israel "Izzy" Hernandez: They were soccer buddies. The New York Times reported that Sayoc attended Brevard College in North Carolina, "for a year beginning in the fall of 1980 and played on the soccer team but did not graduate, according to a spokeswoman." In a digital archive of Brevard College’s 1981 yearbook, "The Pertelote," a student named Cesar Sayoc appears on pages 152 and 155, in a team photo and playing soccer. The caption of one photo reads, "Cesar Sayoc extends after a shot to the goal." A student named Cesar Sayoc also appears in Brevard College’s 1982 yearbook on pages 77 and 136, again in photos of the school’s soccer team. Following Sayoc’s arrest, former Brevard College soccer coach Don Scarborough on Oct. 26 spoke to WRAL-TV NBC affiliate in Raleigh, North Carolina, about his experience coaching Sayoc. In it, Scarborough mentions that North Carolina Soccer Hall of Famer Israel "Izzy" Hernandez was on the same team as Sayoc and that the two were "friends." "Cesar was just one of the guys. I mean looking back on it, I think that soccer team that he was on for two years was the best family and the only family that maybe he had during his life. And to hear what has happened in the last while with Cesar is just heartbreaking," Scarborough told WRAL-TV. Scarborough said the last time he saw Sayoc was about "four or five years ago" when Sayoc visited Brevard to attend Scarborough’s induction into the Athletic Hall of Fame. In that same According to the Brevard College Tornados’ website, Scarborough was inducted in 2015. A profile on a coach named Israel "Izzy" Hernandez, who was inducted into the North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame in 2009, says that he spent his first two years of college from 1980-82 at Brevard College — the same time that Scarborough was a coach and that Sayoc was on the soccer team. A 2007 Sports Illustrated article also profiles Hernandez’s coaching achievements. And in 2006, the News & Observer in Raleigh, NC, published a profile of the Cuban-born Hernandez, a piece that included his full name: Israel Abel Hernandez, then age 44. ‘Dem Donor’ Izzy Hernandez? We searched campaign donor records and couldn’t find donations by anyone that seemed to fit the profile of Israel Abel Hernandez, who appears to be Sayoc’s old soccer buddy. The Federal Election Commission database of individual political contributions show 27 recent campaign donations made by people named Israel Hernandez — six made during 2017-18 and 21 made in 2016-17. Of those, none of the people named Israel Hernandez are from North Carolina. We searched the FEC’s database a little more, this time going all the way back to 1985-86 and found no one from North Carolina by the name of Israel Hernandez who made any campaign donations in any of those years. Nor did we find any documentation by donations of anyone by the name of "Izzy Hernandez" in any of the years going back to 1985-86. Similarly, opensecrets.org, which draws its data from the FEC, shows no record of any political donations coming from an Israel or Izzy Hernandez from North Carolina for any election cycle going back to 1990. The voter who is registered under the name "Israel Abel Hernandez" — the same full name of soccer coach and Brevard College alumnus who was profiled in 2006 in the News & Observer — is listed as politically "unaffiliated." We tried to reach Izzy Abel Hernandez, but were not able to locate him by phone. Our ruling A viral photo claims that pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc was photographed with a Democratic donor named Izzy Hernandez. We don’t know for sure who the man in the photo is. But his photo resembles those of a man named Israel Hernandez, a former soccer coach who played soccer on the same teams Cesar Sayoc once played on and later became inducted into the North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame. While it does appear Sayoc is pictured with a man named Israel "Izzy" Hernandez, we don’t find any indication that Hernandez is a Democrat or a donor to Democratic campaigns. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-11-01T06:57:01	2018-10-27	['None']
pomt-05965	A typical married couple "will contribute $119,000" into Medicare but will "receive $357,000 in Medicare benefits over their lifetimes."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/24/bob-corker/tennessee-sen-bob-corker-says-typical-couple-takes/	As Congress wrestles with ways to cut the federal deficit, lawmakers are floating ideas on how to put the country back on the path to fiscal stability and long-term growth. U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., suggested in a USA Today column that Medicare reform should be part of the solution. Corker, who is up for re-election this cycle, argued that Medicare is on an unsustainable path, in part because Medicare beneficiaries are receiving far more benefits than they are paying into the system. "According to a recent study by the Urban Institute, a married couple each making $43,500 per year will contribute $119,000, including their employer contributions, into Medicare during their time in the workforce and receive $357,000 in Medicare benefits over their lifetimes," Corker wrote. "Common sense tells us this math doesn't add up: Medicare beneficiaries are receiving far more in benefits than they are paying in." The statistic was so striking -- that the government pays twice as much in benefits as people pay in Medicare taxes -- we wondered if the senator was correctly characterizing the study’s findings. On Nov. 1, PolitiFact Ohio looked closely at the report after U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio and a member of the "super committee" that ultimately failed to approve a deficit reduction plan, cited the same statistic. For years, the Urban Institute, a policy think tank that focuses on issues such as taxes, social programs and justice, has been calculating the disparity between the lifetime value of Medicare benefits and the taxes paid into the program. The institute’s most recent report by fellow Eugene Steurle, a former Treasury Department official, and the institute’s Stephanie Rennane, was published early this year and subsequently updated. Essentially, the study calculated how much a single person or a married couple at various income levels would pay into Medicare during their time in the workforce and how much in benefits they would receive over their lifetimes. For a two-income couple in which both partners earned an average wage ($43,500 each in 2011) and retired in 2011, the study concluded they would pay $119,000 in Medicare taxes and receive $357,000 in benefits. The disparity was even larger for a single-income couple. "Over a wide range of scenarios, beneficiaries retiring at age 65 in 2011 can expect to receive dramatically more in total benefits than they have paid in dedicated taxes," the report concluded. "If only one member of the couple had worked, we calculate a six-fold difference between contributions and benefits since both spouses are eligible for Medicare yet only one has paid taxes." The disparity has been noted by other researchers as well. One study by the Congressional Budget Office in 1983 found an even greater disparity than that cited by the Urban Institute. We find that Corker’s description of the study merits a True rating on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-10208	Education Week says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' is 'elusive' on accountability, and a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.'	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/11/john-mccain/education-ad-is-incomplete/	John McCain released an ad this week making the accusation that Barack Obama supports sex education for five-year-olds. Here's what the ad says: " Education Week says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' that he's 'elusive' on accountability, a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.'" As the announcer mentions those last two phrases, "elusive" and "a staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly," logos appear of the Washington Post for the first phrase and the Chicago Tribune for the second. Then the announcer continues: "Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners. Learning about sex before learning to read? Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family." We looked at the claim about sex ed for kindergartners in a different statement and found it Pants on Fire! Here, we'll look at what Education Week said about Obama. Education Week did write that Obama "hasn't made a significant mark on education," but the phrase is plucked out of its original context. It's is from a long article written during the Democratic primary that reviewed Obama's positions on education, particularly in comparison with the other Democratic candidates. Here's the full quote: "In his eight years in the state Senate and two years in the U.S. Senate, Mr. Obama hasn't made a significant mark on education policy. In Illinois, his biggest accomplishments were in reforming state ethics rules and capital punishment. He did promote early-childhood initiatives that advocates considered 'innovative and progressive,' said Betsy D. Mitchell, a lobbyist for the Illinois Association for the Education of Young Children. "His biggest accomplishment in the field was the creation of a state board to oversee the expansion of early-childhood education in the state, Ms. Mitchell said." So Education Week did write the words "hasn't made a significant mark on education," but it was not as disparaging a remark as the ad makes it out to be. The audio portion of the ad is misleading because Education Week did not say Obama was "elusive" or a "staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly." People who only hear the audio portion of the ad will not know that those two phrases are attributed to other publications. And, more significantly, those last two quotes come from opinion columns not news stories, which isn't made clear in the audio or video. The "elusive" description is from a July 7, 2008, Washington Post editorial that says both candidates have fuzzy education proposals. "Mr. McCain has not been forthcoming with any detailed plan; he is said to be preparing one for the fall. Mr. Obama, as the New York Times' David Brooks recently observed, has promised dozens of crowd-pleasing programs but has been elusive on such thorny issues as teacher tenure and school accountability," said the editorial. The charge that Obama is a "staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly" comes from a Chicago Tribune opinion piece by Steve Chapman. That brief quote does accurately capture the substance of Chapman's piece, which criticizes Obama for not embracing school vouchers. The ad gives the idea that Education Week doesn't think much of Obama's education policy, and some casual listeners would think all three quotes were from the publication, which is not the case. In fact, two of them come from opinion pieces, a fact that should be made clear so viewers can decide for themselves how to judge them. Only one of the statements accurately captures the sentiments of the article it's taken from. For all of these problems, we rate this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15172	"The policy mistakes that ... the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/25/julius-jones/black-lives-matter-activist-says-clintons-passed-p/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a glimpse of her approach to issues affecting African-Americans in a tense exchange with Black Lives Matter activists that was recorded and spread across social media. Clinton told Boston-area organizers Julius Jones and Daunasia Yancey that she didn’t believe in "changing hearts" on issues of racial justice but in changing laws and reallocating resources instead. Jones and Yancey expressed concern about Clinton’s remarks on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show the next week. "She doesn’t actually feel like you can move this issue forward other than through policy," Jones said, "even though the policy mistakes that she and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration." We wanted to see if Jones was right to blame the Clintons for the United States’ prison woes. We reached out to Jones, who identifies himself as the founder of Black Lives Matter Worcester, and Black Lives Matter Boston to clarify what Jones meant, but we did not hear back from either source. The underlying policy, however, is well-known. The question is how much it contributed to the growth of America’s prison population. As we'll see, the growth of the prison population started well before the federal law. A ‘tough-on-crime environment’ As Jones suggests, the United States has the highest incarceration rate among developed nations, at around 700 prisoners per 100,000 people. African-Americans in particular are locked up at disproportionate rates. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 37 percent of the 1.5 million men in state and federal prisons in 2013 were black, more than twice the percentage of their share of the population. It wasn’t always this high; before 1975, the incarceration rate hovered around 200 prisoners. Some of the growth had to do with Clinton policies, but experts said not all. Crime policy during the 1970s and 1980s was driven by the "War on Drugs," an initiative launched by President Richard Nixon in 1971. Nixon famously called drug abuse "public enemy No. 1," which led to tougher sentencing and more arrests. New York passed the nation’s first mandatory minimums for drug offenses in 1973, and Washington passed the first state-level truth-in-sentencing law in 1984. By 1987, five states had adopted sentencing guidelines for judges to follow. President Bill Clinton took office in January 1993 touting a "tough-on-crime" agenda in response to an increase in violent crime and swelling homicide numbers. High-profile killings, such as the murder of Polly Klaas, followed later that year. Bill Clinton was instrumental in the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden, the sweeping crime bill provided $10 billion to fund new prisons, $6.1 billion for crime prevention and money for 100,000 new police officers. It also enforced harsher sentencing in federal prisons and incentivized the creation of "truth-in-sentencing" laws at the state level. These laws require violent offenders to serve a minimum portion of their original sentence by ruling out the possibility of early parole. Under the bill, states that set this minimum at 85 percent of the sentence were granted funding for new prisons, and by 1998, 27 states and the District of Columbia had qualified. The president took the final minutes of his first State of the Union to lobby for the bill. Hillary Clinton, too, campaigned for the legislation in speeches and interviews across the country. The bill ultimately found wide support among Democrats and a handful of Republicans. Just five years after the crime bill was passed, 29 states had truth-in-sentencing laws, and 24 had three strikes laws. The bill’s effect So did the crime bill lead to mass incarceration? The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population, has tracked the massive expansion of people in federal, local and state prisons over the past century. Yes, the overall inmate population of the United States has grown significantly since 1994. But the sharp upward trend actually started in the early 1980s. Prisons were adding inmates in 1990 at about the same rate they were in 1997, three years after the crime bill became law. In addition, the bill’s new sentencing standards only directly applied to federal cases. But most of the growth since 1980 has taken place within state systems, which have added almost 1.25 million prisoners over that time. So even though the number of people in federal prison has grown, perhaps as a result of those new standards, federal prisoners represent only a small fraction of the national prison population’s overall growth. And while the bill incentivized truth-in-sentencing laws at the state level, many states had already enacted harsher laws on their own by 1994, said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, a prison policy think tank. Mauer said it’s hard to place the onus of responsibility solely on the Clinton-backed crime bill because the trend towards mass incarceration started as early as 1980. "(The bill) is sometimes unfairly viewed as being the major factor that has contributed to high incarceration rates," he said. So what really drove up the inmate population? "Criminal justice policy leading up to the crime bill was driven by the ‘War on Drugs’ and the desire to appear ‘tough on crime’ by focusing on punishment and retribution, not rehabilitation," said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice, an advocacy and research group that published a retrospective on the bill in 2014. Still, the 1994 bill was the single biggest legislative victory for the tough-on-crime movement. It "certainly didn’t help" the mass incarceration epidemic, Turner said. Crime rates have been on the decline since the early 1990s, making today’s high incarceration levels even more apparent. In the past few years, the Clintons have backtracked on the policies they once championed. The former president seems to regret the bill’s passage. "I signed a bill that made the problem worse," he recently told the NAACP. "And I want to admit that." Hillary Clinton has also called for changes to the justice system during her presidential campaign, saying in an April 2015 speech that "we don't want to create another 'incarceration generation.' " Clinton's campaign highlighted its transcript of her exchange with Black Lives Matter activists where she concedes that "what was tried and how it was implemented has not produced the kinds of outcomes that any of us would want." Our ruling Jones said, "The policy mistakes that (Hillary) and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration." While Hillary Clinton as first lady had no official role in voting for or signing the 1994 crime bill, she certainly championed some of its policies that are now partially blamed for the growth of the prison population, such as longer, tougher prison sentences. The crime bill was not the root cause of this growth, however, as America’s prison population had been expanding since the late 1980s. We rate Jones’ statement Half True.

pomt-12417	"The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/may/19/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-partly-right-first-congress-required-able/	To whoops and applause, Ted Cruz told National Rifle Association members there was a time that Congress required men to own guns. In his April 28, 2017, speech, which the association live-streamed on Facebook, the Texas Republican pointed out that muskets were vital in American revolutionary times and "what everybody carried into combat." "Anyone know the first gun control laws in the United States?" Cruz went on. "The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket. That’s gun control Founding Fathers’ style." Congressional historian, records After unsuccessfully seeking Cruz’s historical backup, we turned to a George Washington University historian, Kenneth Russell Bowling, who told us by phone he was fresh off contributing to the publication of 22 volumes of papers related to the earliest years of Congress. Bowling said Cruz was likely reflecting on a measure passed into law by the nation’s second Congress in 1792. To get a fix on that, Bowling suggested that we consult record-keepers at the Library of Congress where, by email, a librarian who went unidentified pointed us to documentation of the Second Militia Act of 1792, approved by Congress on May 8, 1792 — six days after passage of the Militia Act of 1792 (which was repealed in 1795) giving the president authority to call out state militias to repel U.S. invasions and to do so in the case of state insurrections at the request of state officials or on approval of a federal district judge or an associate justice of the Supreme Court. The second act required "each and every free able-bodied white male citizen" aged 18 through 44 to enroll in his state militia within the next year with the exception of the vice president, other federally elected officials and specified workers such as "all ferrymen employed at any ferry on the post road" as well as individuals exempted by state laws. Commanders were to continue enrolling eligible men in coming years, the law said. Per Cruz’s claim, the law said every enrolled man "shall within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball..."

Action by the nation’s second Congress wasn’t that far-reaching.

pomt-02412	Sarah Eckhardt "refused to take her own pay increases repeatedly."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/06/change-austinorg/sarah-eckhardt-twice-declined-pay-raises-county-co/	Sarah Eckhardt, chosen by voters in March 2014 as the Democratic nominee for Travis County judge, earlier drew fire from her primary opponent, Andy Brown, for voting to increase her own pay several times. We wondered about that, especially after a political group favoring Eckhardt for the executive post sent an email blast declaring that Eckhardt had declined pay raises. ChangeAustin.org said in its Feb. 26, 2014, email blast that Eckhardt, who served as the Precinct 2 county commissioner from 2007 through May 2013 before resigning to run for judge, "refused to take her own pay increases repeatedly." By email, a founder of the group, Brian Rodgers, said that he knew Eckhardt did so because he closely observed the commissioners court during her time there. Genevieve Van Cleve, a consultant to Eckhardt’s campaign, suggested we asked Leslie Browder, who manages budget and planning for the county, about Eckhardt’s pay-raise history. By email, Browder sent us a chart showing each commissioner’s salary since 2007 plus several county public-notice advertisements related to pay raises approved by the commissioners court during Eckhardt’s tenure. Eckhardt, who won re-election in 2010, had her annual pay bump up twice in her tenure. According to the chart, her salary went from $83,716 to $86,646 in October 2008 and to $88,812 as of two years later through her resignation in 2013. Over the period, according to the chart, the commissioners court approved four pay raises for the four commissioners. If Eckhardt’s salary had risen along with that of two colleagues who similarly started at $83,716, Precinct 1 Commissioner Ron Davis and Precinct 4 Commissioner Margaret Gomez, it would have been $98,463 as of October 2013, nearly $10,000 more than it was. But Eckhardt didn't always say no to higher pay. The chart and the public-notice ads, which appeared in the Austin Chronicle, indicate that Eckhardt completely declined a raise in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2013. However, Eckhardt accepted percentage increases equal to the percentage increases approved for all the commissioners as of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, though she did not sign off on catching up to the highest commissioner salaries. Browder confirmed that analysis. Eckhardt’s pay actually varied a bit more, though we didn’t spot anything indicating she slipped in a pay raise extra. A chart and other documents emailed to us by the county auditor, Nicki Riley, show that Eckhardt’s annual pay in her years as a commissioner bounced from $83,716 to $90,109 to $79,890 and then $88,812. Some of this variation ties to the the auditor’s chart covering calendar years, combining different fiscal years, which begin in October. Also, Eckhardt told us by phone, she was mistakenly paid more than she wanted to receive in fiscal 2009. She said that she subsequently repaid the county to keep her pay through the fiscal year at $86,646. Van Cleve emailed us a copy of a Sept. 3, 2010, memo from Eckhardt to Charles Vaughn, then the county’s payroll manager, stating: "I was paid $90,108.76 in FY09 although my advertised salary was ($)86,646. I therefore include the enclosed check for the difference of $3,462.76 written to the county." Per her past pay, Eckhardt otherwise deferred to Browder. Our ruling ChangeAustin.org said that as a Travis County commissioner, Eckhardt "refused to take her own pay increases repeatedly." In two fiscal years, 2008 and 2013, Eckhardt completely declined pay raises, while in fiscal 2009 and 2011, she accepted percentage raises equal to the percentage hikes approved for all commissioners, though Eckhardt's pay did not catch up to the highest level she could have reached.

pomt-08033	"It's taken more time to complete the Towpath Trail than it did to build the (Ohio & Erie) Canal."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/06/dan-moore/metroparks-commissioner-dan-moore-knows-his-canal-/	When Cuyahoga County Probate Court Judge Anthony J. Russo started 2011 by appointing entrepreneur Dan T. Moore III to the Cleveland Metroparks Board, he cited Moore's knowledge of the Towpath Trail as one key factor. The original Towpath Trail -- constructed 175 years ago as part of the Ohio & Erie Canal -- was a simple dirt path on which mules walked to tow canal boats. The modern-day version is a multi-purpose trail of asphalt and crushed limestone open to hikers, cyclists and, in some sections, horseback riders. When completed, the trail will stretch 101 miles from the Lake Erie shore in Cleveland to New Philadelphia. More than 80 miles are done. Obstacles including railroad tracks and industrial contamination have made it difficult to complete the remaining fragments in Cleveland, Akron and Barberton. Moore, who rides the trail regularly, called it "a wonderful, magical and phenomenal resource. "Unfortunately," he said, "it's taken more time to complete the Towpath Trail than it did to build the Canal, and that's tragic. We need to cut through the politics. I think less talk and more doing is a good idea." That caught the attention of PolitiFact Ohio. We knew that completing the Towpath Trail became more of a marathon than a walk in the park. But has it really taken longer to complete than it took to build the original canal? We thought it might be a good time for a brief history lesson. The Ohio & Erie Canal was 308 miles long. Its main channels were 26 feet wide at the base and 40 feet wide at the water line. It was built before the steam shovel was invented, so to construct the canal, laborers had to chop a path through the forest and then dig it using picks, shovels and wheelbarrows. The work started in 1825. It was finished in 1832 -- or, says the Ohio Historical Commission, "by 1833." The National Park Service started work on the Towpath Trail in the mid-1980s, a decade after President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The trail’s first segment -- a stretch through the park of nearly 20 miles -- opened in 1993. Completion of the trail in Cuyahoga County is now scheduled for 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission. The Cleveland Metroparks will handle day-to-day maintenance and security for the trail, and city of Cleveland will own the land under it. The Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition says its goal is to complete the full Towpath Trail, from Cleveland to New Philadelphia, by 2020. Adding it all up, work on the Towpath Trail started no later than 1990. The portion within Cuyahoga County -- which is the portion involving Cleveland Metroparks -- is scheduled to be finished in 2014. That’s a span of 24 years. Construction of the canal that the original towpath once serviced took seven years. We rate Moore’s statement as True.	None	Dan Moore	None	None	None	2011-01-06T06:00:00	2011-01-03	['None']
pomt-07794	"In Austin, I’ve got half-a-dozen or more schools on a list to be closed — one of which I presented a federal blue-ribbon award to for excellence. And several hundred school personnel on the list for possible terminations."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/19/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-hes-got-half-dozen-or-more-scho/	U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett landed in a Feb. 16 opinion column by Gail Collins of The New York Times that questioned draft plans by the GOP-led Texas Legislature not to hike state education aid. "In Austin," Collins quoted the Austin Democrat saying, "I’ve got half-a-dozen or more schools on a list to be closed — one of which I presented a federal blue-ribbon award to for excellence. And several hundred school personnel on the list for possible terminations." We wondered if Doggett accurately summarized the situation. Doggett’s spokeswoman, Sarah Dohl, told us by e-mail that Doggett based his comment on Austin American-Statesman news reports on a district task force’s recommendations about closing schools and the district’s recent announcement that it’s considering employee layoffs as part of an array of budget cuts. Doggett’s "blue-ribbon" reference, Dohl said, was to South Austin’s Zilker Elementary. We found a May 1999 Statesman story stating that Zilker was among three district schools that year to win the honor from the U.S. Department of Education. The story says Doggett was expected to attend the award ceremony. It quotes then-Education Secretary Richard Riley saying: "These schools are examples of the good things happening in education nationwide." Next, we turned to the Statesman’s coverage of school closure recommendations by the Austin district’s volunteer facilities task force. According to a Feb. 10 story, the task force in January specified nine schools, including Zilker, that could be closed "for efficiency’s sake." However, the story says, the task force’s recommendations to the school board would not name particular schools, instead referring to areas of the city where schools could be closed in 2012-13 and 2013-14. A link on the Statesman site led us to a Feb. 9 draft version of the task force’s district facility master plan, which urges consideration of school closures "only after all other alternatives and options, both programmatic and facilities use, have been thoroughly examined and discussed with the affected communities." No individual schools are named, but there are regional suggestions for consolidating/closing a middle school in Northeast Austin; four elementary schools in "Central East Austin"; three elementary schools in Central Austin; and one elementary school in South Austin. We called the district, whose spokesman, Andy Welch, cautioned that the district has no school-closing schedule and said its facility task force won’t present its final report until March. "So there is no list" of schools to be closed, Welch said. Still, didn’t the names of nine schools get floated for possibly closing? "Can’t deny that," Welch said. After he noted that some of the school district is outside Doggett’s House district, we ran the addresses of the schools named for possible closure through the Texas Legislative Council’s "Who Represents Me?" web feature. Eight are in Doggett’s district; Pease Elementary is in San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith’s district. Dohl of Doggett’s office said by e-mail that the congressman was aware of the updated task force report--and that it doesn’t specify individual schools to possibly close. But, Dohl said, "the school closure list seems to still be a very real issue" and Doggett believes school closures should be avoided. All told, Doggett’s comment accurately refers to Zilker Elementary and possible district layoffs. At the time he spoke, though, the task force that aired school closing suggestions had backed off the specifics. And it's not certain any schools are to be closed. We rate Doggett’s statement Mostly True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2011-02-19T06:00:00	2011-02-16	['Austin,_Texas']
pomt-04760	"Household income in America has gone down for families an average of $4,000 in the last four years" while it " went up $5,000" under Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/28/paul-ryan/ryan-says-incomes-went-down-nationally-under-obama/	After distractions over social issues and tax returns dominated the run-up to the GOP convention, Paul Ryan put the focus back on Americans’ pocketbooks at a send-off rally in his hometown. "Household income in America has gone down for families an average of $4,000 in the last four years," Ryan said in Janesville, Wis., on Aug. 27, 2012. "When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, unemployment went down and household incomes went up $5,000." Romney, too, has hammered on this theme, painting President Barack Obama as a failed leader in hard economic times. Ryan, like Romney before him, made clear in his speech that Obama should be held accountable for any income drop. (For clarity, we’ll exclude the unemployment claim.) First, the history of this line of attack. Earlier this year, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked into a claim from Romney that the median income in America had dropped by 10 percent in the last four years. At that time, the drop was $4,600 or 8.3 percent, based on a study by former Census bureau income experts at Sentier Research. We rated that claim Half True because the figure was outdated and somewhat off the mark. Also in June, we looked at a Romney surrogate’s claim that "the average income for a family in Massachusetts went up by $5,500" when Romney was governor from 2003-2007. That also got a Half True because the dollar figure, while accurate, was not adjusted for inflation. In addition, we ruled that governors have only marginal impact on their states’ economies. In his Janesville address, Ryan tossed the Obama and Romney records into one claim. That’s a claim-changer, because the numbers are apples and oranges. The declining incomes Ryan cites in the last four years were in real dollars -- inflation adjusted to show the true effect on purchasing power -- while the gains in household income under Romney were not inflation-adjusted. Applying the "real" dollar analysis to the income trend under Romney, there was a drop in Massachusetts household incomes, not a $5,000 bump up, a Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation researcher told PolitiFact in June. This week we asked Gary Burtless, a former U.S. Labor Department economist with the Brookings Institution, to check that. He found a $589 drop, about 1 percent, compared to a nationwide increase of 1.4 percent. There’s nothing wrong with using unadjusted dollars, but economists we consulted said using real dollars is a better real-world way of gauging income trends. And by mixing the two methods, Ryan creates a much larger gap between the 2003-2007 experience and the 2009-2012 numbers. "It's definitely not kosher to use inflation-adjusted numbers in one case and nominal numbers in the other case," Daniel Mitchell, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us. When inflation is high enough to wipe away nominal gains in income, as in the Massachusetts example, "that makes it even more important to use apples-to-apples comparisons," he added. Recession role Ryan talked about a decline in median household income "in the last four years." That would reach back to mid-2008 near the end of the Republican administration of George W. Bush. The Great Recession began during the Bush era, in December 2007. Let’s look back four years, using the Sentier Research study, which was the source used in a now-outdated Bloomberg News story that Ryan’s campaign cites to back up his claim of a $4,000 drop. (Though census data income data is the gold standard for these statistics, it has not been released for 2011 or 2012). The Sentier data, current through June 2012, shows a $3,317 drop in median household income since June 2008. That’s a 6 percent dip. Ryan said the decline was an "average of $4,000," so he’s off going back four years. But if you assume Ryan was informally using "four years" as a proxy for Obama’s term so far, it’s a $4,019 drop. Our rating Ryan said in a convention send-off speech that Obama deserves blame for household incomes nationally tumbling $4,000, while Romney deserves credit for incomes growing a substantial $5,000 in Massachusetts when Romney governed that state. Earlier in the campaign, when Romney made these two claims separately, we found them partially accurate. But when they are combined, they leave a false impression of polar-opposite trend lines because one is adjusted for inflation, while the other is not. Applying the same inflation-adjusted methodology that Ryan chose to show the $4,000 household income drop under Obama, median incomes actually fell $589 under Romney during his earlier stint as governor. Ryan also affixes too much blame or credit on the pair for the trends. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10539	"Hillary Clinton believed NAFTA was a 'boon' to our economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/she-never-said-boon/	For weeks, Sen. Barack Obama has been quoting Sen. Hillary Clinton as saying that the North American Free Trade Agreement had been a "boon" to the U.S. economy. He used the phrase in a recent mailing to voters in Ohio (the headline said Hillary Clinton believed NAFTA was 'a boon' to our economy"), and he used it in a Jan. 21, 2008, debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. "I know that Hillary on occasion has said — just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy," Obama said. "I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal." We addressed the controversy over the "boon" when he made the remark in the debate (we said it was False), but we're addressing it again now because it has become an issue in the Ohio primary, and the source of the phrase — Newsday — has recently said the word did not come from Clinton. Obama's charge is designed to stoke suspicions among liberals and labor leaders that Clinton is in the thrall of big-business Democrats who served in her husband's administration, such as former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, chairman of Citigroup Inc., and ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, her top economic adviser. Indeed, Sen. Clinton energetically promoted NAFTA in the past, thanking corporations for furthering its goals during an address to the 1998 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and adding, "It is certainly clear that we have not by any means finished the job that has begun." But Obama is wrong that Clinton said NAFTA was a "boon." The Obama campaign got that phrase from an issues summary in the Sept. 11, 2006, edition of Newsday in which the Long Island newspaper, in its own words, stated that Clinton believed the trade agreement to be a boon to the economy. The paper also pointed out that Clinton voted against the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in 2005 because of concerns that it would drive jobs overseas. But Newsday recently published a blog posting written by reporter Dan Janison that said, "The word was our characterization of how we best understood her position on NAFTA, based on a review of past stories and her public statements." But Janison wrote that the newspaper does not have "a direct quote indicating her campaign told us she thought it was good for the economy at that time." However, the Clinton campaign did not complain when the item was published. But now that it's become an issue in the campaign, Newsday says it is not fair to attribute the word to Clinton. "Obama's use of the citation in this way does strike us as misleading," Janison wrote. "The quote marks make it look as if Hillary said 'boon,' not us. It's an example of the kind of slim reeds campaigns use to try to win an office." PolitiFact might be inclined to give Obama a Barely True ruling for this one, but since he has consistently used the word with no evidence — even going so far as to say she said it "just last year," we find the statement False.

pomt-08152	"Refinanced $232.6 million in bonds, resulting in reduced debt service for the City."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/03/dick-greco/dick-greco-says-he-reduced-tampas-debt-payments-wh/	Former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco on Nov. 29, 2010, announced a fifth run for the city's top job. At his campaign kickoff, Greco pledged to sling no mud at his six declared opponents in the non-partisan March 1, 2011, election. "I have a record to run on. Several of them," said Greco, who was elected to four terms as mayor, serving 1967 to 1974 and 1995 to 2003. At Monday's event, he waved a 75-page booklet that details accomplishments in every city department during his last two terms in office, signaling that its contents will form the basis for his campaign. While it's loaded with information, a statement in the Revenue and Finance Department section on page 56 jumped out at us. Greco said he "refinanced $232.6 million in bonds resulting in reduced debt service for the City." We wondered: Could a mayor known for his free-spending ways on huge projects have actually lowered the city's debt payments? City budget documents show that multiple bonds totalling $232.6 million were indeed refinanced during Greco's tenure. They are: • A $45.6 million water and sewer bond issued in 1988 and refinanced in 1998. • A $52 million utility tax bond issued in 1991 and refinanced in 2001. • A $66.1 million water and sewer bond issued in 1999 and refinanced in 2001. • A total of $31.2 million from a sewer state revolving loan fund refinanced into 2002 water and sewer bonds. • A $37.7 million water and sewer bond issued in 1992 and refinanced in 2002. It's true that refinancing those bonds resulted in lower debt payments — by at least $21 million — over several decades. But the statement in Greco's booklet, by itself, could lead someone to believe that the city's total debt went down during his tenure. That's not the case. In fact, Tampa's total debt payments in 1995 were $62.5 million and climbed to $80.2 million in 2002. The city's total debt increased from $682 million to more than $1 billion during that time. Among the $480.6 million in bonds that contributed to that increased debt: • $23.6 million issued in 1996 for police headquarters, district offices and fire rescue vehicles • $62.8 issued in 1999 million to renovate the Hillsborough River water treatment plant • $19.2 million issued in 1998 for an Ybor parking garage and parking lots • $190.5 million issued in 1999 to upgrade the city's waste-to-energy facility and construct a new administration building • $24.8 million issued in 1999 for the electric streetcar and other transportation projects • $55.6 million issued in 2001 for an art museum, Lowry Park Zoo expansion and other projects When asked about the statement, Greco said he doesn’t believe it suggests any broad message about the city's total debt payments, and it refers only to specific bonds that were refinanced. He notes that the status report on the Revenue and Finance Department also details the issuing of new bonds. "This sentence puts in context that new bonds were being issued, in addition to bonds that were being refinanced," he said. Adding that all up, we find Greco correctly described the bonds that were refinanced during his years as mayor. But taken in isolation, the statement about the lowered debt payments for Tampa is misleading. That's because it doesn't include hundreds of millions in new bonds that were issued at the same time. Therefore, we rate this statement Half True.	None	Dick Greco	None	None	None	2010-12-03T18:21:59	2010-11-29	['None']
pomt-00097	Says "billionaire George Soros bankrolls" Minnesota Democrat Dan Feehan, who is "employed by a Soros-funded liberal outfit in D.C." and his campaign is "propped up by out of state super PACs backed by Soros' millions."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/30/national-republican-congressional-committee/link-between-george-soros-and-dan-feehan-weak-no-/	Some people’s names take on special meaning, and when they are mentioned, those in the know nod in recognition. Take George Soros. The name of the Hungarian-born philanthropist, hedge fund manager and major liberal donor stands for things to some in the Republican Party, namely, ultra-liberal ideals and a willingness to spend millions of dollars to back them. That quickly brings us to an ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which wants a GOP candidate, Jim Hagedorn, to win an open seat in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. Thus, the NRCC ad, one of two made in quick succession with similar themes, seeks to tie the Democratic candidate in the race, Dan Feehan, to Soros. We at PolitiFact deal with claims made through words, so we will not be ruling on the ad’s visual that show cartoonish mounds of money piled in front of the billionaire -- and Colin Kaepernick, the protesting former quarterback, right next to Soros, with masked mobs in front of him. But the words, spoken by an announcer, say, "Soros’ billions bankroll the resistance and Dan Feehan. Feehan's employed by a Soros-funded liberal outfit in D.C." and his campaign is "propped up by out of state super PACs backed by Soros' millions." Does Feehan work for a "Soros-funded liberal outfit," and is his campaign "propped up" by PACs backed by Soros? The claim is inaccurate, despite what NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers said when he defended the ad on NBC’s "Meet the Press" last Sunday: "That ad is a factual ad." We’ll explain why that’s not right, but here’s a hint: Feehan isn’t a fulltime employee of the think tank the ad links him to. Even if he were, it would be fairer to say that a major defense contractor and the United States government are bigger current funders of the think tank than Soros -- and President Donald Trump’s defense secretary used to serve on the board and very much likes the center’s work. Feehan’s job Feehan is a combat veteran of the Iraq war, a former teacher and a former acting assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. He does research and writing as an adjunct senior fellow for the Center for a New American Security. The center told us this means he contributes to research and gets paid on a per-project basis, and his compensation suggests as much: As of Aug. 13, his candidate’s financial disclosure listed $55,412 in income from "research/writing" for the center this year and $7,916 from last year. Some full-time senior fellows at the center, in contrast, were making as much as $172,000 to $197,000 in 2016, forms filed with the IRS show. The think tank has been characterized as liberal because of its founding by two Democratic foreign policy experts. But in an article for Vox, it was also described as rather centrist, representing "the old George H.W. Bush view on foreign policy; some people would say it’s the Hillary Clinton view — it’s just where the US government has been for a very long time." The Los Angeles Times in 2013 called the center "respected" and "a haven for hawkish Democrats." The Center for a New American Security has a fan in James Mattis, Trump’s defense secretary. Mattis was on the center’s board before going back into service for the government. The center’s website quotes him as saying the center "understands the importance of all American citizens with worthy ideas in the national security conversation." Other board members include James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch and CEO of 21st Century Fox; former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, and Richard L. Armitage, a foreign policy adviser to presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. The center’s president, Richard Fontaine, was a foreign policy adviser to the late Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican. Soros’ funding Soros has donated to the center through his Open Society Foundations. Open Society spokesman Jonathan Kaplan told us that since 2014, the foundations have given $1.5 million to the center. "These grants supported research on preventing war with North Korea, the use of armed drone strikes, and U.S. foreign military assistance and human rights issues," he said in an email. More context is useful for understanding this. According to the center’s IRS filings, it got $12.2 million in gifts, grants and contributions from all sources in 2016 alone, $14.6 million in 2015 and $8.5 million in 2014. IRS filings for 2017 were not available, but information disclosed by the center shows that in the 12 months between Oct. 1, 2016 and Sept, 30, 2017, the Open Society Foundations gave the center between $250,000 and $499,000. That put Soros in the same donor category as the Boeing Corp., Johns Hopkins University and the Smith Richardson Foundation, which supports conservative and neoconservative causes such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, according to Inside Philanthropy. Who gave more? The center’s website puts contributions in categories, and the category for the deepest donations is $500,000 and above. In the last fiscal year, only these three were on the list: Northrop Grumman, the giant defense contractor; the United States government, and Michael J. Zak, the center’’s board chairman and the principle investor at Charles River Ventures. Soros’ contributions Soros has not donated to Feehan’s campaign directly. But when we asked the NRCC for backup to support its claim, it listed Priorities USA, a major super PAC supporting Democrats. Soros has given Priorities USA $5 million for 2018, our check of Federal Election Commission records confirms, making him the PAC’s second biggest donor (behind Donald Sussman, of the hedge fund Paloma Partners). Priorities USA in turn has spent at least $103,452 running digital ads to oppose Hagedorn, the Republican whom Feehan is running against. The NRCC also listed a super PAC affiliated with House Democratic leaders, the House Majority PAC, which as of last week had spent $972,949 to oppose Hagedorn, running ads on TV and websites and sending direct mail to Minnesota homes, records show. Soros had not donated to the House Majority PAC in this election cycle. But the NRCC told us Soros gave nearly $2.2 million in 2016, and records confirm that. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee says that "billionaire George Soros bankrolls" Dan Feehan, who is "employed by a Soros-funded liberal outfit in D.C." and his campaign is "propped up by out of state super PACs backed by Soros' millions." Soros is currently a major donor to a super PAC, Priorities USA, that is supporting Feehan through its ads criticizing Hagedorn. Beyond that, this claim falls apart. Feehan is an adjunct staff member at an "outfit" that has other funders who are quite generous, including major defense contractors. The center has been described as liberal in media accounts, but it has been described in other ways as well, and its past and present board members include people chosen for high ranks by Republican presidents, including Trump. Soros hasn't donated to Feehan and does not "bankroll" Feehan. We rate the claim False.

pomt-14292	"Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/04/ron-desantis/terrorists-groups-besides-isis-crossing-us-mexico-/	Instead of worrying about ISIS infiltrating the country, U.S. Senate candidate and Rep. Ron DeSantis is concerned that members of other terrorist groups have already been caught trying to sneak across the border from Mexico. The Ponte Vedra Beach Republican called a hearing of the House Oversight Committee’s National Security subcommittee to discuss what to do about what he considered a growing threat. "Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years," he said March 23, 2016. DeSantis has made terrorism a central issue in his campaign. On April 4, 2016, he embarked on a series of town hall-style events in Florida he dubbed the "Defeat the Jihad Tour." We’ve checked hyperbole by politicians that ISIS is invading via the southern border time and time and time again. Because there’s no hard evidence it is happening, those claims range from Mostly False to Pants On Fire! But we don’t often hear politicians warn about about immigrants with ties to other terrorist organizations being caught secretly heading into the United States. According to some reports, those apprehensions do happen, although experts told us any true threat may be a bit exaggerated. More than ISIS When we contacted DeSantis’ office, a spokeswoman pointed us to a 2015 article from the Houston Chronicle as the source of his statement. The newspaper published a report for elected officials from the Texas Department of Public Safety that said shifting law enforcement sources to protect the border led to crime problems in other parts of the state. But the report also said that authorities had detained several people with ties to Islamist terrorist organizations, a point the Washington Post highlighted in a follow-up. The Texas agency told the Post that the Chronicle had not properly obtained the report, which they said wasn’t meant for the public. Along with human traffickers, drug-cartel and gang members, law enforcement personnel in recent years had several run-ins with so-called "special interest aliens." These are people coming into the United States from 35 Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries associated with terrorist groups. Texas reported 439 cases of people from these countries — including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan and Syria — either caught crossing the border or presenting themselves at ports of entry without permission to enter. The report also said authorities had reported 143 "land border crossing encounters with watch-listed individuals in southwest border states between November 2013 and July 2014." These encounters included one with an alleged member of al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based group responsible for the 2013 mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya. In June 2014, he said he had been trained for a suicide attack in Mogadishu but escaped and surrendered to African Union troops, who stopped the attack. That account was unverified and the person sought immigration benefits from the United States, the report said. The report also noted the 2008 apprehension of a Somali named Ahmed Muhammed Dhakane, whom the government said had ties to terrorist groups al-Shabaab, al-Itihaad al-Islamiya and al-Barakat. Dhakane had crossed into Texas and helped move an unknown number of suspected Somali terrorists, as well, although he had claimed he was seeking asylum for religious persecution in Somalia. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2011. It further said one U.S. citizen had smuggled 272 Somalis into the United States through Cuba and Mexico until January 2010. Although he claimed he had been approached by al-Shabaab members for help smuggling people, he said he’d refused, the report said. Also detained were three Sri Lankans, one of whom said he was a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and was on his way to Canada. There are many more instances than what was detailed by Texas officials, too. A 2006 House Committee on Homeland Security report said that "each year, hundreds of illegal aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism" are found trying to cross the border along the Rio Grande Valley. It said members of Hezbollah "have already entered the United States" across the border prior to 2005. A Government Accountability Office report from August 2009 said Border Patrol apprehended three people with "links to terrorism" at southwest border checkpoints in fiscal year 2008. An updated 2012 report from the House Committee on Homeland Security said 1,918 "special interest aliens" were stopped at the border from fiscal years 2006 to 2011. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the common thread in these types of reports is not so much that notorious terrorists had been arrested, but that immigrants with ties to terrorist organizations had been caught. "I haven’t seen this as a method that terrorists have regularly used," he said of infiltrating the southern border. "There are more efficient ways to get in where you don’t have to violate U.S. law." That’s not to say the border isn’t porous, because immigrants from other countries continue to arrive via Mexico. Five Pakistanis and one Afghan were caught by Border Patrol agents near the Arizona border in November 2015. U.S. Customs and Border Protection records checks didn’t turn up any "derogatory information." That same month, eight Syrians — two sets of parents and four children — were stopped at the Texas border, but Homeland Security said they were regular migrants who weren’t evading authorities. Rand Corporation political scientist Colin Clarke said there are many challenges to enforcing border security beyond domestic policy. He noted places like Ecuador, which in 2008 dropped its visa requirements for admission. Lax policies make it much easier for groups to attempt getting into the United States. In 2011, three Pakistani citizens pleaded guilty to trying to smuggle in a member of the Pakistani Taliban from Ecuador. It is possible and plausible that terrorists would cross the Mexican border, Clarke said. But while it’s a problem worth addressing, it’s not something Americans should panic about. Unlike Europe, which has extensive, hidden support systems that could assist infiltrators, a terrorist coming to the United States wouldn’t easily live off the grid for long. "Getting across the border is one thing, having a network of logistics in place to put together what's needed to conduct an effective attack is another altogether," he said. Our ruling DeSantis said, "Recent reports state that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years." There have been several reported incidents along the U.S.-Mexico border of several agencies encountering people on terrorism watch lists or with ties (or suspected ties) to terrorist groups. There also have been a number of people from countries associated with terror groups stopped by authorities, although that’s not an indication they’re terrorist infiltrators. Experts noted that while border security is always a concern, this issue is far from a pressing crisis. The statement is accurate but needs some clarification about the threat involved. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Ron DeSantis	None	None	None	2016-04-04T16:04:07	2016-03-23	['None']
pomt-09633	President Obama "doesn't ... want to admit we're at war."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/03/dick-cheney/cheney-says-obama-wont-admit-us-war-against-terror/	In his latest attack on President Barack Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney seized on the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound jetliner to suggest that Obama is weak on terrorism. "As I’ve watched the events of the last few days it is clear once again that President Obama is trying to pretend we are not at war," Cheney said. "He seems to think if he has a low-key response to an attempt to blow up an airliner and kill hundreds of people, we won’t be at war. He seems to think if he gives terrorists the rights of Americans, lets them lawyer up and reads them their Miranda rights, we won’t be at war. He seems to think if we bring the mastermind of Sept. 11 to New York, give him a lawyer and trial in civilian court, we won’t be at war. "He seems to think if he closes Guantanamo and releases the hard-core al-Qaida-trained terrorists still there, we won’t be at war. He seems to think if he gets rid of the words, 'war on terror,' we won't be at war. But we are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren’t, it makes us less safe. Why doesn’t he want to admit we’re at war? It doesn’t fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn’t fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency — social transformation — the restructuring of American society. President Obama’s first object and his highest responsibility must be to defend us against an enemy that knows we are at war." Cheney's comments echo a frequent criticism by conservatives that President Obama does not use the phrase "war on terror." We rated that True when it was made by talk show host Sean Hannity in November 2009. We noted in our ruling that Obama had said he didn't use the more general phrase "war on terror" because he viewed the conflict as a war against "some terrorist organizations." With his statement to Politico, Cheney is going further than Hannity did, directly alleging that Obama will not "admit we're at war." But a review of Obama's statements of the past year makes it clear he has often said the United States is at war against terrorist organizations. The fifth paragraph of his inaugural address : "Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred." In a February 2009 CNN interview: "I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations." In a March 2009 speech: He said that people might ask why the United States is at war and said, "Al-Qaida and its allies, the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks, are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al-Qaida is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan." In his December 2009 speech at West Point on his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan: He repeatedly called it a war and said, " I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al-Qaida." In his speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize: He said that "we are at war" and noted that "the world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks, and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense." Cheney has offered lots of criticism of Obama in the past year (of the claims we've rated, Cheney has earned a True and a Mostly True ). His remarks here go beyond opinion because he repeatedly says that Obama won't acknowledge that the United States is at war. But even a cursory examination of Obama's statements shows this one is preposterous. Obama has often said the United States is at war against terrorist organizations -- and has ordered a massive increase in U.S. troops in Afghanistan to fight that war. So Cheney's comment isn't just False, it's ridiculously so. Pants on Fire!	None	Dick Cheney	None	None	None	2010-01-03T12:17:05	2009-12-30	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-09434	"Crist stays in $2,000 a night luxury hotel suites where he racks up $1,300 in mini-bar charges, and doesn't pay for a dime of it himself."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/12/marco-rubio/rubio-attacks-crist-taxpayer-funded-junket-europe/	Gov. Charlie Crist is attempting to cast Marco Rubio as earmark-hungry and a lavish spender, dubbing him "Porkus Rubio." The Rubio campaign responds with a claim that Crist is no "Frugal" Charlie himself. Rubio's evidence: a 12-day trade mission Crist took to London, Paris, St. Petersburg, Russia, and Madrid in the summer of 2008. The tab for taxpayers: more than $430,000. "Crist’s 2008 European junket ... came complete with a two-dozen person entourage, an official photographer to chronicle the governor at 'work,' a $2,100 a night luxury suite in London, $1,300 in room service and mini bar charges for Crist alone, and first class airfare at $8,000 per ticket," the Rubio campaign declared in a March 4, 2010, press release titled " 'Frugal' Charlie Crist's $430K European Junket on Taxpayers' Dime." "Charlie Crist might be frugal when it comes to his own money, but he loves spending taxpayer money on a failed stimulus, on $2 billion worth of tax hikes, and on a luxurious lifestyle for himself and his buddies," Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said in the release. "Floridians are not going to take lectures on frugality from a guy who embraced the largest spending bill in American history, stays in $2,000 a night luxury hotel suites where he racks up $1,300 in mini-bar charges, and doesn't pay for a dime of it himself." We've already dealt with Crist's position on the federal stimulus (he supported it), as well as the claim about $2 billion in tax hikes and fees (they passed the Legislature in 2009). In this item, we'll explore Rubio's claims about Crist's trip to Europe. The Europe trip was billed as a way to expand trading relationships with key economic partners around the globe. It was arranged by Enterprise Florida, a public/private agency created to drum up support for Florida's businesses and attract new investment into the state. Florida's delegation totaled more than 90 people, including Crist and his then-fiancee Carole Rome. Taxpayers picked up the bill for more than two dozen state employees, including a photographer and nine bodyguards. A group of 65 business executives also came along, paying their own way. The business executives also pitched in to cover Crist's expenses. The 12-day itinerary included meaty events, such as meetings with business executives at Lockheed Martin and Nothrop Grumman and a speaking engagement at a climate change forum, but also sightseeing and photo-ops. The governor posed for pictures with Prince Charles and visited soldiers' graves in Normandy, France. Crist, who was then being discussed as a possible running mate for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, also conducted several interviews with the European press. To best examine the specifics of Rubio's claim, we turned to our colleagues at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Megan O'Matz was the first reporter to detail the cost of the Europe trip in a December 2008 article. Her work was the basis for Rubio's claim, and led to coverage of the trip across the state. O'Matz provided PolitiFact Florida with a previously unpublished Enterprise Florida document detailing Crist's expenses. The document shows that Crist had hotel rooms for a total of 11 nights (Enterprise Florida booked a suite for Crist the night before the delegation arrived in Europe so Crist could enter the hotel upon arriving from the overnight flight). The charges for Crist's accommodations break down this way: London, England (Hilton London Metropole Hotel ) 4 nights -- $8,714.27; Paris, France (The Westin Paris Hotel) 3 nights -- $4,154.46; St. Petersburg, Russia (Hotel Astoria) 2 nights -- $2,457.46; Madrid, Spain (The Westin Palace) 2 nights -- $2,312.24. That's a total of $17,638.43 for 11 nights, or about $1,600 a night (short of what Rubio claims). The London hotel was the most expensive, at about $2,180 a night, according to the report. Crist's suite in Paris overlooked the Tuileries garden and came with a view of the Eiffel Tower. The Westin Palace in Madrid, where Crist spent two nights, was commissioned by Spain's King Alfonso XIII in 1912. The other part of Rubio's claim related to mini-bar charges. The Enterprise Florida document details those as well. Kind of. Crist amassed a total of $1,356.29 in "food and beverage" charges for the trip. But that's not limited to mini-bar charges. Stuart Doyle, a spokesperson for Enterprise Florida, said the food and beverage charges account for food and drinks provided for business meetings held in the governor's room. They weren't just mini-bar charges. And they weren't only for Crist -- they covered anyone who came to his rooms for meetings. It's important to note that all of the specific charges we just discussed were paid with private dollars, not tax dollars. But taxpayers still ended up on the hook for more than $430,000 to cover the expenses of Crist's government entourage, significantly more than originally estimated. The news prompted a rash of angry newspaper editorials and a call from the Florida Democratic Party for Crist to reimburse the state. Crist defended the trip. "I think it's important to promote free trade," Crist said. "You want to have it be as economical as you can, and when you consider that it should produce hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in Florida, I think it's important to do." Crist officials also noted that former Gov. Jeb Bush used tax dollars to cover his costs on similar trade missions. Let's look at the Rubio campaign quote again. Crist "stays in $2,000 a night luxury hotel suites where he racks up $1,300 in mini-bar charges, and doesn’t pay for a dime of it himself." We can break the statement down into three pieces. The hotel. While in London in 2008, Crist spent four nights in a hotel suite that cost more than $2,000 a night. The rest of the trip, he stayed in rooms, that while still pricey, cost about half as much. For the entire trip, the average was $1,600. The mini-bar. By using that term, Rubio suggests that Crist alone went on a costly binge using the fridge in his suite. But that's quite misleading. Yes, Crist's food and beverage charges for the trip totaled $1,356.29. But it wasn't just the mini-bar and the charges weren't just for Crist. Who paid? Crist didn't pay for the trip out of his own pocket. But taxpayers didn't pay, either. Private business executives picked up Crist's bill. This is a case where Rubio is mixing and matching facts in order to paint Crist in the worst possible light. The campaign rightly details in its release that taxpayers didn't pay for Crist's overseas travel, but then in a quote and headline suggests that taxpayers may have footed the bill. (The campaign featured a headline from the Orlando Sentinel that read: "Crist enjoyed pricey perks on business trip to Europe thanks to taxpayers"). The claim about the hotel, while accurate, focuses on one leg of the Europe trip and not the trip overall. And while the campaign broadly describes the $1,300 in food and beverage charges in the press release, Rubio then truncates the wording in the quote to connote a different and worse meaning. It also suggests Crist ran up the $1,300 bill alone, which is not true. Rubio may be successful in making his broader point -- that Crist's trip to Europe was hardly frugal -- but he could have accomplished that by sticking closer to the facts. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-03-12T16:19:03	2010-03-04	['None']
pomt-04496	"I never supported" a state income tax for Texas.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/oct/05/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-he-never-supported-state-personal/	A Dallas debate between U.S. Senate hopefuls Paul Sadler and Ted Cruz heated up over whether Sadler, the Democratic nominee, has advocated a state personal income tax -- which can be a third-rail issue. Texas is one of nine states without a state income tax. The latest statewide elected official to publicly suggest one, the late Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, left office in early 1999, years after he briefly maintained that a state personal income tax made economic sense. The prospect proved so unpopular, Bullock ushered in a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval before a personal income tax could become law. Sadler, meanwhile, was a member of the Texas House and once led a panel looking at ways to reduce property taxes while overhauling other taxes. In the Oct. 2, 2012, debate hosted by WFAA-TV, Channel 8, Cruz said Sadler "has championed in the state of Texas an income tax." Minutes later, Cruz said Sadler "used to routinely introduce himself around the state as ‘I’m the guy that supports an income tax in the state of Texas.’" Cruz’s campaign emailed us a Feb. 3, 1993, Houston Chronicle news article quoting then-state Rep. Sadler, of Hendersonville, introducing himself to Harris County parents as "the guy for the income tax." But Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton offered no other examples of this self-introduction nor did we find any. At the debate, Sadler replied: "That’s just a lie, Ted." Cruz rejoined: "Did you support an income tax, yes or no?" Sadler: "I never supported an income tax." "I had the responsibility of looking at the tax system of Texas," Sadler continued, "something you (Cruz) wouldn’t know anything about because you’ve never served in the Legislature. You’ve never had the responsibility of putting together a school finance program to pay for our children’s education, to fund education across this state. I did a review of every single tax available, a (value-added) tax, a sales tax, an income tax, you name it, I have done it." A day after the debate, Sadler issued a statement saying that in 1992, lawmakers confronting a Texas Supreme Court ruling mandating changes to the school finance system drafted many proposals. "We drafted bills on consolidation of school districts, expansion of the sales tax, countywide school districts, a personal income tax, and every other possible option. We looked at every single thing that we could do to get Texas out of the courthouse," the statement says. And, the statement says, as "a leader on public education issues, I sponsored a House resolution to consider a personal income tax." According to legislative records, Sadler introduced House Joint Resolution 7, on Dec. 1, 1992, proposing a constitutional amendment "relating to the authorization and limitation of certain taxes for funding public education." If it had cleared the House and Senate, it would have awaited voter approval or rejection at the polls. Voters would have seen this summary: "The constitutional amendment providing for a personal income tax dedicated to public education, a reduction in the maximum local school property tax rate from $1.50 to 15 cents for each $100 valuation, a requirement that the voters of a local school district approve the levy of local school property taxes, and the deletion of the fuel tax dedication for public education." Our online search for news accounts, using the Nexis service, yielded an indication that Sadler advocated for a state personal income tax at the time, though it also brought to light Sadler saying years later that a state personal income tax was unrealistic. A Nov. 24, 1992, commentary by Dave McNeely of the Austin American-Statesman opens: "It's against the grain of the conventional political wisdom in Texas. Many consider it political suicide. But freshman state Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, is advocating an income tax to fund public schools. Openly." Sadler had studied education funding, the column says, and concluded that a broad-based statewide tax was needed as an alternative to plans, like the system ultimately passed into law, to transfer property-tax revenue gathered in some school districts to other districts. McNeely quoted Sadler as saying he favored the merger of some school districts, using incentives, and the creation of a statewide funding source, "either a statewide property tax or a state income tax, which is the fairest of all methods, because it puts everyone in the scheme." The column also quotes Sadler as saying the income tax would have to be sold to voters via a statewide TV blitz buttressed by lawmaker discussions with constituents and educators -- to "tell them ‘this is what we're doing, this is why, and this is where we want to go with education, and this is how it will benefit you.’" "If you do that, you could educate the public," Sadler said. "We've not tried to do that, and so what you get from the constituency oftentimes is a knee-jerk reaction: ‘No, I don't want an income tax' -- even though they don't fully understand the relief they'll get from local property taxes and other taxes. "And it is the fear of an income tax, from a legislator's standpoint, and having to face an opponent that will beat you over the head with that, that keeps most legislators from speaking out and saying what we all know is true," Sadler said. In late 1992, Sadler’s proposed constitutional amendment was referred to a House committee, where it died. Legislative records indicate that Sadler, who remained a House member into early 2003, did not file any other income tax proposals. During the 1997 session, though, he resisted pressure to keep an income tax from being studied. At the time, he chaired the House Select Committee on Revenue and Public Education Funding, which weighed proposals by Gov. George W. Bush and others to drive down school property taxes by tapping revenue from other sources. According to news accounts, Bush ruled out a state personal income tax, while Sadler said it should at least be discussed. According to a March 4, 1997, American-Statesman news article, Bush’s plan envisioned covering cuts in property and other taxes with higher sales taxes, a new business levy and an available $1 billion state revenue surplus. Under Sadler's proposal, the story says, school property tax cuts would be covered by a combination of sales and business taxes and perhaps even a personal income tax. "Bush has said he would veto any plan containing an income tax, but Sadler has refused to reject any option," the story says, quoting Sadler: "To say something is off the table is foreign to me. I will not restrict this committee's deliberations." House members later passed a plan lacking an income-tax feature. It ultimately died in the Senate -- and Sadler subsequently said a state income tax was "a dead issue," according to a news story in the Sept. 6, 2001, Dallas Morning News. The story says Sadler noted the constitutional provision requiring voter approval before an income tax is implemented before saying: "The only way we would have an income tax is if the public votes it in, and that won't happen in Texas." In a telephone interview, Sadler told us that when he made his debate statement, he didn’t remember he had filed the 1992 proposed constitutional amendment. Sadler said, too, that he did not recall the November 1992 commentary presenting his case for an income tax or statewide property tax, though he said he did recall outlining what he then believed to be the criteria for a long-term school funding solution. Our ruling Sadler said he has "never" supported a state personal income tax. To the contrary, he authored a 1992 proposal that, with voter approval, would have resulted in a state personal income tax dedicated to education and five years later, he was clear about not ruling out legislative study of an income tax as members explored tax options. Cruz may have been wrong in the debate when he said Sadler used to routinely introduce himself as the guy for an income tax. However, Sadler’s rejoinder -- that he never supported an income tax -- isn’t supported by his legislative record or his past comments. This "never" claim isn’t just incorrect. It’s ridiculous.

pomt-07756	"President Obama came to Ohio 12 times to try to defeat me and guess what? He didn't win."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/25/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-barack-obama-came-ohio-12-tim/	Shortly after he defeated Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland in the November election, Republican Gov. John Kasich repeatedly expressed his displeasure about Strickland’s negative campaign. Kasich complained that he had to fight an unprecedented effort to soil his good name. PolitiFact Ohio checked one such statement Kasich made to a group of lobbyists on Nov. 4: "I had 12 visits by a president, somewhere between $45 (million) and $50 million (spent against him,) 500 paid volunteers in here calling me every name in the book, former presidents, first ladies and God-knows-who-else." After examining the four main assertions in that statement, the Truth-O-Meter landed on Half True. Lately, Kasich has recycled one of the more questionable assertions within that statement, namely, that President Barack Obama visited Ohio a dozen times to campaign against him. Kasich said it in two separate interviews on CNN on Feb. 21 and Feb. 22, the week Obama visited Cleveland for a small-business forum. Kasich told CNN’s Jessica Yellin on Feb. 21 that he would be there to meet Obama the next day when the president arrived in Cleveland, despite their political differences. "Well, I am there to greet him," Kasich said. "I mean, President Obama came to Ohio 12 times to try to defeat me and guess what? He didn't win." The governor went on to explain: "I think it is my job to be there to welcome him to Ohio on his first visit since he is president and I'm the governor." Since Kasich thinks his statement about the 12 Obama visits bears repeating, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worth revisiting our research. Obama indeed visited Ohio 12 times from the time he took office in January 2009 until last year’s election. But a review of Obama’s travel schedule and the text of all the speeches he made here show that only a small part of his time in Ohio was devoted to campaigning against Kasich. Obama, for instance, visited Ohio on March 3, 2009, a full two months before Kasich even announced his candidacy. And of Obama’s 12 trips, nine were made under the guise of official White House business during which he pushed specific policies – mainly health care reform and the economic stimulus bill. Two trips last year, Oct. 17 and Oct. 31, were made specifically to campaign for Strickland and the Democratic ticket. And on a trip made Aug. 18, Obama hosted a fund-raiser for Strickland and in a separate event pushed his economic polices. Transcripts from Obama’s non-campaign visits show he referred to Republicans in Washington many times in arguing that his policies are better than GOP plans. But Obama never mentioned the governor’s race or Kasich. Obama never mentioned Kasich at an Oct. 17 campaign rally before 35,000 people in Columbus, either. He named Kasich twice at his Oct. 31 rally in Cleveland. Kasich’s claim does contain some elements of truth. Obama did make 12 visits to Ohio as president before election day last November. And on three of those visits he did specifically campaign for Strickland. But to say that Obama campaigned against him 12 times, Kasich is overstating the case. While Kasich deserves a little leeway given that any presidential visit provides cover to office holders of the same party, it’s a stretch to imply that the president was here solely to bash the Republican on the other nine visits. That’s a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression. Even though Kasich likes to repeat it, on the Truth-O-Meter the statement is Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00788	On expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.	full flop	/florida/statements/2015/apr/07/rick-scott/scott-shifts-again-medicaid-expansion/	Has Gov. Rick Scott changed his mind on Medicaid again? In 2012, Scott said he was against expansion. In 2013 he said he was for it. Now, he says he’s against it. Or does he? PolitiFact Florida decided to put Scott’s position on expanding Medicaid on our Flip-O-Meter, to document whether he has changed position. Let’s follow Scott’s path over the past few years. The starting point Medicaid is the longstanding federal and state health insurance program for the very poor; traditionally people also have to be elderly, disabled, pregnant or a child to qualify. The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, sought to expand that program to anyone making up to about 133 percent of the poverty level. (The original plan was that every state would expand the program, but a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowed each state to decide for itself.) Before he ran for governor in 2010, Scott was a persistent critic of President Barack Obama’s federal health care law. In 2009, Scott spent $5 million of his own money to form Conservatives for Patients' Rights and oppose the law. For much of his first term, Scott said that Florida would not expand Medicaid, because it "just doesn’t make any sense" and that it was too costly. We should note that Washington offers more generous cost-sharing for states that expand Medicaid. It covers 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible people through 2016, 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. Those numbers are set by statute, so it would take new legislation from Congress to change those terms. First flip On Feb. 20, 2013, now sitting in the governor’s office, Scott announced a change of position, declaring unequivocally that he supported expanding Medicaid. He called it a "compassionate, common-sense step forward." While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care. We will support a three-year expansion of our Medicaid program under the new health care law, as long as the federal government meets their commitment to pay 100 percent of the cost during this time. Legislation we would support would sunset after three years and need to be reauthorized. It would also sunset if the federal government backed away from their 100 percent commitment during this period. Scott’s announcement won headlines across the country. But the Florida Legislature had other ideas. It never approved the expansion. We should note, however, that Scott never really pushed for the expansion. And he didn’t promote expansion during the 2014 campaign for governor against Charlie Crist, who said repeatedly he supported the federal law and would work for Medicaid expansion. Back flip? The Florida Legislature has been grappling with Medicaid expansion during its 2015 legislative session. The House of Representatives is opposed; while the Senate seems more open. On April 6, Scott rattled the understanding of his position on Medicaid when he seemed to come out against expansion in comments he made about the state’s money troubles with a separate federal health care program called the Low-Income Pool. The LIP, as it’s known, started in 2006. It’s a Medicaid pilot project that distributes $2.2 billion to hospitals to cover the cost of treating low-income, uninsured and underinsured patients. The federal government provides about half the money. The program was set to expire in 2014, but the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) agreed to extend it until June 30, 2015. A CMS spokesman told PolitiFact, "The one-year LIP extension has allowed the state to engage in a process of critical planning to address the need for a more sustainable Medicaid financing system." The spokesman said CMS has no plans to extend the LIP program in its "current form." Scott viewed this a sign that Washington is an unreliable partner. Here's the full text of his statement: "Our priority is to cut more than $600 million in taxes this session and get K-12 education funding up to record levels while holding the line on college tuition. We still have several weeks left for budget negotiations; however, given that the federal government said they would not fund the federal LIP program to the level it is funded today, it would be hard to understand how the state could take on even more federal programs that CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services) could scale back or walk away from." Many people took that to mean Scott had backed away from Medicaid expansion. The next day, reporters pressed Scott to clarify whether this meant he no longer supports expanding Medicaid. Scott declined to answer directly. "I like the program we have right now," Scott said. We asked Scott’s office if he still wants expanded Medicaid. As of our deadline, we have not heard back. Our ruling In 2013, Scott said in no uncertain terms that "we will support an expansion of our Medicaid program under the new health care law." In 2015, Scott suggested the state should not expand Medicaid, saying it would be "hard to understand how the state could take on even more federal programs." Scott’s change of position on expanding Medicaid is particularly perplexing because it comes at a time when the Florida Senate seems to be genuinely considering legislation to either expand the program or propose some kind of overhaul to the program. His April 6 statement dumps cold water on that effort. That’s a dramatic about-face from supporting expansion. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-01862	The U.S. Supreme Court is "five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/11/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-supreme-court-five-guys-who-star/	More than 10 days after the Supreme Court decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, the landmark case was still sending shockwaves through Washington and the political world. In the decision, a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for four kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act, the law proposed and signed by President Barack Obama. At her weekly press conference on July 10, 2014, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., referenced the decision with a note of alarm. "Really, we should be afraid of this court," Pelosi said. "The five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal. Let's not even go there." Several readers asked us to scrutinze whether Pelosi was right to say that the Supreme Court was deciding which contraception methods are legal, rather than whether some corporations must pay for them through their employees’ health insurance plans. Later that day, Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly took the media to task for not immediately shooting down Pelosi’s assertion. "I’ve seen the media rush to clarify Ms. Pelosi’s misleading remarks … Oh, no, I have seen none of that, except on Fox News," Kelly said sarcastically. "When you’ve got somebody in such a powerful a position as Nancy Pelosi, in a position to influence so many people on such a platform, come out and tell blatant falsehoods, there should be some fact-checking. Where is PolitiFact on that? Where is the mainstream media calling her to account?" Well, here we are. We can eliminate any reader suspense by sharing the response Pelosi’s office sent PolitiFact after we inquired: "She misspoke," spokesman Drew Hammill acknowledged. "Obviously the impact of the court’s decision is not to make these four contraceptive methods illegal – i.e. no longer allowed to be sold." Hammill went on to explain that Pelosi’s "overriding point" was that the decision "does in fact limit access … which is the key point Pelosi made." He pointed to portions of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent in which Ginsburg notes that IUDs are expensive and that removing company support for them could leave some female employees without the "most effective" medical option for their needs. Indeed, one of Pelosi’s later comments from the news conference -- when she focused on the issue of who pays for contraceptives, rather than whether they remain legal -- seems to be on firmer ground. She expressed concern "that five men could get down to specifics of whether a woman should use a diaphragm and (whether) she should pay for it herself, or her boss. It's not her boss' business. The business is whatever his business is, but it's not what contraception she uses." We asked legal experts whether it was plausible to think that the Supreme Court would actually make certain kinds of contraceptives illegal, as Pelosi’s now-disowned comment suggested. The experts agreed that the scenario was farfetched. "There is no reason to think the Court will ban any contraceptives," said Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University. "Hobby Lobby involved the question of whether a company can, for religious reasons, refuse to pay for health insurance that covers certain contraceptives. Hobby Lobby does not relate to the legality of contraceptives at all." Kurt Lash, a University of Illinois law professor, agreed. Pelosi’s original comment, he said, suggested "either that the Supreme Court has started 'determining what contraceptions are legal,' or that recent decisions suggest that a majority might be heading in that direction. Neither is true, or even plausible." As evidence, Lash cited solid legal precedent in favor of making contraceptives legal. Regardless of the court’s recent jurisprudence, Lash said, "it is -- and will be -- ‘legal’ for employees to obtain contraceptives on their own. Employees have that right as a matter of constitutional law under the Supreme Court's 1965 decision in Griswold vs. Connecticut, a case no one is challenging anywhere in the country and which is not implicated in any way in the ACA litigation." In fact, he added, "even if a majority of the the Supreme Court reversed Griswold -- something that will never happen under the Roberts Court -- this still would not make contraceptives ‘illegal.’ At most, it would leave the matter to the states to decide for themselves. And every state allows the distribution of contraceptives and has done so for decades, even prior to the Court's 1965 decision in Griswold." Our ruling Pelosi said, "We should be afraid of this court, the five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal." This sweeping claim was a misstatement, her spokesman acknowledged to PolitiFact. The Hobby Lobby decision didn’t turn on whether certain types of contraception should be legal, but rather on the question of whether certain corporations could decide on religious grounds not to pay for specific types of contraceptives in employee health insurance plans. Experts say that there are solid legal precedents that would keep the Supreme Court from actually banning forms of contraception outright. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11367	"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/02/donald-trump/trump-usps-postal-service-amazon-losing-fortune/	President Donald Trump took a swing at Amazon once more on April 2, blaming the digital retailer for the United States Postal Service’s financial woes. "Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon," Trump tweeted. "THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We addressed the closing of retailers across the country in another Amazon-USPS tweet-inspired story last week. (Trump had a point.) But for this fact-check, we wondered whether Amazon is causing the Postal Service to "lose a fortune." The post office is losing a fortune, but Trump is wrong to blame Amazon. Parcels are growing the Postal Service The Postal Service reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for 2017. It has lost $65.1 billion since 2007. Much of the red ink is attributed to a 2006 law mandating that USPS pre-fund future retirees’ health benefits. First-class mail, the USPS’ biggest source of revenue, also continued to shrink, seeing a $1.87 billion revenue loss in fiscal year 2017. Package delivery, however, was one of the few bright spots in its latest financial statement. In 2017, parcels brought in $19.5 billion, or 28 percent of USPS’ annual revenue. At $2.1 billion, packages contributed the largest revenue increase. Deals with private shippers like Amazon accounted for $7 billion of the $19.5 billion in revenue. While we know that Amazon is the biggest e-commerce player, we don’t know exactly how much of the $7 billion comes from Amazon, because the details of the postal service’s deals with private shippers are considered proprietary and not made public. A good deal? USPS ships about 40 percent of Amazon’s packages. Amazon bulk-delivers packages to a USPS distribution center, and the Postal Service brings it to your door. USPS negotiates the discounted rate for that service with Amazon, as it does all other bulk shippers. Those rates are kept under wraps. That said, we do know the Amazon deal is at least a break-even venture. That’s because the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost. "By law our competitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon, must cover their costs," an August 2017 USPS press release said. "Our regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), looks carefully at this question every year and has determined that they do. The PRC has also noted that competitive products help fund the infrastructure of the Postal Service." In fact, the Postal Regulatory Commission gave the green light to the USPS-Amazon deal the same day Trump began tweeting about Amazon last week. Trump might have a point, however, in saying the USPS could be making more money off Amazon. For example, Citigroup found that on average, USPS was charging $1.46 below market rates for parcel delivery (not just to Amazon). Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers, explained the Postal Service can offer lower prices than their private competitors because they already "go to every house, every day." "We’re already going there to deliver mail and bills and advertising, so the marginal cost of delivering an extra package is not high, especially in the low-density areas," Sauber said. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed." Amazon isn’t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it’s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. While we don’t know the deal USPS crafted with Amazon, we know it’s not losing money. A 2006 law codified profitability into law, and an independent regulatory commission that reviews their deals annually gave it a green light on March 29. That said, it’s possible that the Postal Service could be charging Amazon more for package delivery and therefore get a better deal. That still doesn’t mean USPS is losing a fortune. We rate this claim False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-04-02T17:53:49	2018-04-02	['Fortune_(magazine)']
pomt-14090	"Now in half the homes in California, people speak a language other than English in their own homes."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/may/17/pat-buchanan/pat-buchanans-mostly-false-claim-about-language-ca/	Pat Buchanan, a conservative commentator and backer of Republican Donald Trump for president, believes America is losing its ethnic identity. He says that identity is tied to the English language. In a recent interview on NPR about America’s changing ethnic and linguistic makeup, Buchanan spoke about the large share of Californians who speak a foreign language at home. "We created a really united country where 97 percent of us spoke English in 1960," Buchanan said in the interview on May 5, 2016. "Now in half the homes in California, people speak a language other than English in their own homes." We checked the second part of Buchanan’s statement, about the percentage of Californians who speak a foreign language at home. It’s a claim that was close to correct on the numbers, but wrongly implies that half the state does not speak English. Close by the numbers Nearly 44 percent of Californians age 5 or older spoke a language other than English at home as of 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That doesn’t mean they speak a foreign language exclusively at home. Data on the percentage of "homes" where a foreign language is spoken is harder to find. But after crunching some 2014 census figures, Steven Camarota, director of research for the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told us that 48.3 percent of households in California "have at least one person who speaks a language other than English at home." "I would call it half," Camarota said in an email. He added that foreign language households are often undercounted during census surveys. More to the story Buchanan’s statement is not far from the truth, when examining the numbers alone. But he ignores figures about how many Californians speak English proficiently. Nineteen percent in the state report having limited English language skills, the highest share of any state in the nation, followed by 14 percent in Texas and 13 percent in New York, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That means, however, that more than 80 percent of Californians report having a stronger set of English language skills, or speaking the language "very well." Proficiency levels offer a more accurate look at how California and its many immigrants are adopting the country’s primary language, said Laura Hill, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, who studies immigrant populations. Buchanan’s claim about foreign language speakers includes many who Hill said "could be completely fluent in Spanish and English or English and Vietnamese. They could have really high levels of English fluency." Hill added that "If you’re trying to make a point about immigrant integration, you’re going to be more interested in understanding not how many people speak a different language, but how many don’t speak English very well." When we asked Buchanan to explain his statement, his representative sent us links to news articles that say more than half of Los Angeles, but not California as a whole, speaks a foreign language at home. Buchanan made two runs for the Republican presidential nomination, coming up short in 1992 and 1996. He also ran a failed bid for president in 2000 as a Reform Party candidate. Our ruling During a conversation on NPR, Pat Buchanan said "In half the homes in California, people speak a language other than English in their own homes." Looking at the numbers alone, he’s close to correct. But he fails to note that many of those who speak a foreign language at home also are fluent in English. He also omits the fact that only 19 percent of Californians, not half, are considered limited English speakers. Buchanan’s statement contains some element of truth, but in the context of his conversation, it wrongly implies that half the state does not speak English. It ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his claim Mostly False. CORRECTION: This fact check has been corrected to show that English is the primary language in the United States. A previous version incorrectly stated it is the official language.

pomt-03841	Says the federal government is supporting a study in Hawaii to "develop a menu for when we colonize Mars."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-mocks-federally-funded-study-menus-astro/	A Hawaii research project to choose cuisine for astronauts? Count us in! During a speech to the conservative CPAC conference, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., made fun of a number of scientific research projects funded by the federal government, suggesting that they were a waste of taxpayer money. Here’s one of them: "For any of you college students looking for jobs, Uncle Sam’s got a job for you," said Paul during the March 14, 2013, speech. "The pay’s $5,000, all expenses paid. The study is in Hawaii. But the requirements are onerous. Only a few can qualify. You have to like food. The study is to develop a menu for when we colonize Mars. I’m not making this up. Guess what a bunch of college students came up with for the menu. Pizza!" Battling 'menu fatigue' The name of the study blends science fiction with tropical breezes: "Hawaii Space Exploration Analogue and Simulation," or HI-SEAS. Most of it does take place in Hawaii, under the guidance of scientists from Cornell University and the University of Hawaii at Manoa using a $947,000 grant from NASA. Six primary participants and two alternates have been chosen to spend 120 days in "space" (actually a barren lava field) to simulate the conditions faced by astronauts on a mission to Mars. Since cooking is considered nearly impossible while rocketing through space, astronauts have long eaten prepackaged, ready-to-consume foods. (Remember Tang?) But on a mission to Mars, astronauts would be at greater risk for what scientists call "menu fatigue" -- becoming so bored with the same meals that they don't eat enough to keep their muscles, bone and organs healthy enough. (And we know that space travelers need their strength so they can maneuver an X-Wing to blow up the Death Star.) There could be better menu options once they land on Mars, however, because the planet’s gravity might allow them to cook. The purpose of the Hawaii study is to determine whether the benefits of having astronauts cook meals outweigh the additional cost, complexity and crew time involved in cooking. To do this, the crew in Hawaii will live in a 950-square-foot structure in the middle of a lava field, 8,200 feet above sea level on the slope of the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa. "There is no vegetation visible for miles, nor can the crew see the ocean," Kim Binstead, a University of Hawaii- Manoa astrobiologist who is helping run the study, told PolitiFact. "The temperature routinely goes below 40 degrees Fahrenheit." (Check out the 360-degree view of what the crew will see every day -- it really does look a lot like Mars.) Study participants can only leave their capsule when wearing a modified HAZMAT suit that simulates a spacesuit. "This is not a vacation, and life at the habitat will be crowded, uncomfortable and busy," she said. The crew will conduct a variety of monitoring experiments on each other, as well as other scientific studies. For instance, they will measure their fellow participants’ ability to smell, their food and nutrient intake and their changes in mood, health and body mass. Contrary to Paul’s tongue-in-cheek suggestion, college couch potatoes wouldn’t have had a very good shot at getting selected. The crew was chosen from among 700 applicants according to NASA astronaut selection criteria. "Four are scientists with Ph.Ds, one is a science journalist, and one is wrapping up an M.S. in robotics," Binstead said. "This last crewmember, our one student, is also an Afghanistan veteran who built a bomb-sniffing robot from spare parts while deployed. Three of our crew members applied to be NASA astronauts this year, and all made it into the ‘highly qualified’ group." Considering the crew members’ qualifications, $5,000 for four months’ work in tight quarters, plus two preparatory training sessions, doesn’t exactly sound lavish. The stipend doesn’t even come with health insurance. How accurate is Paul’s description? Even though he was playing the study for laughs, Paul does describe some aspects correctly. The project is supported by federal funding, the pay for participants is $5,000, expenses are covered, and the longest portion of the study takes place in Hawaii. Even so, we think Paul was off-base when he said its goal is to "develop a menu for when we colonize Mars." "We're not developing menus -- we're comparing food systems," Binstead said. "The lessons we learn are applicable to all long-duration space missions, as well as to military deployments and other isolated, hazardous activities here on Earth." She added that "no one is talking about 'colonizing' Mars." Any human visit to Mars currently being envisioned would be temporary. We asked a space expert whether he thought the study was frivolous. He said he didn’t think it was. "This is one of many Mars analog activities supported by NASA," said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. "I might object to a bunch of NASA civil servants devoting all their time to this, but enlisting universities and students makes it both educational and scientifically useful, while also building a cadre of experts who might support a real Mars mission when we end up doing one." Ellegood said he thought it ironic that "on one hand, NASA is being pressured by Congress and the public to focus on long-duration human exploration missions, and on the other hand they're being ridiculed for conducting some of the research that is prerequisite to such missions." Our ruling Paul gets the basics of the project right. The government is paying for a study in Hawaii in which people will prepare foods under conditions that simulate a mission to Mars. He exaggerates when he refers to "colonizing" Mars, since the project is a broader look a how astronauts would eat on short-term visits. Also, he exaggerates the appeal of the assignment, which is in a small capsule on a barren landscape. It ain't waterfalls and palm trees. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-01626	"My campaign alone has created more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Narragansett Beer."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/28/clay-pell/clay-pell-says-his-campaign-has-created-more-ri-jo/	Clay Pell lobbed a zinger at rival Gina Raimondo during Tuesday night’s feisty Providence Journal-WPRI-12 Democratic gubernatorial debate. Pell took aim at Raimondo’s recent TV campaign ad, during which she said she helped bring iconic Narragansett Beer ("Hi Neighbor! - Have a ‘Gansett") back to Rhode Island. "Now it’s a top-selling beer again," Raimondo said in the ad, as she reiterated her claim that she has helped create more than 1,000 jobs when she was a partner in her former company, Point Judith Capital. "My campaign alone has created more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Narragansett Beer," Pell said Tuesday, drawing applause and laughter from the live TV audience at the Providence Performing Arts Center. PolitiFact Rhode Island recently examined Raimondo’s "more than 1,000 jobs" claim and ruled it True -- within its narrow scope. Raimondo did not claim that she created those jobs in Rhode Island -- though many people have taken away that impression. So do more people work in Pell’s campaign than at Narragansett Beer? First, we checked with Pell’s campaign manager, Devin Driscoll. Driscoll said the campaign has 40 paid employees. Driscoll listed those jobs in an email: "Team Pell has a field staff of thirty: three deputy field organizers (DFOs); twenty-three field organizers (FOs); two regional field directors (RFD); a deputy field director (DFD) and a field director." Driscoll said the field organizers are paid an entry-level salary equivalent to $36,000 a year. He declined to enumerate other salaries. "We also have a headquarters staff of ten: a driver, training director, policy director, digital director, GOTV director, Women for Pell director, operations director, scheduling director, deputy campaign manager and campaign manager." "All 40 of these folks are full-time and salaried, with the exception of three DFOs, who are stipended. Our FOs make a very competitive salary for organizers -- $36,000 a year, plus benefits (we offer healthcare through HealthSource RI to all salaried employees)." Driscoll said he started on January 1, and "we started onboarding field staff in May." The last workers joined the campaign in June. The campaign also has a Rhode Island-based finance director, Driscoll said, who is a consultant. Three people have left in the past two weeks to go to college or graduate school: a driver, a press assistant, and our data director, Driscoll said. To be fair, these jobs are not permanent. Should Pell become the next governor, it is fair to say that the entire campaign staff won’t join him at the State House. Should Pell lose the election, Team Pell would be disbanded. Then, we checked with Mark Hellendrung, president of Narragansett Beer, which was brewed in Rhode Island from 1890 through 1983. Hellendrung said that, in addition to himself, there are six Rhode Island residents and two Massachusetts residents working full-time for the company in Rhode Island, for a total of nine. Four people work full-time out of state in sales and marketing. He said there are about 50 part-time employees who work at promotions events all over the East Coast; 20 of them live and work in Rhode Island. The company is headquartered in Providence, but Hellendrung said the beer is now brewed in Rochester, N.Y., Pawcatuck, Conn., and Westport, Mass. Test batches have been brewed locally in Rhode Island; ultimately, the company hopes to open a brewery here. Our ruling Clay Pell says that his campaign has created "more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Narragansett Beer," a poke at Gina Raimondo’s claim that she helped bring Narragansett Beer back to Rhode Island. The Pell campaign provided a list of 40 campaign jobs; Narragansett Beer said it has 9 full-time employees in Rhode Island; 20 part-time people who work promotional events in Rhode Island; and four full-time employees out of state. A major difference is that the Pell jobs are short-term and, one way or the other, most or all will be gone no later than November. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we hoist a pint to Pell and rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05537	"6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/10/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-poverty-ranks-64-million-under/	In an online video suggesting that President Barack Obama plays golf while Americans suffer, U.S. Senate candidate David Dewhurst highlights the increase in the number of people living in poverty since Obama took office. The ad from the Texas lieutenant governor shows video of Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation’s economic troubles. The video culminates with these claims, which appear in red letters: "6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama" and "over 90 rounds of golf." We’ve already checked the sporty part of that claim, rating as True the statement that Obama has played more than 90 rounds of golf since he became president. Here, we’ll focus on Dewhurst’s claim that the ranks of the poor have grown by 6.4 million. As backup, Dewhurst’s campaign sent us a January 2012 editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner that says "there are 6.4 million more Americans in poverty today than when Obama took office." Dewhurst’s campaign also pointed us to a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference, which consists of Republican members of the U.S. Senate. The page — dated April 2, 2012, and titled "He’s Made it Worse: The Obama Economic Record" — is presented as a comparison of conditions when Obama became president and "today" according to statistics such as the unemployment rate and the size of the federal debt. Under "Americans in Poverty," the page says there were 39.8 million on Obama’s inauguration day (Jan. 20, 2009) and are 46.2 million "today." The difference: 6.4 million people. The page does not give a source for the poverty numbers, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. The bureau uses a measure of poverty called the "poverty thresholds" to help determine the number of U.S. residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty. The bureau’s thresholds, which are adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. For example, the preliminary figures for 2011, which are the most recent thresholds, show that a family of four people would be considered to be living in poverty if it earned less than $23,018 through the year. Alternatively, the 2011 threshold for single people younger than 65 is $11,702. The bureau’s thresholds are different from the poverty guidelines overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which are used to determine if applicants are eligible for government assistance programs. Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that the bureau estimates the number of U.S. residents living in poverty on an annual basis. The figure is based on a survey of a scientifically selected sample of about 100,000 households that takes place between February and April each year. The survey asks respondents their income for the previous year. And from the survey results, the bureau extrapolates the number of U.S. residents that were living in poverty that year. The 2010 poverty statistics were released in September 2011. The next estimate of the number of U.S. residents living in poverty, for 2011, is scheduled for release in September 2012. We should note that there have long been concerns about the bureau’s measure, which determines a person or family’s poverty status based on before-tax cash income. One of the primary identified weaknesses with this method is that it does not take into account government policies or benefits that can shrink a family’s income (such as payroll taxes) or enhance it (such as food stamps). Another criticism: The thresholds are not adjusted to account for variations in the cost of living in different places. We checked the bureau’s poverty figures to compare with the Senate Republican Conference’s data and found that the group was comparing the number of Americans in poverty in 2008 to the number in 2010. In other words, the Senate group used the bureau’s 2008 statistic — 39.8 million — for the number of people in poverty on Obama’s inauguration day in January 2009. And it used the 2010 statistic — 46.2 million, the most recent — for its count of poor Americans in April 2012. The bureau data show that the estimated number of U.S. residents in poverty in 2010, Obama’s second year in office, was greater by 6.4 million than it was in 2008, George W. Bush’s final full year in office. The largest increase came in 2009, Obama’s first year in office, when the poverty total was 3.8 million higher than the year before. In 2010, the number was 2.6 million greater than the 2009 level. The 46.2 million residents in poverty in 2010 amounted to the greatest number of Americans in the low-income category since the government started tracking the statistic in 1959. But the recent increase did not start on Obama’s watch. The number of Americans living in poverty, by the bureau’s measure, first creeped up in 2007, when 800,000 more people were in poverty than the year before. The subsequent 2008 increase: 2.5 million people. In fact, during Bush’s eight years as president, the estimated number of Americans in poverty rose every year but two. We applied the Dewhurst campaign’s methodology to the Bush years, comparing the number of people in poverty the year before Bush took office (2000) with the number during his last full year in office (2008). We found an increase of 8.2 million people. In making such comparisons, though, there is another, better way to judge change. As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, because of population growth, it’s important to notice shifts in the share of all residents in poverty. And during the years Dewhurst focused on, the portion of U.S. residents in poverty increased, although like the estimated number of people in poverty, the climb began in 2007. The figures: ** 2006: 12.3 percent ** 2007: 12.5 percent (0.2 percentage point increase) ** 2008: 13.2 percent (0.7 percentage point increase) ** 2009: 14.3 percent (1.1 percentage point increase) ** 2010: 15.1 percent (0.8 percentage point increase) The 2010 poverty rate of 15.1 percent was higher than that of every year for more than four decades, save two — 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent, and 1993, when it was the same as the 2010 figure, 15.1 percent. A September 2011 New York Times news article about the 2010 poverty statistics said economists pointed to joblessness associated with the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent recession as the main factor pushing more Americans into poverty. A final note: Dewhurst implies that Obama is to blame for the rising number of people in poverty. But our sense is that it’s unfair to place all the responsibility in the president’s lap. The economic downturn began before Obama took office. Also, poverty experts such as Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, say that more Americans would have been forced into poverty without the 2009 federal stimulus plan, championed by Obama, which included billions of dollars for programs that help low-income Americans such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance. More broadly, no single official controls the number of Americans living in poverty. Our ruling Dewhurst’s figures draw from a reliable source on Americans in poverty in 2010 — which, of course, is not 2012 — compared with 2008, the year before Obama became president. A better understanding of the extent of U.S. poverty lies in looking at the share of Americans in dire straits. That measure also supports Dewhurst’s point — that poverty has increased during Obama’s term. Then again, the percentage of residents in poverty had begun to grow in 2007, two years before Obama’s first in office. Finally, it’s a reach to say Obama is personally to blame for the increase in poverty. On balance, we rate Dewhurst’s statement Half True.

pomt-10124	On the economic crisis, "the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/13/barack-obama/lax-regulation-contributed-among-other-things/	The country's economic woes were a somber topic at the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008, with both candidates explaining their thoughts on the root of the crisis. "Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system," Obama said. "Sen. McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator." Let's look at what McCain said about deregulation before we get to the more complicated question of what caused the current economic mess. (See our story and other statements on potential causes of the subprime crisis here.) Obama is referring to an interview John McCain gave to the Wall Street Journal 's editorial page that published March 3, 3008. Here is the exchange: Question: "In 1995, when the Republicans won control of both houses of Congress, you proposed a regulatory moratorium, but couldn't get it passed. Would you declare such a moratorium if you were president?" McCain: "I'm always for less regulation. But I am aware of the view that there is a need for government oversight. I think we found this in the subprime lending crisis — that there are people that game the system and if not outright broke the law, they certainly engaged in unethical conduct which made this problem worse. So I do believe that there is role for oversight. "As far as a need for additional regulations are concerned, I think that depends on the legislative agenda and what the Congress does to some degree, but I am fundamentally a deregulator. I'd like to see a lot of the unnecessary government regulations eliminated, not just a moratorium. "I've thought more on the area of deregulation rather than a moratorium." So McCain is arguably proud of his reputation as a deregulator, but he says in the same breath that the subprime lending problem is one area that requires oversight. So Obama is leaving out the part of McCain's answer that doesn't suit his purposes in the debate. In this item, however, we're focusing on Obama's other statement, that "the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system." Deregulation implies regulations that were done away with. In the case of the economic crisis, there was a bit of that. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, gave an exemption to investment banks in 2004 that allowed them to take on much more debt. But credit default swaps were never regulated in the first place. In 1999, Republicans passed legislation, signed by President Clinton, specifically exempting them from regulation. Some regulatory agencies also had regulation powers that they never utilized or didn't utilize well. The Federal Reserve has the power to tighten lending standards, for instance, or raise interest rates. But former Chairman Alan Greenspan discouraged new rules and advised Congress repeatedly not to regulate derivatives. "There were lots of regulatory failures, and it would be reasonable to blame regulators for not detecting problems and acting on them sooner," said Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "But deregulation means the removal of regulatory barriers." But lax regulation contributed significantly to the crisis, in the opinion of another economist. "I put the first blame with the Fed and their failure to rein in the bubble," said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "They just ignored the proliferation of really bad mortgages," Baker said. "They could have cracked down on this in a number of ways and they chose not to." Both economists agree that regulatory failures contributed significantly to the problem, but it wasn't the only problem. Also, using the word "deregulation" to describe a broad spectrum of regulatory failures is not technically accurate. Obama is right that more rigorous regulation could have helped the situation, but he shorthands it as deregulation and he doesn't mention other contributing factors. For these reasons, we find Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-13T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['None']
pomt-06696	The United States "won every major battle" of the Vietnam War. "Every single one."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-never-lost-major-battle-vietn/	During a speech before the 93rd annual conference of the American Legion on Aug. 30, 2011, President Barack Obama praised the Vietnam War veterans in the audience for their service and achievements. "You, our Vietnam veterans, did not always receive the respect that you deserved — which was a national shame," Obama said. "But let it be remembered that you won every major battle of that war. Every single one." When we noticed Obama’s claim, we were skeptical. Was it really true that the United States, even as it lost the Vietnam War, actually won every major military battle? We checked with a variety of historians specializing in the period, and 10 of them responded to our inquiries. Combined, their responses provoked a lively and nuanced debate, which we’ll recap here. Here are some issues to consider: • What constitutes "winning"? It’s not as easy to answer this question as one might think. Lance Janda, a professor of history at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said that "our strategy in Vietnam did not revolve around taking and holding terrain. In fact, we often captured and then abandoned key positions over and over again, and measured our progress in the war through a body count." By that measure, Janda added, "it’s certainly true that we consistently inflicted far greater casualties on the Viet Cong and North Vietnam than we suffered, and if that’s the only gauge one uses to measure ‘victory,’ then we really did win in Vietnam." On the other hand, he said, "if you argue that the North Vietnamese learned how to fight us in the early major battles of the war and then developed superior tactical and strategic plans for prolonging and ultimately winning the war, then you can plausibly make the case that they were winning a lot of battles from the beginning, regardless of the body count." • What constitutes a "major" battle? There is no official list of "major" battles of the Vietnam War. Some battles could plausibly be classified as either major or minor, or else be classified as one battle within a broader campaign. Some observers have suggested that the U.S. actually lost more than two dozen battles during Vietnam. But the 10 historians we contacted agreed that most, and possibly all, of the major battles were won by the U.S. The biggest battles, including Tet and Khe Sanh, "took place in the first half of 1968 and all were clearly American victories," said Edwin E. Moise, a Clemson University historian. But if you expand the universe of battles that qualify as "major," two in particular might be considered U.S. defeats, he said. One likely loss was the battle at Landing Zone Albany, in November 1965. An American battalion of about 400 men was ambushed by the People’s Army of North Vietnam -- the North Vietnamese army -- and parts of the battalion were overrun, Moise said. The preliminary count of American casualties was 151 killed, 121 wounded and 5 missing. Since defensive perimeters were established and a majority of U.S. troops did survive the battle, some might not consider it a defeat, but Moise is among those who do. Maj. Steven M. Leonard wrote in the journal Army Logistician that "inevitably, there were those who would draw comparison to" the wipeout of Gen. George A. Custer’s 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn. The second likely loss was the battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord in mid 1970, which was largely unknown by the public into the mid 1980s. The United States established Ripcord to help launch attacks in the A Shau and Da Krong valleys, Moise said, but the North Vietnamese army attacked it "so strongly that the American command decided it had better get the U.S. troops out fast if it was to get them out alive. The withdrawal on July 23 was so hasty that the withdrawing troops were not able to take along all their artillery pieces. I would have to call this an American defeat." Richard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill), added that the South Vietnamese Army lost battles even with the benefit of U.S. advisers and air power, such as Operation Lam Son 719, the incursion into Laos in 1971 that led to heavy casualties. • Is winning military battles the appropriate yardstick to judge the Vietnam War? Ultimately, this is the question that matters. If you assume that the U.S. really did win all the major battles of the war on military terms, how does one square that with the reality that the U.S. lost the war as a whole? "For the most part, Vietnam was not a war of ‘major battles,'" said Andrew Bacevich, a career Army officer who now teaches international relations at Boston University. "What matters is a war's outcome. Therefore, the president's claim is largely beside the point -- not unlike advocates of the 'Lost Cause' citing Robert E. Lee's victories as evidence of the superiority of the Confederate army." To better analyze this paradox, let’s look at a couple of examples of military victories that were losses in the bigger picture. One example is the Tet Offensive, which is often considered the turning point of the war. In January 1968, the North Vietnamese army launched a surprise attack during Tet, the Vietnamese New Year. Militarily, it was a major defeat for the Communists, but in the public relations sphere, it was far from a victory for the United States. The offensive, Moise has written, undercut U.S. claims that the Communists were weak, brought the brutality of the war to American television screens, and led to the highest U.S. casualty rates of the war. "It was a tactical victory for the U.S. in the sense of casualties inflicted and a strategic victory in the military sense, because it defeated the enemy's plan in the field," said James C. Bradford, a Texas A&M University historian. "But the North Vietnamese won a strategic political victory in the sense that the campaign eroded support for the war in the U.S. and contributed directly to President Lyndon B. Johnson's decision to not seek re-election." Meanwhile, in the battle for "Hamburger Hill" in May 1969, 46 Americans died and 400 were wounded. Enemy losses were much higher -- the number of dead was estimated to be 673 -- and the U.S. seized the hill in question. So by body counts and tactical achievements, the battle for Hamburger Hill was a U.S. victory. But within days, the U.S. decided to abandon the position it had seized, for tactical and operational reasons. And the victory came at a steep price back home. As the late Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. wrote in 1999, "war is first and foremost a political act, and in the view of politicians in Washington the 101st Airborne Division's assault on Hamburger Hill had been a disaster. As Hedrick Smith reported in the May 23, 1969, New York Times, a number of civilian officials in the Nixon administration were afraid such Pyrrhic victories would undermine public support for the war and thus shorten the administration's time for successful negotiations in Paris." The historians we contacted largely agreed that the president was technically right, or at least close to right, in saying that the U.S. won the war’s major battles. Author Doris Kearns Goodwin noted that Obama’s comments were targeted directly to veterans. "The responsibility for the eroding support for the war falls on the political leaders, not on the veterans," she said. At the same time, while Obama's comment may be technically accurate, several historians added that it may be irrelevant because it does not address the larger factors that had a more dramatic impact on the conduct and outcome of the war. Before his death in 1999, Summers liked to tell about a meeting he had with a North Vietnamese colonel named Tu while he was with a delegation visiting Hanoi in 1975. At one point, Summers told Tu, "You know, you never defeated us on the battlefield." Tu paused for a moment, then replied, "That may be so. But it is also irrelevant." Obama’s claim, said Cameron University’s Janda, "is ultimately emotional and defies logic." Our ruling Most of the the 10 historians agreed that Obama was pretty close to correct when he said that the U.S. didn’t lose any major battles in the Vietnam War -- "pretty close" because a case can be made that the U.S. lost the battles for Landing Zone Albany and Fire Support Base Ripcord, and possibly others. But Obama's remark to the veterans fits our definition of a Half True - the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Although the U.S. may have won most of the major battles, it's important to note that there is wide agreement that the U.S. lost the war. The cause of that may very well be political decisions rather than military ones, but it's an exaggeration to portray the U.S. effort the way Obama has. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01611	"Scott Walker has given a $10,000 tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/31/wisconsin-state-afl-cio/scott-walker-gave-10000-tax-break-millionaires-afl/	In a mass-mail piece headlined "Falling Behind," the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO contends that under Wisconsin’s Republican governor, working families have suffered at the expense of the well-to-do. The four-page flier goes on to make a number of attacks, including this one: "What’s really troubling is that Scott Walker has given a $10,000 tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools. Some have asked why Walker is giving a tax break to millionaires who can afford tuition costs rather than investing in the children who are being educated in public schools. Working families are still waiting for an answer." So, did Walker carve out a $10,000 private-school tax break strictly to benefit millionaires? What happened The AFL-CIO hasn’t been alone in decrying the tax measure, adopted as part of the 2013-’15 state budget, which is for students from kindergarten through high school. The Wisconsin Budget Project, part of the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, criticized it for being larger than the tax deduction available for college tuition. Meanwhile, the Republican chairman of the state Senate Education Committee praised the tax break because it "might make it easier for parents to afford private school if they feel that is the best option for their children." Here’s how it works: Beginning in the 2014 tax year, for tax returns due in April 2015, taxpayers can subtract from their income amounts paid to private schools for tuition and mandatory student fees. The schools can be inside or outside of Wisconsin, although expenses such as room and board can’t be deducted. For each student in kindergarten through eighth grade, the maximum deduction is $4,000; for each student in high school, the maximum is $10,000. An important point: The deductions are available to any individuals, regardless of income, including millionaires. Taxpayer impact The deduction will amount to a state income tax cut for the typical family of up to roughly $240 for each elementary school student and $600 for each high school student, according to a rough calculation by the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office. Percentage-wise, the savings have a bigger impact on taxpayers with lower incomes, although it wouldn’t be enough by itself for many lower-income families to pay for a private school. Viewed another way, the state is expected to collect $30 million per year less in tax revenue as a result of the tax break. The AFL-CIO argues that, in light of cuts Walker made to public school aid with his 2011-’13 budget, the $30 million is yet more money that could be invested in public schools rather than for reducing taxes for people who are arguably on the higher end of the income scale. The conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute observed, however, that the reduced revenue could be offset if the tax break enticed more students -- about 3,000 -- to move to private schools. That’s because public schools get state taxpayer aid based on how many students they have. While many private-school students come from wealthier families, many others come from families with more modest incomes. Before we close, let’s consider one other perspective. In June 2013, days before the tax break became law, state public schools superintendent Tony Evers declared it "the most generous in the nation." We rated his claim Half True. We found that in comparison to the five other states that offered either a private school tax deduction, or tax credit, Wisconsin’s tax break is among the most generous -- for parents with multiple children attending a private high school, for example. But depending on various factors, it's not necessarily more generous than other states. Our rating The state AFL-CIO said Walker "has given a $10,000 tax deduction to millionaires who send their kids to exclusive private schools." There is an element of truth, in that millionaires do benefit from the tax break. But so do taxpayers of other income levels who send their kids to private schools. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05750	Sixteen million jobs were created under Ronald Reagan's presidency.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/02/newt-gingrich/gingrich-uses-reagan-record-make-case-his-campaign/	Former Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich was feeling nostalgic Wednesday. Or at least hoping voters here feel that way next week. Gingrich, now a Virginia resident, spoke to the Georgia House of Representatives to gather support in a state the Republican has repeatedly said he must win Tuesday in order to stay in the race for the White House. Gingrich talked one particular achievement that he and his fellow members of Congress were able to accomplish with Republicans favorite Republican, President Ronald Reagan, during the 1980s. They created 16 million jobs during the Reagan years, he said. It could be done again under a Gingrich presidency, the candidate said. Perhaps. But we wondered if Gingrich was correct about that number under the Reagan years. Gingrich served in Congress from 1979 to 1999, the final four years as U.S. House Speaker. Reagan took office in 1981 and left the White House in January 1989. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps the most widely used data on employment, which can be accessed on its website on a month-by-month basis. In January 1981, the month Reagan took office, there were slightly more than 91 million Americans employed. By January 1989, the total was 107.1 million Americans. That’s an increase of 16.1 million employed Americans. There is some debate about how much credit Reagan deserves for the increase. First, what types of jobs were these? Reagan’s supply side economic policies were debated intensely at the time. Critics contend those policies resulted in the rich getting richer and the poor becoming poorer. Conservatives say his tax cuts were the catalyst of the nation’s economic revival in the mid 1980s. The Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute released a report in 1996 that found the median family income of Americans rose by nearly 1 percent a year under Reagan, which they concluded was higher than the years before and after he was in office. A U.S. Census Bureau chart we found shows a similar increase, although median salaries rose higher for whites than African-Americans and Hispanics. Asian-Americans weren’t included in the chart. The first two years of Reagan’s presidency saw a economic downturn that included the decline of about 2.3 million employed Americans and an unemployment rate that rose from 7.5 percent to 10.8 percent. The unemployment rate was 5.4 percent by the end of Reagan’s presidency. Some argue Reagan’s predecessor, Jimmy Carter, was responsible for some economic policies that helped during the Reagan years. Others contend the increase in employed Americans were largely a result of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates and expanding the money supply, policies used after the recent Great Recession. Gingrich’s numbers are accurate. Reagan’s policies, many of which required the support of Congress, deserve some credit for the increase. We rate Gingrich’s statement as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/51bfa8a4-73fc-48e3-a8b5-c9361867c06e	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-03-02T06:00:00	2012-02-29	['Ronald_Reagan']
pomt-09614	"Sen. Hutchison abandoned Republicans and stood with Democrats to ensure health care legislation would pass quickly."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jan/13/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-hutchison-abandoned-gop-helped/	Gov. Rick Perry's campaign landed a Nutcracker-like leap in December by suggesting that Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison enabled Democrats to advance their health-care package by voting for the Senate to take up an unrelated spending proposal. Hutchison's vote caused a small stir back home. Texas "tea party" activists gathered outside Hutchison's offices in Austin, Houston and Dallas. Perry spokesman Mark Miner said Dec. 20: "After promising to fight health care, Sen. Hutchison abandoned Republicans and stood with Democrats to ensure health care legislation would pass quickly." But is that the way it happened in Washington? We decided to check Perry's version of events. True, Hutchison voted with the majority Democrats in favor of the Senate taking up the defense appropriation. Early on Dec. 19, Democratic leaders amassed more than the 60 votes needed under Senate rules to proceed to action on the measure. Outnumbered Republicans had hoped to keep members stewing on the defense plan, thereby putting off action on the looming health care legislation. The vote kept the Senate on a schedule that allowed the Democrats to bring up the health care overhaul. On Christmas Eve, the Senate passed it. By Perry's analysis, Hutchison's vote eased the Democrats' passage of the health care bill she opposed. Perry's campaign posted several videos online including the version we're showing to the right musically casting Hutchison as flip-flopping. The video includes a snippet showing Hutchison telling colleagues before the vote that its early-morning timing was being driven by the "underlying" health care legislation. Remember, Democrats needed only 60 votes to stay on their schedule. We found that Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, voting at 1:14 a.m., provided the crucial 60th vote in favor of action on the defense bill. One minute later, two Republicans — Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine — voted "aye." Video broadcast on C-SPAN2 shows Hutchison voting "aye" at 1:16 a.m. At 1:20 a.m., the final tally was read: 63 Yeas, 33 Nays. Most Republicans — including Hutchison — then joined Democrats in passing the spending measure, 88-10. Did Hutchison's procedural vote in any way ensure the Democrats' health care legislation would pass quickly? We don't see how. The Perry campaign hasn't offered evidence to prove Hutchison blessed the Democratic health plan in any way other than casting a vote on that defense bill after the outcome was determined. Asked why Hutchison signed off on taking up the earlier spending measure -- surely knowing her vote might generate sparks back home -- Hutchison spokesman Joe Pounder said: "After the Democrats had their 60, Sen. Hutchison felt it was important to register her vote for our defense priorities." Significantly, Hutchison later joined fellow Republicans and voted against passage of the Democratic health plan. In claiming that Hutchison paved the way for the Democratic health bill, the Perry campaign leaped to a conclusion not supported by the facts. We give the Perry campaign's statement a ruling of Pants on Fire.

pomt-07970	The financial regulatory bill "will kill jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-dodd-frank-financial-regulation-bi/	After the global economic crisis of 2008, President Barack Obama and Democratic lawmakers promised to pass a bill that would strengthen regulation of financial markets. The result was the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The law is complex -- here is a summary assembled by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee -- but in general, the bill created an independent consumer protection agency, established new ways to liquidate failed financial firms, created a council to warn about systemic risks to the financial system and tighten regulatory scrutiny of the financial system while increasing transparency. The measure was controversial. When it passed the House and the Senate, it did so with only three Republicans voting for it in each chamber. On July 15, 2010, shortly after the Senate passed the measure, then-House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence, R-Ind., released a statement critical of the bill. In part, it said, "This so-called financial reform bill will kill jobs, raise taxes, restrict the flow of credit, make bailouts permanent and turn the Democrats’ disastrous too-big-to-fail approach into federal law." With the Republicans now in control of the House, some lawmakers are already pushing to repeal Dodd-Frank. Not long after being sworn in, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said she was introducing a bill to do just that. "I'm pleased to offer a full repeal of the job-killing Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill," Bachmann said. As part of our look at the range of bills that have been attacked as "job-killing," we thought we'd look at whether the charge is accurate when leveled against the Dodd-Frank bill. We began by asking Pence's office for details on why they believed the bill would "kill jobs." They replied with two position statements Pence's office had sent out during the debate. One of Pence's statements said the bill "would discourage lending to those on Main Street. By draining capital out of the financial system and wasting it on misguided government spending and double-digit unemployment, the albatross weighing down the economy gets even heavier." In an interview, Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, elaborated on what Pence meant. "Micro-level access to credit for consumers and small businesses will be severely constricted, hampering basic purchases and small-business creation," Thallam said. "Individuals who need access to credit will inevitably substitute to whatever form is available (check bouncing, loan sharks, other high interest methods) which is like adding a tax on these transactions, which in turn will reduce the number of productive purchases, investments, and allocations." The other concern Pence raised is that "government bureaucrats would have the authority to break up" a bank or bank holding company that is becoming "too big to fail" -- "even if the firm is financially healthy and well managed. Such arbitrary power could have a devastating impact on the nation’s economy and destroy American jobs." Next, we looked at the cost estimate of the bill published by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency that referees fiscal and economic impacts for Congress. Though CBO acknowledged that uncertainty about the course of future regulations clouded its estimate, it nonetheless concluded that the cost of the bill on the private sector would be substantial. Over the bill's first five years, firms would likely have to pay $1 billion into a mandatory fund that would help liquidate failed financial institutions; $650 million in user fees to the Securities and Exchange Commission; $375 million to cover new regulatory entities within the Treasury Department; and $375 million to cover new regulatory costs for the Federal Reserve. In addition, the bill would impose specific costs or restrictions on credit rating agencies, credit card companies and hedge funds. Finally, the bill opened the door to the SEC barring mandatory arbitration to settle disputes, requiring companies instead to use the court system. The cost of such a rule "could be significant," the CBO said. Granted, the financial and insurance sector is big -- it contributes more than $1 trillion annually to GDP, or better than 8 percent of the national GDP, so these costs would be absorbed into a pretty large base. Still, they are not trivial. While the CBO didn't go as far as to project job losses, most analysts we spoke to agreed that they could have a direct impact on the number of people employed by financial companies. In 2009, the financial and insurance sectors employed about 6.8 million Americans. But the analysis of job losses quickly gets tricky. Between 2008 and 2009, the financial and insurance industry shed about 450,000 jobs, or 6 percent of its workforce -- most, presumably, due to the economic crisis and the resulting meltdown that the Dodd-Frank bill is designed to prevent. Should the number of jobs "killed" because of Dodd-Frank be offset by the 450,000 jobs in the financial sector that might have been saved had Dodd Frank been in place earlier? For that matter, what about the 7.2 million jobs lost in the larger economy between the peak employment of December 2007 and today, a drop that was caused to a significant (though not exclusive) degree by excesses in the financial sector? Most of the experts we spoke to said the bill is all about tradeoffs -- and determining whether the tradeoff is merited depends heavily on how much confidence you have that Dodd-Frank will actually be able to prevent economic crises. "Let's assume this bill is a big job-killer because of the direct and indirect costs to the financial system, and because of the degradation in the ability of the financial sector to support the non-financial sector," said J.D. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Those costs are like a great, macro-insurance premium we all pay hopefully to avoid a costly financial crisis. The big question is then, will the financial regulatory bill reduce the likelihood or the magnitude of a future financial crisis?" Foster said he personally doesn't think Dodd-Frank would do much good in preventing the next crisis. Others, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision -- an international panel of high-level banking officials that serves as a forum to discuss regulatory issues -- have projected that Dodd-Frank has a decent shot at succeeding. Even supporters of the bill acknowledge uncertainty, and even skepticism, about its effectiveness. Still, many did tell us that the risks of another crisis are so serious -- including on the narrow question of how many jobs are "killed" as a result of future financial crises -- that even an imperfect bill needed to be passed. "It requires an exceptional degree of chutzpah to suggest that new regulation of the financial sector represents 'job-killing' legislation," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "If any private industry in the United States can be legitimately identified as a 'job-killing' machine, the financial sector would seem be that industry. The nation is still trying to pick of the pieces from a devastating economic crisis brought about by the financial industry’s hubris and recklessness." As we concluded our research on this item, we noticed that the information on how financial reform will affect the labor supply is speculative. While the CBO noted that the cost for the private sector would be substantial, it didn't estimate how much that would affect job numbers. (By contrast, CBO said the health care law would restrict the labor supply by .5 percent.) Most analysts agree that the financial regulations will restrict job growth by some amount, but nobody has detailed estimates on just how much. Ultimately, even the supporters of the bill we spoke to acknowledged that some jobs will likely be lost, or never created, due to passage of Dodd-Frank. However, many of the experts we spoke to agreed that not passing the bill would put even more jobs in the greater economy at risk, not to mention countless nest-eggs, homes and other non-job-related concerns. Would potential job savings offset job costs? Unfortunately, there is no way to know. Still, Pence's comment ignores the principle that preventing financial shocks is job-saving. On balance, we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb3196ca-e4dd-4009-863e-dbaa192dc592	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2011-01-21T11:11:27	2010-07-15	['None']
pomt-12532	"We don’t give bonuses in the state of Missouri on any level of government."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/apr/21/dan-hegeman/u-missouri-system-bonuses-might-not-be-outlier-sta/	Two days after the Missouri State Auditor’s office released a report showing the University of Missouri System paid top executives and administrators roughly $2.3 million in inappropriate bonuses, state Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, criticized the university system during a meeting with three Board of Curators nominees. "We don’t give bonuses in the state of Missouri on any level of government, so this is very troubling for me what we’re seeing, and I’m glad you’re taking it to heart," Hegeman said to one nominee, according to the Columbia Daily Tribune. "Even if it’s legal, it may not be the right thing to do." Amid public and legislative scrutiny, newly appointed UM System President Mun Choi ended the executive compensation program on March 10. But we were interested in looking into Hegeman’s claim that public money is not used for employee bonuses in other areas of the state. When asked to elaborate on the claim, Drew Dampf, a spokesman for Hegeman, said the state senator was speaking from his experience working in government at both the county and state levels, where giving out bonus pay is not standard practice. In fact, Article III, Section 39 of the Missouri Constitution states that any unearned, extra compensation given after a service has already been rendered is unlawful. The UM System audit found that the executive compensation program appeared to violate that section along with the Attorney General’s Opinion No. 72-1955, which extends the law on bonus pay to all government agencies within the state. But the audit also noted a distinct difference between bonus pay and incentive pay. "While the use of an incentive program may be allowable if implemented and executed appropriately, the absence of consistent documentation about performance goals to be met and the lack of defined objective criteria to determine the achievement of incentives gives the appearance the payments represent additional compensation for past performance," the audit read. In other words, incentives are predetermined in an employment contract and have specific requirements to be met in order to receive payments, State Auditor Nicole Galloway said. Bonuses reward extra compensation for work the employee was already expected to perform. Whether a violation has occurred at the state or the local level, it is up to law enforcement agencies to decide if any legal actions should be taken. "Sometimes we find things that are clear violations, but we don’t have power to seek any legal enforcement," Galloway told PolitiFact Missouri. "It can be very frustrating sometimes." Bonus pay is not something a government body would broadcast to the public, so it’s tough to tell whether the same thing is happening anywhere else in the state. Gena Terlizzi, a spokeswoman for the auditor’s office, said the office had not identified other concerns with bonus or incentive pay at the state level since Galloway assumed the office in April 2015. However, Terlizzi provided examples of several recent local audits that included findings that appeared to violate Article III, Section 39. Problems at the local level There are dozens of local government audits over the past decade showing various bonuses paid to employees and contractors. Terlizzi pointed out the five most recent examples: 1. In December 2014 and 2015, the Huntsville City Council approved year-end bonuses for all city employees. Full-time employees with more than a year of service received $100, while half-time employees and those with under a year of service received $50. In total, $2,000 in bonus pay was handed out each year. 2. A 2016 audit of Buck Prairie Road District in Lawrence County gave a poor rating to the district’s budgetary system. A myriad of problems were identified, including $207,000 paid to three district employees over two years when the total should have been about $156,000, according to the district's payroll system. In violation of Article III, Section 39, the road district’s three employees were paid bonuses of more than $2,000 per person in November 2014. These bonuses were given the label "special" payments in the district’s accounting system. 3. Marion County Services for the Developmentally Disabled received a slap on the wrist in April 2016 for its financial documentation procedures. In addition, the services department spent $1,420 on 46 gift cards in 2014-2015 and $420 for small gifts and cash payments to reward employees for their work. The department had already been called out in a prior audit for similar misuse of funding. 4. Henry County was also unfazed by previous audits when State Auditor Nicole Galloway released a statement in December 2015 saying the office found the county failed to implement the office’s recommendations in two prior audits. The county received a rating of "poor" that year. Along with many other reporting and documentation issues, the county paid $1,000 in bonuses to seven employees. 5. In November 2015, the Village of Leasburg, in Crawford County, also received a "poor" rating. Nearly $10,000 was missing from the village’s budget from 2011-2013, and the auditor’s office was unable to figure out exactly who was responsible due to outdated record and documentation management. In addition, several employees were given bonuses or were paid for hours they had not worked, including $350 Christmas bonuses paid to village employees and reserve police officers in December 2013. No documentation or reasoning was given for $3,505 paid to the Board of Trustees chairperson’s son in 2013. Past issues at the state level The former state auditor, John Watson, found an instance in 2012 when a Missouri Department of Transportation employee received a $30,000 reimbursement from the department for a loss on a sale of the employee's property. The audit defined such a reimbursement as an impermissible extra compensation. In 2009, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the state’s retirement fund doled out $300,000 in bonuses to its 14-member investment team and $160,000 in "one-time incentive payments" to 58 operations staffers despite the fact that the pension system had lost $1.8 billion in investments in 2008. State workers hired before 2011 do not pay a portion of their salary to the pension program. Other funding comes from taxpayers and investment earnings. Then-Gov. Jay Nixon described the bonuses as "unconscionable" and criticized the department for establishing a bonus program that avoided transparency requirements. In 2011, the Missouri State Employees Retirement System discontinued the operations staff incentive program and modified the investment staff incentive program. Our ruling Sen. Hegeman called out the UM System for its inappropriate use of public and tuition funding by contrasting it with the rest of the state. "We don’t give bonuses in the state of Missouri on any level of government," he said in a Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee meeting. While it is true that state law forbids bonuses, several government agencies have given them and legal retribution is inconsistent. Hegeman’s claim is accurate but needs clarification. We rate this claim Half True. CLARIFICATION, April 22, 2017: This article has been updated to clarify which state workers didn't pay a portion of their salary to the pension program. This change did not affect the ruling.	None	Dan Hegeman	None	None	None	2017-04-21T09:28:01	2017-03-08	['Missouri']
pomt-09627	"Why is January 8th an important date in American history? This day in 1835 is the only day in our history when we have not been in debt."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/11/george-lemieux/fla-senator-says-jan-8-1835-only-day-us-has-been-d/	U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla., has joined the ranks of politicians experimenting with Twitter. LeMieux, who was appointed last year to fill the unexpired term of Sen. Mel Martinez, has sent Twitter messages with his thoughts on health care reform ("neither 'comprehensive' nor 'reform'"), his whereabouts ("visiting our military installations tomorrow") and now, U.S. trivia. "Why is January 8th an important date in American History," LeMieux asked during the afternoon of Jan. 8, 2010. "This day in 1835 is the only day in our history when we have not been in debt." We've all seen pictures of the national debt clock, which is now spinning past $12.3 trillion. In fact, LeMieux has it running on a computer monitor posted outside his Washington office, and mentioned the debt on his first day as a senator. We wondered, was there actually a time, one time, when the clock struck zero? First, just so no one gets confused: Debt does not equal deficit. Deficit is the difference in the money the government takes in and what it spends each year. Debt is accumulated deficits, plus interest. You'd think the United States would have been founded with zero debt. But not so, says the Bureau of Public Debt. The government office, which is under the U.S. Department of the Treasury, says the United States had more than $75 million in outstanding American Revolutionary War debts when the nation was created. From there, the national debt grew some and shrunk some before ballooning to $127 million as a result of the War of 1812. The debt then started a steady 20-year decline, which you can see for yourself here. By Jan. 1, 1833, the national debt stood at $7 million. On Jan. 1, 1835, under President Andrew Jackson, the debt was just $33,733. On Jan. 8 of that year, Jackson proclaimed that the last installment of the national debt had been paid. Jackson had called the debt a "national curse" when he ran for president in 1824. "The Payment of the Public Debt," Jackson wrote in a toast at a party that also marked the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans (another good day for Jackson, who as general, led U.S. troops to victory). "Let us commemorate it as an event that gives us increased power as a nation, and reflects luster on our federal Union, of whose justice, fidelity, and wisdom it is a glorious illustration." According to the 1860 biography Life of Andrew Jackson written by James Parton, Jackson vetoed bills that appropriated money for infrastructure projects, thus quickening the pace that the country's debt was retired by up to five years. It was one of the cornerstones of his administration, said Parton, who added that Jackson thought it his most glorious achievement. But did it actually happen on Jan. 8? Jackson biographer Robert Vincent Remini said in his book The Life of Andrew Jackson that the extinguishing of the national debt "nearly coincided" with the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans, which falls on Jan. 8. That would at least suggest the actual payment may have occurred a few days sooner. Remini doesn't get into more detail. Other accounts, like H.W. Brand's Andrew Jackson, His Life and Times, say the country was debt free closer to Jan. 1, 1835. For its part, the Bureau of Public Debt says that the national debt reached zero on Jan. 8, 1835, a Thursday. LeMieux's office provided PolitiFact with some additional examples (here and here) documenting the U.S. being debt free on Jan. 8, 1835. After Jan. 8, history writers fail to track the debt with precise detail. Jackson biographers Parton and Remini don't discuss how long the national debt remained zero. (In their defense, they use their ink discussing an assassination attempt on Jackson at the end of January 1835). The Bureau of Public Debt also appears fuzzy on how long America was debt free. All the government group notes is that it wasn't long. We talked to Robert E. Wright, a political economy professor and author of One Nation Under Debt: Hamilton, Jefferson, and the History of What We Owe. He offered a couple of caveats to this talk about the national debt. Even though the United States was considered debt free, the government still had outstanding loans, Wright said. No one asked for the loans to be paid off however, and the federal government had the money in the bank to pay them if they were. Wright said the country remained debt free for some time -- much longer than a day -- as politicians argued over what to do with government surpluses. "There wasn't a desire to invest in corporations," Wright said. "But there were schemes afloat to divide the money up and give it to the states." Financial panics made those discussions irrelevant. By Jan. 1, 1836, the national debt had grown back to $37,000, according to the Bureau of Public Debt. A four-year depression starting in 1839 resulted in the debt growing to $20 million. Then, it was off to the races. The debt was more than $2.6 billion by the end of the Civil War; almost $27 billion by the end of World War I, and almost $260 billion by the end of World War II. The debt reached $1 trillion in Ronald Reagan's first term as president. It reached $5 trillion near the end of Bill Clinton's first term. LeMieux says that the United States was only debt free for one day in its history -- Jan. 8, 1835. He's right that the United States was indeed debt free on that day. And before and after that, we as a country really never got that close to being debt free. Did it last only one day, however, as LeMieux says? We found "this day in history" stories and blogs that tend to suggest so. But LeMieux's office didn't offer any definitive proof. Jackson biographers don't note it that way. Neither does the government office that tracks the debt. Scholars also say it lasted much more than a day. And since Jackson was bent on retiring the debt, we'd at least expect him to spend a day or two with an empty credit card account before racking up a bill again. We rate LeMieux's comment Mostly True.	None	George LeMieux	None	None	None	2010-01-11T19:04:49	2010-01-08	['United_States']
pomt-12524	"Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns."	true	/missouri/statements/2017/apr/23/allen-andrews/missouri-has-borrowed-money-unemployment-insurance/	Ever since the Great Recession in 2007-09, Missouri lawmakers have been trying to change Missouri’s unemployment benefits. House Bill 228 is the General Assembly’s third attempt in the past four legislative sessions to offer unemployment benefits on a sliding scale. If passed, the bill would link the amount of weeks a person could receive unemployment benefits to the state’s unemployment rate. Currently, Missouri offers up to 20 weeks of unemployment benefits. The bill proposes that when Missouri has a low unemployment rate — 6 percent or lower — benefits would be available for only 13 weeks. As the rate increases, so do the benefits. At most, people could collect up to 20 weeks of benefits if the unemployment rate is 9 percent or higher. Supporters said the bill will ensure the state does not deplete the state’s unemployment trust fund, which is how Missouri saves money for unemployment benefits during recessions. When the fund reaches zero, the state must borrow money from the federal government, which involves paying high interest rates. Employers pay separate taxes to fund both the state and federal unemployment trust fund. The bill’s fiscal notes report it could save the state’s unemployment fund up to $82 million per year. The House passed HB 288 on February 23, and it now awaits a vote in the Senate. In the days after the House voted, Rep. Allen Andrews, R-Grant City, was quoted about the bill in an article on KMA Land, a website produced by a radio news station based in Shenandoah, Iowa. Andrews said, "Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns. This isn’t the only time Andrews has stated this. A fewlegislators and the Missouri Chamber of Commerce have repeated the statement as well. So we wanted to check it out. Missouri borrowing Andrews never answered PolitiFact’s many emails and calls, so we went to find the data on our own. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the last five recessions were > December 2007 to June 2009 > March 2001 to November 2001 > July 1990 to March 1991 > July 1981 to November 1982 > January 1980 to July 1980: To find out whether Missouri borrowed a Federal Title XII loan to pay for unemployment benefits deficits during those time periods, we went to the U.S. Department of Labor. The data showed that at year’s end of the following years, Missouri had borrowed money to fully fund unemployment benefits claims: > 2009-2013 > 2003-2006 > 1993 > 1983 > 1982 These year years don’t exactly match up with the recessions — Missouri borrows just after the recessions’ end dates — but that’s normal, said Robert Pavosevich, lead actuary for the U.S. Department of Labor. States usually take out loans at the end of a recession, not in the middle, when unemployment remains high, he said. In fact, Pavosevich said that using the strict definition of a recession "wouldn’t be fair." "When people talk about recession, generally they’re talking about when unemployment is high, not the official date," he said. "(Andrews) probably meant the time period overall." So far, Andrews is correct: Missouri has borrowed money from the federal government in the last five recessions to make up for deficits in its unemployment trust fund — but is it the only state to do so? The only state A review of data on borrowing by the other 49 states along with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands confirms that Missouri is indeed the only state to receive a loan from the federal government for the unemployment trust fund during the past five economic downturns. There are five close contenders that borrowed during four of the five recessions: Neither Michigan nor Connecticut borrowed for the 2001 recession, while Minnesota, Texas and Illinois didn’t borrow for the 1990-91 recession. Pavosevich said there were two other ways that could invalidate Andrews’ claim. States could have borrowed and paid back a loan within a year, which wouldn’t have been represented on the data available on the department’s website. Additionally, several states use private borrowing to pay back the Title XII loan to the government by selling state bonds to the private market; these states have outstanding loans for unemployment benefits but not to the government. Pavosevich looked into the data, which isn’t publicly available, for these two caveats — paying the Title XII loan within the year and private borrowing — and found that Missouri is the only state to to have taken out a loan during or right after each of the last five recession. "(It) appears that the statement is true if you consider recessionary periods rather broadly," Pavosevich concluded in an email. Our ruling Andrews said, "Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns." According to the data from the U.S. Department of Labor, not only did Missouri take out loans from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during economic downturns, but also it is the only state to do so. We rate this claim as True.	None	Allen Andrews	None	None	None	2017-04-23T09:24:06	2017-02-24	['None']
pomt-02093	Before the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, "the State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/19/ron-johnson/hillary-clintons-state-department-reduced-security/	With the launch of a new Benghazi investigation, Republicans will once again scrutinize the actions of Hillary Rodham Clinton's State Department in the months leading up to the deadly terrorist attacks in that Libyan port city. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson signaled as much on May 6, 2014, two days before the GOP-led House of Representatives voted to open what by some counts is the eighth Benghazi investigation. In an opinion article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson alleged that a "dereliction of duty" by Clinton contributed to the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. It wasn’t the first time the Wisconsin Republican took on the Democrats’ front-runner for president in 2016. One of Johnson's high-profile moments in the Senate occurred during a testy exchange with Clinton, then the secretary of state, at a 2013 hearing on Benghazi that led to Clinton’s oft-quoted "What difference does it make" comment. In his opinion piece, Johnson singled out the State Department leadership in Washington in saying that "the greatest outrages occurred before the attack." "The State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya. Although no one can say with certainty, I firmly believe a relatively small contingent of armed military guards would have prevented the attack, and those four lives would not have been lost." Is Johnson right -- that before the attacks, the State Department "failed to honor repeated requests for additional security" and "actually reduced security in Libya"? Benghazi background A May 2014 Associated Press news article sets the scene prior to the attacks, which resulted in the first murder of a U.S. ambassador since 1988. Benghazi is where Moammar Gadhafi in 1969 launched a revolution that put him in control of the North African nation. It is also the birthplace of a 2011 revolt that, with the help of NATO warships and planes, deposed and killed the Libyan dictator. A year later, Benghazi remained chaotic, in the grip of heavily armed militias and Islamist militants, some with links to al-Qaida. A temporary U.S. mission in Benghazi had been created in 2011 in hopes of encouraging stability and democracy. It was struck by homemade bombs twice in the spring of 2012 -- two of some 20 security incidents involving the facility, British diplomats, the Red Cross or other Westerners in the months before the deadly assaults. Ambassador Chris Stevens was based at the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, 400 miles west of Benghazi. He decided to visit the Benghazi mission on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when U.S. embassies around the world were on alert for terrorism. There were seven Americans at the Benghazi mission in the hours leading up to the attacks: Stevens, a communications officer and five security agents -- two of whom had accompanied Stevens and three based at Benghazi. About 9:40 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2012, dozens of armed attackers entered the U.S. compound and set the main building on fire. Stevens and the communications specialist died of smoke inhalation. Early the next morning and about a mile away, mortar fire killed two CIA security contractors at a CIA annex, where Stevens’ body had been taken. First part of Johnson claim The first part of Johnson’s claim is that the State Department "failed to honor repeated requests for additional security." His reference is to requests made by Stevens and other U.S. officials in Libya to the State Department leadership in Washington. "There are disagreements about whether State acted reasonably, but that it didn't honor requests for additional security is established fact," said Georgetown University adjunct assistant professor Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which focuses on foreign policy and national security. The State Department has acknowledged it rejected requests to provide more security personnel in Libya. It also acknowledged rejecting a request to erect guard towers at the Benghazi mission, but notes that a number of physical security upgrades, such as the installation of concrete barriers to block unused gates, were made during 2012. The State Department’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks was inadequate "despite repeated requests" from the Benghazi mission and the embassy in Tripoli for additional staffing. The Benghazi facility had been projected to have five security agents and there had been multiple requests that five be placed there. But in the nine months before the attacks, the facility had a full complement of five agents on only 23 days. After the State Department's security staff in Washington rejected the repeated requests, the post became resigned to not having the full complement of five agents and stopped making the requests, the review board found. A bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee also found that the State Department headquarters did not grant Stevens' requests for more security personnel. Second part of Johnson claim The second part of Johnson’s claim is that before the attacks, the State Department "actually reduced security in Libya." The bipartisan Senate committee found that despite the deteriorating conditions around Benghazi, State Department headquarters decided not to request an extension of service by the Defense Department's Site Security Team, which was scheduled to be redeployed in August 2012, about one month before the attacks. The 16-member team was based in Tripoli, but spent some time in Benghazi and had provided security resources that the State Department could utilize. The State Department opted not to request an extension of the team, the Senate committee found, because it believed that many of the duties could be provided by State Department security staff and local Libyan security personnel. The Senate committee also pointed out that less than a month before the attacks, Stevens "declined two specific offers" from the general heading Defense Department operations in Africa to extend the stay of the Site Security Team. But according to Stevens’ top assistant, Gregory Hicks, that was a few weeks after the State Department had already decided not to request the team’s deployment to be extended. Because Washington "had refused to extend the special forces security mission, State Department protocol required" Stevens to decline the two offers, Hicks wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Our rating Johnson said that before the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, "the State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya." State Department headquarters in Washington did refuse repeated requests from its ambassador in Libya for more security personnel. And it decided not to accept an offer from the Defense Department to extend the stay of one of its security units in Libya, reducing the level of security that was available.

pomt-01572	"Fox admits they lie" and, under the First Amendment, "have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/10/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-fox-admits-they-lie-have-righ/	Critics of Fox News not-so-fondly call the cable channel "Faux News." But, according to an Internet meme, Fox not only admits it airs false news, it says it has a legal right to do so. "Fox News admits they lie," reads one version of the meme, "They argued that, under the First Amendment, broadcasters have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves." The meme, which quotes a 2003 report in the now-defunct Chicago Media Watch, has circulated around the blogosphere, and the legal case it refers to was featured in documentary on the history of corporations. A reader asked us to look into the claim that Fox News admits to lying and says that right is protected by the First Amendment. What we found is that the claims centers around a lawsuit involving a Florida Fox-owned affiliate, not the national network or cable news channel. And that's not all that is wrong with what the meme. Spilled milk The lawsuit the meme refers to involved two married reporters -- Jane Akre and Steve Wilson -- and their former employer, WTVT Channel 13, a Fox affiliate in Tampa, Fla. In 1996, the husband-and-wife team began reporting on the use of Posilac, a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle developed by Monsanto. After eight months of back and forth between the reporters and the station, the story never aired, and the reporters were fired in 1997. Akre and Wilson sued the station for breach of contract and retaliatory firing in 1998. Why the reporters lost their jobs is the heart of the case. According to Akre and Wilson, WTVT caved to pressure from Fox corporate and Monsanto, and fired the pair when Akre threatened to take what Akre described as the station’s deliberate news distortion to the Federal Communications Commission. According to WTVT, the reporters submitted a biased and inaccurate report and were terminated after they refused to make the necessary edits. In 2000, a Tampa jury ruled that WTVT did indeed retaliate against Akre and awarded her $425,000, the Tampa Bay Times (then the St. Petersburg Times) reported. WTVT then appealed the case. In 2003, the Florida Second District Court of Appeals reversed the ruling, arguing that Akre’s retaliation allegation did not hold water. Whistleblowing in the dark Akre’s allegation and the meme involve the intersection of three pieces of media policy: the FCC’s false news provision, the FCC’s whistleblower’s statute, and the First Amendment. According to Akre, WTVT deliberately distorted news by airing a revised version of the Posilac story. That, Akre says, is prohibited under the false news provision. When Akre threatened to notify the FCC, the station fired her and breached the whistleblower statute that prohibits retaliation against employees who disclose an employer’s "violation of law, rule, or regulation." The station denied repeatedly that it had tried to broadcast distorted news and said it wanted fair and balanced reports from Akre and Wilson. WTVT argued that the FCC’s news distortion policy is more a rule of thumb than a codified law, and thus not under the purview of the whistleblower statute. The appeals court agreed. Stuart Benjamin, a professor of telecommunications at Duke University, said he doesn’t see anything in the legal documents that suggests WTVT admitted to any lies or distortion. Rather, the station argued, and the court agreed, that Akre failed to meet her burden of proof, according to Benjamin. "If a statute prohibits me from hitting you only if I act with malice, and you say that I hit you but don’t establish malice, then I have a simple winning argument in court that you failed to show malice.That doesn’t mean I agree I hit you. It just means I have a winning argument that focuses on the absence of malice," he said. Freedom of the press Beyond what was in writing, Akre doesn’t remember WTVT admitting to lying and defending it as a legal right. "I don’t think they said it just like that, but they basically said we can do what we want," Akre told PunditFact. "They kept saying ‘we have First Amendment rights,’ meaning they can operate with impunity and have the constitutional right to do so." The First Amendment, as well as the Florida Constitution, "prohibits judicial review of Defendants’ news judgments and the exercise of editorial discretion, consistent with the guarantees of a free press," the station argued in its defense statement. What this means is that the court shouldn’t judge the editing choices of WTVT, the station’s lawyer Patricia Anderson told The Weekly Planet. Anderson invoked the First Amendment because it is dangerous for the courts and the FCC to become involved in disputes between members of the media and tread on either party’s freedom of press rights, according to Alison Steele, a media lawyer and Anderson's’ former law partner. (Steele currently represents the Tampa Bay Times, which operates PunditFact.) Deni Elliott, a professor of media ethics at the University of South Florida, said that by invoking the First Amendment, Fox is suggesting that they are not accountable to anyone -- "not a reasonable stand for a news organization to take." But to infer that WTVT used the First Amendment to defend news distortion and declare impunity is wrong. "That wasn’t ever their position," Steele said. "There was never a factual or logical nexus established between the alleged crippling of the First Amendment and the firing of these two individuals," said Thomas McGowan, a media lawyer who was part of WTVT’s defense team. Liane Casten, the reporter who wrote the the Chicago Media Watch article that originated the meme, said WTVT admitted to the false news allegations and defended it as a legal right during the trial, but could not recall the specifics. That position, however, is not corroborated by Akre. Steele, who worked with WTVT’s attorney, said it’s possible lawyers conceded the point as a hypothetical. But it was never central to their legal argument, nor an admission in the sense Casten or the meme suggests. "I can certainly imagine that in oral argument. The other side says, ‘If you did do this,’ and you respond, ‘If I did, it doesn’t matter.’ That’s just part of the refining and defining what the legal argument," she said. "This happens all the time, but it’s not an admission." The ruling The Internet meme claims, "Fox admits they lie" and, under the First Amendment, "have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves." The claim doesn't track back to the national cable network most people know. Instead, it's rooted in a wrongful termination lawsuit between a Tampa Fox affiliate and two reporters. The heart of the suit was whether the Fox affiliate wrongly fired the reporters over a story about a synthetic growth hormone in Florida dairy cattle. The reporters and the station disagreed about the accuracy of the story. As part of the lawsuit, lawyers for the station argued that the courts do not have the right to play referee on story decisions -- citing the First Amendment. We found no evidence that the Fox affiliate admitted that it lied about the news it ultimately presented, and we certainly found no evidence that Fox News as a whole admits it lies (in the present tense). While the Fox affiliate argued that it has the right to present the news as it chooses, it’s quite a leap to suggest Fox as a television corporation defended some right to "distort news reports" -- other than in a hypothetical sense to quash a wrongful termination suit. This meme wasn’t conjured out of thin air, but it’s not accurate. We rate it False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-09-10T11:53:48	2014-09-10	['None']
pomt-03689	"Demand for public transportation is reaching record levels in Wisconsin."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/22/billboard-spaghetti-junction/1000-friends-says-demand-public-transit-all-time-h/	The environmental group 1000 Friends of Wisconsin sees at least 10 reasons to change the way the state Department of Transportation spends money. The Madison-based group opposed the cut in state funds for public transit in Gov. Scott Walker’s first budget, which simultaneously boosted aid for highways. In the end, state lawmakers moderated Walker’s 10 percent cut by adding to the funding for transit for disabled riders. Now, with Walker’s second two-year budget awaiting action, 1000 Friends is pushing state lawmakers to restore the 2011-13 transit cuts. "We should allocate more funds for transit to respond to the increase in demand and ridership," the group said in an April 11, 2013 press release. "Transit ridership in America is at its highest in 50 years and demand for public transportation is reaching record levels in Wisconsin, yet transit systems in the state are in jeopardy of disappearing due to lack of state support." The group’s claim that "demand for public transportation is reaching record levels in Wisconsin" got our attention. Let’s take this one for a spin. Record ridership? When asked for backup, 1000 Friends pointed to a mix of ridership statistics and state and national demographic and lifestyle trends. Officials with the group reference a "substantial increase" in transit trips over the last decade in Wisconsin -- not including Milwaukee County -- based on the National Transit Database. That database covers fixed-route buses, van and taxi service for the disabled, trolleys, light rail and other forms of public transit in Wisconsin, excluding Amtrak passenger rail. The trend "shows that demand is going up," 1000 Friends executive director Steve Hiniker said. Maybe so. But up to "record levels"? We ran the numbers with help from the Federal Transit Administration’s National Transit Database and found a 37 percent jump in transit trips outside Milwaukee County from 2002 to 2012. In 2011, Madison reported its highest bus ridership since the late 1980s, La Crosse its highest in 30 years and Valley Transit in the Fox Cities its highest since 1995. And the group correctly cites U.S. figures showing that national transit ridership, including trains, has grown since the 1960s, driven mostly by strong interest in light rail and heavy rail. Bus ridership has remained mostly flat. The trends were reported in 2012 by the American Public Transportation Association using the national database. But two others sets of numbers provided by the group, and confirmed by PolitiFact Wisconsin, paint a much different picture. Once you include Milwaukee County -- the largest transit agency in the state by far -- the trend becomes a drop of 8 percent in rides comparing 2002 to 2012. Three of the last four years show decreases. The Milwaukee County Transit System’s bus service has steadily lost ridership -- nearly 30 percent by one estimate -- since 2002 as it has cut routes and eliminated stops due to funding shortages. Fares have increased 50 percent in 11 years. The Milwaukee County numbers are enough to put the statewide trend into the negative. The bottom line: Trips statewide totalled more than 71 million in 2012, down from about 77 million in 2002. That puts a dent in the group’s claim about "record levels" in Wisconsin. Transit cuts Hiniker argues that the statewide figures don’t tell the whole story on demand for transit in Wisconsin because funding cuts have led to higher fares and made transit less available, while other states have added service. Outside of Milwaukee, total transit ridership dipped in 2012 after the transit cuts in Walker’s first budget, according to figures from the national database. The city of Racine, for example, reported a double-digit drop in 2012 bus rides after raising fares 33 percent following the budget cut. A year earlier, ridership had jumped 10 percent. "Most of my clients are on a fixed income," said Al Stanek, Racine’s transit manager. "Our customers just end up riding less while spending the same amount of money on transportation." Demand can be up, or remain steady, even as ridership declines, Stanek and Hiniker said. Researchers cite funding levels -- and their impact on fares and convenience -- as among the many factors that influence ridership demand. So funding cuts can help explain why ridership is not higher. But that lack of supply is not evidence that demand is reaching "record levels." The group also argued that demand is a function of lifestyle and demographic trends at the state and national level, as well as U.S. ridership trends. Wisconsin’s over-60 population is growing, and that "has implications for ... expanded transit services for drivers who transition from cars to public transportation or paratransit services," the state’s Commission on Transportation Finance and Policy concluded in a January 2013 report. The same state report found that "young people are waiting longer to apply for driver licenses." That, along with national surveys showing more young people are turning to transit supports an inference that young Wisconsinites do too, Hiniker said. Hiniker conceded, though, that "sloppy" work explained why the group’s press release asserted that demand was at an all time high in Wisconsin. The intended statement, which is on the group’s website, said simply that demand was up nationwide, without mentioning Wisconsin, he said. Our rating 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, arguing for restoration of transit aid, claimed that "Demand for public transportation is reaching record levels in Wisconsin." The group can point to hot spots where ridership in 2011 reached heights unseen for many years, and makes a decent argument that transit cuts have suppressed demand. But its claim goes well beyond that, suggesting a quantifiable statewide trend at "record" levels -- and hard evidence of that is lacking. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00729	"We're not allowed to read it (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) before representatives vote on it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/23/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-says-congress-wont-see-pacific-trad/	President Barack Obama’s efforts to pursue a landmark trade agreement with countries on the Pacific Rim has split his own party. Obama is seeking to finalize an agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal has been in negotiation since 2009 between the United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Combined, these countries account for roughly 40 percent of the world’s economy. Trade deals often draw opposition from the left, due in part to concerns from labor unions -- a key Democratic-leaning constituency. For this reason, Obama’s push for the deal has forced Democratic officeholders and candidates to decide whether or not they will back the president’s agenda. Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who is a potential presidential candidate, took a strong stand against pursuing such a deal during an interview with NPR on April 20, 2015, saying the public wouldn’t get to read the agreement before it was approved. Here’s the excerpt that aired; a longer version with more back-and-forth is available as a transcript on the NPR website. Inskeep: "Let me ask about another issue on which Democrats seem to be divided. You have said in recent days that you oppose the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that would tie a dozen nations, including the United States, into free trade. What's wrong with that?" O’Malley: "Yeah, I do oppose it. What's wrong with it is first and foremost that we're not allowed to read it before representatives vote on it. What's wrong with it is that right now what we should be doing are things that make our economy stronger here at home. And that's my concern, that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this deal, is a race to the bottom, a chasing of lower wages abroad. And I believe that that does nothing to help us build a stronger economy here at home." A reader asked us to take a closer look at whether Americans won’t get to read the deal before Congress casts a vote on it. So we did. As we discussed this question with trade experts, we concluded that O’Malley’s problem was conflating two pieces of legislation -- Trade Promotion Authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Despite their similar acronyms (TPA and TPP), they are different, with different degrees of transparency. Trade Promotion Authority, sometimes informally known as "fast-track," is a method for putting trade agreements before Congress. If Congress passes Trade Promotion Authority legislation, it’s granting the president broad leeway to negotiate a trade agreement. Once the executive branch finalizes a deal with its foreign counterparts, Congress will have a separate up-or-down vote to ratify the agreement, in the process, changing U.S. law to fit the agreement’s provisions. This second bill must be considered under streamlined procedural rules and voted on without any amendments from lawmakers. The bill introduced in Congress on April 16, 2015, was for Trade Promotion Authority, giving Obama the right to strike a deal and laying out the process for voting on the agreement once the administration finalizes it. Since the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the only significant trade deal that’s likely to be sent to Congress anytime soon, these two bills are intertwined. But their distinctions are important -- including the degree of transparency before each vote, which is the part that O’Malley was referencing. At the time Congress votes on whether to grant Trade Promotion Authority to Obama, the details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership won’t be known yet. But if Trade Promotion Authority is passed, and if the Obama administration succeeds in striking a deal, then the provisions of the deal will emerge before lawmakers cast the second vote. So in a strict sense, what O’Malley said is wrong. When lawmakers vote on the actual Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the second vote -- they will indeed have the full details of what the deal entails. The confusion enters because when Congress casts the first vote -- the one currently on Congress’ agenda, to empower Obama to strike the deal -- they won’t yet know the details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That’s the way the process was designed to work. Congress votes first to authorize the negotiations, and then votes a second time -- weeks, months or even years later -- on whether to approve the agreement produced by the negotiations it authorized. "There is congressional input into the negotiations as they proceed, but the negotiations take place behind closed doors and are not made open to the public or all members of Congress," said Robert M. Stern, an emeritus professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. "There may be a democratic deficit, but if the details of the negotiations were publicly available, there would likely be endless discussion and debates about various parts of the negotiations." That sticks in the craw of critics, including O’Malley. Doing it this way puts lawmakers in an uncomfortable position -- they are being asked to approve a process that will produce a bill they won’t have the ability to amend when it comes up for a vote later. O’Malley "believes that Congress and the American people should be able to read the agreement before Congress votes on giving away their authority -- our authority -- to change it," his staff said in a statement to PolitiFact. "The deal will not be made public until after fast track is approved -- and then at that point, there can be no changes. That leaves the general public in the dark." O’Malley does have a point that transparency has been lacking so far. Negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership have been under way for years, even before passage of Trade Promotion Authority, but they’ve been conducted with extreme secrecy. In fact, much of what the public knows about them so far comes from draft documents obtained and publicized by Wikileaks. And under the Trade Promotion Authority bill now being considered in Congress, "detailed and timely information" will be shared with lawmakers and staff with "proper security clearances as appropriate." Even before passage of Trade Promotion Authority, the Obama administration said, lawmakers and staff with security clearances have access to negotiating texts and summaries and has held hundreds of briefings. Some House Democrats say that isn’t enough enough openness. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., told The Hill that the administration is being "needlessly secretive. … Even now, when they are finally beginning to share details of the proposed deal with members of Congress, they are denying us the ability to consult with our staff or discuss details of the agreement with experts." Our ruling O’Malley said that "we're not allowed to read it (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) before representatives vote on it." Strictly speaking, he’s wrong -- Congress, and the American public, will be fully informed of what’s in the Trans-Pacific Partnership before lawmakers vote to make the agreement part of United States law. But he has a point that lawmakers won’t know what’s in the Trans-Pacific Partnership before they cast a separate, precursor vote -- the vote to authorize Obama to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership on a fast-track basis in the first place. In a meandering radio conversation, O’Malley made a reasonable point that transparency about the deal has been lacking, but in doing so, he conflated two separate congressional votes. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False. UPDATE, Apr. 25, 2015: This version adds additional information from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative regarding the transparency policies afforded members of Congress prior to the passage of Trade Promotion Authority.

pomt-05222	Florida election officials’ requests to some residents to submit proof of citizenship is a "backdoor poll tax."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jun/07/alcee-hastings/us-rep-hastings-says-floridas-noncitizen-voter-pur/	Florida set off yet another firestorm about voting rights in May when state elections officials forwarded a list to counties of about 2,700 potential noncitizens who illegally registered to vote. The state told county election supervisors to contact the residents and ask them to supply proof of citizenship. If the voters failed to comply, they’d be removed from the voter rolls within one or two months. A partisan war broke out: Democrats cried foul that this was directed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott and just happening months before a presidential election. Republican leaders pointed out that it’s a felony for noncitizens to vote. A Miami Herald analysis determined that there were more Democrats than Republicans on the list and that about 58 percent were Hispanic. The U.S. Department of Justice ordered the state to halt its noncitizen purge on May 31. A DOJ lawyer argued that Florida was violating federal law including the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Gov. Rick Scott is fighting the DOJ’s demand. A few days before the feds intervened, two Democratic congressmen from South Florida -- Alcee Hastings and Ted Deutch -- held a press conference with a voter flagged by the state: Bill Internicola, a Brooklyn-born World War II vet, who had voted for decades and is a Democratic voter in Davie, a town in Broward County. Before the press conference officially started, Hastings asked Internicola if the Broward Supervisor of Elections had mailed him a stamped envelope to send back his proof of citizenship. The answer: no. That led Hastings to say this during the press conference: "There is also a backdoor poll tax. In the letter that he (Internicola) received I asked him a moment ago he did not have a prepaid envelope to send it back meaning he had to buy a stamp. Don’t tell me how little it is -- that stamp is a cost. And the state should not be about the business of emaciating voter rights. They should be in the business of causing people to participate." Was Hastings correct to compare the requests from elections officials to Internicola and others on the list to a "backdoor poll tax"? The process for documentation for those on the list The Florida Division of Elections started with a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizen voters based on drivers’ license data, which is not updated when someone later becomes a citizen. The state sent an initial batch of about 2,700 names to counties. From there, county election supervisors mailed out letters asking the potential noncitizens to send back documentation proving U.S. citizenship (a copy of a birth certificate or passport, for example). Miami-Dade, the county with the highest number of voters on the list, did not provide an envelope while neighboring Broward County provided an envelope but no stamp. Florida division of elections spokesman Chris Cate said the voters could respond to their county supervisor in a number of ways including in person, mail, email or fax. "We have an obligation to ensure the integrity of Florida’s elections, and making sure the voter rolls are accurate is a crucial part of upholding the integrity of our elections," Cate said. Some voters with access to a fax and a copy machine could have completed the process for free (or for the cost of the paper). For those who had to buy a 45-cent stamp and make copies or deliver it in person requiring gas and parking, we figure the cost for some could be less than $1 or up to $3. History of the poll tax We interviewed 14 professors about the poll tax and Hastings’ claim. We also read this article by California Institute of Technology Professor Morgan Kousser and portions of a book about the history of voting rights by Harvard history professor Alex Keyssar. We also consulted our False ruling of U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s (D-Weston) claim that compared GOP-backed voting bills to Jim Crow. Poll taxes referring to a tax on each male head had been around in various forms for many years, but after Reconstruction it was taken to mean a tax required to vote. Florida adopted one in 1889. Southern states passed these poll taxes to raise revenue for state governments and to prevent poor blacks and poor whites from voting. Some experts described it as a concerted effort to halt blacks from voting while others said it was more a matter of class power. "It wasn’t so much a matter of racial discrimination -- it was a matter of class power," Keyssar said in an interview. "Black people were tenants and workers." Some states required poll taxes to be paid several months before an election and required voters to bring a receipt to vote -- further barriers to voting. The poll tax was effective because at $1 to $2, that was a significant amount of a person’s cash income. The effect on turnout was significant. During the presidential races in the 1880s, black turnout in Georgia, which had the poll tax, was less than half of that in Florida, Kousser said. It’s somewhat difficult to pinpoint the number disenfranchised by the poll tax or other voting restrictions. But Kousser said the poll tax disenfranchised millions in the South. "It was more than any other single device responsible for fastening white supremacy on the South for 70 years or so," Kousser said. Southern states starting repealing the poll tax in the 1930s including Florida. The 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1964 barred poll taxes in national elections and two years later the Supreme Court in Harper vs. Virginia barred them in state elections under the Equal Protection Clause. How is it the same or different than poll tax We asked experts on the poll tax and elections if they agreed with Hastings analogy and found no consensus. Some experts agreed with Hastings at least in part -- one professor said he’d start to use the same comparison. "If voters, as a practical matter, are required to spend money out of their own pocket -- even a relatively small amount -- in order to prove their eligibility and therefore vote, then it's functionally equivalent to the poll tax," wrote Daniel Tokaji, election law professor at Ohio State University. But other experts saw key differences in the poll tax and Florida’s recent potential noncitizen voter purge. One expert cautioned us that this is a partisan issue and that it might be difficult for PolitiFact to reach a factual conclusion. "To most Democrats, what Hastings says is self-evidently true: Yes, it’s a back-door poll tax. They are trying to make it harder for poor people to vote," wrote Michael Klarman, a Harvard law professor who identified himself as a Democrat in an email. "Most Republicans would deny this, and I think they truly believe what they are saying: They are trying to eliminate or reduce vote fraud. Most Democrats don’t acknowledge that such fraud exists." Here are the arguments for how the noncitizen voter documentation effort and the poll tax are the same: • Both disproportionately affected minorities: The poll tax reduced the number of blacks who could vote. Florida’s potential noncitizen voter list was 58 percent Hispanic, 14 percent black and 13 percent white. "Thus, Rep. Hastings' term, ‘a backdoor poll tax,’ is accurate as it applies to blacks as a group, because still today blacks have a lower median income than whites. Granted, it is not as onerous monetarily as the tax was back in the sixties, but it is still a tax that imposes a heavier burden, proportionally, on blacks than whites," said Chandler Davidson, a sociology professor at Rice University. • Requiring extra steps for voters is a burden: Voters often had to show their receipt to vote under the poll tax which is analogous to the potential noncitizens having to present documents at elections’ offices in advance of voting. • Both require at least some voters to pay to vote: In the case of the poll tax, it applied to all men but in reality was a burden for poor blacks and whites. Florida’s recent noncitizen voter purge required some residents to provide proof of citizenship which meant a cost for many to mail in documentation, make copies or drive and possibly pay to park at an elections office. Note this category also includes a difference: The poll tax applied to all while the recent purge applied to few. Now, how it is different. • The cost for voters: The poll tax of between $1-$2 was a significant sum for blacks and poor whites at the time. The cost of a stamp and making a copy of a birth certificate today is less than the cost of the poll tax instituted more than 100 years ago. "Now, when Mr. Hastings says potential voters might be disfranchised by having to buy a stamp, I say, ‘Give me a break!’ That is absurd," wrote East George College history professor T. Adams Upchurch. "To put it in perspective, my home state of Mississippi levied its poll tax in 1890 at $2. That was tantamount to Florida voters today having to pay about $200 for the privilege of voting. Poor people could absolutely and rightly claim discrimination if that were the case. But a stamp? Please." • Numbers: The poll tax disenfranchised the majority of black residents as well as poor whites -- one professor said it disenfranchised about two-fifths of voters. The noncitizen voter drive affected a very small percentage of Florida’s electorate -- even if the state had continued to send names from the list of 180,000 that would be less than 2 percent of the overall nearly 11.3 million voters in Florida. • Right to vote: Poor blacks and whites should have had a right to vote. In the current Florida case, noncitizens don’t have the right to vote -- it’s a felony. We haven’t heard anyone argue that noncitizens should get to cast a ballot -- the controversy is that there were errors on the list -- many were citizens. And some critics say that some voters simply didn’t get the letter or would be discouraged from responding. Since the many of those who received the letters didn’t respond to elections officials and the state was working with outdated information, it’s unclear if the majority on the list are citizens or not. • Every expense associated with voting isn’t a poll tax: Many voters drive to the polls to vote -- the cost of gas isn’t a poll tax. In the noncitizen case, a stamp isn’t the only way to deliver the form -- someone might get a ride from a friend and drop it off. We sent Hastings’ office our list of similarities and differences and asked if they wanted to respond and did not hear back. Our ruling After Broward residents received letters asking them to submit documentation proving their citizenship in order to vote, Hastings described it as a "backdoor poll tax" because they had to buy a stamp to mail in the documents. Hastings is correct that there are some similarities between the poll tax and Florida’s recent search for noncitizen voters. The most important similarity is that minorities in both cases were disproportionately affected. And in both cases, it added costs and burdens to vote. "Any effort to introduce an election procedure that requires some voters to incur financial costs could be thought of as a metaphoric or perhaps real poll tax," Keyssar said. But there are some important differences including that the poll tax had a far more widespread effect than Florida’s search for noncitizen voters. While poor black sharecroppers couldn’t afford the poll tax, the issue for some of the Florida voters may be more of the inconvenience than the expense. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06217	Sen. Sherrod Brown "has chosen to side with Washington bureaucrats and fringe extremists in the attacks on our natural resources."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/dec/07/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-has-sided-washingto/	Note to Athens, Ohio, residents: Your mayor and other elected officials in your part of Ohio are fringe extremists. You may disagree with that statement, but then, you probably support the Washington bureaucrats who halted leasing in the Wayne National Forest for fracking. What’s that? It wasn’t a Washington bureaucrat who made that decision but, rather, a forester in Ohio? Well, as Emily Litella used to say on Saturday Night Live: Never mind. With apologies to the late Gilda Radner, these claims about fringe elements and Washington bureaucrats owe themselves to Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer. Mandel, a Republican now running for U.S. Senate, criticized incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, after Brown told Ohio Public Radio on Nov. 28 that he supports a local decision to remove 3,302 acres of national forest in southeast Ohio from a federal auction of land for oil and gas exploration. The land is in a part of the state where hydraulic fracking could yield big dividends, although there are a lot of uncertainties. Fracking is shorthand for fracturing, and it involves drilling deep into the ground and injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to fracture the shale and release the natural gas or oil trapped there. Geologists and energy industry officials say a potential windfall of gas lies in the Utica shale formation, and to a lesser extent the Marcellus shale, beneath eastern Ohio. Fracking has its critics, including those who say the chemicals used in the process might contaminate groundwater. A number of experts, including the geologists at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, say fracking is safe and that human error, the real cause of problems, can be avoided with proper state regulation. We mention that because Anne Carey, supervisor of the Wayne National Forest, was concerned about fracking’s impact on the Wayne National Forest. She recommended that the forest be removed from the Dec. 7 federal auction until there could be further review. That could take up to six months, and will deal with fracking’s effect on forest land, not groundwater. A Wayne National Forest already allows for other drilling -- and there are 1,300 shallow wells there -- but fracking could require removing far more trees, according to The Columbus Dispatch. In an interview, Brown said he supported Carey’s decision, noting that numerous local officials had concerns about fracking in the area. Mandel then criticized Brown. In a Dec. 2, 2011, column Mandel wrote in The Wall Street Journal, the treasurer said: "Adding to the public outrage here is the position taken by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who this week announced his support of the federal government's job-killing decision. Even though the vilification of Ohio's abundant coal, oil and gas disproportionately hurts jobs and energy prices here, Mr. Brown has chosen to side with Washington bureaucrats and fringe extremists in the attacks on our natural resources." PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at the last part of his claim; that Brown has chosen to side with bureaucrats and fringe extremists. We started with the part about "Washington bureaucrats." Carey, who made the recommendation, told The Athens News that her entire career with the Forest Service "has been at the local level." Jane Cliff, the media officer for the U.S. Forest Service’s eastern region, headquartered in Milwaukee, told us that Chuck Myers, the region’s forester, accepted it and the Wayne National Forest was removed from the auction. Myers also is based in Milwaukee. As for the "fringe extremists," among the people who wanted to apply the brakes in the Wayne National Forest were Roderick McDavis, president of Ohio University; the Athens County commissioners, and Athens Mayor Paul Wiehl. Wiehl won re-election recently in what could be called a landslide, getting 71 percent of the vote, according to The Athens News. Granted, Athens is a university town with a lot of Democrats, and Wiehl wants to keep fracking out of the city. But so did his Republican opponent, according to news coverage. Wiehl told PolitiFact Ohio his concern is that there is a gold rush-like frenzy to frack because of the potential for prosperity, without what he considers to be enough caution. An accident in the forest near the Hocking River basin could affect Athens’ drinking water. "I don’t consider myself to be fringe-like," he said. "I consider myself to be cautious or a little bit conservative as to how this is done." There has been a lot of debate about this issue in southeast Ohio. Mandel has tapped into that, with his spokesman calling this "a defining issue over the next year" and Mandel saying that the fracking boom represents a way out of economic stagnation. But does the removal of acreage in Wayne National Forest represent a real setback to this boom? We asked Tom Stewart, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, how much land in the scheme of Ohio fracking this represents. "The bulk of eastern Ohio is leased," he said. "I don’t know what that acreage would be. It would be a huge number." In other words, fracking is going on in so many other places that the Wayne acreage represents a mere blip. The Plain Dealer and other newspapers have reported that one company alone, Oklahoma-based Chesapeake Energy, has leased 1.5 million acres in Ohio so it can drill 12,000 wells. And The Plain Dealer reported in October that gas and oil-rich shale may lie under 5 million acres of rural Ohio landscape. That compares with 3,302 acres that the Wayne has taken off the table for now. So let’s recap: Josh Mandel is all for fracking if it follows safe, acceptable practices. He sees it as a potentially huge economic win for Ohio. Sherrod Brown says he, too, is for fracking, but he says he understands the concerns of the Wayne National Forest supervisor, the mayor of Athens, the county commissioners and the university president, and he supports the decision for a delay to allow further study. It would be easy to just say that Brown’s support for fracking comes with more qualifications, or that he deferred to the local officials. It would be true. But it would lack outrage, and outrage, apparently, is what Mandel was going for. He said that Brown sided with "fringe extremists," when these individuals happen to be a mayor, county commissioners and a state university president. And Mandel said Brown sided with "Washington bureaucrats," when the woman making the call was in Ohio. Her boss who signed off was in Wisconsin. Political criticism is fair game. But it’s a stretch to equate a national forest supervisor in Southeast Ohio and her boss in Wisconsin as Washington bureaucrats. And when rhetoric gets ridiculous -- when a public official running for office implies that an Ohio mayor, county commissioners, a major university president and a federal forest supervisor are fringe extremists -- PolitiFact Ohio has one rating for it: Pants on Fire!

pomt-07644	"Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-last-year-was-/	In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump. "We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas," he said. "Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesn’t match up with reality," In this item, we’ll check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasn’t "shut down" oil production -- that "last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003." We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said "oil production," we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products. Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003: 2003: 2,073,453,000 2004: 1,983,302,000 2005: 1,890,106,000 2006: 1,862,259,000 2007: 1,848,450,000 2008: 1,811,817,000 2009: 1,956,596,000 2010: 2,011,856,000 So, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But we’ll note a couple of caveats. First, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic. The second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years. Domestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling. So Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but we’re taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-03-15T11:42:48	2011-03-11	['United_States']
pomt-04012	Says out-of-state abortion clinics "have marketed their services to minors" in states with parental consent laws.	true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/06/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-abortion-clinics-market-their/	Ohio and most other states require a parent’s consent or notification before they will allow a minor to have an abortion. Minors can get around this if they get a court order, or what’s known as "judicial bypass." But minors have another option -- one that abortion opponents consider dastardly but that abortion rights activists defend as necessary sometimes. The minor can go to an abortion provider in one of 12 states that have no parental-involvement laws. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, wants to make it harder for non-parental adults to help minors bypass these state laws. Some of these adults do not have a girl’s best interest at heart when they transport her, say supporters of this effort, including Ohio Right to Life. So on Jan. 24, Portman announced the latest version of a bill long sought by abortion opponents. He would make it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion if it would circumvent a state law requiring parental involvement. In announcing his bill, Portman released a statement that caught the interest of PolitiFact Ohio: "Ohio law requires the consent of one parent in order for a minor to get an abortion. Large, nearby states such as New York and Illinois, however, do not have such restrictions, and providers in those states have marketed their services to minors in states with parental consent requirements." Not that we eagerly stepped into this one, opinions being heated on both sides. But we wondered how this marketing worked, so we asked. Were abortion providers in less-restrictive states actually advertising across state lines to let minors know they could come over without telling their moms or dads? Portman’s press secretary, Caitlin Dunn, answered the question by showing us an array of ads from the Internet and Yellow Pages. Some of what she sent us dated to a 2005 U.S. House of Representatives report on minors and abortions. But Dunn and others in her office also showed us more recent marketing efforts. For example, she showed us the results of Internet searches on Yahoo and Google, using "abortion" as the keyword. She said the searches were conducted in Erie and other Pennsylvania cities by members of an anti-abortion group there. Pennsylvania has a parental-consent law. We, too, got such sponsored, or paid, search results -- clearly marked as ads -- when we used Yahoo and Google to do web searches with the keywords "abortion" and "Erie," and for searches using the names of other Pennsylvania cities as well. One of the sponsored search results for the terms "Erie PA" and "abortion" was an ad that said: "South Jersey Board Certified (OBGYN) providing abortions in Cherry Hill, New Jersey." Another ad said, "Private, safe abortions." The ads said nothing about minors or parental consent. But the headlines had links that took us to www.sjwc.net. By clicking, we were transported to the website of the South Jersey Women’s Center, in Cherry Hill, a suburb of Philadelphia. Though not in Pennsylvania, the New Jersey clinic is about as close as a Pennsylvanian can get. But it is also 429.6 miles from Erie, or a 6-hour and 44-minute drive, according to Google. Why would a clinic so far from Erie advertise for clients more than 400 miles away? Portman’s office suggested this is why: Near the top of the center’s website are the words, "No 24-hour wait or parental consent required in New Jersey." The no-consent clinic, in other words, was marketing to minors in parental-consent states, according to the Portman view. We called the South Jersey Women’s Center to ask about its ads and website. A woman who answered said she was not authorized to talk to the media. But she referred us to the National Abortion Federation, an association in Washington, D.C. that says it strives to ensure women have access to safe, legal abortion care. So we called the federation and spoke with Vicki Saporta, the president and CEO. Saporta said that just because the abortion clinic’s website says that "parental consent is not required in New Jersey," that does not necessarily make it a marketing message. "It’s just stating what the law is," she said, adding that it would be reasonable for any center to inform patients or potential patients about its services and its providers’ medical credentials, as this site does. "I think it’s important that women know what the laws are that govern any particular state if they are considering an abortion in that state," Saporta said. The South Jersey center was not the only abortion provider believed by Portman’s office to be marketing to minors. Dunn showed us other ads, from the Internet as well as from Yellow Pages across Pennsylvania. An ad showing up in phone books in Scranton was for the clinic of Amy R. Cousins, M.D., in the Binghamton, N.Y. area. We found her clinic, too, in a paid Google ad when we searched under "Scranton Pennsylvania abortion." Cousins’ Yellow Pages ad states, "No state consents." An ad from 2010 said, "No consent or waiting period." Her website says her center "offers one-visit abortion services with no waiting period or parental consent to women living in Pennsylvania including Scranton, PA, Wilkes-Barre, PA and surrounding counties." We called Cousins’ clinic and spoke with Peg Johnston, the manager. Johnston has been active in national abortion-care networks and authored a guide promoting parental involvement. "We advertise our services and all we have to offer," she said. This information, she said, helps patients or would-be patients know what services and procedures are available. "We are completely within our rights to advertise whatever services we offer. It’s not like we’re luring" minors over the state line. About that state line, she said, "We are 10 miles from the Pennsylvania border," and the closest abortion center for many women around Scranton. "A lot of people come to New York for their health care because we’re closer" than facilities in their home states, she said. Portman’s office showed us other ads, from New York, New Jersey and Illinois, that stated "no parental consent" required. Some of the ads were nearly a decade old, others more recent. Based on this and our own Web searches, it appeared that Portman was correct in at least one regard -- that some abortion clinics in states that don’t have parental-consent laws were informing minors in other states of their parental-consent options. But before we could rule on his claim that they have "marketed their services to minors," we had another question to answer: What, exactly, is marketing? Is running a small web ad that says nothing about parental consent marketing? What if that web ad takes you to the provider’s website, where the "no parental consent" feature is included? Is it marketing if the web ad appears in a Google or Yahoo search for "abortion" and "Erie," but not a search for cities in other states? In answering, it is helpful to understand how web ads work. They are not placed blindly or randomly. Companies and services pay to have their Web addresses come up when users type in -- or their computers or Web-browsing habits help detect -- specific parameters, including a location. This is called geo-targeting. Here is how Yahoo’s advertising department explains: "Whether your online customers live in Little Rock, Arkansas, or near the Great Wall of China, having the ability to pinpoint where in the world your audience is can help drive results for your business. Yahoo!’s geographic targeting delivers your audiences at scale and drives measurable results." Even a small sponsored ad that shows a headline, a web address and little other information can be considered "part of a larger marketing and communications plan," said Shelly Morton, a project manager and team leader for Hitchcock Fleming & Associates, an Akron marketing firm, if it takes you to a website with the full information the sponsor wanted you to have. The point of the ad is to have you click on it and get to that fuller information. We interviewed Morton to get an independent voice on Internet marketing, not to discuss abortion rights. PolitiFact Ohio cannot tell you why a minor might use certain terms in a web search. But we know most ads when we see them, and we generally understand how and why geo-tracking works. More important for assessing Portman’s claim, his office did not limit itself to Web searches or Web ads. It provided print ads, too. As Cousins’ clinic in New York told Yellow Page users in Pennsylvania, "No state consents." This is information the clinics wanted patients or potential patients to have, and paid money to help them have it. Whether it was to help persuade them to come in or not, it provided pertinent facts that could help them in their decision-making. It fit the definition of marketing. We rate Portman’s claim True.

pomt-03043	"Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!"	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/07/tweets/did-obama-shut-down-ocean-part-shutdown/	As we were drowning in claims about the federal government shutdown, this one popped up on our shores Monday morning: Obama has closed down the ocean as part of the shutdown. This brought to mind an image of federal agents tossing frolicking children out of the sea and soldiers marching on the beaches, barricading the bikini-clad set from taking a dip. We found numerous ocean shutdown claims on Twitter: "Obama shuts down Atlantic ocean! Who knew the fed’s owned the ocean?" and "Obama and Dems can’t even close borders but are trying to close the ocean!" and "if Obama can shut down the ocean why didn’t he shut down the hurricanes and floods?" We fished out this one to fact-check: "It is official. Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!" We dove in to search for answers. Has Obama shut down the ocean as part of the federal government shutdown? The key to the answer was close to home for PolitiFact Florida: the Florida Keys. The Florida Bay Many of the ocean shutdown tweets linked to an Oct. 5 article on the conservative website Breitbart, which included this headline: "Feds try to close the ocean because of shutdown." It featured a photo of President Barack Obama swimming through ocean waves. The article explained that the closure related to the Florida Bay and linked to a Miami Herald article. The Herald pulled information from the Florida Keys Keynoter, which stated that boat charter guides received a message from the National Park Service banning them from taking customers to fish in Florida Bay, which is within the boundaries of the Everglades National Park. More than 1,100 square miles of prime fishing, between the southern tip of the mainland and the Keys, would be off limits until further notice, according to Dan Kimball, superintendent of Everglades and Dry Tortugas national parks. We tracked down the message that commercial use permit holders for Everglades National park received: "Effective at 6 p.m. on Oct. 1, 2013, both Everglades and Dry Tortugas National Parks will be closed. While our law enforcement rangers will remain on duty, all other administrative activities and visitor services will be discontinued until the shutdown has been lifted. If you have a trip planned for Oct. 1, you must conclude your business within the park by 6 p.m. After today, you may not offer any services within the park's boundaries until further notice. We regret the burden that this will place on your livelihood. We will notify you when the park is reopened." Kimball confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that the Florida Bay, which encompasses about a half-million acres, is closed due to the shutdown. However, there are exceptions, including transit through the park. "You can’t anchor, you can’t fish," Kimball said. "It has to be for transportation purposes." Also, the feds will allow access in emergencies, such as seeking shelter from a storm, and they granted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission access to monitor algae blooms. "Just like the Grand Canyon is closed during shutdown -- it's federal property -- so is the Florida Bay under the Everglades National Park," said Jennifer George-Nichol, who works for U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, who represents the Keys. The national park closure does not mean that the entire ocean -- whether in the Keys, the rest of Florida or elsewhere -- is shut down. There are still spots in the Keys where tourists can go fishing or jump in for a swim. For example, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which offers glass bottom boat rides and snorkel excursions, isn’t limited by the federal shutdown. "At this time, nothing in the state park is affected," said Nathan Frier, assistant manager for Coral Reef Park Company, a concessionaire inside the park. "We do have a lot of calls to see if we are open or not." At Barefoot Billy’s in Key West, boat trips to the Dry Tortugas are canceled but other ocean activities including parasailing, boating and jet skiing remain open. "We have numerous local and state parks and beaches, none of which are impacted," said Lisa Tennyson, director of legislative affairs for Monroe County. Enforcing the shutdown in Florida Bay We wondered how seriously the shutdown in Florida Bay will be enforced. Breitbart speculated that the government "will probably use more personnel and spend more resources to attempt to close the ocean, than it would in its normal course of business." The National Parks Service contingency plan states activities at parks and facilities will be suspended "except for those that are essential to respond to emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property." The majority of employees at Biscayne National Park and Everglades National Park and Dry Tortugas have been furloughed. Rangers have been notifying people that the park is closed and asked them to leave and generally have had good compliance, Kimball said. When we interviewed Kimball mid-afternoon Oct. 7, no one had been issued a written warning or violation. Our ruling Claims about the federal government shutdown include this one circulating on Twitter: "Obama has jumped the shark and ordered the ocean closed!" The tweet linked to an article in Breitbart that explains that the shutdown means that the Dry Tortugas and the Florida Bay are closed as a result of the shutdown. That means that 1,100 square miles of prime fishing is off limits -- a blow to fishing charter companies and others that benefit from that access. Biscayne National Park is also off limits. But it’s an exaggeration to state that Obama has tried to shut down the entire ocean -- or even to suggest that he has shuttered the Atlantic Ocean or all of the waters in the Keys. Tourists and locals can continue to fish, swim and play in the ocean, even in the Keys. We throw a big ol’ bucket of ocean water from the Keys on this claim and rate this claim False.

pomt-10156	"Palin (proposed) a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/01/defenders-wildlife-action-fund-defenders-wildlife-/palin-endorsed-wolf-bounty/	In a jarring television advertisement, the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund attempts to show a less friendly side of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin by noting how the Alaska governor championed an intensive predator management program. "The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife," the narrator says. "Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier," the narrator says. "Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?" For this item, we'll focus on this part of the ad: “And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf.” “The cruelty” in question was a state-sanctioned hunt intended to thin out the wolf population. Indeed, Palin’s administration announced the $150 bounty for the “left forelegs of wolves” as part of a larger effort to reduce wolf populations in five areas of the state, according to a press release from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game dated March 21, 2007. The payments are made to volunteer pilots and shooters who are permitted to track and kill predators in the winter months. State biologists planned to use the forelegs as specimens to study the wolf population. Department spokesman Tim Barry said the idea came from state biologists and Palin’s office played a key role in developing the cash incentive program. Proposals of this nature ultimately are approved by the state’s Board of Game, which is appointed by the governor’s office. The release contends the payment isn’t a “bounty,” but that’s a matter of semantics. An Alaskan judge who later declared the payments illegal called it a “bounty, pure and simple” in his ruling. In fact, the Defenders of Wildlife Action, which made this ad, was among the conservation groups that took Alaska to court over the incentive program. What’s missing from the campaign ad is the context about wildlife management in Alaska, and the history of the program. Unlike other areas where wolves are protected, Alaska officials estimate the state’s vast wilderness holds 7,000 to 11,000 wolves. These elusive predators hunt moose and caribou, which are favorite targets for hunters seeking food and sport in Alaska. In 2003, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski initiated the program to manage the wolf population. In 2007, the state wanted to kill between 382 and 664 wolves, but the nearly 200 permitted hunters had shot only about 100 wolves as the hunting season neared its April 30 end. High fuel prices and limited snowfall made it hard to track the animals, so Palin’s administration offered the $150 per wolf as an extra incentive “to motivate permittees to redouble their efforts and to help offset the high cost of aviation fuel,” the release states. The organization behind the ad, along with other environmental groups, filed a lawsuit to stop the payments because wildlife bounties were outlawed in 1984. About 40 wolves were killed after the bounty was offered, but the payments were never made to hunters. The judge struck down the incentive program 10 days after it was announced, Barry said. The advertisement is intended to shock viewers by presenting Palin without the context of political life in frontier Alaska, where wildlife management is a high-profile government function. But the facts are right and the missing context has more to do with sensibilities than factual accuracy. We rate the attack True.

pomt-06324	In April 2009 "the Democrats were in control, and the congressional (approval) rating was 40 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/11/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-tells-jon-stewart-congressional-appro/	During an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., discussed the public’s dismal view of Congress. Stewart began the interview by joking that the public’s approval of Congress ranks "slightly below, from what I understand, hepatitis C." Pelosi responded by joking, "And you wonder who are these people who approve of Congress, these 9 percent!" She proceeded to draw a contrast between the current Republican-controlled House and the Democratic House she presided over as speaker from January 2007 to January 2011. "The last time I was here in April of 2009 ... the Democrats were in control and the congressional (approval) rating was 40 percent. Do you remember that?" We actually didn’t, and when a reader asked us to fact-check it, we did. (She repeated the claim later in the interview.) We looked in the polling archive of RealClearPolitics.com and found four relevant polls during the month of April 2009. The approval ratings raged from a low of 26 percent approval to a high of 38 percent approval, for an average of just under 32 percent. So neither the average for April nor any individual poll within that month reached 40 percent, making Pelosi’s statement incorrect. (Still, 38 percent is close.) She’s on somewhat firmer ground if you expand the parameters. If you look at the months of March, April and May 2009, you’ll find two polls with 41 percent support. Still, all the other polls during that period were lower, and the average for the 13 polls is 35 percent -- still short of the 40 percent mark that Pelosi cited. This compares to the most recent three polls asking this question, which showed congressional approval below 13 percent. We should add that if Pelosi wants to tout the public’s approval of Democratic stewardship of Congress, the period she chose was clearly the high point of her tenure. Things went downhill from there. Within six months, approval ratings plunged to the mid-to-low 20s. Within about a year, approval ratings were often sinking into the teens. Our ruling Strictly speaking, Pelosi’s incorrect: Congressional approval didn’t hit 40 percent during the month of April 2009. Polls taken that month averaged just under 32 percent. But the rating did exceed that benchmark twice within the 13 polls taken in March, April and May 2009. On balance, we rate her statement Half True.

pomt-12539	"We’ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/19/donald-trump/manufacturing-heavy-wisconsin-donald-trump-links-c/	On his first visit to Wisconsin since taking office, President Donald Trump came to Kenosha, a city once synonymous with manufacturing, to sign an executive order as part of his "Buy American, Hire American" agenda. It’s aimed at boosting jobs in the United States. Speaking April 18, 2017 at Snap-on Inc., a tool manufacturer, Trump made a claim about China. He implied it had a hand in the loss of American jobs, saying: For too long, we’ve watched as our factories have been closed and our jobs have been sent to other faraway lands. We’ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization. And you’ve seen that, you’ve heard about it -- 70,000. The World Trade Organization -- another one of our disasters. Congress cleared the path for China’s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, which deals with the rules of trade between nations and works for open trade. The entry spurred investment in China and produced a lot more movement of goods -- leading to broad agreement that the change cost America millions of jobs. But how many factories? And were there other factors? Previous claim Trump’s claim is nearly the same one he made a month earlier at a rally in Kentucky, when he said: "Since China joined — that’s another beauty — the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories." PolitiFact National’s rating was Mostly True. Here’s what our colleagues found: The latest-available U.S. Census counts, for 2014, show the number of American factory establishments has dropped to below 300,000. The decrease since China joined the World Trade Organization was nearly 61,000, according to one Census tally, and more than 73,000 according to another. Some of that decline is due to China’s becoming a bigger player in the world economy by joining the WTO, as our colleagues reported: Around the same time China joined the WTO, the United States gave China permanent normal trade relations status. Both of these actions removed significant barriers to trade and investment with China, basically putting them on an even playing field with the United States’ other trading partners. In the 16 years since, United States imports from China have quadrupled, in large part because production is so cheap there, making U.S.-based manufacturers less competitive. We found three significant economic studies from the past few years that all conclude increased free trade with China has had a negative impact on American manufacturing and jobs. At the same time, experts said the loss of factories was also brought on by other factors, including U.S. trade deficits with other parts of Asia and Europe; a slow recovery after the Great Recession; and increased manufacturing productivity in the United States. The Trump-O-Meter, which tracks Trump’s campaign promises, shows Trump has pledged to reverse China’s entry into the WTO. For its part, China maintains that its entry has led to global economic growth. Our rating Trump said: "We’ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization." The latest U.S. Census figures, for 2014, produced two counts: 73,000, which supports Trump’s claim, and 61,000. And at least some of the losses can be attributed to increased trade with China. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Scott Walker could perhaps be excused for over-exuberance when it comes to Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwan-based company that describes itself as the world's largest electronics manufacturing services provider. Indeed, the typically composed Republican governor seemed almost giddy when he joined President Donald Trump, Foxconn founder Terry Gou and other officials at the White House on July 26, 2017. The occasion: Foxconn was announcing that, after considering a number of states, it had decided to build a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing plant in southeast Wisconsin. Not just any plant, but a $10 billion facility that is envisioned as becoming part of a high-tech "ecosystem." So, in all the excitement, did Walker go too far in stating how many jobs are coming? In a tweet the same day, he declared: Foxconn is bringing 13,000 high-tech jobs to Wisconsin -- the biggest jobs announcement in our state’s history! Leaving aside the term high-tech, we wondered about the figure. We found that the 13,000 is something more than a goal, though -- at this stage -- considerably less than actual jobs. What Foxconn says At the White House, Gou made no reference to the number of jobs the facility would create. And in a news release, Foxconn was notably more measured than Walker was, using the word "potential" in saying the plant would "create 3,000 jobs with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs." Trump used the same word, saying 3,000 jobs would be created "at a minimum, with the potential for up to 13,000 jobs in the very near future." Indeed, in an interview on the day of the announcement, Walker himself qualified the 13,000 figure as less than certain in discussing $3 billion in incentives Wisconsin is offering Foxconn. "If there’s something less than the 13,000 jobs, they don’t get as much of an incentive," he told WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee. (Walker repeated that point in three broadcast interviews the next day, making it clear the company would not get the full $1.5 billion jobs portion of the incentives unless 13,000 jobs are created.) It’s fair to say that the 13,000 is something more than a goal, given that Foxconn is entering into a written agreement with the state. "Is there an absolute guarantee that there will be 13,000 jobs? I don’t know how Foxconn could guarantee that," said Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, a nonprofit that advises the governor and the Legislature. "But is there a strategic plan to grow to that level? Absolutely." At the same time, much must occur before any help wanted postings are made. It’s worth noting that in 2013, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett announced that Foxconn planned to invest $30 million in a "high-end technology manufacturing facility" with 500 jobs. The company has a small research operation in Harrisburg, Pa., but the factory was never built. And by way of comparison, on the same day of Foxconn’s Wisconsin announcement, Amazon made a more firm jobs announcement. It said it would hold a job fair on Aug. 2, 2017, at 10 of its shipping sites around the country as part of an effort to fill more than 50,000 U.S. jobs. Our rating Walker said: "Foxconn is bringing 13,000 high-tech jobs to Wisconsin." Leaving aside the term high-tech, the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer is a long way from even breaking ground on a plant that was only announced the same day Walker made his statement. And the company itself has been more measured, saying the planned plant initially will create 3,000 jobs, "with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs." But the 13,000 is more than talk. Foxconn is pledging a $10 billion investment and the state is offering $3 billion in incentives, with $1.5 billion aimed at the creation of 13,000 jobs. Walker’s statement is partially accurate, but needs clarification -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-02677	"State Rep. Kathleen Peters has a 100 percent pro-abortion voting record – even voting against a ban on sex-selection abortions."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/09/national-right-life-committee/kathleen-peters-has-100-percent-pro-abortion-votin/	State Rep. Kathleen Peters has had to articulate positions on a range of issues in the runup to her Jan. 14 Republican primary, but now she’s got a new component to clarify: Her voting record in the Florida Legislature. National Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, brought up Peters’ record on abortion in a Dec. 31 item on its website. In a short article written by political director Karen Cross about the special election’s candidates, the South Pasadena Republican was taken to task for votes in the 2013 legislative session. "State Rep. Kathleen Peters has a 100 percent pro-abortion voting record – even voting against a ban on sex-selection abortions," the piece read. It also stated David Jolly is "the only candidate in the GOP primary who has taken a pro-life stand." The item added that fellow Republican Mark Bircher had not returned the group’s questionnaire and has refused to answer questions about the issue. First Jolly accused Peters of refusing to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare (we rated that Mostly False) and now a conservative group says she’s for abortions. It looks like we have to check into her stance on an issue once again. On the (voting) record Like the Obamacare accusation, it was initially difficult to pin down Peters’ stance on abortion. During her campaign, she didn’t give a clear response to questions about whether she supported further restrictions on abortions, or if Roe vs. Wade should be overturned. "Honestly I think that's a private issue. I think too often we put social issues into government that don't belong," she told the Tampa Bay Times. She continued, "I don't support government-funded abortions, but I don't support the government dictating to religious hospitals what they can and cannot do." She gave a similar answer on a Dec. 22 episode of Bay News 9’s Political Connections. She was much more specific after the National Right to Life article came out. When asked about the issue at a Belleair Women's Republican Club meeting on Jan. 3, Peters said she was "absolutely pro-life" and had "voted on good policy that protects the unborn children." Her campaign said that she "has always believed that life begins at conception and should only end through natural death." The campaign has also said Peters may not have even received the group’s questionnaire. Abortion bills didn’t fare well in the 2013 Florida legislative session, with most not getting past the committee level. Peters, who was a freshman representative last year, only had the chance to cast a vote on three pieces of legislation involving abortion-related issues. National Right to Life confirmed they were the three taken into account for their claim about her voting record. HB 759, the Offenses Against Unborn Child Bill, sought to make the injury or death of an unborn child during the commission of a crime a separate offense with its own penalties. It passed the House along mostly party lines on April 18, 74-43. Peters and Ray Pilon, R-Sarasota, were the only Republicans to vote against the bill. The measure later failed. The only bill specifically mentioned by Cross in the claim, the Ban On Race or Sex-Selective Abortions Bill, HB 845, is the one that dealt directly with abortions. The legislation required making doctors sign an affidavit before the procedure affirming they were not knowingly performing an abortion based on the sex or race of the fetus. Again Peters and Pilon voted against the bill, along with Republicans Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Bill Hager, R-Delray Beach. It passed the House on April 18, 71-44, but also eventually failed. Peters’ campaign manager Mark Zubaly said the no vote was because although she opposed sex-selection abortions, Peters felt the legislation would have created unnecessary regulations for doctors without solving the problem. Finally, the entire Legislature voted in favor of HB 1129, the Care for Infants Born Alive After Botched Abortion Bill. The bill required immediate medical care for fetuses born alive following an attempted abortion. It unanimously passed the House on April 17, and the Senate on April 30. All three of those bills were listed under the Florida Family Policy Council’s list of "Good Bills" for the session, meaning legislation that furthered conservative, anti-abortion interests ("Bad Bills" dealt primarily with promoting forms of gambling and gay rights). Since Peters voted against HB 759 and HB 845, that’s two strikes, as far as National Right to Life would be concerned. But then there’s HB 1129, which was supported by pro-life and pro-choice advocates. Cross said the vote counted against Peters because she "did not co-sponsor" the legislation. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, introduced the bill, with Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, added on as a sponsor. Eventually 25 co-sponsors, two of which were Democrats, were added to the bill. That sounds pretty nitpicky to us, since there were obviously plenty of other Republicans who didn’t co-sponsor the bill, but still voted for it. Either way, Peters’ yes vote is what the anti-abortion lobby wanted for HB 1129. When we asked Cross to clarify whether her vote was negated only because she wasn’t a co-sponsor, she referred us to the Florida chapter of the organization, which didn’t respond to our attempt to contact them. Our ruling National Right to Life said Peters "has a 100 percent pro-abortion voting record – even voting against a ban on sex-selection abortions." It’s true that she voted against a sex-selection abortion ban, no matter what reasoning she offered as an explanation. Whether all her votes were "pro-abortion" is another matter. Peters voted against two bills ostensibly designed to protect unborn children, but she voted for a third bill that aimed to save the life of children born after failed attempts at abortions. That doesn't make her voting record on the issue 100 percent "pro-abortion." We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-01087	The Obama administration "supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/14/jonathan-turley/gw-law-prof-white-house-supported-muslim-allies-tr/	France has braced itself for yet another round of Islamic extremist attacks as the latest issue of Charlie Hebdo hits the newsstands. Following the murders of most of the Paris-based satirical paper’s staff last week, the cover features a cartoon Mohammed with a tear rolling down his cheek, under a headline that reads in French, "All is forgiven." He holds the symbol of solidarity with the slain journalists, a sign that says "Je suis Charlie," or "I am Charlie." While that message might be somber, a powerful vein of Muslim thought sees any depiction of Mohammed as blasphemous. Cartoons like this were what drew death threats in the past. In this violent clash between the pen and the sword, politicians and pundits in the western democracies largely put the onus on the Islamic world to uphold the principle of freedom of expression. But a prominent American law professor wrote in a Sunday Washington Post op-ed that the Obama administration itself has abetted the forces of intolerance. In that op-ed, Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School primarily criticized the French for passing laws that criminalize speech that insults, defames or incites violence on the basis of religion, race, or other social marker. At the end of his piece, however, Turley brings his critique closer to home. "In 2009, the Obama administration shockingly supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard," Turley wrote, "And as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton invited delegations to Washington to work on implementing that standard." Has the administration really supported Muslim countries as they seek to spread an international standard forbidding blasphemy? We took a closer look. (For the record, Turley is representing House Republicans in their health care lawsuit against the president, but his stance on this issue came long before.) At the heart of Turley’s argument is American support for United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18. The U.S. goal was to establish common ground for religious tolerance. Or, as the opening lines of the resolution put it, "to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction as to, inter alia, religion or belief." Approved in March 2011, the document has many clauses. These three are the most relevant to our fact-check: It affirms "the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information can play in strengthening democracy and combating religious intolerance." It "condemns any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-visual or electronic media or any other means." In a list of "actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance, peace and respect," it calls on states to adopt "measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief." For Turley and other free speech advocates, the kicker is that last point and the green light it gives to criminalizing expressions that incite others to violence. "The president has said that he does not support criminalizing blasphemy, but the reality is that the language of the resolution criminalizes the same speech," Turley told PunditFact. A quick history of blasphemy at the UN The effort to give blasphemy laws international legal standing at the United Nations goes back 15 years. It was largely a project of Muslim nations working through the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group with 57 member countries. In committees like the Human Rights Council, they were able to win majority support for policies to rein in freedom of expression in the name of preventing religious defamation. The United States and Western European representatives opposed these moves on free speech grounds, but found themselves out-voted. The Islamic nations pressed the defamation issue until a few years ago. Then in 2011, compromise language emerged that dropped any reference to blasphemy or defamation. The measure passed by unanimous consent. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it a landmark achievement. "The United States strongly supports today’s resolution, which rejects the broad prohibitions on speech called for in the former ‘defamation of religions’ resolution, and supports approaches that do not limit freedom of expression or infringe on the freedom of religion," Clinton said in a prepared statement. Human rights advocacy groups, such as Human Rights First and British-based Article 19, also endorsed the measure. Human Rights First wrote, "Resolution 16/18 ceases to provide cover for national blasphemy laws and charts a new course. The resolution omits any reference to ‘defamation of religions’ and — in accordance with international standards — focuses on the protection of individuals, rather than the protection of abstract ideas and religions." We reached out to the White House to learn how the "incitement to immediate violence" phrase is different from the religious defamation language sought by the Muslim governments. We did not hear back, but in a published letter, two high-level State Department officials, Michael Posner and Suzan Johnson Cook, explained how these words are in synch with American law. They cited the 1969 Brandenburg v. Ohio decision involving a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In its ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court held that all speech is protected "except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action." Posner and Cook wrote, "drawing a caricature of the prophet Muhammad that resulted in violence by Muslim extremists would not constitute 'incitement to imminent violence' under the Brandenburg test." Accordingly, the resolution, they said, would protect freedom of expression. Reading the UN rules differently Blasphemy laws are not rare. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2012 nearly a quarter of all countries had them. The list includes some European countries, such as Germany and Ireland, but the greatest concentration is in the Middle East where every Muslim nation from Egypt to Pakistan has them. In Pakistan, for example, a person could, in theory, be executed for insulting the prophet Mohammed or the Koran. No executions have happened, but in 2012, Pakistan prosecuted a dozen blasphemy cases. Muslim governments consistently argue that it is okay to restrict speech when that speech incites others to violence. Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu, Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation until 2014, made that clear in a 2012 interview with the French news service France24. İhsanoğlu spoke more than a year after the UN resolution passed and about a month after the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. "The OIC — I as secretary — I am a staunch supporter of freedom of expression," İhsanoğlu said. "But freedom of expression, according to international law, does not entail freedom of insulting others, denigrating others, mocking others." For İhsanoğlu, just as no one has the right to randomly scream "Fire!" in a crowded theater, no one has the right to insult Mohammed if others might respond violently. When the interviewer pressed and said "making fun of a religion doesn’t necessarily equate with incitement to violence," İhsanoğlu was adamant and specifically said that cartoons that mock Mohammed should be banned, in France and elsewhere. "If you don’t respect the feelings of 1.5 billion people, and if you don’t feel yourself responsible not to insult them, then we have a problem here. And if we have a problem here, we will have a problem there, with the demonstrations and taking to street and using violence," İhsanoğlu said. The secretary-general went on to say that the anti-Islam video that contributed to the attack in Benghazi and the attack itself were two sides of the same coin. "We are equating these acts together as incitement to hatred, incitement to violence. And we say we should not be hostages to extremists on either side," İhsanoğlu said. A year later, in a speech in Moscow, İhsanoğlu praised Resolution 16/18 for advancing the principle that freedom of expression did not include the right to defame any religion. He called the western concept, "a "twisted negative logic that is incomprehensible; that one exercises his freedom by insulting others, and not insulting just a few people, but insulting 1.6 billion people all over the world for no reason." The record is clear. The governments of Islamic majority nations see no conflict between 16/18 and laws that ban cartoons of Mohammed or any other public act that might offend believers in Islam. A failed strategy? Adoption of the 16/18 resolution led to a series of meetings to put its lofty goals into practice. Turley’s op-ed referred to one such meeting held in Washington. On the issue of freedom of speech, those talks have yet to deliver the goods. Robert Blitt is an associate professor of law at the University of Tennessee College of Law and has studied this slice of international law very closely. Blitt told PunditFact that the process is faltering. "The west is confronting the realization that the compromise effort that halted resolutions on defamation of religion and replaced them with an incitement-based approach did nothing to resolve the underlying, and still overriding, desire for the OIC to secure a prohibition on expression deemed defamatory of Islam," Blitt said. The American support for 16/18, Blitt said, probably bolstered the voices of moderate Muslim states that wanted to dial down the bad publicity they were getting with the defamation of religion resolutions. But Blitt said that tactic hasn’t shifted the Muslim position. "I don’t think the administration is intentionally supporting efforts to establish a new blasphemy standard," Blitt said. "However, its current stance represents an inadequate and miscalculated effort to create common ground." This isn’t terribly far from Turley’s view. Turley told PunditFact that he has talked with administration officials about this. "They always insisted that they were taking a different approach to try to moderate the Muslim countries," Turley said. The claim in his op-ed, Turley said, was not based on intentions, but results. And so far, the results, in his view, have been nill. Our ruling Turley said that the Obama administration "supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard." The accuracy of this statement hinges on how you understand that word "supported." American diplomats did endorse a UN resolution that avoided words about restricting speech that defamed a religion, but left open the door to criminalizing speech that was "incitement to immediate violence based on religion." The administration, as well as some free-speech advocacy groups, saw this as progress. But blasphemy laws remain on the books in Muslim nations, and the largest international body that speaks for those nations has said plainly that such laws are appropriate and ought to be adopted in the west. Not even Turley argues that this is the result the administration wanted, and another critic of the administration's strategy said American diplomats do not support efforts to establish an international blasphemy standard. One could argue that by participating in the ongoing negotiations, the administration has de facto endorsed a vehicle for the Muslim nations, but that is not the same as supporting their efforts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07977	"92 percent" of President Barack Obama's administration has "never worked outside government."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jan/20/steve-southerland/92-percent-obama-administration-has-no-private-sec/	Steve Southerland successfully campaigned on a message that Washington and the Panhandle incumbent he ousted, Allen Boyd, were out of touch with mainstream American thinking. Now in Congress, Southerland isn't letting up. In a speech on Jan. 17, 2011, before the Liberty County Chamber of Commerce, Southerland described what he calls the "Serengeti principle" of personal responsibility -- "wherein the gazelle wakes up every morning knowing he must outrun the fastest lion, or he will die, and the lion wakes up every morning knowing he must outrun the slowest gazelle, or he will starve." Southerland, according to coverage provided by the Tallahassee Democrat, said the federal government "picks winners" through a maze of subsidies and social programs that have saddled future generations with massive debt and stifled business with over-regulation. "It is ugly," he said. "If you look at the finances of this nation, going forward, it terrifies me, the tsunami of debt, the tsunami of financial obligations we're staring at. And yet, they want more — an administration where 92 percent have never worked outside government." Southerland, like many Republicans, has argued that Congress needs to work to reduce government spending and repeal the federal health care bill passed in 2010. But in this fact check, we wanted to analyze Southerland's claim about the Obama administration, that part of the reason it is out of touch is that so many of its highest officials have been solely government workers. It turns out this is the case of a bad political myth being recycled. Fox News talk show host Glenn Beck seized on the same claim in November 2009. It started on the Internet, based on a study by Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. In a column titled "Obama's Business Blind Spot" and published on Forbes.com, Cembalest wrote, "In a quest to see what frame of reference the administration might have on this issue (of creating jobs), I looked back at the history of the presidential Cabinet. Starting with the creation of the secretary of commerce back in 1900, I compiled the prior private-sector experience of all 432 Cabinet members, focusing on those positions one would expect to participate in this discussion: secretaries of State; Commerce; Treasury; Agriculture; Interior; Labor; Transportation; Energy; and Housing & Urban Development." He continued, "Many of these individuals started a company or ran one, with first-hand experience in hiring and firing, domestic and international competition, red tape, recessions, wars and technological change. Their industries included agribusiness, chemicals, finance, construction, communications, energy, insurance, mining, publishing, pharmaceuticals, railroads and steel; a cross-section of the American experience. (I even gave [one-third] credit to attorneys focused on private-sector issues, although one could argue this is a completely different kettle of fish.) One thing is clear: The current administration, compared with past Democratic and Republican ones, marks a departure from the traditional reliance on a balance of public- and private-sector experiences." In an accompanying chart, Cembalest reported that in the Obama administration, fewer than 10 percent of the Cabinet appointees counted under those rules had private sector experience. (The chart has since been updated -- more on that in a second.) According to the chart, all other administrations going back to Theodore Roosevelt's had rates in at least the high 20s, with the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations approaching 60 percent. (Cembalest wrote in a footnote that the data came from a number of sources, including capsule biographies of Cabinet members posted on the website of the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs.) The chart — reprinted by itself, without Cembalest's accompanying narrative — circulated in the conservative blogosphere for a couple of days before eventually being picked up by Beck. PolitiFact writer Louis Jacobson looked into Beck's claim back then, and found much lacking. In Obama's Cabinet, at least three of the nine posts that Cembalest and Beck cite — a full one-third — are occupied by appointees who had significant corporate or business experience. (The Cabinet technically includes 15 department heads and Vice President Joe Biden.) Shaun Donovan, Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., where he oversaw its investments in affordable housing loans. Energy Secretary Steven Chu headed the electronics research lab at one of America's storied corporate research-and-development facilities, AT&T Bell Laboratories, where his work won a Nobel Prize for physics. And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, in addition to serving as Colorado attorney general and a U.S. senator, has been a partner in his family's farm for decades and, with his wife, owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado. Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke spent part of their careers working as lawyers in private practice. Clinton and Vilsack worked as private-sector lawyers at the beginning of their careers, while Locke joined an international law firm, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, after serving as governor of Washington state. At the firm, Locke "co-chaired the firm's China practice" and "helped U.S. companies break into international markets," according to his official biography. That sounds like real private sector experience to us. Finally, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas. The occupants of the two remaining Cabinet posts cited in the chart do not appear to have had significant private-sector experience: Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Obama's Cabinet has even more private-sector experience if you go beyond those nine positions. Vice President Joe Biden, officially a Cabinet member, founded his own law firm, Biden and Walsh, early in his career, and it still exists in a later incarnation, Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder, P.A. And Office of Management and Budget then-director Peter Orszag -- that position too has Cabinet-level rank -- founded an economic consulting firm called Sebago Associates that was later bought out by a larger firm. (Orszag stepped down in July and the agency is now being run by acting director Jeffrey Zients -- who has his own private-sector experience as a managing partner for an investment firm focused on business and health care services companies.) Now Southerland used the term "administration," which has a much broader context than just Obama's Cabinet. National Journal examined a larger group of senior Obama administration appointees in June 2009, and found that more than one in four have experience as business executives. That compared with the 38 percent the magazine found eight years earlier at the start of George W. Bush's administration. Still, the numbers for Obama are at least three times higher than the level claimed by Southerland. The author of the chart quoted by Beck and requoted by Southerland, Cembalest, told PolitiFact that any effort to address the topic is heavily subjective, and he expressed regret that his work had been used for political ends, saying that it was not his intention to provide fodder for bloggers and talk show hosts. Cembalest said he has "written 250,000 words in research over the last decade, and every single thing I've ever done — except this one chart — was empirically based on data from the Federal Reserve" or another official source. "This is the one time I stepped out into making judgment calls, and I assure you I won't do it again. ... The frightening thing about the Internet is that people copy one chart from what you write and then it goes viral. So I've learned a lesson here that these kinds of issues are best left addressed by the people who practice them day in and day out." After the controversy in 2009, Cembalest updated his chart to reflect that more than 20 percent of Obama Cabinet appointees had private sector experience. That brings us back to Southerland. He said that "92 percent" of Obama's administration has "never worked outside government." While rating someone's degree of private-sector experience is an inexact science, Southerland at the least is guilty of failing to keep up with Cembalest's own opinion on the matter. Cembalest now says that of Obama's Cabinet appointees that he studied, more than 20 percent have private sector experience. But more than that, the study itself is highly subjective, first because it cherry picks what Cabinet appointees to consider, and second because it unilaterally tries to define private sector work. On top of that, Southerland didn't single out the Cabinet, but instead said "administration," which is a far wider pool of people. We rate this claim False.

pomt-04960	Says Mitt Romney "backed a bill that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/25/barack-obama/romney-abortion-rape-incest/	To appeal to women voters, Barack Obama's campaign has been attacking Mitt Romney about his position on abortion. The latest ad, "Jenny’s Story," opens with a woman speaking to the camera. "I’ve never felt this way before but it’s a scary time to be a woman," she says. "Mitt Romney is just so out of touch." The announcer says, "Mitt Romney opposes requiring insurance coverage for contraception. And Romney supports overturning Roe vs. Wade. Romney backed a bill that outlaws all abortion, even in case of rape and incest." Back to the woman: "There’s just so much we need to do. We need to attack our problems. Not a woman’s choice." PolitiFact has tracked Romney’s change of position on abortion. In the early 2000s he spoke of a woman’s right to choose. By 2006, he said he was "pro-life." For this fact-check, we'll explore if the Obama campaign is accurately describing his position when it says he opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest. This claim is almost identical to one made in an Obama ad that ran in the first week of July. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org said that "twisted Romney’s stance." At the time, the Obama campaign backed up its ad by pointing to a 2007 debate when Romney said he would sign a bill that banned all abortions. But there was no specific bill and no specific language. The Obama campaign produced a new ad, but it is not posted on YouTube. We found it on a Washington Post site that tracks campaign ads using data from Kantar Media. The ad changes the claim to say that Romney supported a "bill" rather than a "law." This time, the Obama campaign referred us to additional material. In 2004 and 2008, the Republican Party platform backed the "human life amendment," which asserts that legal personhood begins at conception -- and with that comes full constitutional protections. In 2007, Romney said on ABC’s Good Morning America, "You know, I do support the Republican platform, and I support that being part of the Republican platform and I’m pro-life." But the Obama campaign has a problem in extrapolating Romney's position from that comment. Support for the amendment does not necessarily equate to opposing abortion when pregnancy is due to rape or incest. The National Committee for a Human Life Amendment, a Washington-based advocacy group, has compiled the congressional bills in favor of an amendment dating back to 1973. Some of those bills have no exceptions for rape and incest. However, the most recent versions do. In 2003 Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo, introduced H.J. Res 9 which held that "no unborn person shall be deprived of life." However, the bill adds "nothing in this article shall prohibit a law permitting only those medical procedures required to prevent the death of the mother of an unborn person: Provided further, that nothing in this article shall limit the liberty of a mother with respect to the unborn offspring of the mother conceived as a result of rape or incest." We asked Michael Taylor, Executive Director of the National Committee for a Human Life Amendment, what that bill means. "I’m not a lawyer," Taylor said. "But the way I read it, there’s an exception for the life of the mother and for cases of rape and incest." Taylor’s site lists another occasion in 1989 when the Senate Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on the Constitution approved amendment language proposed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, that also included exceptions for rape and incest. These versions predate the Republican Party platforms of 2004 and 2008 that endorse the "human life amendment." Rep. Emerson introduced the same amendment with the exception for rape and incest in 2005. So the main versions when Romney made his 2007 remark included the exception. More recently, Romney has made clear that he supports the exception for rape and incest. In 2011, Romney explained his position on abortion in an op-ed in the National Review. It begins with "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother." Our Ruling The ad from the Obama campaign said Romney "backed a bill that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest." The Obama campaign provides virtually nothing to back that up, however. It has no evidence that Romney explicitly opposed the exception for rape and incest. While he supported the "human life amendment," there are many versions and the most recent ones allow abortion after rape or incest. And it's worth noting that in 2011, Romney declared that has said he supports those exceptions. In its effort to appeal to women, the Obama campaign has twisted Romney's position to a ridiculous degree. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-07626	The House budget plan proposes "the largest discretionary spending cut in history."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/18/bob-goodlatte/bob-goodlatte-says-house-budget-offers-largest-dis/	The U.S government got a three-week lease on life Thursday as Congress passed yet another stopgap that will fund federal operations through April 8. But the threat of a shutdown still lurks as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked on the magnitude of spending cuts for the 2011 federal budget, which runs through Sept.30. U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Roanoke, supported deep budget cuts approved by the GOP-led House on Feb 19. In a column posted on his website six days later, Goodlatte said the bill cuts $100 billion. "This represents the largest discretionary spending cut in history," Goodlatte said. Kathryn Rexrode, a spokeswoman for Goodlatte, said her boss’ statement has been widely uttered by interest groups and members of Congress, including Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. We wondered if the cuts would be truly historic. First, an important detail: The $100 billion figure that Goodlatte and other Republicans are using represents the amount the House would ax from President Barack Obama’s 2011 budget proposal. Budget analysts from conservative and liberal organizations told us it is more meaningful to say the House proposal would cut spending by $61 billion, which is the amount it would excise from the 2010 federal budget. The Senate, by contrast, wants to pare $10.5 billion from last year’s budget. So our goal is to see whether U.S. discretionary spending was ever reduced by more than $61 billion from one budget to the next. Discretionary spending is the money the federal government pays out through a dozen or so appropriation bills Congress approves each year. It adds up to about 40 percent of the national budget and includes a variety of services such as defense, law enforcement, transportation and national parks. If you’re curious, non-discretionary spending largely refers to three benefit programs Congress is required to fund at certain levels: social security, Medicare and Medicaid. We didn’t go back to the 1st Congress in 1789 to determine whether the proposed spending cut is indeed historic. The annual federal budget did not exceed $61 billion -- the amount the House wants to cut this year -- until 1943. We analyzed spreadsheets from the Office of Management and Budget. To roughly compute discretionary spending each year since 1943, we took the total budget outlay and subtracted the costs of Social Security and interest payments on government loans. The nation began paying for Medicare and Medicaid in the 1966 budget so starting that year, we also subtracted the cost of those programs. The largest reductions came after World War II as the U.S. was returning to peace. Discretionary spending dropped by about $38.5 billion in 1946 about $21 billion in 1947 -- entirely because of defense cuts. There have been a few other years when discretionary funding has dipped by smaller amounts: in the mid 1950s after the Korean War and in 1965. The feat was last accomplished in 1996, when discretionary spending dropped $12.1 billion. All of those numbers are smaller than the $61 billion the House wants to cut this year, so Godlatte’s claim is technically correct. But the post-World War II cuts, when adjusted for their times and inflation, were far greater in magnitude than anything being considered today. The 1946 cuts represented a 43 percent reduction in discretionary spending and 1947 brought another 41 percent cut. In contrast, this year’s House plan proposes a 4.5 percent drop. When adjusted for inflation, the 1946 cuts equal about $438 billion worth of reductions in today’s dollars -- more than seven times the reductions in the House budget. The 1947 cuts come to about $207 billion in today’s dollars. One final point: While the post World War II reductions came from military spending, this year’s House proposal would shield defense from cuts. Let’s review: Goodlatte says the proposed House budget would be "the largest discretionary spending cut in history." The plan would pare $61 billion from last year’s discretionary budget. In terms of raw numbers, Goodlatte is correct. The closest Congress came to that number was about a $38.5 reduction in 1946 and about a $21 billion lop the following year. But the magnitude of those post-war cuts, when adjusted for inflation and the percentage of non-discretionary spending they represented at the time, far outstrips this year’s House proposal. Goodlatte’s statement is accurate but benefits from clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2011-03-18T11:46:17	2011-02-25	['None']
pomt-04390	Says Rep. Jon Runyan "voted to redefine rape."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/18/shelley-adler/shelley-adler-claims-jon-runyan-voted-redefine-rap/	Democratic congressional hopeful Shelley Adler says the voting record of her Republican opponent, Rep. Jon Runyan, stands as "proof that we can't trust him to be on our side." But one piece of Adler’s evidence against Runyan doesn’t hold up against the facts. At an Oct. 10 campaign event, Adler -- who is challenging Runyan on Nov. 6 for the seat representing the state’s third congressional district -- listed the reasons women should be wary of her opponent. "We can’t trust him to stand up for women, after he sponsored legislation that would allow insurance companies to deny women access to birth control and basic preventive health care services. He voted to cut off critical, life-saving health care for women that included cancer screenings, like mammograms, and even voted to redefine rape," Adler said. "That’s not being on our side." Adler levies a hefty allegation against Runyan in claiming he voted to redefine rape, but it’s just not true. Adler’s charge -- which her campaign has repeated before -- stems from legislation sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.) called the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act." The bill, as introduced, would have permanently restricted federal funding for abortions except in cases of "forcible rape," incest, if the victim was a minor, or to save the life of the mother. In September, PolitiFact Wisconsin checked a claim from Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat from Wisconsin, that House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape" and rated it Mostly False. As one piece of evidence to support the statement, Moore’s spokeswoman cited Smith’s legislation. But PolitiFact Wisconsin found that House Republicans were not trying to change the definition of rape, per se. Rather, they were trying to limit federal funding for abortions. So Adler starts off on a flawed premise. But the charge against Runyan -- which Chris Russell, Runyan’s campaign spokesman, called "just plain despicable" -- is even more misleading because when he cast a vote in favor of Smith’s bill, the word "forcible" had been removed. Adler’s spokesman, Michael Muller, acknowledged the error, saying "you're right about the vote." Smith first introduced the bill in 2010 when Democrats controlled the House. The legislation went nowhere. But the next year Republicans gained control of the House. Smith reintroduced his bill on Jan. 20, 2011. As we noted in a previous fact-check, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican nominee for vice president, and Rep. Todd Akin -- a Republican Senate candidate from Missouri who made the controversial remark that pregnancies are rare in cases of "legitimate rape" -- both signed on as co-sponsors of Smith’s bill. Runyan never co-sponsored the legislation. Critics condemned the term "forcible rape," saying it would exclude rapes involving drugs and victims of statutory rape. By February, Smith had agreed to strip the controversial language from the bill. So when the House passed the bill on May 4, 2011, the legislation exempted all cases of rape from the ban on federal funding for abortions. The legislation passed by 251 to 175, with Runyan voting in favor of the legislation. The Democrat-controlled Senate never voted on the proposal. So Adler is wrong to claim Runyan voted to redefine rape. The vote he cast was in favor of prohibiting federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother was at risk. Our ruling Adler said Runyan "voted to redefine rape" while listing the reasons "we can’t trust him to stand up for women." The Democratic congressional hopeful distorts the voting record of her Republican rival with this claim. House Republicans introduced a bill that restricted federal funding for abortions, except in cases of "forcible rape." Runyan never signed on as a co-sponsor of that legislation. Further, when the bill reached the House floor for a full vote and Runyan voted in favor of it, the word "forcible" had been removed. We rate Adler’s claim False.

pomt-08662	Extending current tax rates would "average more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and even billionaires."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/13/austan-goolsbee/Goolsbee-millionaires-tax-cuts-average/	Tax cuts passed under the Bush administration have been in place for close to ten years, but they will expire at the end of 2010 if Congress doesn't take action. Add in a weak economy, big government deficits, and an upcoming election, and you've got one of the most pressing policy issues of the year. President Barack Obama's administration wants to see the tax cuts made permanent for individuals who make less than $200,000 a year and couples who make less than $250,000 a year. Tax rates would go up for people who make more than that. Austan Goolsbee defended that position on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Goolsbee is one of Obama's top economic officials, and was recently selected to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, which counsels the president on economic policy. Obama has been "quite clear," Goolsbee said, "that borrowing $700 billion to extend tax cuts that average more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and even billionaires is the least effective bang for the buck we have." We were interested in that $100,000 number -- that extending the expiring tax cuts would "average more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and even billionaires." The White House pointed us to data from the Ways and Means Committee, the committee in the U.S. House of Representatives charged with writing tax legislation. Democrats on the committee asked the Joint Committee on Taxation for an analysis of extending the expiring tax cuts. The Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, is a nonpartisan committee with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants who conduct research. The JCT crunched the numbers to generate several tables estimating tax revenues if the tax cuts expire, and how many taxpayers would be affected. The JCT found that, for those who have income of $1 million or more, extending the Bush tax cuts would mean $32.7 billion that the government would not collect in 2011. That amount would apply to 315,000 tax filers. Divide the foregone tax revenues by the number of filers, and you get $103,809, or just over $100,000, as Goolsbee said. We also checked with the Tax Policy Center, an independent, nonpartisan think tank that generates economic projections similar to those of the JCT. The Tax Policy Center found that the average tax increase to millionaires and up would be $128,832. That's a bit higher than the JCT estimate, but for a complex economic analysis, it's fairly close. The center's numbers also supports Goolsbee's statement that extending the tax cuts would "average more than $100,000 a year to millionaires and even billionaires." To get the point of view of someone who opposes letting the current tax rates expire, we turned to the conservative Heritage Foundation. J.D. Foster said he didn't argue with the numbers, but with Goolsbee's focus on millionaires. Many of those who make more than $200,000 or $250,000 are not millionaires, and those people will see a tax increase as well. "If they only intend to raise taxes on millionaires, then they need to change their proposal," Foster said. "I understand it's a convenient rhetorical ploy, but its factually incorrect." This is a fair point: Goolsbee talked about a $700 billion cost, which is a general estimate for what extending the tax cuts for 10 years would cost for all higher earners, not just millionaires. We went back to the analysis and found calculations for what the Bush tax cuts are worth for other high incomes. The JCT found that for those who make between $500,000 and $1 million, the lower rates were worth an average $17,467 per tax filer, and for those who make between $200,000 and $500,000, the lower rates were worth $7,152 per tax filer. The Tax Policy Center's numbers were similar. So Goolsbee is correct that the expiring tax cuts are worth, on average, more than $100,000 for millionaires and billionaires. But the proposal the president supports would let tax cuts expire for some people who make high salaries but aren't millionaires, which Goolsbee didn't mention. So we deduct a tick from the Truth-O-Meter and rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Austan Goolsbee	None	None	None	2010-09-13T17:18:50	2010-09-12	['None']
pomt-01315	On an income cap for recipients of the popular HOPE scholarship	full flop	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/28/jason-carter/Carter/	Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter was adamant in 2011 that Gov. Nathan Deal was taking the wrong approach to saving HOPE, arguably the most popular state program ever created. The lottery-funded scholarship program was looking at potential bankruptcy. Deal, Georgia’s newly elected governor, proposed a series of changes to the program — the most significant being that full scholarships would go only to the best and brightest, students with a 3.7 grade-point average and 1200 SAT scores. Carter, however, championed an alternative in 2011 and 2012. His proposal would have set a so-called income cap on HOPE scholarships. The scholarships would go only to qualifying students from families with a household income of $140,000 or less. Opponents said that would put the program in equal financial peril, eliminating only 6 percent of all Georgia families. The proposed income caps resurfaced recently in the tight governor’s race between Carter and Deal. Republicans pounced with attack ads suggesting Carter "wants to eliminate HOPE scholarships for thousands of middle-class families." But then Carter appeared to change his approach on the income cap. At an education summit earlier this month, Carter said an income cap is "probably too blunt an instrument." The goal, he said, is to maximize the number of scholars and consider "need without a full-fledged cap." So has Carter flip-flopped on his position? We found an article from January indicating that Carter had changed from his original call for an income cap. He said he still wanted to push for some needs-based criteria for the HOPE scholarship. But he dismissed the idea of an income cap, calling it "too blunt an instrument," the magazine reported. Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas said Carter first discussed abandoning the idea of an income cap with students at the University of Georgia about a year ago. Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, said Carter was late to the game. "It’s literally taken Jason Carter three and a half years to realize you ‘cannot pay for everybody’ — a conclusion that responsible Republicans and Democrats reached when they took courageous votes to save HOPE from bankruptcy." We rate Carter’s change of heart on HOPE a Full Flop.	None	Jason Carter	None	None	None	2014-10-28T00:00:00	2014-10-07	['None']
pomt-09485	"Fifty-seven" of Rubio's 100 ideas "ultimately became law."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/26/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-57-his-100-ideas-were-made-law-florid/	Marco Rubio's two years as speaker of Florida's House of Representatives were marked by passionate speeches, promises of conservative principles and a book filled with 100 ways to transform state government. 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future promised a sea change -- from lowering property taxes and insurance rates, to luring Hollywood productions to the state; from recalibrating Florida's schools, to building a better Web site for the state budget. The ideas became the agenda of the Republican-led House in 2007 and 2008 and a personal report card for Rubio, now a candidate for the U.S. Senate. In the end, Rubio gave himself A's. "All 100 ideas were passed by the Florida House," Rubio's campaign Web site says. "Fifty-seven of these ideas ultimately became law, including measures to crack down on gangs and sexual predators, promote energy efficient buildings, appliances and vehicles, and help small businesses obtain affordable health coverage." The St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald are launching PolitiFact Florida, accessed online at http://www.politifact.com/florida, with this examination of Rubio's claim. Fifty-seven fact-checks packed into one ruling. At a recent campaign event in front of a room full of reporters, Rubio -- who has met our Truth-O-Meter before -- offered this introduction: "I don't want to get PolitiFact-checked today," Rubio said. Sorry. The Truth-O-Meter has come to Florida. How we got started Taking Rubio at his word on the 43 unsuccessful ideas, we began by asking Rubio's Senate campaign for evidence about the 57 he says became law. Spokesman Alex Burgos pointed us to a May 2008 Miami Herald article, which referenced a two-page report prepared by Rubio's then-legislative staff. That report, like Rubio claims, says 57 of the 100 ideas have been "completed." From there, we researched the validity of each claim, matching the idea from the book to a corresponding state law. Some of the ideas in Rubio's report listed specific House or Senate bills that we examined. For others, we searched the Legislature's online repository of bills from the 2007 and 2008 sessions, as well as newspaper articles and press releases from the time. When we found an idea that matched a description in law, we crossed it off our list. When we couldn't, we consulted with the appropriate state agency, the House Majority Office and/or Rubio's U.S. Senate campaign. In the end we created the chart that accompanies this story and shows our findings (at the bottom of this page). Overall, 24 of the 57 ideas Rubio takes credit for delivering we don't question. And we found 10 other ideas that are partially law, or were law under Rubio's watch, but are no longer in effect, or have some other type of asterisk. What Rubio got done When the House and Senate passed property insurance legislation during a special session in January 2007, just two months after Rubio became speaker, House Republicans celebrated with a press release titled "Nine down: 100 ideas gets special start." We agree with Rubio on eight of these nine ideas being accomplished. The legislation created a uniform, statewide building code, allowed policyholders to increase or decrease hurricane deductibles depending on the circumstances, and created a "Truth in Premium Billing" statement for policyholders. But an idea for expanding a short-term, no-interest bridge loan program didn't happen. Rubio can claim many other successes, though. Florida's presidential primary came earlier in 2008 as Rubio promised. Floridians seeking health care coverage now have an online database to check. Drivers can purchase multiple-year vehicle registrations. And the state created an investment money pool for businesses and infrastructure projects. "I think that Marco Rubio drove the agenda down to the last hour that he was speaker," said state Sen. Don Gaetz, who worked with Rubio on education reforms in 2008, including four ideas that are now totally or partially law. "Literally, in the last two hours he was speaker, I was still negotiating issues with him on behalf of the Senate." One of Rubio's ideas led to a requirement that school districts create career academies -- where students can be training in high-demand/high-need vocations. Another pushed the FCAT to later in the school year. A third increased tax credits for companies that contribute to education scholarships. Rubio supporter and former state Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, notes that the ideas aren't all Rubio's -- he collected them at meetings across the state called "Idearaisers." The meetings and then the book gave Floridians an opportunity to have their voices heard, Baxley said. "The book framed a practical set of issues that the people had brought to us," said Baxley, who served as speaker pro tempore under Rubio. "It gave us a platform to work from that was meaningful." Gaetz said Rubio's ideas still come up today. "Marco's genius was in actually listening to people around the state and compiling the list of ideas," said Gaetz, who has endorsed Rubio's opponent Gov. Charlie Crist for Senate. "He branded those ideas and that's the sign of a smart politician. Even still in 2010, as we put together health care and education bills, there will often be somebody, wryly or respectful, noting that what we're doing is in the 100 ideas book." What's not on the books Quick math -- if 24 ideas are law, and 10 others are "kind of" law, that leaves 23 ideas that are something else. In the case of five of the ideas, we find it's wrong to suggest they could be achieved in law. Rubio, for instance, wanted the state to commit to having a "Top 10" public university and to building a "model transportation system." These, and three others, are more appropriately called broad goals, but none are law. (Rubio's office, in response, points to increased university funding or the leasing of toll roads to private companies as evidence these ideas were fulfilled.) That leaves 18 ideas that have not been enacted. Here's an example: Rubio says seven ideas dealing with the environment are now law thanks to a comprehensive energy bill that passed in 2008. One of our favorites was to provide incentives for alternative-fueled cars, including "discounted parking and free or reduced tolls." We have a hybrid in the PolitiFact fleet, and the thought of free or reduced tolls sounded like a great idea. But the bill has no parking or toll incentives for hybrid or other alternative-fuel cars. It does, however, offer lonely hybrid drivers the opportunity to use state High Occupancy Vehicle lanes. But: You need to apply for a decal that costs nearly $6 a year. And you only need a decal weekdays from 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. And, oh, you actually need to have an HOV lane where you drive. The only HOV lanes in Florida are on Interstate 95 in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Two other ideas concern Internet access for sexual offenders and minors, but neither is a law the way Rubio intended. One was to deny sex offenders access to "popular Internet networking sites" and to "install tracking equipment on their computers." What passed in 2007 was a requirement that sex offenders register their e-mail and online instant message names with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The state could then forward that information to social networking sites, which could then choose to ban or block those users. During a presentation of the bill, the Web site MySpace.com agreed to receive the information from FDLE. But there is no tracking equipment, nor is there a requirement that MySpace.com or a Web site like Facebook delete the users FDLE finds. The other idea would have required "social networking sites to set up verification systems to require parental notification and consent for minors to use these sites." There are no such requirements on sites like Facebook or MySpace.com. In those cases, and others we found, Rubio's ideas got lost as part of compromises between the Senate and House, said Rubio's former House spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin. Rubio supporter Baxley agreed. "I don't think that there was an expectation that every bill that would pass would reflect every idea in the book," said Chamberlin, who continues to work for House Republicans. "The legislative process is about negotiation and compromise." Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos noted that Rubio himself described the 100 ideas book "as much a process as it is a product." "The beauty of the 100 ideas project is that these were ideas presented by Floridians," Burgos said. "They weren't put in the book as pieces of legislation or executive orders. They were put in there as a starting point to be inserted in the legislative process." Others are less forgiving. "At the end of the day, sadly, everyone wants to take credit for it, especially if it's a good idea," said state Sen. Mike Fasano, who is supporting Crist. "I think then-speaker Rubio, now candidate Rubio, exaggerates when he suggests he accomplished all of these things." Our ruling Rubio's claim is that 57 of the ideas in his book 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future are now law. Based on our analysis, he has fallen short. Using the most generous accounting, Rubio might be able to say that he got 34 ideas into state lawbooks (adding together those ideas that we marked "law" or "kind of" law). Rubio's campaign had almost two weeks to review our findings, and responded Feb. 26, 2010, with five pages of explanations. In two cases, their information changed our decisions. We also offered Rubio the chance to address our findings. He chose, through a spokesman, not to. That leaves us to make a Truth-O-Meter ruling based on the information you see here, and in the corresponding chart. Based on our findings, 24 of Rubio's 100 ideas became law. Another 10 were partially enacted. That's not the kind of claim you're likely to hear in a TV ad, but it's what we found. Rubio delivered on education and property insurance reforms, and his book and its ideas remain part of the lexicon of the Florida Legislature. But 23 of the ideas either aren't law or could not be law. We find his claim Half True.

pomt-00903	"At this particular point in time, looking at the field, there’s only one individual that’s ever had the uniform of his country on—and that’s me."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/mar/04/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-presidential-field-hes-sole-indivi/	Rick Perry stresses his military service in a web ad noted by Politico on Feb. 27, 2015, describing himself as unique among milling presidential prospects. "At this particular point in time, looking at the field," Perry tells listeners around a table, "there’s only one individual that’s ever had the uniform of his country on—and that’s me." The Politico story went on: "No other 2016 presidential contender — except for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), arguably a long-shot candidate — has served in the military." According to the Associated Press, Graham said in January 2015 he’d set up a committee to explore running for president. Perry’s biographical entry, on his website, says: "Between 1972 and 1977, Perry served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East." And when the then-governor of Texas ran for president in 2012, he was nearly the only candidate with a military record, The Washington Post said in an Aug. 16, 2011, news blog post; the only other candidate with military experience was Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, formerly a flight surgeon in the Air Force and the Air Force National Guard. Paul has since left the House and the presidential hustings, seemingly giving buoyance to this new claim. Prospects who have worn the uniform Perry aides did not respond to our inquiry about how Perry reached his "only one individual" conclusion. So we don’t know why he overlooked Graham, whose time as an Air Force lawyer is mentioned in his Senate biographical entry. By email, Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop said Graham was a senior prosecutor at Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Germany from 1984-1988. He left active duty in 1989, but remains a colonel in the Air Force Reserves, Bishop said. It's worth noting, too, that no candidate has already declared for president, a factor leading us to root our review of Perry's declaration in a list of Americans believed to be considering a run. The list is kept up by Politics1.com, a website run by Florida attorney Ron Gunzburger that tracks candidates for federal office. And it looks like besides Perry and Graham, a couple of possible longshot Republican hopefuls could be stumping with military experience: --Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was a U.S. Army counterintelligence agent in West Germany before entering the University of Virginia Law School, from which he graduated in 1977, according to a biographical entry posted by the National Governors Association. Gilmore’s entry in Who’s Who specifies he was an Army agent in West Germany from 1971-74. In December 2014, Gilmore declined to rule out a presidential bid in an interview with The Washington Post. --Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who like Perry spoke at the February 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference, spent time in the National Guard (signing up, he’s said, because he wanted to diminish his chances of dying in a rice paddy in Vietnam). In January 2015, The Boston Globe quoted Bolton, then about to venture to New Hampshire (home to the nation’s first-every-four-years presidential primaries), saying he was considering a run for president. Democrat fought in Vietnam In his video, Perry--who has said he’ll reveal if he’s running for president in May or June 2015--didn’t say if he was limiting his focus to Republicans. If not, he also overlooked former Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, who was a Marine in Vietnam before later serving as Secretary of the Navy. Webb served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1972 as a second lieutenant and platoon commander in Vietnam, according to Who’s Who. In a video posted online as he launched his presidential exploratory committee in November 2014, Webb said: "I came from a family of citizen-soldiers" including his father, a 26-year pilot. "My brother, my son and I all became Marines. I fought on one of the Vietnam war’s harshest battlefields," Webb said, adding that he spent eight years on active duty. Bush to Walker to Biden to O’Malley; no military service touted Biographical information posted online by more than a dozen other possible Republican candidates or groups didn’t reveal a personal military record for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; surgeon Ben Carson; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz; business executive Carly Fiorina; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; Indiana Gov. Mike Pence; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum; Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder; and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Similarly, possible Democratic aspirants--Vice President Joe Biden; former Secretary of State/former Sen. Hillary Clinton; and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley--show no military background in their lives. What to make of all of this? Next, we queried a Duke University political scientist, Peter Feaver, who offered his opinion by email: "If the field of prospects is limited to what Gov. Perry would plausibly consider to be the Republican top tier, meaning those who poll at his level or higher, then his statement is demonstrably true. None of the Republican candidates that are currently running ahead of Perry in the polls has served in uniform." Feaver continued: "If the field of prospects is expanded to include every person who has expressed an interest in running for president, then of course some of that vast multitude have served in uniform." Our ruling In a web video, Perry said: "At this particular point in time, looking at the field, there’s only one individual that’s ever had the uniform of his country on—and that’s me." Perhaps Perry’s definition of the "field" leaves out possible aspirants who haven’t surged in early polls. We also can see Perry making a case for being the best-known possible Republican nominee with military experience. However, there are others who might bid—a sitting senator, another former governor, a former ambassador and a Democratic former senator—who also were in the military. On balance, we rate his absolute statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-13982	In Ohio, "each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/jun/10/joyce-beatty/thousand-child-sex-trafficking-victims-yearly-ohio/	Despite all the divisiveness in politics, Republicans and Democrats have joined hands to draft legislation on a few things everyone can agree on, like fighting the opioid epidemic, the Zika virus and child sex trafficking. On the latter topic, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio held a press conference on May 25, 2016, with Republican co-sponsors of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, calling for its full implementation. "In my home state of Ohio, for example," Beatty said, "each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk." Because child-sex-trafficking is an inherently clandestine crime, we were curious about the source of those numbers. The "1,000 children" stat appears throughout several Ohio government websites, including the one for the Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force, which Gov. John Kasich first convened in 2012. The home page links to the task force’s most recent report, from 2015, and it does not line up with the annual estimate. The report says "181 potential victims of trafficking were identified" statewide in 2014 after almost 100 stings to bust sex traffickers — and this tally is not limited just to children. The task force’s website also runs a banner that encourages anyone with a tip on a suspected human trafficking case to call the National Human Trafficking Hotline Resource Center, which answers calls 24/7. The resource center, which is partly funded by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, keeps state-by-state reports online. According to the statistics for Ohio, between December 2007 and March 2016, there were 753 cases with "high indicators" of human trafficking. That’s almost 10 years of data collection that, combined, doesn’t come close to the estimate of 1,000 children annually. What’s going on? The 1,000-victim figure comes from a questionable study commissioned by the Ohio Attorney General’s Office and published in 2010. The members of the study included researchers from the University of Ohio and Toledo University, members of law enforcement, and nonprofit advocates. The commission started with data from an FBI program called "Operation Innocence Lost," which focused on 14 cities with the highest incidences of prostitution, which included Toledo, Ohio. The authorities identified an average of 15 minor victims of sex trafficking in Toledo each year, between 2005 and 2009. The study’s authors took that 15-per-year figure and applied it to all girls ages 12 through 17 in the state of Ohio. That population, 337,961, yields an estimate of 202 girls per year. Then, the commission multiplied 202 by five, because a University of Toledo study claimed that each sex trafficking victim they interviewed knew an average of five more underaged minors "not known to law enforcement, but who were engaging in the sex trade." One big problem: The Ohio study did not control for the fact that Toledo’s child sex trafficking rates were the highest in the state, which inflates their estimate even before multiplying it by five. The commission then threw in some boys for good measure, reasoning that being gay, transgender or a runaway are "risk factors" for becoming a child sex trafficking victim. Because 3 to 5 percent of the overall US population identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, the committee added 63 males to the estimated number of child victims. The attorney general’s trafficking study concluded that an annual 1,078 minors in Ohio were potential victims. The other number Beatty and other state leaders cite repeatedly is that there are 3,000 children "at risk" of being trafficked. For that, the attorney general’s commission relied on a study by University of Pennsylvania researchers Richard J. Estes and Neil Alan Weiner, who came up with 14 factors that purportedly increased the chances of a teen being forced into the sex trade. But the Washington Post and Village Voice are among many sources that have thoroughly debunked the Estes and Weiner study. Estes eventually admitted to reporters, "Kids who are kidnapped and sold into slavery — that number would be very small. …We’re talking about a few hundred people." David Finkelhor, a respected voice in his role with the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, has previously criticized the methodology used in the 2010 Ohio study. He told PolitiFact via email, "Nothing has appeared in the last couple of years to make estimates of the problem any more scientific than they were 10 years ago." Through a spokesperson, Beatty agreed that the estimate is bunk. "Congresswoman Beatty was comfortable using the estimates because they were calculated by the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, in consultation with the University of Toledo, and based on research and observations from experts in the field," spokesman Dominic Manecke wrote in an email. "However, she has no problem conceding that the estimate may need to be updated, because whether it be one person, 100 or 1,000 people, one trafficking victim is one too many." Elizabeth Ranade Janis, the head of Kasich’s Human Trafficking Task Force, told PolitiFact that the 1,000-child-victim talking point lacks a basis in solid statistics. "It’s definitely an estimate," she said. "There is no question whether human trafficking is a crime that occurs in our state. ... I would gladly welcome more research to help us better understand the prevalence of the crime and strengthen our efforts to assist survivors." Celia Williamson, who served as the sub-committee chairperson on the 2010 study commission, stood by their estimate, with a caveat. "I think you have to look at 2009 and the data we had at the time," Williamson said. "Toledo was the only city in Ohio with a task force on human trafficking at the time. It was the central place to start. Someone has to pioneer and begin." Our ruling Beatty said, "Each year an estimated 1,000 children become victims of human trafficking, and over 3,000 more are at risk." The underlying study behind this widely distributed state talking point lacks scientific footing. Law enforcement totals of cases involving sex trafficking victims did not approach anywhere close to 1,000 child victims. It’s impossible to quantify how many go undiscovered. But artificially inflating that estimate isn’t necessary. We rate this statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a0e109ab-8e1f-4e19-a85c-d5bdbfbee89f	None	Joyce Beatty	None	None	None	2016-06-10T10:47:12	2016-05-25	['Ohio']
pomt-04115	Says his transportation plan "would make Virginia the first state in the nation to eliminate the state tax on gasoline."	true	/virginia/statements/2013/jan/10/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-his-roads-plan-would-make-virginia-/	Gov. Bob McDonnell opened the 2013 General Assembly session by proposing a dramatic change to the way Virginia raises money for building and maintaining roads. "The proposal would make Virginia the first state in the nation to eliminate the state tax on gasoline," McDonnell said in a Jan. 9 news conference announcing the plan. We wondered if his claim is correct, so we did some checking. McDonnell’s plan would end the Virginia’s 17.5-cent excise tax on a gallon of gas. The revenue would be replaced by increasing the state’s 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent and dedicating the new proceeds to roads. Diesel would still carry a 17.5 cent per gallon excise tax. Virginia’s gas tax rate has been unchanged since 1987. With cars getting better mileage and using alternative fuels, McDonnell says the levy no longer produces enough money to pay for Virginia’s road needs. Sales tax revenues, in contrast, are expected to steadily grow. All states have some form of excise tax on gasoline, according to a report by the American Petroleum Institute and a joint study published by the National Council of State Legislatures and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Center for Excellence in Public Finance. Thirty-eight states impose a flat, per-gallon tax like Virginia. Other states set the tax to a percentage of the price of gas per gallon. A few states levy a combination of excise and sales taxes on gas. All told, Virginia had the 11th lowest gas excise tax in the nation at the start year, according to the API. The federal government, we should note, also collects an 18.4 cents per gallon excise tax. So it’s clear that all states tax gas. But before ruling on the governor’s claim, one question remains: If McDonnell’s plan passes, does that mean that motorists will pay zero state gas tax at Virginia pumps? The answer is no. Virginia would continue to collect an 0.6-cent-per-gallon petroleum storage tank fee that is charged in addition to the excise tax. The levy isn’t limited to gasoline -- it’s collected on most fuel sales. Unlike the excise tax, it does not support transportation. Instead, the money goes to a program, run by the Department of Environmental Quality, that reimburses qualified landowners for some of the cost to remove underground fuel storage tanks. The fund collected $3 million in November and paid out $3.4 million that month, with just under $1 million in the bank. Over 2,000 claims were pending at the end of November. Experts we consulted did not agree on whether the fee constitutes a "gasoline tax." The American Petroleum Institute counts it among "other taxes" on gasoline in its summary of state levies. Joung Lee, associate director of finance at AASHTO, said the association would consider the storage tank fee a special-purpose user fee, not a gasoline tax. He also said Virginia’s proposal would put the state in a unique position. "Our understanding is that every state has a flat per gallon excise tax for fuels and some also have a supplemental sales tax," Lee said. "Virginia’s proposal is more unique in that there have been some discussions to keep up with inflation by indexing the gas tax or converting to a sales tax on gasoline but Virginia is not just proposing a sales tax on fuel but making transportation part of the overall sales tax regime." Scott Drenkard, economist with the Tax Foundation, said it’s accurate to say that Virginia "would be the first state without a gasoline excise tax." We should also note that fuel distributors in 12 Northern Virginia localities pay a 2.1 percent sales tax on gas and other fuels. Although the levy is sanctioned by state law, the $70 million in annual revenues it produces do not go into the state budget -- they are used to help pay for mass transit systems that shuttle workers to and from Washington. McDonnell’s plan would not affect this local tax. Our ruling McDonnell said his proposal to overhaul road funding would make Virginia the first state to eliminate its gasoline tax. The governor wants replace Virginia’s 17.5-cent-a-gallon excise tax on gas with an increase in the state sales tax. His plan, if approved, would make Virginia the only state without an excise gasoline tax. His proposal would leave intact an additional 0.6-cent-a-gallon levy at Virginia pumps that goes into a fund to help landowners remove old petroleum storage tanks. Virginians would continue to pay some state gasoline tax -- 6 cents on a 10 gallon fill up. We won’t quibble about this small levy, which is not used to build roads. We rate McDonnell’s statement True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2013-01-10T15:28:28	2013-01-08	['Virginia']
pomt-06425	Says 24 million people in this country "can't find a full-time job," 50 million "can't see a doctor when they're sick," 47 million people need government help to feed themselves and 15 million families owe more than the value of their home.	true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/24/alan-grayson/alan-graysons-defense-occupy-wall-street-impassion/	Alan Grayson, an Orlando Democrat and former U.S. Representative running to reclaim a seat in 2012, emerged a big-time supporter of the Occupy Wall Street movement after appearing on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on Oct. 7, 2011. A couple of Maher's panelists, and even Maher himself, mocked the protesters for their worrisome bathroom situation, lack of media spokesperson, name choice, and proficiency (or lack thereof) in economics. Saying he was a former economist, Grayson jumped in, saying he had no problem understanding the protesters' grievances. "They're complaining about the fact that Wall Street wrecked the economy three years ago and nobody's held responsible for that," he said. "Not a single person has been indicted or convicted for destroying 20 percent of our national net worth accumulated over the course of two centuries. They're upset about the fact that Wall Street has iron control over the economic policies of this country. And that one party is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wall Street. And the other party caters to them as well. That's what they're upset about." It gets more interesting. P.J. O'Rourke, a political theorist and author, said, "Get the man a bongo drum. They've found their spokesman, okay. Take your shoes off, get a bongo drum, forget where to go to the bathroom, and it's yours." He got a few laughs. Then Grayson shot back with this: "Listen, if I am a spokesman for all the people who think we should not have 24 million people in this country who can't find a full-time job, that we should not have 50 million people in this country who can't see a doctor when they're sick, that we shouldn't have 47 million people in this country who need government help in order to feed themselves, and we shouldn't have 15 million families who owe more on their mortgage than the value of their home, okay, I'll be that spokesman." Maher's audience gave Grayson a standing ovation. His retort popped up on YouTube and then spread through Facebook and Twitter. Liberal bloggers praised him for his succinct explanation. You can see the video clip here. We decided to check Grayson's litany of claims about the economic plight of many Americans. (We previously checked a claim from Michael Moore that gets at Grayson's other major point, that no one associated with the 2008 economic collapse was arrested or indicted.) We'll take the economic claims one by one. 24 million people in this country can't find a full-time job A similar claim -- "More than 25 million Americans are unemployed" -- was presented in an article in the protester-produced Occupied Wall Street Journal, which we examined in a fact-check here. Grayson was wise to distinguish between the number of people who are "unemployed" and those who "can't find a full-time job." According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 14 million Americans were unemployed as of September 2011, which is how officials determine the unemployment rate. We pointed out in our fact-check that BLS methodology has been criticized for not expanding the definition of unemployment so that it includes people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they would rather have a full-time job. An alternative measure called the "U-6" paints that picture. As of September, an additional 2.5 million Americans were deemed "marginally attached" to the labor force, and another 9.3 million are working part time but would prefer a full-time job. That adds up to 25.8 million people. In our item, we pointed out the Occupy Wall Street Journal article described the expanded definition of unemployment, not the traditional one. Grayson's statement is a little low at 24 million but more precise in its definition. 50 million people in this country can't see a doctor when they're sick Again, this is close to what is cited by the Occupied Wall Street Journal article but is a little different. That story claimed "more than 50 million live without health insurance," and we found that they were almost exactly right. A U.S. Census Bureau study called "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010," found that 49.9 million Americans were uninsured in 2010. That's about 16 percent of the population. While Grayson's statement isn't exactly the same, his point seems clear enough to us. 47 million people in this country need government help in order to feed themselves Grayson is talking about what we know as food stamps, which has been called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program since 2008. The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds SNAP and the states administer it, sometimes by other names. The economic recession has forced more people into the program since 2008, and the numbers are climbing, according to this annual summary. In fiscal year 2008, 28.2 million people received nearly $35 billion worth of benefits. The program served 33.4 million in FY 2009 and 40.3 million in FY 2010. The most recent participation figure, for July 2011, is 45,344,946 people, with the most recent monthly allotment per household at $283.68. That enrollment figure isn't the program's highest number, but it's just 65,737 people short of the May 2011 record. "We are dealing with historic participation," said Regan Hopper, USDA Food and Nutrition Service spokeswoman. Grayson's figure is pretty close. He probably wasn't accounting for other government food programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children -- better known as WIC -- in his tally. But that USDA program provides low-income pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women, as well as infants and children up to age 5, with checks for certain kinds of food to supplement their diets. WIC served 8.9 million in July 2011, said Regan Hopper, a USDA Food and Nutrition Service spokeswoman. Further, USDA funds school lunch and breakfast programs, which provide free and reduced-price meals to some schoolchildren, and provides food and money through its Emergency Food Assistance Program to states for distribution in food banks, soup kitchens and the like. 15 million families owe more on their mortgage than the value of their home This housing phenomenon is also referred to as being "underwater" or "upside down" in mortgage payments. We asked a few companies that keep databases of mortgages and home loans, usually public records in counties, for the financial and property industries. Seattle-based Zillow.com puts the latest figure for these homes at 26.8 percent for the second quarter, which ended in June. That amounts to 15.3 million homes. It's down slightly from Zillow's first-quarter analysis, which put the number of underwater homes at 28.4 percent, or 16.2 million. We posed the same question to CoreLogic, a Sana Ana, Calif. firm. In a study released in September, CoreLogic reported that 22.5 percent of all homes with a mortgage were in "negative equity" in the same period. CoreLogic's number is roughly 5 million homes fewer than Zillow's, coming in at 10.9 million. The company found another 2.4 million borrowers at the brink of negative equity, or having less than 5 percent equity. You may have noticed some disparity with those estimates. Corelogic's data includes 48 million properties with a mortgage, accounting for more than 85 percent of all mortgages in the country. Zillow.com tries to provide an estimate for the country's total number of homes with outstanding mortgages, estimated by the U.S. Census bureau to be 50 million to 55 million. So part of the difference could lie in the 15 percent of homes CoreLogic does not cover. There are also estimation errors to consider, said Zillow.com chief economist Stan Humphries, particularly in guessing the value of homes and current outstanding loan balance. A difference of about 4 percent between the companies' estimates is not really significant, he said. "We think this is a critically important metric in understanding the housing market," he said. The point remains that economists have never seen housing values fall so low. Housing data is scant for the Great Depression, but Humphries believes the ongoing crisis outranks that period. He says Depression-era down payments were higher in the 1930s, giving folks some cushion as the crisis set in. Our ruling Grayson's defense of the Occupy Wall Street movement earned him praise from the left-wing blosophere and pundits for its pith. No pundit or official in the movement's first month had quite articulated the protesters' qualms -- high unemployment, expensive health care, poverty and underwater mortgage payments -- as Grayson did in 20 seconds on Maher's show. We examined each of his economic claims and found them accurate, point for point. We rate his claim True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2011-10-24T11:15:19	2011-10-07	['None']
pomt-09919	"Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/25/barack-obama/obama-says-medicare-and-medicaid-are-largest-defic/	During a town hall on health care, an audience member asked President Barack Obama about the cost of health care reform, and whether the government could afford to do it. Obama's answer was a variation on the sales pitch, Can you afford not to? "I think it's a very legitimate question," Obama began. "I guess that the first point I'd make is, if we don't do anything, costs are going to go out of control. Nobody disputes this. Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin." If we don't do something soon to rein in health care costs, Obama said, Medicare and Medicaid "will consume all of the federal budget." We decided to check his statement that "Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin." We consulted a number of experts, both left-leaning and right-leaning, and they agreed that over the long term, Medicare and Medicaid, along with Social Security — the programs popularly known as "entitlements" — will indeed overwhelm the federal budget and are the main drivers of the deficit. (Of the three programs, Medicare is the largest by a significant margin.) But there's also some explaining to do about Obama's statement. When he talks about Medicare and Medicaid driving the deficit, he's not talking about 2009. The 2009 deficit will be powered primarily by the economic downturn, both spending on stimulus and bailouts, and lost tax revenues from the lack of economic activity. The Bush tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the recent Medicare prescription drug benefit have also created gaps between spending and revenues in recent years. But Obama's singling out of Medicare and Medicaid is true over a much longer window of time, say, over the next 50 to 75 years. Now, that may strike you — as it did us — as too far in the future to worry about. But the economists we spoke to are definitely worried about it right now. A coalition of diverse think tanks — the Concord Coalition, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Heritage Foundation — teamed up several years ago for a "Fiscal Wake Up Tour" to alert people across the political spectrum about the poor outlook for the budget over the long term. "Unless lawmakers promptly reform Social Secu­rity, Medicare, and Medicaid, America faces a future of soaring taxes and government spending that will cause poor economic performance," wrote Brian Riedl, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, who participated in the tour. "Americans will pay onerous taxes, and future generations will have lower living standards than Americans enjoy today," he said. "The longer lawmakers wait to enact the necessary reforms, the more painful those reforms will be." How bad could things get? The nonpartisan Concord Coalition, citing data models from the Government Accountability Office, found that by 2027, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and net interest would consume all revenues collected by the federal government. By 2047, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone would consume all revenues. By 2052, the model is untenable, because the economy is in ruins. Gulp! So if Obama is right that Medicare and Medicaid are driving the deficit, then health care reform can fix the long-term deficit, right? Wrong. "We have to do everything we can on the health care side, and then certainly there's going to be even more that we have to do," said James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. "Don't assume we can wave the wand on health care reform and that will take care of everything." Obama has said many times that he wants health care reform to slow the growth of health care spending. But note the words slow the growth — that doesn't mean a reduction in overall health care spending. "Even if we significantly cut back the growth in health spending every year for the next 75 years, we still need more revenues to pay for our current obligations," said Ben Harris, a senior research associate at Brookings and the Tax Policy Center. "There's a need for a dramatic cut in spending or some way to raise more revenue, whether it's a new tax or raising an existing tax." That's where the economists disagree: Whether to cut spending or raise taxes. But we found little disagreement over the underlying problem. So going back to Obama's statement, Obama said, "Medicare and Medicaid are the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin." But we do need to add the caveat that Medicare and Medicaid growth is a long-term problem, not what's driving the deficits of this year or the next few years. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-12752	"North Carolina's teacher income is rising faster than any other state."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/feb/28/tim-moore/north-carolina-republican-leader-claims-credit-nat/	North Carolina teachers have been among the lowest-paid in the nation for the better part of a decade now. Concerns over education funding have dogged Republican politicians since they took over the state legislature in 2011. Pushing back against the criticism, N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore said he and his fellow Republicans are doing more to give teachers raises than politicians anywhere else in the country. "North Carolina's teacher income is rising faster than any other state," Moore wrote on Twitter, Facebook and in a press release earlier this month. Teacher pay debates can quickly become controversial. Local school boards are the largest employers in many of the state’s 100 counties, and the liberal N.C. Association of Educators, a teacher advocacy group, holds a great deal of political clout. When campaigning in North Carolina, politicians on both sides of the aisle tend to exaggerate claims about teacher pay. See our fact-checks of Mostly False claims by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and North Carolina’s Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper for just a few examples. Now, similar to those two claims from Democratic politicians, this time Moore takes a snippet of truth and twists it out of context to try to bolster his own party. Figuring out what years to measure It wasn’t immediately clear what Moore meant by "is rising faster." We asked if he was talking about just the most recent school year, or the entire time Republicans have been in charge of the state budget. Moore’s communications director Joseph Kyzer said it was neither. Moore was talking about the period from 2014 to 2016, Kyzer said. While none of Moore’s statements ever directly gave that time frame, his press release and website did cite several blog posts and news articles about teacher pay raises in those years. "The 2014-16 time period provided in the data the Speaker linked to covers the total teacher raises (under) Republican leadership, so it is accurate to quantify Republican pay increases over that combined period and claim NC ranks No. 1 in the U.S.," Kyzer said. So we looked at that time frame. But we didn’t stop there, because doing so would ignore half the budgets written and passed by Moore and his colleagues. Furthermore, when the N.C. GOP shared Moore’s claim in its own press release, it used the more sweeping headline "Teacher Pay in NC Under Republican Leadership" and never mentioned Moore’s timeframe. So we looked at the years Moore’s office suggested, as well as how North Carolina has done under all six years the GOP has had control of the state budget. Year-by-year In the current 2016-17 school year, the average North Carolina teacher is making just shy of $50,000. That’s about a 3.9 percent raise since last year. We don’t know if that’s the best in the country. There’s no national data yet. But it is well above the national average for the post-recession years, which has typically been below 1.5 percent. The national data for 2015-2016 is partially complete. The National Education Association, the country’s largest teacher’s union, aggregates this type of data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. NEA researcher Tim Tang said nearly half haven’t reported their 2015-2016 numbers year, so the data listed for them in that year's NEA reports is instead an inflation-based placeholder, But North Carolina is one of the 27 states we do have data for, and we don’t need the rest to know it didn’t have the nation’s fastest-rising pay in 2015-2016. The state’s 0.35 percent raise was higher than eight but lower than another 18. So once the other 24 report, North Carolina will rank somewhere between 19th and 43rd. The previous year, in 2014-2015 North Carolina did have the country’s biggest raise, at 6.2 percent. But in 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, the average North Carolina teacher’s pay dropped each year. The state’s change in pay ranked 47th or 48th all three years. So we crunched the numbers to see if that one excellent year could make up for the rest. Total during GOP control Moore’s claim clearly isn’t true if you consider the GOP’s entire record. Between 2011-2012 and 2015-2016, teacher pay increased in North Carolina by 4.5 percent. Of the 27 states that have reported for 2015-16, 10 had larger increases. And between 2011-2012 and 2014-15, when we have data from all 50 states and D.C., 21 others had larger increases than in North Carolina. Teacher pay in North Carolina rose 4.1 percent in that period. The national average was 3.6 percent and the top state, Vermont, saw teacher pay rise by 12.3 percent – triple the North Carolina rate. Moore’s chosen timeline If we consider only Moore’s cherry-picked data from 2014 on, North Carolina does appear (at least at first glance) to have the country’s fastest-growing teacher pay. In those years, North Carolina’s teacher pay rose 6.7 percent. But that’s an arbitrary selection of years that only counts years of positive growth and excludes the years when salaries actually fell. PolitiFact previously dinged President Barack Obama for similarly cherry-picking data to warp the facts, in a Half True claim about job creation. And again, we should note that we still don’t have data from 24 of the 51 states and D.C. from the 2015-16 school year. So that means while North Carolina does appear to have the fastest-rising teacher pay, 24 others could possibly surpass it. More realistically, though, five of the 24 have a reasonable chance of doing so. They are North Dakota, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Florida and the District of Columbia. Each gave about a 2 or 3 percent raise in 2013-14 and again in 2014-15. If they kept up that trend in 2015-16, they might have already surpassed North Carolina. It’s simply too soon to know. Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. Tim Moore, the N.C. House Speaker, said that "North Carolina's teacher income is rising faster than any other state." If you look at all six years Moore and his fellow Republicans have been in charge of the state budget, the claim is clearly not true. Teacher pay has risen faster in many other states. Moore said he was only counting from 2014 onward, which excludes the years teacher pay fell under GOP leadership. We frown on cherry-picking data like that. However, that data does support Moore’s claim – but only with the caveat that the data is incomplete, and some states could still feasibly overtake North Carolina. Either way, Moore has a point that the teacher pay is rising quickly in recent years. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01205	"Our median income here in Providence is the same as the median income in Mississippi."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/27/jorge-elorza/mayor-elect-jorge-elorza-says-providence-has-same-/	In the days following the Nov. 4, 2014 election, Providence Mayor-elect Jorge Elorza reflected on his priorities ahead in interviews with various media outlets. He shared one such reflection Nov. 9, with reporter Bill Rappleye on WJAR-Channel 10’s "News Conference," saying his top priority is seeking more economic justice in Providence. To make his point, he compared the city to what he referred to as the nation’s poorest state. "Our median income here in Providence is the same as the median income in Mississippi," he said. Elorza noted that Providence "is a very poor city" that lacks an adequate tax base to provide the services people want and need. We wondered whether the mayor-elect got his facts right.. We asked Elorza spokeswoman Marisa O’Gara where Elorza got his information. While waiting for her response, we plumbed U.S. Census Bureau data to see what we could find on our own. There, we learned that that the 2008-2012 American Community Survey five-year estimates placed the median household income in Providence at $38,243 and the median household income in Mississippi slightly higher, at $38,882. We also reached out to Rhode Island Kids Count and its Mississippi counterpart. The two nonprofit research groups confirmed the figures. But researchers at both agencies urged us to further differentiate between median household income and median family income. (Elorza didn’t say whether he was talking about household or family income.) The Census Bureau defines family as a group of two or more people who are related. A household, meanwhile, is defined as all the people occupying a housing unit, including family members as well as those who are unrelated. The same American Community Survey reported that the median family income in Providence was $43,378. In Mississippi, it was substantially higher, at $48,300. We also asked the state Department of Labor and Training to weigh in. Spokesman Michael Healey provided figures from its labor market information division based on Census data for 2010 through 2013. Those figures also showed the median family income in Mississippi eclipsing that in Providence for each given year. In 2013, for example, the median family income in Mississippi was $47,615, compared to $45,122 in Providence. Kids Count researchers cautioned that the five-year estimates were more reliable. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said that the median income in Providence "is the same as the median income in Mississippi." He made the comparison to illustrate how poor the capital city really is. In fact, Providence’s median income, both for households and for families, is actually lower than Mississippi’s, not equal to it. While Elorza’s comparison is slightly off, it supports his overall point. We rule his claim Mostly True.

pomt-01980	"Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/16/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-gun-homicides-are-down-49-percent-/	In the social media wars over gun control, a new social-media meme makes the case that gun violence is wildly exaggerated by the media. "Gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years. Only 12 percent of Americans know that. Tell us again how unbiased our media is," the Facebook post said. A reader sent us the posting and asked us to fact-check it. We’ll focus our attention on the claim about gun homicides, but we’ll also touch on the media question later on. Trends in gun homicide We began by looking at year-by-year statistics on gun homicides compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the meme’s language was clear about focusing on "homicides," we didn’t include statistics for suicides, gun shootings with undetermined causes, or "legal interventions," such as justified shootings by police. The most recent data is for 2010, so we went as far back as 1998 to define the 12-year period. This table summarizes what we found: Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1998 11,798 4.28 1999 10,828 3.88 2000 10,801 3.84 2001 11,348 3.98 2002 11,829 4.11 2003 11,920 4.11 2004 11,624 3.97 2005 12,352 4.18 2006 12,791 4.29 2007 12,632 4.19 2008 12,179 4.01 2009 11,493 3.75 2010 11,078 3.59 This disproves the clear wording of the meme. Over the past 12 years, the number of gun homicides is down 6 percent, and the rate of gun homicides is down 16 percent. Both are well below the 49 percent claimed in the post. However, we also found that the statistic did come from somewhere. The 49 percent decline emerged from 2013 report by the Pew Research Center. It found that gun homicides (or more specifically, the rate of gun homicides per 100,000 residents) had declined by 49 percent between their peak in 1993 and 2010, a period of 17 years. We double-checked Pew’s calculations of the CDC figures and found that they were correct. Between 1993 and 2010, the gun homicide rate fell from 7.02 per 100,000 to 3.59 per 100,000, or a decline of precisely 49 percent. Here’s the rundown of those earlier years: Year Gun homicides Gun homicides per 100,000 people 1992 17,488 6.82 1993 18,253 7.02 1994 17,527 6.66 1995 15,551 5.84 1996 14,037 5.21 1997 13,252 4.86 It’s possible to chalk this mistake up to a simple typo -- after all, if the claim had said 17 years rather than 12, it would have been correct. However, the time frame raises important issues. For one thing, the CDC data show that the big decline in gun homicides came between 1993 and 2000, which happens to coincide with the years Bill Clinton was president. While Clinton and his policies are hardly the only reason for this decline, his signing of tighter gun-control legislation makes him unpopular among the kinds of gun supporters who might have created this meme. By contrast, by framing the decline as happening over the past 12 years, the meme implies that George W. Bush -- a president much more friendly to gun-rights supporters -- can take some credit for the decline. More importantly, by making this mistake, the meme misunderstands the overall trend lines of gun homicides. Gun homicides didn’t decline 49 percent over the last 12 years -- rather, they declined precipitously over six years in the 1990s, then have remained basically stagnant for the past decade or so. Why is this important? Because the decline, to a large degree, has to do with a specific reason -- the end of the crack epidemic. The decline in gun homicides in the 1990s "was largely a reversal of an upward trend that occurred in the mid-to-late 1980s," said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. "There would not have been much of a downturn were it not for the surge. This up-and-down change was primarily in cities and among offenders under age 25, and indeed have much to do with crack markets and gang activity." In fact, the Pew study made the same point, noting that "by the early 1990s, crack markets withered in part because of lessened demand, and the vibrant national economy made it easier for even low-skilled young people to find jobs rather than get involved in crime. At the same time, a rising number of people ages 30 and older were incarcerated, due in part to stricter laws, which helped restrain violence among this age group." Fox said another reason for the decline in gun homicides overall was a specific decline in cases that involved intimate partners. After 1993, when the pro-gun-control Brady Law was passed, "there was a decline in gun homicides by women against their partners, but no decline in non-gun killings," he said. Media bias? The meme also takes a shot at the media for burying this large decline. But that’s not deserved. Just the first two pages of Google search results show articles about the Pew study appearing in the following outlets: • Associated Press • Washington Post • CNN • NPR • NBC News • Yahoo News Oh, and PolitiFact. As for the claim that "only 12 percent of Americans know that," the meme got the percentage right, though of course it got the substance of what that 12 percent knew wrong. "Despite national attention to the issue of firearm violence, most Americans are unaware that gun crime is lower today than it was two decades ago," the report said. "According to a new Pew Research Center survey, today 56 percent of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12 percent think it is lower." Our ruling The social media meme said that "gun homicide is down 49 percent in the past 12 years." The gun homicide rate is actually down by 49 percent over the past 17 years, but this seemingly minor mistake betrays a significant misunderstanding of how rates have fluctuated over the past two decades. During the past dozen years, gun homicide rates have been largely static; their big decline mostly came in the years before the meme even started counting. The meme is not just incorrect; it’s a distraction from what actually happened. We rate the claim False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-06-16T17:13:15	2014-06-16	['None']
pomt-10451	"A year ago, in March 2007, I called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market, and I laid out detailed concrete proposals for how to do so."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/01/hillary-clinton/an-early-voice-on-foreclosures/	For months, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been saying she spoke up early about the dangers of subprime mortgages and the growing problem of foreclosures. In a speech on March 24, 2008, she said that "a year ago, in March 2007, I called for immediate action to address abuses in the subprime market and I laid out detailed concrete proposals for how to do so. I warned this administration that the problems in subprime mortgages would soon spill over into regular mortgages." She has emphasized her early comments to show working-class families that she is in touch with their problems. We wondered if she was accurately describing the timing. Indeed, Clinton gave a speech on March 15, 2007 to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition in which she said "the alarm bell about the subprime home market has largely gone unnoticed by the (Bush) administration because they keep arguing we have to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy." She called for more borrowing options for lower income, minority and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and reforms to reduce foreclosures. "The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street," she said. "It is a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families." Her campaign also sent us a letter she wrote in July 2006 to the chairman and ranking Democrat on a Senate appropriations subcommittee asking them to include provisions to expand the Federal Housing Administration, which she said would help provide "a real alternative to the sub-prime and predatory lending market." Her campaign said it shows she was involved in the issue early. Sen. Barack Obama first got involved with home lending problems in February 2006 when he introduced a bill known as the STOP Fraud Act. That bill, prompted by a series in the Chicago Tribune, dealt primarily with mortgage fraud, but when he introduced the bill he noted that it "also protects the legal rights of borrowers with risky, subprime loans. The greatest growth in the mortgage lending market is in subprime loans and some have estimated that more than 2 million homeowners with subprime mortgages are at risk of losing their homes." His bill did not pass. (We should point out that in a Feb. 5, 2008 CNN interview, Clinton said she was "the only candidate left in this race on either side who has been talking about the mortgage crisis for nearly a year," which was not true. Her more recent comments don't make comparisons with her rivals and we're addressing the newer remarks.) We're not going to declare who spoke up first because the crisis evolved over many months. The evidence shows both Obama and Clinton were talking about various aspects of the issue as early as 2006, before it had ripened into a crisis. But we will rule on Clinton's claim that she spoke up in March 2007. She did and we find her statement True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-05-01T00:00:00	2008-03-24	['None']
pomt-12605	"Autopsy results from Vince Foster’s exhumed body — Cause of death to be changed!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/03/blog-posting/vince-fosters-death-has-not-been-ruled-homicide-af/	A fake news story saying former White House counsel Vince Foster’s body shows evidence that he didn’t die of a suicide is only part of a wide range of false Internet posts that won’t let rest the idea he was killed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. A March 24, 2017, story posted on Liberty-Courier.com carried the headline, "Breaking: Autopsy results from Vince Foster’s exhumed body — Cause of death to be changed!" The site, which is registered to an address in Utah, uses a name that evokes a newspaper, but is filled with fake news stories and has no immediately apparent contact information. The Foster story was flagged by Facebook users, who reported it as potentially being fake as part of the website’s efforts to push fabricated stories out of its news feeds. Foster, who was deputy counsel to President Bill Clinton and a former Arkansas law colleague of Hillary Clinton, committed suicide in 1993 at age 48, after suffering from depression. He was buried in his hometown of Hope, Ark. Conspiracy theories have raged for years that the Clintons actually had Foster killed for his knowledge of the Whitewater real estate deal or some other insight. President Donald Trump is among those who have questioned whether Foster actually committed suicide, despite five different investigations concluding he suffered a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound. The post, meanwhile, is fake, and has ended up on other fake news websites. It says that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., had ordered Foster’s body exhumed. It cited a U.S. Navy officer as saying the forensics lab at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Va., determined Foster suffered two gunshot wounds, and his death should be reclassified as a homicide. Foster’s body has not been exhumed, and there is no Naval Hospital in Norfolk — although there is a Naval Medical Center across the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, which used to be known as Naval Hospital Portsmouth. The post is accompanied by a photo that purports to be of naval forensics specialists, but actually is a handout photo from the Sacramento County (Calif.) Coroner’s Office. The story first appeared on March 22 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. Their posts often end up being repurposed by many other websites that don’t credit its origin, as is the case here. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate this story or any other post is fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." TheLastLineOfDefense.org has developed a regular cottage industry of writing about Foster’s death. The site has previously written posts that said Gowdy had Foster’s body exhumed, then that it went missing from the morgue in Norfolk, or that WikiLeaks has proof of a conspiracy surrounding Foster’s death. The assertion that Foster’s body has been dug up, autopsied again and his death ruled a homicide is completely made up. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-03897	"There's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/03/carolyn-medeiros/leader-alliance-safe-communities-says-employers-ca/	The Rhode Island General Assembly is considering legislation that would prohibit employers from asking job applicants if they have a criminal history. They could ask finalists if they have ever been in trouble with the law, but they could not deny a job because of an applicant’s criminal history, unless the crime was directly related to the type of job being sought. The measure is designed to prevent discrimination against people who have paid their debt to society. Supporters say ex-convicts who have a good job are less likely to break the law again. Carolyn Medeiros, executive director of the Alliance for Safe Communities, was on WHJJ's "Helen Glover Show" Feb. 18 to express opposition to the proposal, saying the offenders pose an extra risk to employers and the community and shouldn't get preference over job seekers who have kept out of trouble. "We're bending over backwards here for a minority of people," she said. "Think of the other things that are afforded to them, Helen. There's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond them that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses. "I think we're doing plenty to help out this population," she said. "I think we need to worry about the law-abiding citizen's fight to get a job now, and that should be at the top of our priority list." Do employers really get thousands of dollars in tax breaks and bond money for hiring convicted felons? And does the government offer special small business grants for ex-cons? We contacted Medeiros, who quickly referred us to various links on her website at ASC-RI.org. You can find them at the bottom of the "Re-entry, 'Fast and Furious Nationwide'" section of the site. We’ll start with the third part of her statement -- "there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses" -- because it’s the simplest to judge. The "Federal small business grants for convicted felons" section of her page has links to two websites. The first explicitly says, "there are no grants set up to help felons start their own business" and "Felons are at a disadvantage when they apply for grants, but that doesn't preclude them from applying." The second says exactly the same thing. So Medeiros' owns sources contradict that part of her statement. Second, let's look at her statement that "There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon." Her web page has a link to an unsourced document on the Alliance website, which, she says, came from another source. We tracked down what the document was talking about and found that employers do not, as Medeiros said, get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. Instead, employers can get a free bond -- the equivalent of an insurance policy worth $5,000 to $25,000 -- to cover the expenses of an ex-convict going rogue. The Federal Bonding Program is financed by the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by individual states. Laura Hart, spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, said $5,000 is the typical value of the seldom-used bonds given out in Rhode Island "and it is only to insure the employer against theft, not against any other kind of behavior." The employer must contact DLT after the ex-felon has been offered a job to arrange for the bond, and the potential employee must meet with DLT. "All the bonding does is provide a different level of assurance to an employer to try to reconnect this particular population to the work force. Is anybody making money off this bond? The employer isn't," Hart said. Finally, Medeiros’ claim that "there's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon" is mostly correct. She erred in characterizing it as a bond. It's a tax credit. Called the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, it is designed to encourage employers to hire people in a variety of categories, including veterans, food stamp and welfare recipients, and, most importantly for our purposes, "an individual who has been convicted of a felony and has a hiring date that is not more than 1 year after the conviction or release from prison." The credit can only be taken for the first year the ex-felon is on the job. The amount of the credit is capped at $2,400. Our ruling Carolyn Medeiros of the Alliance for Safe Communities said, "There's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses." She was mostly correct about the tax credit (although it doesn't involve a bond). But she was wrong on the other two points. Because her statement contains some element of truth but gets some critical facts wrong, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10052	The stimulus bill contains "$20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers" and "$25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/04/mike-pence/stimulus-has-money-help-fish-roaders/	In a speech on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2009, Republican Rep. Mike Pence sounded off about what's in the stimulus bill before Congress. "In legislation before the Senate this week, $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers or $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is not going to put this economy back on track," Pence said. "And, it was exactly that kind of wasteful government spending that resulted in unanimous Republican opposition last week." We wanted to check to see if the bill includes the money Pence mentioned. Some of our previous reports have shown that opponents of the bill have not been completely truthful about what's in the bill. In this case, Pence is right. The Senate report on the bill, as of this writing, includes $20 million "for the removal of small- to medium-sized fish passage barriers," which means clearing barriers in rivers and streams to allow fish migration. It's part of an overall $190 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for habitat restoration projects that "accomplish ecological goals and provide employment opportunities in the local communities." The report also says the projects can be modified to "achieve the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources." Similarly, the $25 million for recreation maintenance, "especially for rehabilitation of off-road vehicle routes," is part of an overall $135 million for the Bureau of Land Management, which includes funding for trail maintenance, remediation for environmental and public safety hazards on public lands, and habitat restoration. This passage also allows for modification for "the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources." A Democratic spokesman defended the funding when we asked about Pence's criticism. "Preserving our national parks and preserving our wildlife don't seem to be unreasonable goals," said Rob Blumenthal, a Democratic spokesman for the Senate Committee on Appropriations. "These are ready-to-go jobs that will employ American workers." The Fish and Wildlife Service said the work to remove fish barriers is "shovel ready" and includes projects like building bypasses around large dams and demolishing obsolete mill runs that date back to colonial times. "There's going to be a lot of work for local contractors," said Fish and Wildlife spokesman Chris Tollefson. "We're talking about restoring native fish runs all over the country." We'll let others decide if the projects are worthy or not. We should point out that almost any job the government pays someone to do is technically stimulating the economy by creating income and reducing unemployment, if only by the smallest amount. Also, the two projects combined account for not even 1 percent of the bill — more like .005 percent. Nevertheless, $45 million for most people is serious money. When he made his remarks, Pence had his facts straight on what was in the legislation — $20 million for fish-barrier removal and $25 million for off-road trails. We rule his statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/07a56563-3240-4087-a1bf-60b7abb63097	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-02-04T18:28:13	2009-02-03	['None']
pomt-09201	Says that in three legislative sessions, his proposals opening pre-kindergarten to all Texas 4-year-olds never got heard or voted out of committee.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/may/24/rodney-ellis/state-senator-thrice-filed-proposals-offer-pre-kin/	Some 181,000 Texas 4-year-olds were enrolled in state-backed pre-kindergarten in 2008-09, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research, making the state No. 1 in the number of 4-year-olds attending public-school pre-K. Separately, the Texas Public Policy Foundation has estimated that 85 percent of the state's 4-year-olds are in a public or private pre-K program. The pre-K program funded by the state mostly serves children whose families live at or near the federal poverty level — an eligibility limit that state Sen. Rodney Ellis wants to erase in hopes, he says, of helping more children succeed in school. A 2006 study by researchers at Texas A&M University concluded that permitting all 4-year-olds to enter high-quality, full-day pre-K classes, in public or private settings, would deliver benefits greatly exceeding costs. The study took into account factors including educational outcomes, increased future earnings and reduced child welfare, child care, justice system and crime victims' costs. Ellis, D-Houston, filed proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds in the 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions, but nothing happened, he complains. The May 14 issue of The Texas Observer quotes Ellis saying: “I’ve never gotten it out of committee or gotten a hearing.” We wondered if Ellis accurately recapped the fate of his proposals. First, some background on this issue. Like most states, Texas limits pre-K eligibility to targeted groups. For starters, children have to be at least 3 years old to qualify. Until recently, they also had to be homeless or unable to speak and comprehend English or educationally disadvantaged — a characterization based on family income. Since 1985, state law has required any district with at least 15 eligible 4-year-olds to offer half-day pre-K, which is supported by state education aid. Districts that offer full-day programs must fund them by charging parents tuition or using other resources including state early-start grants, according to a 2010 report by the House Research Organization. The state put nearly $777 million into pre-K classes in 2008-09, according to the Texas Education Agency. With an assist from Ellis's office, we confirmed from legislative records that for each of the three sessions, Ellis filed his pre-K bill and it failed to win a hearing or be voted out of committee. In 2005 and 2007, identical House measures likewise languished. Still, we wondered if that inaction reflects lawmakers' indifference to early childhood education in general, or simply the three proposals by Ellis. Has any House or Senate member succeeded in winning consideration—or adoption—of measures widening pre-K access? Texas experts on pre-K told us that in 2006 and 2007, the Legislature took steps intended to expand access. In 2006, legislators agreed to a move by Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, to allow toddler dependents of adults on active military duty into pre-K; the expansion was rolled into a measure focused on education and school property taxes, according to Ida Garcia, Van de Putte’s legislative director. In 2007, Garcia said, Van de Putte was among backers of a move to ensure pre-K eligibility for all children who had ever been in foster care became law. Previously, she said, children in foster care were permitted into pre-K classes but if they were later adopted, they could be barred. Pre-K experts noted too that legislators last year sent Gov. Rick Perry a proposal by Rep. Diane Patrick, R-Arlington, that directed $25 million to support full-day pre-K classes in school districts that adopted specific pre-K class-size limits and teacher-student ratios, among requirements. But Perry vetoed that bill, saying the money should be spent instead on existing grants enabling select districts to expand half-day classes to full-day offerings -- serving "more students with greater needs," or 21,000 more students than would have been served under the vetoed proposal, the governor said. So how does Ellis’ statement shake out? He’s right that his proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds never drew a hearing or advanced from committee. But a few efforts to expand eligibility for — or enhance — pre-K offerings have succeeded or won wide consideration. We rate his statement as Mostly True.

pomt-00159	In California, "they're rioting now" over sanctuary cities.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/23/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-about-people-riotin/	Down the stretch in the midterm elections, President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric over immigration. For instance, during an Oct. 20 rally in Elko, Nev., he criticized "sanctuary cities," a somewhat fuzzy term that refers to localities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. "I don't think we like sanctuary cities up here," Trump told the crowd in Nevada. "By the way, a lot of people in California don't want them, either. They're rioting now. They want to get out of their sanctuary cities." Is it really the case that in California, "they're rioting now" over sanctuary cities? We found no evidence of it. The White House did not respond to a request for evidence for this article, and Trump himself sidestepped an opportunity to cite specific evidence during remarks to journalists boarding Marine One at the White House on Oct. 22: Reporter: "Hey, Mr. President, you said Californians were rioting over the sanctuary cities. Where?" Trump: "You shouldn’t have — take a look. They want to get out of sanctuary cities. Many places in California want to get out of sanctuary cities." Reporter: "But that's not rioting, sir, right?" Trump: "Yeah, it is rioting in some cases." Reporter: "Where are the riots, sir?" At that point in the media availability, Trump turned to an unrelated question. It’s worth noting that there is no broad consensus on the question of whether sanctuary cities are good policy. A June 2018 Gallup poll found that 50 percent of those surveyed favored "banning sanctuary cities," while 46 percent opposed a ban. And a March 2018 CBS News poll found that 48 percent favored leaving immigration enforcement policy up to the locality, compared to 47 percent who said localities should be forced to comply with federal authorities. (As we’ve written, the wording of poll questions can make a significant difference on how people answer these questions.) And the battle has moved to the courts. In addition to stepping up efforts to get cities to cooperate with federal officials, the Trump administration sued California over its sanctuary law. The populous and historically Republican Orange County in suburban Los Angeles moved to join the lawsuit against the state. However, the existence of discontent in some quarters doesn’t mean that riots are under way, or were recently. We found nothing of the sort in Google searches, and officials from California who would be in a position to know said there was nothing to Trump’s assertion. "Short answer: no," said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for California’s Democratic governor, Jerry Brown. Jonathan Muñoz, a legislative assistant with the California Police Chiefs Association, agreed. "The California Police Chiefs Association is unaware of any riots taking place as a result of the state’s sanctuary city policy," Muñoz said. "What we do know is that some cities are challenging the policy in court, but that’s as far as anyone has gone to my knowledge." Our ruling Trump said that in California, "they're rioting now" over sanctuary cities. There is no evidence to support that assertion. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12342	"It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/14/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-cites-longstanding-policy-deflect-se/	Democratic senators skewered Attorney General Jeff Sessions for refusing to answer their questions about his private conversations with President Donald Trump during a June 13 hearing about Sessions’ role in the controversy over Russia and the election. Sessions said Trump hadn’t invoked executive privilege, which presidents can use to prevent the compelled disclosure of private executive branch communications and deliberations. Instead, Sessions cited "longstanding" Justice Department policy as his reason for declining to comment. "It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States, for confidential reasons that, really, are founded in the coequal branch powers in the Constitution of the United States," Sessions said. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked Sessions if this policy is in writing somewhere. "I think so," he replied. So we asked the Justice Department where this policy was written down. Spokesman Ian Prior sent us two memos about executive privilege written in 1982, as well as a 2009 memo based on the rationale laid out in the 1982 documents. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Based on Sessions’ testimony, we were looking for the memos to say that an attorney general should not comment on conversations he or she has had with a president or top White House officials, full stop. But that’s not exactly what the memos say. They acknowledge that the executive branch has an expectation that its communications remain confidential, so they guide the attorney general to consult with the White House counsel about congressional information requests involving White House communications. Then, the president can decide whether to invoke executive privilege to keep those communications confidential if necessary. In his testimony, Sessions said he didn’t want to answer certain questions without first giving Trump the opportunity to decide whether it would be appropriate to share that information with Congress or keep it confidential. "It would be premature for me to deny the president a full and intelligent choice about executive privilege," Sessions said. "It is improper for agents of any of the department (or) any departments in the executive branch to waive that privilege without a clear approval of the president," he added later. This rationale — that Sessions needs to talk with the president first before commenting — seems to be in line with the 1982 and 2009 memos. "Congressional requests for information shall be complied with as promptly and fully as possible, unless it is determined that compliance raises a substantial question of executive privilege," says one of the 1982 memos, which President Ronald Reagan issued to the heads of executive branch departments and agencies. However, it’s important to consider that many of the questions Sessions declined to answer were ones that he could have predicted, given the topic of the hearing, noted Duke University law professor Lisa Kern Griffin, an expert in dishonesty and the law. Sessions deflected questions about details of his conversations with Trump about the Russia investigation or the firing of FBI director James Comey. So Sessions could have asked Trump in advance of the hearing whether an executive privilege invocation would be appropriate. "Basically (Sessions) is trying to gain the benefits of claiming executive privilege without its political or legal consequences," said Heidi Kitrosser, an expert in government transparency and professor at the University of Minnesota. To fully abide with the policies outlined in the Justice Department memos, Sessions should have made it clear that he planned to consult with Trump about the questions Congress asked him, Kitrosser added. If Sessions continues to refuse to answer Congress’ questions, and Trump doesn’t invoke executive privilege, Congress could ultimately hold him in contempt or impeach him, said Jamal Greene, a constitutional law professor at Columbia University. "That remedy is, however, highly unlikely," he said. Interestingly, in his former life as a senator, Sessions asked Attorney General Eric Holder about his private conversations with President Barack Obama during a congressional hearing in January 2014. (Bloomberg View Executive Editor Tim O’Brien uncovered this example.) "Did he consult with you before he made that statement?" Sessions asked, during a January 2014 hearing, regarding a comment President Barack Obama made to the New Yorker about marijuana. "No, we didn't talk about that," Holder replied. This exchange between Holder and Sessions doesn’t automatically refute Sessions’ reasoning, however. We don’t know if Obama cleared Holder to talk about their conversations about marijuana legalization, or if Holder didn’t think his statement raised a substantial question of executive privilege. In 2012, Congress held Holder in contempt for refusing to provide records related to the Fast and Furious scandal. The Obama White House had invoked executive privilege in that case, though a federal judge rejected that decision in 2016. Our ruling Sessions said, "It's a longstanding policy of the Department of Justice not to comment on conversations that the attorney general has had with the president of the United States." The Justice Department provided us with memos from 1982 and 2009 about executive privilege. They do not say outright that attorneys general can’t ever comment on conversations with the president. However, they do guide the attorney general to consult with the White House before responding to congressional inquiries that may involve confidential communications with the president. This is the rationale Sessions invoked later in his testimony. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-08594	Says Ron Wyden spent $2 million "to study exotic ants."	false	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/jim-huffman/jim-huffman-attacks-ron-wyden-spending-2-million-s/	It’s a popular theme among Republicans this year: Democrats are shoving the nation into endless debt with irresponsible spending -- mostly because of the stimulus. And what better way to illustrate this profligate spending than ... ant research? Yep. Ant research. And what’s worse, it’s not research on your run-of-the-mill picnic-destroying ant. It’s exotic ant research. Republican Senate hopeful Jim Huffman took a page out of Arizona Sen. John McCain’s book, dinging Democratic incumbent Sen. Ron Wyden in a recent television ad for voting to fund a study of exotic ants. After an ominous intro about Oregon’s unemployment rate and the growing national debt, the ad takes its entomological turn: "Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants," a man says to his wife, while shaking his head. "And you thought he was out of touch." So does Wyden have a thing for ants or is Huffman making a mountain out of an anthill? Well, before we get into all that, let’s take a look at how, exactly, ants found their way into our political picnic in the first place. Back in August 2010, Sens. McCain and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., released a list their top "100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues." On Page 6, the Republican senators take aim at a favorite target, San Francisco, and a $1.9 million ant research project based out of the California Academy of Sciences. In short order, this bit of stimulus spending then found its way into the California Senate race and into the political discourse down in Texas. So how does it relate to Oregon’s Senate race? Wyden did, indeed, vote in favor of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, along with 60 other senators (including three Republicans and two Independents). But that vote, it turns out, didn’t release any money to ant research -- not directly. The federal stimulus gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009, according to the foundation’s Website. The foundation is distributing the money using the same peer-review process with which it normally decides on which research to fund. As it turns out, one scientist’s study on ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project’s leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed. "I think it’s legitimate," he said. "There’s no reason why people shouldn’t challenge this and question what we’re doing." What exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense. Ants, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. "You can’t monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them," he said. "Without them, we wouldn’t have a functioning ecosystem." It’s also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher’s last count. At Politifact Oregon, we think it would be fair to say that Wyden’s vote did eventually lead to the funding of a study of exotic ants. But it happened in such a roundabout way that Huffman’s claim that "Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants" is disingenuous. Wyden voted for a bill that, despite being thousands and thousands of words long never mentions the word "ants." Instead it directed more money to the National Science Foundation, which then distributed the funds as it saw fit. PolitiFact Oregon rates the claim False. Comment on this item.

pomt-06726	In Afghanistan, "it is very, very rare that someone who is killed in action is not killed by an" improvised explosive device, or IED.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/30/bob-casey/bob-casey-says-non-ied-deaths-afghanistan-are-very/	Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., visited Pakistan in late August 2011 -- the deadliest month so far of the war in neighboring Afghanistan, with 66 U.S. servicemembers killed through late August. During a media conference call to discuss his trip, Casey noted that improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, are one of the major the reasons for the death toll in Afghanistan, where U.S. forces and their allies, have been involved for almost a decade. First, some background. IEDs can be made from easy-to-obtain components, such as batteries, cell phones and radios, yet they create blasts that are often deadly. This makes them a key weapon of insurgents, including those in Afghanistan. They are often planted along roadsides and either detonated directly by passing U.S. vehicles or remotely by insurgents. They can also be carried by suicide bombers. A wire service story by the French news agency Agence France Press said that during Casey’s conference call, the senator said he had pressed the Pakistani government to reduce the flow of ammonium nitrate -- a component of explosives that can be used in IEDs -- into neighboring Afghanistan. "They have not implemented a strategy yet, and ... that's one of the reasons I'm over here," Casey said on the call. He added, "I think we made real progress impressing upon the Pakistani leadership our sense of urgency to get results on this strategy to reduce the flow of ammonium nitrate into Afghanistan." One statistic Casey used in the conversation caught the attention of a PolitiFact reader, who asked us to check it. "It is very, very rare that someone who is killed in action is not killed by an IED," Casey said, according to the Agence France Presse account. "And that's why we've got to take steps to focus intensively on a strategy against this kind of explosive device and the main ingredient in that explosive device.’ We wondered whether non-IED deaths in Afghanistan are in fact "very, very rare." We found a report issued by the Brookings Institution titled, "Afghanistan Index: Tracking Variables of Reconstruction & Security in Post-9/11 Afghanistan." Using the data, we were able to determine the annual totals for U.S. deaths caused by IEDs in Afghanistan, the total "hostile" deaths in Afghanistan and, ultimately, the percentage of hostile deaths that were caused by IEDs. The numbers are based in part on totals compiled by an independent monitoring organization called iCasualties.org. (Here’s some background about iCasualties.org and the use of its data by media outlets.) 2001: 0 IED deaths, 6 total hostile deaths, 0 percent 2002: 5 IED deaths, 41 total hostile deaths, 12 percent 2003: 1 IED death, 32 total hostile deaths, 3 percent 2004: 12 IED deaths, 29 total hostile deaths, 41 percent 2005: 18 IED deaths, 82 total hostile deaths, 22 percent 2006: 27 IED deaths, 86 total hostile deaths, 32 percent 2007: 33 IED deaths, 92 total hostile deaths, 36 percent 2008: 84 IED deaths, 135 total hostile deaths, 62 percent 2009: 142 IED deaths, 277 total hostile deaths, 51 percent 2010: 257 IED deaths, 465 total hostile deaths, 55 percent 2011 (through July 31): 112 IED deaths, 210 total hostile deaths, 53 percent We also asked the Pentagon for the official statistics, and they provided them. The two data sets differ for varying technical reasons, but the overall pattern is similar: 2001: 3 IED deaths, 3 killed in action, 100 percent 2002: 6 IED deaths, 18 killed in action, 33 percent 2003: 1 IED deaths, 17 killed in action, 6 percent 2004: 14 IED deaths, 25 killed in action, 56 percent 2005: 23 IED deaths, 66 killed in action, 35 percent 2006: 32 IED deaths, 65 killed in action, 49 percent 2007: 34 IED deaths, 83 killed in action, 41 percent 2008: 68 IED deaths, 132 killed in action, 52 percent 2009: 168 IED deaths, 271 killed in action, 62 percent 2010: 268 IED deaths, 437 killed in action, 61 percent 2011 (partial year): 102 IED deaths, 202 killed in action, 50 percent By either set of numbers, IED deaths account for the largest share of U.S. in-action deaths in Afghanistan -- a large enough share to have inspired the Pentagon to establish the Joint IED Defeat Organization, created to spearhead efforts to defeat the weapon. But Casey went too far when he described non-IED deaths as "very, very rare." Over the past four years, non-IED deaths have ranged between 38 percent and 50 percent of hostile deaths. In 2010, according to the Brookings report, the other causes of hostile deaths, in declining order, were miscellaneous hostile fire (35 percent); helicopter losses (4 percent); mortars, rocket propelled grenades and rockets (3 percent); and suicide bombs (2 percent). And while the absolute number of IED deaths has spiked, they have actually declined slightly as a proportion of all deaths since 2009. "Technically, (Casey is) pretty wrong," said Michael O’Hanlon, the Brookings Institution senior fellow who coauthored the report. "The data does not support Casey’s assertion at all," agreed Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies and senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security. April Mellody, a spokeswoman for Casey, said the senator has made IEDs one of his major issues on Capitol Hill for years. She added that Casey was speaking off the cuff on a conference call and prefaced his comment by talking about battle deaths among his Pennsylvania constituents. "Many of you know in Pennsylvania we have a total of 78 killed in action in Afghanistan," Casey said on the conference call in dialogue not included in the Agence France Presse article. "I literally cannot remember the last time I read about … one of our servicemen and women killed who was not killed by an IED. It is very, very rare that someone who is killed in action is not killed by an IED." Mellody said that "while the transcript makes clear that the intent was to convey the sense that you rarely hear of someone killed in action that was not killed by IED, the overarching point is that the majority of servicemen and women killed in action are killed by IEDs. I don’t think that’s disputable." Our ruling We agree in the accuracy of Casey’s underlying point that IEDs pose a special danger to troops in Afghanistan. However, we think it’s important to correct the record for those who may have been misled by the specific statistic he cited. We think most people would consider 38 percent to 50 percent of hostile deaths to be something more than a "very, very rare" occurrence. So we rate Casey’s comment Mostly False.

pomt-10705	"No, I did not (have illegal immigrants working at his mansion)."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/28/mitt-romney/hired-help-haunts-romney/	Fending off an attack by Romney that implied he was soft on illegal immigration, Rudy Giuliani asked the former Massachusetts governor: "You did have illegal immigrants working at your mansion, didn't you?" Romney's response was a flat, "No, I did not." Oooops. Romney did amend that statement with a vague ramble that homeowners shouldn't have to ask for the papers of anyone with a funny accent who is working on their house. But he never corrected or clarified his initial response, which is barely true. It's not as if Romney was caught off guard. Giuliani has leveled this charge before. It's good opposition research that comes courtesy of the Boston Globe. It broke the story about Romney's hired help late last year. The newspaper sent a team of reporters to Guatemala after getting a tip that Romney had hired a landscaping company notorious for using illegal immigrants. Reporters tracked down three former landscapers who claimed to have been in the United States illegally when they worked on Romney's lawn. One of the workers, Rene Alvarez Rosales, said he worked for Romney eight years landscaping his lawn, occasionally getting a "buenos dias" from Romney himself. Others told the Globe of casual encounters with Romney over the years, during which he had never inquired about their status. The Globe said Romney, for an entire decade, used a landscaping company that relied on illegal Guatemalan immigrants. Employees at the company, Community Lawn Service with a Heart, said its owner hadn't asked them to provide documents showing their immigration status. The workers said they were paid $9 to $10 an hour, in cash, for working sometimes 11 hours a day. When confronted by Globe reporters about the landscapers, Romney replied, "Aw geez," and walked away. Several hours later, the Globe said, a spokesman issued a statement that the governor knows nothing about the immigration status of the landscaping workers, and that his dealings were with owner of the company, who is a legal immigrant from Colombia. The owner of the company told the Globe that Romney never asked him about the status of the workers. A day after the Globe story, the Los Angeles Times followed up. This time, a Romney spokesman said "Gov. Romney has no information or knowledge to corroborate the Globe's allegations. He hired a legitimate lawn service company and he knows the owner as a decent, hardworking person who is a legal resident." Later, the standard reply from Romney's campaign didn't even contest that the landscaping company working on his lawn had hired illegal immigrants. Rather, the campaign draws a distinction between the company and its employees. "Governor Romney hired a company, not the individuals who were not of legal status," Romney's spokesman, Kevin Madden, told the McClatchy-Tribune News Service in November. "The owner of the company was a legal immigrant who claimed that workers were legal, though he did not request documentation." Considering Romney's forceful rhetoric on illegal immigrants, this explanation hasn't satisfied his opponents. Since April, the Democratic National Committee has hammered Romney with frequent citations of the Globe article. Even nice guy Mike Huckabee has joined Giuliani, piling on after Romney criticized him over his plans to offer tuition breaks for children of illegal immigrants while serving as governor in Arkansas. Huckabee, appearing on Fox News Channel, said, "I guess Mitt Romney would rather keep people out of college so they can keep working on his lawn." Romney's "I did not" statement racks up a barely true on the Truth-O-Meter. We cut him a little slack for doing what most Americans would do and rely on the legal status of the company hired to do the job. But he could have scored even better if he had at least spoken about his own situation, rather than speaking in general terms about the pitfalls of finding good legal help. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11249	"In seven years that (nuclear) deal will have expired, and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-wrongly-iran-nuclear-deal-expire/	President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to continue waiving sanctions against Iran under the 2015 agreement that rolled back the country’s nuclear program. At an April 30 press conference, Trump said pulling out of the deal would send the right message on American policy. "In seven years that deal will have expired, and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons," Trump said. "That's not acceptable. Seven years is tomorrow. That's not acceptable." Trump is incorrect about the expiration date. The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, puts a cap on enriched uranium until 2030, or 12 years from now. After that, other agreements limit nuclear weapons development in Iran. A focus on fuel A full nuclear weapons program needs fuel for a bomb, a warhead, and a way to deliver the warhead, such as a missile or a plane. "By far the most important and the most difficult step is producing the fuel," said Matthew Kroenig at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. "That’s why the Obama administration wanted to limit Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium. And it’s why it was so important to Iran to have the limits end after 15 years." Under the deal, Iran gave up 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium. It also lost 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, the machines used to enrich uranium, and it agreed to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years. For plutonium, the other possible fuel for a nuclear bomb, the agreement bans plutonium reactors for 15 years and stipulates that Iran must dismantle its current one. The White House pointed to an Associated Press article about a confidential side agreement that, according to the article, allows Iran to "install centrifuges up to five times as efficient as the 5,060 machines it is now restricted to using." That would kick in at Year 11, or 2026. The article warned that this could reduce the time needed to produce weapons-grade uranium after the deal expired. The White House also noted a Brookings Institution summary that said that after 2025, Iran could "test large numbers of, and conduct enrichment R&D with, advanced centrifuges," and get a space ready for running the most advanced centrifuge after 2030. So starting seven years from now, Iran could begin developing and then using better centrifuges. However, both of those sources noted that for 15 years, Iran could not have more than 300 kg (660 pounds) of low-enriched uranium, well below the amount experts agree is needed to make a single bomb. Why does the cap matter? Because even as Iran installed more efficient centrifuges, it could not end up with more enriched uranium than is permitted. The agreement spells out various ways to make that happen, either by diluting the uranium or sending it out of the country under international controls. The Arms Control Association, a group that supports the Iran deal, produced this timeline. The gray bars at the top show the changes in the centrifuge rules at the 10-year mark, and the limits on enriched uranium through the 15-year mark. Building a bomb Trump said that in seven years Iran would be free to build nuclear weapons. But under the agreement and the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran agreed on paper at least that it would never build a nuclear weapon. Formally, it would not be free to do as it pleases. "Some of the terms last forever," said nuclear arms expert Matthew Bunn at Harvard’s Kennedy School. "The deal prohibits Iran forever from the key activities of a nuclear weapon design and manufacture program — experimenting with the relevant types of explosives, doing the relevant neutron modeling, and so on." Bunn added: "And Iran’s acceptance of the broader inspections called for in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Additional Protocol also lasts indefinitely." The Additional Protocol improves international oversight of nuclear fuel, from when it is mined to when it becomes waste, and allows broader inspections, such as collecting environmental samples at any location to detect radioactive materials. Plus, many activities have to be approved by a commission that oversees the agreement. The deal does have one element that clearly ends at the 10-year mark. If Iran fully complies with the deal for a decade, the U.N. Security Council’s resolutions on Iran’s nuclear program come to an end. That is called Termination Day. The agreement itself continues in force, but the United Nations no longer has Iran’s nuclear program on its docket. The White House noted this clause. Our ruling Trump said that the Iran nuclear deal expires in seven years and after that, Iran is free to develop a nuclear weapon. The agreement’s limits on enriched uranium last for another 12 years. While some restrictions ease after seven years, the key elements that prevent Iran from enriching the uranium needed for a bomb remain until 2030. In addition, certain terms last forever, including the prohibition on ever designing or making a nuclear weapon, and remaining under the eye of international inspectors. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01430	The Islamic State is so small it "couldn't fill a Double A ballpark in Charleston, W. Va."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/07/ben-affleck/ben-afflecks-claim-isis-couldnt-fill-double-ball-p/	Ben Affleck is in the news for more reasons than new thriller Gone Girl. The activist-actor’s defense of Islam in a confrontational appearance on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher is generating headlines of its own. Maher argued in two recent shows that the beliefs and actions of Islamic State, while widely decried as extreme, are not all that different from the core tenets of Islam practiced by Muslims around the world. Affleck called that an unfair generalization of Muslims, which number about 1.6 billion people and represent the world’s second-largest religion. Affleck then used a tongue-in-cheek comparison to speak to the size of the Islamic State versus the number of Muslims worldwide. "ISIS couldn't fill a Double A ballpark in Charleston, W. Va.," Affleck said. It’s clear Affleck’s comment was at least partially intended to draw laughs, but he used it to strengthen his argument that the number of Islamic State fighters pales in comparison to the Muslim population overall. That’s worth a second look. So for this fact-check, we wanted to learn what we could find out about the size of the Islamic State and see how it stacks up to the seating capacity of the minor league baseball team he had in mind. The size of the Islamic State The U.S. government has had a hard time pinning down the precise number of jihadist fighters within the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL. Part of the problem is the group has grown quickly as it has captured more ground in Syria and Iraq. Over the summer, it was widely reported that the U.S. government estimated about 10,000 fighters in the al-Qaida-linked group. In September, the CIA more than doubled the group’s estimated size to between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters. In a statement to PunditFact, the CIA public affairs office explained the figure is based on intelligence reports collected from May to August. The CIA attributes the growth to "stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate, greater battlefield activity, and additional intelligence." At least 2,000 of the fighters reportedly have Western passports, too. Non-U.S. reports say the Islamic State is potentially much larger. RT, the Russian government-sponsored English news organization, quoted an Iraqi intelligence adviser as saying the Islamic State numbered 100,000 in August. Al Jazeera reported that the Islamic State had an army of 50,000 troops in August. A Kurdish security official told 60 Minutes in September there were 40,000 Islamic State fighters. It’s hard to say which estimate is the best, but we think using the U.S. figure is certainly defensible, given that the other estimates do not come from named or official government sources. So would ISIS members fail to fill the "Double A ballpark" in Charleston, W. Va., that Affleck had in mind? The West Virginia Power Affleck’s example of a small-scale baseball stadium is not a hypothetical. There is indeed a minor league team in Charleston. The city is home to the West Virginia Power, a Class A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates since 2009. The Power plays at Appalachian Power Park, which has a maximum seating capacity of 4,500 for baseball games, said Adam Marco, the team’s radio broadcaster and marketing director. The park could hold up to 11,000 people for charity events and concerts that would allow people onto the field, he said. So, assuming Affleck meant stadium seats, even the lowest estimate of Islamic State fighters would be way too much for the stadium. The story for Double A teams, which is what Affleck said even though the West Virginia is Class A, is no different. The largest Double A team stadium belongs to the Jacksonville Suns, which can hold 11,000 fans, said Minor League Baseball spokeswoman Mary Marandi. Curious, we asked Marco why he thought Affleck, a rabid Boston Red Sox fan, would allude to the West Virginia Power on TV. His theory: Affleck’s wife, actress Jennifer Garner, grew up in Charleston. "I know Jennifer was at a game this past summer," Marco said. "But in my five years here, I can’t say that I’ve seen him at a game. But that’s not to say it hasn't happened." Our ruling Affleck said, "ISIS couldn't fill a Double A ballpark in Charleston, W. Va." It’s not every day we consult the CIA and a minor league baseball team for the same fact-check (of an Oscar-winning actor), but here’s what we found: The minor league stadium in question would not provide enough seating room for Islamic State fighters, even when using the U.S. government’s outdated, low estimate of 10,000. The CIA now uses a much higher estimate of 20,000-31,500 fighters, and other reports indicate it could be even higher. The Islamic State is small, but not Double A-baseball park small. We rate Affleck’s claim False.	None	Ben Affleck	None	None	None	2014-10-07T17:09:27	2014-10-03	['None']
pomt-12857	"Wall Street comes out en masse with its money against House Democrats every election."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/01/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-overstates-wall-street-refusal-support-demo/	During a town hall televised on CNN, an audience member said to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that Wall Street tends to support Democrats these days -- a belief that irritated the "Reagan Democrats" who work alongside him at a steel mill in the industrial Midwest. Pelosi was incredulous. "They don’t support me!" Pelosi said to laughter. She proceeded to thank the questioner and added that it’s a "challenge" to overcome the perception that the Democrats are captive to Wall Street. "When you said, ‘Wall Street,’ I'm like, no -- Wall Street comes out en masse with its money against House Democrats every election," Pelosi said. Is Pelosi correct about Wall Street giving patterns to House Democrats and Republicans? Partly, but she leaves out some important context. We turned to the opensecrets.org website of the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign-finance data. The group compiles donation data by industry sector, so we looked at the category "securities and investment." We looked specifically at dollars from PACs and individuals employed in the securities and investment sector that were given to Republican and Democratic House members. Here’s the rundown going back to 1990, the earliest year available in the database. Election cycle To Democrats To Republicans More money given to Incumbent majority party 2016 $11.3 million $18.6 million R R 2014 $11.3 million $18.0 million R R 2012 $9.2 million $17.1 million R R 2010 $13.7 million $10.0 million D D 2008 $13.0 million $8.2 million D D 2006 $8.1 million $9.6 million R R 2004 $6.9 million $8.9 million R R 2002 $3.9 million $5.6 million R R 2000 $4.4 million $7.4 million R R 1998 $2.5 million $3.5 million R R 1996 $2.9 million $3.8 million R R 1994 $3.2 million $1.6 million D D 1992 $3.1 million $1.3 million D D 1990 $2.4 million $1.3 million D D We see two key takeaways. One of them supports Pelosi’s statement; the other doesn’t. The one that supports Pelosi’s statement is that the Republicans have received a majority of securities and investment money for three election cycles running, at a rate 60 percent to 80 percent higher than Democrats received. The one that doesn’t support her statement is that Wall Street fealty to the GOP is not preordained. The unshakeable pattern going back to 1990 is that the securities and investment sector has given to whichever party is holding the majority in the House at the beginning of the election cycle. Recently, that’s been the Republicans -- but for five previous cycles, that’s been the Democrats, including two when Pelosi herself served as speaker. In other words, contrary to Pelosi’s implication, Wall Street doesn’t have a firm ideological or partisan allegiance to the GOP. Rather, it has hedged its bets by disproportionately sending its money to whichever party holds the reins of power. Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist said it does seem like Wall Street has tended to support whatever party is in charge in the House. He dated that patten back to at least the 1980s, when then-Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., headed of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats’ campaign arm. In that position, Coelho "made a concerted, and highly successful, effort to attract far more business money to the Democrats," Loomis said. "One of his major talking points was that since the Democrats were going to run the House for the foreseeable future, business would be smart to support and invest in the majority party." Loomis added that Coelho’s strategy worked until the election of 1994 -- when the GOP won control of the House for the first time in four decades. We’ll note that not all sectors have swung back and forth the way Wall Street has. For instance, for lawyers and labor unions, donations to Democrats have easily outpaced donations to Republicans in every campaign cycle going back to 1990. By contrast, donations from agribusiness and construction have been majority-Republican every cycle over the same period. For these industries, then, ideology or partisanship seems to play a bigger role in political giving than it does for Wall Street. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, said the minority leader "was referring to her own experience in fundraising since becoming part of leadership in 2002. She does a tremendous amount of fundraising from grassroots and individuals donors on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and that’s what she was referring to in response to the question at the town hall." The data cited above includes money given to every member of the House. Our ruling Pelosi said, "Wall Street comes out en masse with its money against House Democrats every election." She has something of a point if you only consider the last three election cycles. However, it’s important to note that in each of those cycles, the Republicans have held the majority in the House. When the Democrats were in control -- including two cycles in which Pelosi herself was speaker -- Wall Street has sent the majority of its money to House Democrats. We rate her statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e8ed9669-bedf-4eef-8ef4-1ac4bc87f869	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2017-02-01T16:15:43	2017-01-31	['None']
pomt-13726	"Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining- then a small one. Pathetic."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/donald-trump/dnc-flag-missing-controversy/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump noticed something on the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. No American flags. "Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic," Trump tweeted July 27, 2016. Trump said the Democrats caved and added flags after he and others noticed. Is that true? Well, there is some evidence to the fact. A false flag? Some people noticed the flag missing during the first day of the convention on July 25, 2016. The conservative Daily Caller wrote "No Visible American Flags Present At The Democrat Convention." "The Daily Caller is at the Democratic National Convention Monday and it doesn’t look like there are any American flags. The stage is bland and grey, with no red, white or blue present. A thorough look at the crowd present also turns up no American flags," the website wrote. Some went further, saying the flag actually was banned at the DNC. That particular viral image is bogus, there is no ban. But what about Trump’s more-tempered claim that there was "not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention"? Capture the flag We’re here at the DNC and have seen American flags at the Wells Fargo Center. The issue -- to the extent that Trump and others are making it an issue -- surrounds the stage that Democrats built in Philadelphia. The stage includes huge video boards that serve as the main visual element for delegates in the arena and viewers on TV back at home. One of our editors, Amy Hollyfield, snapped this photo before the convention opened July 25, 2016. It shows the set-up we described … and sizable virtual American flags on the video board. Hard to miss the flag there. But where Trump and some people may have a point is that there did not appear to be physical flags on the stage during the first night of the convention. A physical flag did appear during the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem. You can see it, if you don’t believe us, at 31 minutes into this video of the convention’s proceedings. But when the color guard left, so did the physical flag. Flags appear! Trump also has a point that flags were added to the stage, starting with the second day of the convention July 26, 2016. But it wasn’t just one, and they weren’t necessarily small. Here’s a pre-flag photo from Bernie Sanders’ speech on the first night of the convention, taken by Stephen Crowley of the New York Times. And here’s a photo from Ruth Fremson of the New York Times from the next night. It may be hard to see, but the DNC did add a series of flags along the edge of the stage. You can see them in the shadows in the righthand side of the photo. Here’s a better view. This photo was taken by Stephen Crowley, also of the New York Times. We asked DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda why flags were added to the stage Tuesday (and why they weren’t there Monday). If we hear back, we’ll let you know. We also reached out to the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said on Twitter, "Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic." A huge video board prominently displayed the American flag during the first day. The proof is in the photos. And a physical flag made an appearance during the National Anthem. But Trump has a point that physical flags (plural) appear to have been added to the stage for the second day of the Democratic National Convention, after some stories reported the lack of flags. Trump is partially accurate. We rate the claim Half True. Update: After we published, and thanks to a reader, we came across photos from the day before the convention, July 24, that showed flags on the wings of the stage. Here is a photo of the flags from Josh Haner of the New York Times: So the flags were in place before the convention started and removed for the first day ... but reappeared on July 26. We still haven't heard back from the DNC explaining what happened. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e8e3eb1-ed26-4a7c-95e7-20a6725bd03b	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-27T14:40:21	2016-07-27	['United_States', 'Democratic_National_Convention']
pomt-08381	Charlie Crist "attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago, (when) he was running in the Republican primary."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/24/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-fires-back-charlie-crist-attacks/	One of the most prevalent attacks against Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is that he abandoned the Republican Party and decided to run for the U.S. Senate as a no-party candidate out of political expediency and nothing more. He heard it from both Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek in their Oct. 24, 2010, debate on CNN. But Crist countered that his decision had more to do with a far-right shift in the Republican Party. "The Republican Party and the right wing of that party went so far right. It's exactly why Marco Rubio stayed there (and) it's exactly the same reason that I left," Crist said. "He wants to overturn -- listen to me, women watching -- overturn Roe v. Wade. He does not support stem cell research. You know, these are extreme views that I am not comfortable with." The line produced one of many heated exchanges between Rubio and Crist. Rubio, in his rebuttal, tried to point out Crist's hypocrisies. "We don't need to go down the long and torturous road of the governor's change on positions and so forth. That's been well-documented," Rubio said. "I mean, I do think it's curious that he attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago, (when) he was running in the Republican primary and we were debating together on Fox News." We previously have analyzed Crist's flip-flopping on things like oil drilling, the federal health care bill and even a controversial education bill that Crist vetoed in 2010. But what struck us in this case was that Rubio not only accused Crist of flipping on issues, but then brazenly criticizing Rubio for positions Crist himself held not too long ago. Our gameplan is to start the search where Rubio suggested, a Fox News debate back on March 28, 2010. But we also think it's fair to at least examine other Crist attacks that didn't come up in the March Fox debate. Looking back at Crist-R, circa March 2010 Much of the Fox debate, moderated by Chris Wallace, focused on Crist and Rubio arguing about Rubio's personal finances. (Some things never change). But when it came to policy issues, the debate largely covered four topics -- jobs and the economy, Social Security, health care and immigration. What we found might actually surprise you -- Crist's statements then and now are very consistent. Both in March and this month, he said he would support the idea of raising the eligibility age for Social Security. Then and now, he said he supported the federal stimulus program. Then there's his answers on immigration. They are nearly identical. He said both in March and during the October CNN debate that the country needed to first secure or seal the border and enforce the laws now on the books. Then, in both instances, he talked about a way to gain citizenship for people now living here illegally. "If they have the opportunity to gain citizenship, they should go to the back of the line, go through the regular process, what the law requires, in order to attain their citizenship," Crist said on March 28 as a Republican. Then on Oct. 24 as an independent: "People should have to get in the back of the line, pay a fine if necessary, their back taxes, and be able to become productive members of the American economy. It's a compassionate way." In matters of policy, the closest PolitiFact Florida could come in finding a difference between March and now comes in discussing the federal health care bill. On March 28, Crist he would vote to repeal the bill. In an Oct. 6 ABC debate, Crist said he was against the health care bill and said it needed to be fixed (health care wasn't discussed during the CNN debate). In other cases, he said the health care bill should be repealed but be accompanied by a responsible substitute. Meek is attacking Rubio for wanting to repeal the health care bill, but Crist isn't. Claims about abortion, stem cell research Without much to go on from the Fox News debate, we turned to two attacks Crist levied against Rubio directly during the CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate -- that Rubio wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and that he opposes embryonic stem cell research. Did Crist once oppose stem cell research? Did Crist once want to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in America? On embryonic stem cell research, Crist generally has been supportive of it. When he ran for governor as a Republican in 2006, Crist said he favored embryonic stem cell research. The position put him at odds with former President George W. Bush. And in May 2010, Crist vetoed state budget language banning tax dollars from being used to support human embryonic stem cell research. Crist's record on abortion, however, is more difficult to decipher. But not necessarily on overturning Roe vs. Wade. When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. "I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government," he said. In a subsequent debate, he said he would not support a constitutional amendment banning abortion -- essentially overturning Roe vs. Wade. In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade. "I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession," said Crist, whose father is a doctor. In the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, Crist said he would support "pro-life" legislation like tax credits and subsidies for parents who adopt. He didn't answer questions about Roe vs. Wade. So Crist is attacking Rubio on both stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, but there is no evidence his position has changed on those issues since the spring. Gay adoption Rubio has used this line about Crist attacking him before. During an ABC News debate earlier in October, Crist chastised Republicans like Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint for telling people "who they should love and who they shouldn't." In that context, Crist said he supported a court's decision to lift a ban in the state on gay couples adopting a child. That prompted Rubio to respond. "I think it’s always funny to listen to the Governor attack me for positions he himself held just six months ago, when he was trying to be the biggest conservative in the world and win the Republican primary." Crist's accusation meets our definition of an attack. And it turns out Crist himself in the past has supported the gay adoption ban. That's our definition of a flip. Back in 2006, when he running for governor as a Republican, Crist said that "my position is the traditional family is the best to adopt." The comments came after earlier comments suggested he might support lifting the ban and allegations from Republicans like former state Rep. Dennis Baxley that he supported gay adoptions. And then on one day in July 2009, he told reporters two different things. When one group of reporters asked if he would support legislation to change the law, he said, "I'd have to think about it." Later in the day, he said he supported the ban. "I think Florida has it right right now," he said. In February 2010, just eight months ago, Crist's office confirmed to the Orlando Sentinel that he supported the ban. Crist defends the differing positions by saying he was simply enforcing the laws on the books of the state. That's a weak argument. Laws change all the time. At the behest of leaders. Rubio's response To add to its case, the Rubio campaign sent us back to that Fox News debate, and the discussion of Social Security. One of the criticisms Crist consistently has made against Rubio, and a claim that PolitiFact has analyzed, is that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits. Crist said during the Fox debate that he would not raise the retirement age or change cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries and proposed one of the ways to help keep Social Security solvent is to cut waste and fraud. But the moderator didn't think eliminating waste and fraud was a practical solution and pressed further. "Don't you actually have to make some benefit changes if you're going to deal with this debt issue?" Fox's Wallace asked. "Well, I think you might have to make some," Crist answered. "But I think what you want to do first is get the waste and the fraud out." Crist clearly was against raising the retirement age and against benefit adjustments based on his answers. When he was pressed about the effectiveness of his plan to fix Social Security, he said some benefits changes might be needed. But then quickly said his plan — get the waste and fraud out — could work. We think it's a stretch to use an answer he was pressed into giving as evidence of a flip-flop. Rubio's campaign also noted that Crist went from being a proud Republican to essentially attacking much of the Republican Party for a far-right ideological shift. We won't disagree with that. But we're focusing on policy issues here. Our ruling Make no mistake: Crist is ripe for attacks about flip-flopping. We've already pretty much written a book about it, noting that his position on oil drilling has shifted, as has his position on the federal health care bill. He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee. But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago. There, the case is much more difficult to make. When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio. But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme. The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue. In that case, Crist's flip-flopping helps his argument. Overall, we think Rubio's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.

pomt-04871	As Florida secretary of state, Kurt Browning "allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/aug/09/heather-fiorentino/heather-fiorentino-said-kurt-browning-allowed-1800/	In the run up to Tuesday's primary election, Pasco schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino sent out a campaign mailer aiming to distinguish herself from challenger Kurt Browning. Fiorentino, who has trailed Browning in campaign contributions and endorsements, for the second time attacked the former two-time Florida secretary of state as a "double dipper" and a former Democrat. She also rolled out a new contention, that Browning "allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida" during his tenure. Browning scoffed at the claim, which includes a number of alleged noncitizen voters we'd never seen before. We set out in search of her facts. • • • In early 2011, while Browning was secretary of state, the Division of Elections learned the Department of Motor Vehicles maintained a database that categorized driver's license holders as citizens and noncitizens, spokesman Chris Cate said. (Cate worked at the time for Browning; he and his wife have since donated $50 to Browning's campaign.) After a discussion with Gov. Rick Scott, Browning decided to take a closer look at just how many noncitizens might be registered to vote. Officials took the driver's license database and compared it to the state voter registration list. The first pass-through generated 180,000 names of potential noncitizen voters, a number that was widely reported by the news media. But Browning was skeptical of that figure: The data was crunched by DMV, not his own department. And he suspected it included some people who obtained their citizenship and registered to vote after they got their last driver's license. The driver's license database might not reflect their current citizenship status. A later effort whittled the list down to 2,600 names, including about 1,400 verified matches from the first list and 1,200 people who get annual driver's licenses because they are on work or student visas. That list went to county elections supervisors to review. Those supervisors did their due diligence, giving the voters in question an opportunity to respond. Some voters quickly returned documents verifying their citizenship. Pasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley said of the 13 names he received, "more than half were actually U.S. citizens." One woman was improperly flagged when her records were mistaken for someone else's, Corley said. After finding flaws in its methodology, the Department of State told supervisors of elections to stop using the list of 2,600 names. "We consider that number obsolete now," Cate said. The state is working out an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to better identify noncitizens and compare that list to the voter rolls. As for Fiorentino's flier: "I don't know where they would come up with a number of 1,800," Cate said. Fiorentino acknowledged her flier contained a typo: She meant to use the original 180,000 figure. "I was kinder than it should have been," she said. • • • The question then turns to whether Browning "allowed" all — or any — of those voters to register. The secretary of state is Florida's chief election officer. His responsibilities include creating and administering a statewide voter registration system. "The secretary may delegate voter registration duties and records maintenance activities to voter registration officials," Florida statute states. Those officials include county supervisors of elections, whose powers include accepting voter registration applications and updating the statewide voter registration system. "It is the supervisor who is activating the voters," Cate explained. From that perspective, Browning did not have a hand in the registration. He also was secretary of state from 2006-10, and again from 2011-12. The voter list under review included registrations from years outside his terms. • • • Fiorentino said she was aware the 180,000 number represented "all the people" initially tagged. She argued that Browning allowed illegal voters to remain on the rolls even after several elections supervisors, including Corley, raised red flags in 2011. "He did nothing," she said. "I call that allowing." Browning emphasized that supervisors of election are responsible for voter registration. "I didn't register those voters," he said. He added that he had no firm number of illegal voters but that he tried as secretary of state to identify them so local elections officials could address them. "She doesn't understand how the law works," Browning said. Our ruling Fiorentino accused Browning of "allowing 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida." Her number is wrong. The state's initial list of 180,000 names never identified voters as illegal, but rather created a starting point for further verification. The state later stopped using the list, deeming the data unreliable. The secretary of state does not register voters in Florida, nor does he have the authority to remove them from the rolls. That's the job of county elections supervisors. And Browning was not secretary of state during the entire time the people on that list registered to vote. Fiorentino played fast and loose with her claim in an effort to discredit her opponent on election eve. We rule her claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-02763	Gov. Charlie Crist "sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history."	false	/florida/statements/2013/dec/12/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-says-charlie-crist-got-approved-automat/	As former Gov. Charlie Crist tries to gain supporters in his quest to unseat Republican Gov. Rick Scott, he wants to portray himself as the hero of voter access and Scott as a leader who restricted voting. Dan Gelber, a former state House Democratic leader from Miami Beach and a Crist supporter, praised Crist for helping felons restore their civil rights, which includes the right to vote: Gelber wrote that Crist, as governor, "sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history (since reversed by Governor Scott)." At PolitiFact our Truth-O-Meter ramps up when we hear any claims about a "first" so we wanted to check if Gelber’s claim was correct. History of restoration of felon rights Restoring felons’ civil rights can include the right to vote, serve on a jury and run for office. The roots of disenfranchisement for ex-offenders extend back to 1845 when Florida’s General Assembly enacted a law that stated: "no person who shall hereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury, or other infamous crime, shall be entitled to the right of suffrage." In the mid 20th Century, a small number of ex-offenders could get their rights restored by the Parole Commission. By 1968, the Constitution placed that power in the hands of the Cabinet. In the 1970s, there was pressure from the Legislature on Gov. Reubin Askew, a Democrat, to make it easier to restore civil rights. Legislators passed a bill in 1974 that included automatic reinstatement, but the Florida Supreme Court declared that unconstitutional because it bypassed the governor’s clemency power. Askew then convinced the Cabinet to amend the clemency rules to make restoration easier. Randall Berg, a civil rights attorney at the Florida Justice Institute, told PolitiFact that Askew was motivated by a personal belief that "after one had served their time, they had paid their debt and ought to start with a clean slate so they might become productive members of society." Askew also wanted to speed up the process. The Cabinet restored rights in its role as the Executive Clemency Review Board, but meetings were only held quarterly, and the process was slow. "There were simply too many people to determine who got their civil rights restored and who did not," Berg said in an email. The 1975 rule that Askew promoted included automatic reinstatement after a person was released from prison or parole, with the exception of the right to own or possess firearms. Each month, the Cabinet signed orders to grant restoration of civil rights. In 1977, the wording was changed to allow members of the Clemency Board to object to restoring a particular individual’s rights. A timeline from the state’s Parole Commission explains how the rules changed after Askew. In the early 1990s, Gov. Lawton Chiles tightened the rules, which made it harder for ex-felons to regain their rights. (That happened amid the backdrop of prison overcrowding, which led the state to release prisoners early.) Gov. Jeb Bush then took steps to simplify the process. (For example the application shrank from 12 pages to one.) But advocates said there was more to be done. Crist changes In April 2007, Crist convinced the Cabinet to streamline the process. "Some who favor the current system argue that restoring civil rights is somehow ''weak on crime," as if restoring the right to vote, to serve on a jury or to work lessens the punishment or encourages a person to commit new crimes. In fact, the opposite should be true," Crist wrote in a Miami Herald op-ed. "Giving a person a meaningful way to re-enter society, make a living and participate in our democracy will encourage good behavior." Under Crist, ex-offenders convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing, while those convicted of crimes such as murder required a more thorough investigation and a hearing. Though some news articles used the word "automatic" to describe this process, that’s an oversimplification, because the Parole Commission had to approve it. Some advocates argued that Crist’s change didn’t go far enough. Under Crist, there were more than 150,000 restorations, but a backlog of 100,000 remained when he left office, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In February 2011, newly elected Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi argued that the process was too easy for released felons. One month later, Bondi, Scott and the rest of the Cabinet scrapped the process and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period. During Scott’s tenure through mid September, about 850 offenders have had their rights restored. Gelber’s response We contacted Gelber and told him that our research showed Askew sought restoration of felons’ voting rights before Crist did. Gelber told PolitiFact that he was unaware of Askew’s actions in 1975 and did some additional research; he said he found some differences between the restoration rules under Askew and Crist. (One difference related to some wording under Askew that required an ex-con to be a resident of Florida for one year, but that paragraph was in a section related to offenders who were not U.S. citizens.) "While there are some debatable distinctions, I think my statement unfairly diminishes Gov. Askew's efforts," Gelber told PolitiFact in an email. "The truth is, both men deserve high praise for what they did because the position they advocated is often unpopular and requires a measure of political courage. I have revised my statement to pay homage to Gov. Askew while at the same time congratulating Gov. Crist." Here is how Gelber re-worded the claim: "as Governor he convinced the Cabinet to approve the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time since Gov. Reubin Askew implemented a similar reform in 1975 (since reversed by Governor Scott)." Our ruling Gelber said that Crist "sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history." First, a minor quibble: the restoration of felon rights under Crist was not automatic because the Clemency Board still had to sign off on it. However our main objection to Gelber’s statement is his claim that Crist was the "first" to do this in Florida history. In 1975, Askew and the Cabinet changed the rules to allow for "automatic restoration" of rights for voting. Under Askew, the changes broadly applied to offenders, whether they had completed sentences related to violent or nonviolent offenses. Crist’s policy favored nonviolent offenders. Depending on your viewpoint it was Askew who earned kudos or criticism -- not Crist -- for making it far easier for felons to regain civil rights including the right to vote. Gelber changed the wording of his claim in response to this fact-check. At PolitiFact, we give props to people who admit to errors and correct them, but that doesn’t change our analysis or rating of the original claim. We rate this claim False.

pomt-10882	"Democrats are kind of falling over each other seeing who can raise taxes faster. It looks like they're going to raise taxes anywhere between 20 to 30 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/06/rudy-giuliani/playing-fast-and-loose-with-numbers/	It's not entirely clear from the context whether Giuliani is talking about the Democratic presidential candidates or the Democrats in Congress. But it doesn't really matter, especially since so many in the Democratic field of candidates are in the Senate or the House. Either way, Giuliani is correct that Democrats are open to letting some of the tax cuts of 2001 expire, which would raise taxes for those affected. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they want to renew some of the those tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. But they also have indicated that they would favor allowing tax cuts to expire that, in their view, unfairly benefit wealthy Americans. The tax rate on household incomes above $200,000 would return to higher levels, as would taxes on capital gains, dividends and estates. But is that a 20 to 30 percent increase? To defend his claim, the Giuliani campaign points to a Congressional Budget Office report that shows a 31 percent rise in revenue from 2006 to 2011 if all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire. There are two problems with this. First of all, the Democrats aren't advocating the elimination of all of the 2001 tax cuts. And second, the logic of the Giuliani argument is that a rise in revenues is the same as a tax increase. If that's the standard, than President Bush's own budget for 2008, released in February, includes a 29 percent tax increase over the same period, too. Nope, that doesn't cut it.

pomt-07752	If public employees don’t pay more for benefits starting April 1, 2011, "the equivalent" is 1,500 state employee layoffs by June 30, 2011 and 10,000 to 12,000 state and local government employee layoffs in the next two years.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/25/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-if-public-employees-dont-sta/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker warned during a Feb. 22, 2011 "fireside chat" that if his controversial budget-repair bill does not pass, 1,500 public employees will be laid off before June 30, 2011 and up to 12,000 after that. His threat applied not only to state employees, but also local government and public school workers, over whom he has no direct control. That made us wonder: Are some of Walker’s deficit-reduction goals so high that they are the equivalent of laying off that many public employees? We established in a previous PolitiFact Wisconsin item that, despite some cries to the contrary, the state does have a budget deficit. The shortfall is projected at $137 million for the budget that ends June 30 and $3.6 billion for the next two-year budget, which starts July 1. Walker’s bill led tens of thousands of people to protest and 14 Democratic senators to leave the state in order to prevent a vote on the bill. The opposition focuses on the bill’s elimination and curtailment of public workers’ collective bargaining rights. The public worker unions have said they would accept paying more for pensions and other benefits. The bill would cut the deficits through various means, including increasing what public employees pay for pensions and health insurance. Those are key parts of an employee’s overall compensation package, so workers would end up with less money in their pocket. That would generate $30 million in the budget year ending June 30 and $300 million for the two-year budget that starts July 1, according to Walker. At a Feb. 21 news conference, Walker framed the impact of the higher benefit payments in terms of the "equivalent" cost of public workers: "That $30 million -- if we don’t get it by starting our (higher) health care and pension contributions by April 1 -- translates in this budget, which means June 30, to the equivalent of 1,500 state government employees being laid off." He added: "The equivalent at the state level for the next (two-year) budget would be 5,000 to 6,000 state government employees being laid off and 5,000 to 6,000 local government employees. That’s teachers and city workers and county workers and others out there." Added together, Walker is talking about a total of 10,000 to 12,000 layoffs at the state and local levels. We can’t rule on Walker’s threat of layoffs -- he has said initial layoff notices could be sent as soon as Feb. 28, 2011 -- since it is a prediction of future action. But we can assess his claim about the money that would be raised from higher employee benefit contributions as compared to the "equivalent" savings that would be gained from layoffs. That’s a mathematical comparison. Asked to back up Walker’s claim, his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, provided a three-paragraph memo from a member of the governor’s administration, state budget director Brian Hayes. In doing the math, the memo relies on total compensation (not just wages) for the average state employee: $76,500 per year. The memo echoes what Walker said -- the benefit changes for employees would bring in $30 million in the budget year that ends June 30. In his news conference, Walker said that savings is based on the employees paying more for their benefits starting April 1. Using the average employee’s total compensation, we found that $30 million is the equivalent of 1,568 employees. That essentially matches Walker’s claim of 1,500 state worker layoffs by June 30. To look at the long-term budget effects, it helps to have a slightly different vantage point. The budget director’s memo says that to reach Walker’s deficit-reduction target for the two-year budget that starts July 1, there would need to be 5,532 state employee layoffs. That’s right in the middle of Walker’s claim of 5,000 to 6,000 state layoffs. Such a layoff would generate savings of $420 million per year, according to the memo. That’s more than the $300 million in savings over two years that was stated by Walker, so we asked the governor’s spokesman to explain. Werwie said the $420 million is an "all funds" savings and that the amount of general state revenue -- which could be used to lower the deficit -- would be only $300 million over two years. One reason is that a portion of the salary of some state employees is paid from federal revenue or other sources, he said. So, the budget director’s memo provides a basis for Walker’s layoff claims in terms of state employee layoffs. But what about the layoffs of 5,000 to 6,000 local government employees that Walker claimed? The memo makes no mention of them, so we went back to Werwie. He said municipalities and school districts would have to lay off 5,000 to 6,000 employees to offset likely reductions in state aid that would be made in Walker’s budget for the two-year period that starts July 1, 2011. In other words, the amount of state money that local governments would lose would be the equivalent of what they could save by laying off 5,000 to 6,000 employees. Werwie did not provide any figures, however, to show how that layoff estimate was reached. And Walker isn’t scheduled to submit his budget, which would include the reductions in state aid, until March 1. So, with regard to local government layoffs, we don’t know what math Walker is using to back up his claim. But Dan Thompson, executive director of the Wisconsin League of Municipalities, and John Reinemann, legislative director of the Wisconsin Counties Association, both said it would be relatively easy for Walker to come up with the estimate of local government layoffs. They said Walker could use data from the state pension system to estimate the average total compensation for local government workers. And assuming Walker knows roughly how much in state aid to local governments he plans to cut, he would divide that amount by the average compensation figure, they said. That would reveal the number of local government layoffs that are the equivalent of the amount of reductions in state aid. So, we still don’t have Walker’s formula for his claim of local government layoffs, but there is reason to believe that figure could be estimated. Let’s return to the governor’s statement. Walker said the higher benefit contributions from public employees that he is seeking in his budget-repair bill are the equivalent of laying off certain numbers of state employees. He provided a basis for those claims. Walker also said cited layoffs of local government employees. He didn’t spell out that estimate, but it appears he would have the figures needed to make it. If more details emerge, we’ll revisit this item. For now, we rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-02-25T18:43:19	2011-02-21	['None']
pomt-06429	On letting Occupy Atlanta protesters stay in Woodruff Park.	no flip	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/24/kasim-reed/reed-sends-mixed-messages-occupy-atlanta-protest/	All the twists and turns in the Occupy Atlanta protest saga made the PolitiFact Georgia team wonder whether they amounted to a flip-flop by Mayor Kasim Reed. Sympathizers of the Occupy Wall Street protests took over Woodruff Park in downtown Atlanta on a Friday night more than two weeks ago. The following Monday, police officers positioned themselves nearby, and protesters braced for clashes or mass arrests like the ones that have taken place in New York City. The clashes never happened. Two days later, demonstrators cheered an executive order from Reed that let them stay in the park until Oct. 17 -- last Monday. The order’s expiration loomed. Once again activists prepared for a showdown. With hours to spare, Reed issued another order letting them stay for three more weeks. It sounded a little flip-floppy to us. We rummaged the office for our Flip-O-Meter to see whether Reed shifted his stance by letting Occupy Atlanta protesters stay in the park. We studied Reed’s public statements, news releases and executive orders, as well as actions and statements by other city officials who report to him. As far as we can tell, the first time Reed spoke publicly about the Occupy Wall Street movement was Oct. 10 in Chicago, as he appeared on a panel that included New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. It was three days after the Atlanta protests began. Reed was sympathetic. "I think that people wanted focusing attention and passion on jobs," he said, according to a clip that aired on WXIA-TV. "I’m really OK with it because I think the country needs more passion and we need a big fight." As Reed was in Chicago, Atlanta City Councilman Michael Julian Bond was back home helping set up a meeting between demonstrators and city officials, including Police Chief George Turner. Activist Tim Franzen attended the meeting. He told PolitiFact Georgia that Turner said that police would arrest demonstrators who break the law, but the chief did not give a specific time frame. Another activist at the meeting told us Turner’s message was less specific. "Word for word, it was that they [police] ‘would enforce the law,’ " said activist James Turner, who is not related to the police chief. "They made it seem urgent." Bond, who attended a portion of the meeting, said he did not hear the police chief tell protesters they would be arrested, but he got the impression they were going to jail that night. That night, police mobilized on the streets surrounding Woodruff Park. Some rode on horseback. Others brought police dogs. Regardless of the chief’s actual words, it makes sense that protesters thought they would be behind bars before sunrise. The chief’s office referred PolitiFact Georgia’s questions to Reed’s representatives. Reed told PolitiFact Georgia the police chief "never" told protesters they would be arrested. The next day, Reed told the City Council’s Public Safety Committee that police staged near Woodruff Park to rehearse their response in case protests turned violent. Attorneys were reviewing the city’s options, Reed said. "Obviously we have some feeling about the right of people to peaceably protest and their legitimate concerns. But you all have passed a set of ordinances that I’m responsible for enforcing," Reed told the committee. "So to apply them to one group and not to apply them to another group is creating real problems with us." "[T]he posture of the city of Atlanta is we will not be moving forward with arrests at this time," he said. Reed issued an executive order the next day, a Wednesday. It said "there is a compelling public safety need" to suspend enforcement of city rules that shut down Woodruff Park between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Enforcing them would take too many police resources away from other neighborhoods. Police could make arrests to "maintain public peace and good order for a reason other than enforcing park closing hours," it said. The order would expire Oct. 17, the date of the next City Council meeting. City code requires all executive orders to expire after the next council meeting, unless the council ratifies them. The order did not say police would arrest protesters who remained in the park after the order’s expiration. Still, protesters perceived this date to be an eviction deadline. Media outlets described it as one, but this interpretation is not clear-cut. That Friday, three days before the order expired, the mayor’s office said the date was not a firm deadline, according to a story by Channel 2 Action News, a reporting partner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. When Oct. 17 rolled around, Reed issued a second, nearly identical order. It will expire after the Nov. 7 council meeting. Reed has not indicated what he will do at that time. Our ruling: Reed maintained through his public statements, news releases and executive orders that he will respect peaceful public protest and protect the city if demonstrations turn violent. The police show of force near the park Oct. 10 conveyed a more intimidating message than Reed’s words did, but it fell short of contradicting him. Both he and his surrogates gave themselves leeway to make arrests. The fact that Reed extended the time protesters could remain in the park is not enough evidence to say he flipped his position, either. City code required that the first order expire Oct. 17. The order does not say protesters would be removed after that date. Reed’s office said three days before then that it was not a firm deadline for protesters to leave the park. The city’s actions might have sent mixed signals, but Reed’s statements were carefully calibrated and the evidence indicates he did not change his stance. We rule No Flip.

pomt-12781	"More than ever our nation and the traveling public rely on Amtrak for mobility."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/feb/21/wick-moorman/whats-missing-amtraks-claim-we-rely-more-ever-trai/	Amtrak CEO Wick Moorman spoke in front of a Senate subcommittee earlier this week. Per usual, he was lobbying for more federal funding for Amtrak, which operates at a loss every year and claims to need more money to service its aging infrastructure. Philadelphia knows about the importance of Amtrak as much as any city. Not only does Amtrak have offices here, 30th Street Station is the third-busiest station in the country, and the failure of the company to implement positive train control contributed to the deadly crash of Amtrak 188 in 2015 in Frankford. In this plea to get more funding, Moorman called on the rising need for train travel in America. "More than ever," he said, "our nation and the traveling public rely on Amtrak for mobility." Are we really more reliant on Amtrak than ever? First of all, the Amtrak era began in 1971, long after the heyday of trains in the 19th century and earlier in the 20th century. During World War II, for example, nearly 10 times as many passenger miles were accumulated annually as were the last few years. But Moorman specified Amtrak, so we’ll only check from 1971 on. And in terms of total passengers, Amtrak has never been more popular. Ridership hit a record 31.3 million in fiscal year 2016. It was 30.8 million in 2015, and since 2010 ridership has topped 30 million each year but has not increased each year. That’s only one statistic, though. Another way to measure the frequency of travel on Amtrak is passenger miles, and the most recent data for passenger miles shows the train system trending slightly downward. For fiscal year 2016, 6.5 billion passenger miles were traveled on Amtrak. That’s one million fewer miles traveled than the previous year and two million fewer than Amtrak projected for the year — but still about one billion more than Amtrak had in 2000. Trains were also emptier than in the previous year, with a 50.9 percent average load in 2016, compared to 51.3 percent in 2015. Another way to gauge the public’s reliance on Amtrak would be to compare its passenger miles as a percentage of overall passenger miles of similar travel options. And according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Amtrak is taking up a smaller share of those miles when sized up against airline passenger miles and highway bus miles. The Congressional Budget Office has measured Amtrak against these two other forms of transportation in past reports. In 2014, the most recent year the Department of Transportation has available for the three options, Amtrak’s passenger miles represented .7 percent of miles traveled. That’s a negligible amount lower than in 2010, but higher than in 2000. It’s lower than in 1990, when Amtrak passenger miles accounted for 1.2 percent of total passenger miles traveled across bus, air and train in the United States. There’s been a similar decline in Amtrak’s share across the same time period when you take into account all highway passenger miles and not just bus. This would indicate that despite Amtrak’s recent growth in passengers and steady rate of passenger miles traveled per year, the service is being used for a smaller percentage of overall travel than in years past. We asked Amtrak’s media relations team for clarification on Moorman’s comment but never heard back. Our Ruling In a plea for more federal funding, Amtrak CEO Wick Moorman told a Senate subcommittee, "More than ever, our nation and the traveling public rely on Amtrak for mobility." In terms of passengers, Amtrak has never been more popular. Its ridership reached a record 31.3 million in 2016. But the train service is lagging in other ways. The number of passenger miles traveled on Amtrak in 2016 was 6.5 billion, fewer than the previous year and fewer than what Amtrak projected. Passenger miles traveled on Amtrak also represent a smaller share when compared to highway bus and air miles traveled than in the past. We rule the claim Half True.

"Democrats just elected… a woman whose IQ is lower than a salamander, a man who preys on underage prostitutes, an anti-semitic, America-hater who married her brother, and an anti-semitic who beats women," reads a Facebook post that appeared online Nov. 7.

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared nearly 17,000 times. We feel that the allegation about Ocasio-Cortez’s IQ is hyperbole, and after looking into other claims about Omar’s marital history, we don’t have enough information to make a ruling, though the Associated Press has done a lot of reporting on the subject in response to the allegations. Instead, we’ll check whether Menendez "preys on underage prostitutes" and if Ellison is "an anti-semitic racist who beats women." Menendez First, let’s look at Menendez. An Oct. 15 political ad from his Republican opponent, Bob Hugin, accuses Menendez of being a hypocrite. "What about the underage prostitutes who accused you, according to the FBI?" the narrator says. The charge is an old one from Menendez’s last re-election campaign in 2012. It stems from an anonymous tip that Menendez and his friend, Salomon Melgen, hired underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. Menendez has denied the allegations and, the New York Times reported on Oct. 17, "it has never been proven." The FBI investigated the claims. "The government took responsible steps to investigate these serious criminal allegations, which were not so ‘easily disprovable,’ as the defendants suggest," according to court documents. But Washington Post reporter Salvador Rizzo, who traveled to the Dominican Republic in 2013 in part to investigate the underage-prostitution allegations, recalls that the FBI "and a platoon of reporters from national and New Jersey news organizations spent months investigating whether the senator was committing sexual crimes with minors outside the country. The accusations were never substantiated." Rizzo also talked to Melanie Sloan, a former Democratic congressional aide and a former federal prosecutor: "I can tell you definitively that there was no evidence ever to support the underage-prostitution allegations," she said. In a comprehensive fact-check of the Hugin’s ad, Rizzo finds that "to accuse a rival candidate of maybe sleeping with underage prostitutes, solid evidence is an absolute must. The evidence for Hugin’s ad fails the test." This Facebook post fails the test, too. Ellison But what about Ellison? An old tie to Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader with a history of making anti-semitic remarks, dogged the congressman during his campaign. As a law student at the University of Minnesota, Ellison wrote an article for the school newspaper that "defended Farrakhan against accusations of anti-semitism," according to a Washington Post story from 2006. He renounced the Nation of Islam that year, when he first ran for Congress. In 2016, a spokesperson for Ellison told CNN that he "rejects all forms of anti-semitism." The congressman also wrote an opinion piece for the Post declaring that he "neglected to scrutinize the words" of Farrakhan, "who mixed a message of African American empowerment with scapegoating of other communities." "These men organize by sowing hatred and division, including anti-semitism, homophobia and a chauvinistic model of manhood," Ellison wrote. "I disavowed them long ago, condemned their views and apologized." Others maintain that Ellison made anti-semitic statements himself. In a 2017 opinion piece for The Hill, Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus law professor at Harvard University, wrote: "A prominent lawyer, with significant credibility, told me that while he was a law student, Ellison approached her and said he could not respect her, because she was a Jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school." Ellison has denied that he’s anti-semitic. He’s also denied more recent allegations that he abused his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan. She’s accused the congressman of physical and emotional abuse. Once, she said, he shouted profanities at her while trying to drag her off the bed, the New York Times reported in August. Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer Labor Party hired a law firm to investigate and "found the allegations unsubstantiated," according to Politico. Our ruling There’s a lot to unpack here. The allegations in this Facebook post range from the absurd—comparing Ocasio-Cortez to an amphibian—to the incendiary. But all of the claims, including the ones we didn’t check, are misleading because they’re presented as if they are uncontested facts, and that’s not the case. The burden of proof is high in claiming someone paid a minor for sex, and in the case of Menendez, that proof is missing. The allegations against Ellison are murkier. We know that, while in law school, Ellison wrote an article defending Louis Farrakhan against claims that Farrakhan was anti-semitic. Ellison then went on to renounce the Nation of Islam while also addressing those criticisms head-on in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. It seems clear that while this claim contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. As to the claim that Ellison "beats women," we know that Ellison has not been convicted of assault in a court of law. However, his former partner hasn’t backed down from claims that he harmed her in what was clearly a volatile relationship. Without more evidence, it is hard to rule on this matter. Still, the claim does not come out of nowhere. While it contains an element of truth, this claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Together, the charges in this post are problematic and, in the end, range from incindiary to largely unsubstantiated. We rate this viral Facebook post Mostly False.

pomt-12987	"If you’re a single mom, and you’ve two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/dec/19/bryce-reeves/bryce-reeves-says-single-mom-can-make-almost-50000/	State Sen. Bryce Reeves is running in a crowded Republican primary field for lieutenant governor on a small-government platform. "My goal, as lieutenant governor, is to reform taxes, help to get people off of welfare," Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, said on "The John Fredericks Show" radio program. "If you’re a single mom and you have two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole." We wondered whether that single mom in Richmond really could receive so much public assistance. Reeves’ claim is based on a report by the Virginia Department of Social Services that examines the "road to self-sufficiency" taken by a fictitious Richmond mom with two boys, ages 3 and 7, as she gradually works toward a higher income level where she can pay completely for her family’s basic needs without relying on public assistance. She starts out working 40 hours a week at a minimum-wage job, earning $15,080 a year. The Department of Social Services provided us a chart showing the public assistance she’d receive at that wage level for a year: •Welfare, $3,840 •Food stamps, $2,268 •Women Infants and Children food basket, $600 •Child care assistance, $12,468 •School lunch, $1,296 •Housing voucher, $10,692 All of that assistance comes to $31,164 a year. That doesn’t include the value of medical benefits the three-person family would get. Necole Simmonds, a Department of Social Services spokeswoman, told us in an email that the mom might be eligible for Medicaid while her children would be eligible for FAMIS Plus, a medical insurance program for children in low-income families. We asked about the cost of providing the fictitious Richmond family with medical insurance. Simmonds pointed us to estimates by the Kaiser Family Foundation of per-capita Medicaid spending in Virginia in 2011 - the latest year available. It came to $4,411 for an adult and $2,698 per child. These are not ideal figures because they’re bit old and, as we noted, the kids would be insured by FAMIS Plus, not Medicaid. The Department of Social Services couldn’t provide an estimate on per-capita benefits from FAMIS Plus. Despite these issues, the figures provide an approximation of the cost of publicly funded medical services for the fictitious family. And when we add the medical costs to the other benefits listed above, the family would be receiving close to $40,000 in total public assistance - short of the figure Reeves cited. Simmonds told us in an email that "the total value of the benefits a woman with two young kids making minimum wage may receive does not add up to $50,000." When we reached out to Reeves’ campaign, a spokeswoman told us the senator misspoke and said Reeves was not trying to suggest that the single mom would be getting nearly $50,000 from the public dole. "What he was trying to say was: ‘If you’re a single mom, and you’ve two kids in the city of Richmond, you almost have to make $50,000 a year to get off the public dole," Sam Azzarelli, communications director for the Reeves campaign, wrote us in an email. There are some problems with this amended claim that we also should point out, even though it’s not the focus of this fact-check. The fictitious mother loses most of her public assistance by the time she’s earning $33,800. At that point she no longer qualifies for welfare, food stamps, child care and housing assistance. As a result, she’s left with an income that leaves her hundreds of dollars short each month of meeting her family’s basic needs. The only major benefit her family continues to get is medical assistance for her two children, and that ends when her income reaches $42,120. But the family is not self-sufficient at this point and won’t be, according to the Department of Social Services report, until the mother is earning $50,440. At that earning level, the mother is able to pay all of the basic expenses of housing, food, child care, health care and transportation. Our ruling Reeves said, "If you’re a single mom, and you’ve two kids in the city of Richmond, you can almost make $50,000 a year on the public dole." Although Reeves acknowledges he misspoke, he wasn’t far off. That mother, if she was working full time at minimum wage, could receive about $40,000 a year in public assistance. So we rate Reeves’ statement Mostly True.	None	Bryce Reeves	None	None	None	2016-12-19T03:00:00	2016-12-04	['None']
pomt-09311	Passage of Clinton budget bill in 1993 "led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/19/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-takes-credit-flowering-economy-1990s/	On the April 18, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, interim host Jake Tapper and former President Bill Clinton discussed whether Clinton sees similarities between his first two years as president and the first two years under President Barack Obama. Asked by Tapper, "Politically does this year remind you of 1994?" Clinton responded, "A little bit. We passed the bill which reversed trickle-down economics by one vote. (It was) close like the health care bill (this year). And it led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America." We thought it would be worth checking whether the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, as it was officially known, really did lead to "an enormous flowering of the economy in America." First, a recap of that bill. Its key provisions included raising the top effective tax rate to 39.6 percent; removal of the income cap on Medicare taxes; imposition of a 4.3 cent per gallon gasoline tax; and tax hikes on Social Security benefits and corporate income. As might be expected of a bill that raised taxes, the bill did not attract a single Republican vote in the House. So it was controversial at the time, and it still is. But love it or hate it, the bill has been widely credited with helping set the course for Clinton's economic policy. We see two related, but distinct, questions to answer. First, did the economy flower after passage of the bill? And if so, how much credit, if any, does the bill deserve for that "flowering"? We'll take these questions in turn. Did the economy truly flower? Was there something in it for everybody? There's a strong case that in terms of employment, income and productivity it did. We compared several key economic indicators during two periods. The first is the period between the bill's passage (in August 1993) and the end of Clinton's term in office (December 2000). The second is the period from the official start of the nation's economic expansion (in March 1991, during the presidency of George H.W. Bush) to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (in August 1993). Our aim was to see whether the economic expansion that was already under way actually accelerated after passage of the bill, or whether it simply continued the existing expansion (or even if it slowed down). Here are some of the key indicators we looked at: • Gross domestic product. Between the third quarter of 1993 and the fourth quarter of 2000, the economy culumatively grew by just about one-third, or approximately 4.4 percent per year. By comparison, growth between the first quarter of 1991 and the third quarter of 1993 was just under 3 percent per year. So growth was strong in both periods, but it was stronger after passage of the bill. • Unemployment. Unemployment fell from 6.8 percent to 3.9 percent between passage of the bill and the end of Clinton's term, a period of seven and a half years. That continued a decrease that was already under way: Unemployment fell a full point between a peak of 7.8 percent in June 1992 and August 1993. So, once unemployment turned a corner, it fell noticeably during both periods. But the period after passage of the bill was especially impressive. During those 90 months, there was only a single occasion when unemployment rose for two consecutive months -- and even that was an exceedingly modest gain, rising from 4.3 percent to 4.4 percent and then 4.5 percent between April 1998 and June 1998. • Personal income. After the bill's passage, personal income increased by about 7.5 percent a year, compared to about 5.2 percent a year prior to passage. So income growth was strong in both periods, but it was stronger after the bill passed. • Industrial production. Industrial production followed a similar pattern. It rose by about 5.6 percent per year after passage, compared to 3.2 percent per year before passage. • House prices. The same goes for the real estate market. House prices rose about 4.7 percent a year after passage, compared to 2.4 percent per year prior to passage. (If you thought housing prices rose faster than 4.7 percent per year under Clinton, you may be mistaking his presidency for George W. Bush's; during the first seven years of the Bush administration, housing prices grew by almost 8 percent annually.) • The stock market. From the passage of the bill until the end of Clinton's term, the Dow Jones Industrial average rose from 3,651 to 10,788 -- a stunning 26.7 percent per year. That dwarfs the historically healthy increase of 10 percent a year for the two and a half years prior to passage. So, the statistics are unanimous: Not only was the Clinton presidency after the bill's passage a time of vigorous economic growth, but that growth was also demonstrably more robust than what occurred during the first two and a half years of the recovery. How much credit does the bill deserve for subsequent economic growth? Here are some reasons to be skeptical: • It's impossible to prove causation. There's a basic principle of logic: Just because you can prove that B happened after A doesn't mean that A caused B. That applies here. Was this particular bill what drove the economy to "flower?" Or did this period of unusually long growth owe something to the tax cuts -- proposed by Congressional Republicans and signed by Clinton -- that were passed in 1997? J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that 1993 tax hikes "probably slowed the economy compared to the growth it would have achieved" and counters that the 1997 tax cuts were what kept the expansion chugging along after one would have expected it to wane. Meanwhile, Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institution, credits not passage of the bill per se but rather a more intangible sense that Clinton economic policy would be less reliant on borrowing than that of its Republican predecessors. He said that between the beginning of 1993 and passage of the bill later that year, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury securities fell by more than a full percentage point. "Many people, including me, think this was because financial markets began to take seriously the new administration’s determination to be fiscally conservative," Burtless said. "People buying and selling stocks and bonds on Wall Street were evidently more impressed by the appearance of fiscal discipline than they were upset by the hike in top marginal rates." This, Burtless argues, spurred business investment because it "gave investors confidence that the drop in long-term interest rates was sustainable." And this, in turn, "helped boost industries producing business equipment, including high-tech firms and new and old companies that supply communications and computer equipment. Of course, lower long-term borrowing rates made it cheaper to buy a house and to obtain credit for household consumption." For his part, Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, points to other Clinton-era changes that had a free-market bent. "The economy did do well under Clinton, but that was because of other policies he adopted and in spite of the '93 tax increase," Mitchell said, citing lower government spending as a share of gross domestic product, approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization, welfare reform, farm-subsidy reform. "These are the policies that boosted the economy. The tax increases in 1993 hurt, but were more than offset by other changes." • Clinton's economic policies may have also sowed the seeds of later economic decline. Nothing can take away the fact that Clinton presided over an extraordinarily long economic expansion. But some would argue that he also deserves some demerits for policies that led to less healthy economic developments. For instance, Dean Baker, a liberal economist, sees the stock market rise as a double-edged sword, leading to the bursting of the bubble in 2001 and perhaps helping shape a subsequent decade of only modest job growth. Baker also cited the Clinton administration's support for a strong dollar. "The policy of promoting an overvalued dollar gave us the record trade deficits that eventually peaked at almost 6 percent of GDP in 2006," Baker said. Ultimately, few would deny that Clinton presided over impressive economic growth. Meanwhile, our number-crunching suggests that the economy's improvement did indeed accelerate after the 1993 Balanced Budget bill became law. Still, Clinton is exaggerating when he says the 1993 bill "led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America" because economists say many factors played a role. All in all, we give the former president a rating of Half True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2010-04-19T15:30:20	2010-04-18	['United_States', 'Bill_Clinton']
pomt-04072	"It is ironic that (First Energy Corp. is) going to have a name on our (football stadium) where we (Cleveland Public Power) supply the electricity."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/22/mike-polensek/mike-polensek-says-utility-first-energy-will-have-/	The Cleveland Browns opened a new source of revenue in January 2013 by selling stadium naming rights at Cleveland Browns Stadium to Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. Browns owner Jimmy Haslam vowed that the naming rights money will be used to help the team become more competitive. Haslam didn’t disclose the amount First Energy will pay in the deal, but reportedly it will amount to about $6 million a year for 17 years. Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek said he hoped the deal would open the door to discussion about the stadium's continuing cost to the city. "It is ironic," he added, "that they're going to have a name on our building where we supply the electricity. Only in Cleveland." By "they," he meant First Energy Corp., parent of the Illuminating Co. and the major electrical utility in northern Ohio. By "we," he meant the city-owned electric utility, Cleveland Public Power, a longtime rival. Polensek made the remark in an interview on WEWS Channel 5 in which he asserted that the original lease was "clearly a one-sided, lopsided deal." It charges the Browns $250,000 a year in rent while leaving the city saddled with $13 million a year in debt and capital maintenance costs, he said. To PolitiFact Ohio, if Polensek's quip was accurate, it would indeed indeed be ironic -- or almost comically contrary to expectation. We sought illumination. Shelley Shockley, communications manager for Cleveland Public Power, quickly confirmed that CPP does in fact supply the electrical power to the stadium that will now bear its rival’s name, and will continue to do so at least until the lease expires in 2029. CPP also provides power to such Cleveland landmarks as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Great Lakes Science Center, West Side Market and to much of University Circle. FirstEnergy powers Progressive Field, home of the Indians. Polensek told us he's a Browns fan who wants a winner and has been favorably impressed by Haslam's approach since becoming owner. "My concern is how we can get them to face the economic realities that confront the city every day," he said. "Will the Browns at least consider taking a greater role in maintenance of the facility or in doing something more for city recreational programs? Is there something (they) can do to help us out? "I always believe that reasonable people can come up with reasonable solutions." Polensek, who voted against the lease as a councilman in 1996, saying "city government has not bargained strongly enough on behalf of the taxpayers," noted that it explicitly gives the Browns naming rights for the stadium and all revenues received from marketing the name. And he has no quarrel with FirstEnergy. "It's clearly specific in the lease," he said. "If they want to call it Reddy Kilowatt Stadium, and make Reddy Kilowatt the mascot" -- referring to the old stick figure mascot used by the Illuminating Co. and Ohio Edison and many other power companies -- "there's nothing we can do." First Energy didn’t opt to put Reddy’s name in lights, though. Cleveland Browns Stadium is now "FirstEnergy Stadium, Home of the Cleveland Browns." And, it is powered by Cleveland Public Power. On the Truth-O-Meter, Polensek's statement gets a power rating of True.	None	Mike Polensek	None	None	None	2013-01-22T21:00:00	2013-01-15	['None']
pomt-07683	"We ... sold the state airplanes as I had promised."	true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/08/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-he-sold-state-planes/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott couldn't help but bring up the sale of the two state airplanes during his first State of the State speech on March 8, 2011. Scott told a joint session of the Legislature that, "We ... sold the state airplanes as I had promised." On that, there's no question. On Feb. 11, Scott authorized the sale of two state airplanes to out-of-state buyers. Scott "directed the Department of Management Services to accept two bids that were revealed earlier this week," according to a press release. "This sale of two state-owned airplanes will net the state of Florida more than $560,000 in savings this fiscal year, and it will eliminate the annual operating and leasing costs of $2.4 million per year. "Burdening taxpayers with these ongoing expenses is irresponsible and not a core function for government to meet the state's critical needs," Scott said. The planes are a 2000 King Air 350 and a 2003 Cessna Citation Bravo. The St. Petersburg Times described the buyers on Feb. 12: A Mexican-American oil-field services firm, Transportes Internacionales Tamaulipecos, bid $1.9 million for the Cessna jet, and the nine-passenger King Air prop plane brought a bid of $1.77 million from JNC Aircraft Sales of Washington, D.C. Now, the only question is whether those sales were legal. Powerful Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander has questioned the sale of the planes, saying they first needed the consent of the Legislature. You can read the specifics of Alexander's claim here. But on the merits of Scott's claim, he's right. The planes are long gone. We rate this statement True.

pomt-05943	"We have cut crime across every single zone in the city of Atlanta by between 10 percent and 16 percent, depending on the zone."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/27/kasim-reed/atlanta-crime-down-details-inaccurate/	Two years into his term, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed is fulfilling his promises, he told a crowd of hundreds during his State of the City address. The city is cleaning up its finances. It’s easier for businesses to get permits, he said, and Atlanta code enforcement officers are clearing up blight. In 2010, he promised to cut crime. Already, Reed said Jan. 19, he’s done it. "We have cut crime across every single zone in the city of Atlanta by between 10 percent and 16 percent, depending on the zone," Reed announced. Every zone? The Truth-O-Meter loves a good crime statistic, so we wound it up and let it whirl. The Atlanta Police Department posts weekly crime data on its website. We clicked through it and found that while crime is down 11 percent across the city, it’s not down in all of the city’s six zones. Ordinarily, we would check a claim like Reed’s by comparing the number of incidents in each zone for 2011 and 2009, the year before the mayor took office. For this fact check, we took a slightly different approach. The department changed its zone boundaries on Dec. 13, 2011. If we used the standard method, a zone’s crime could appear to rise if its borders shifted to include a higher-crime neighborhood. Instead, we looked at total incidents starting the first week of January 2011 to the week ending Dec. 10, 2011, the last full week before the switch. We compared it with the same time period in 2009. We analyzed what the Federal Bureau of Investigation calls "Part I" offenses, or murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, auto thefts, thefts from automobiles and larceny. Researchers think tallies of these crimes tend to be a good reflection of the actual number of incidents taking place. This is what we found: Zone 1: Crime declined 10 percent in this west Atlanta zone. The biggest drop was in thefts from cars, which fell 23 percent. Robbery fell 20 percent. Zone 2: Crime dropped 16 percent in these northern neighborhoods, led by a 26 percent drop in thefts from cars. Zone 3: This area includes areas on the city’s south side. Crime increased 2 percent, led by a 26 percent rise in larceny. Zone 4: Crime declined 4 percent in these southwest Atlanta neighborhoods. Robberies, burglaries and thefts from cars all dropped by double digits while larcenies rose 18 percent. Zone 5: Crime dropped 14 percent in this zone, which covers parts of downtown. Burglaries plummeted 35 percent. Zone 6: Crime declined in these east Atlanta neighborhoods by 27 percent, led by a 45 percent drop in thefts from cars. Burglaries and aggravated assaults dropped by more than 30 percent. Crime is down in Atlanta, but Reed mangled the specifics. It’s down in all zones but one. And in the case of east Atlanta, where crime dropped 27 percent, the decline is far more dramatic than the 10 percent to 16 percent decrease Reed mentioned in his State of the City address. In a written statement to PolitiFact Georgia, Reed acknowledged that the city has more work to do, but the lower overall crime rate is a sign of progress. "One of our goals is to say with confidence that crime is down in all zones, and I believe we are moving in the right direction," Reed said. Because Reed’s broader message held true, but the data he used are topsy-turvy, we grant him a Half True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2012-01-27T06:00:00	2012-01-19	['Atlanta']
pomt-07791	"Lyme disease is one of the fastest growing infectious diseases in the United States, and Rhode Island has the second-highest incidence of this disease in the country."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/20/susan-sosnowski/sen-sosnowski-says-rhode-island-ranks-second-us-ly/	Remember when you could roll around in the grass and not have to worry that a tick bite would leave you with aching joints that make you feel like you’re 80 years old? Lyme disease changed that. Now we have to worry that a tick the size of a poppy seed might cause an infection that mimics the flu and can cause muscle and joint pain. It can also lead to serious long-term health problems. To help combat Lyme disease, state Sen. Susan Sosnowski of South Kingstown proposed legislation that would authorize the Rhode Island Lottery to sell "Scratch-A-Tick" scratch tickets, with the proceeds going toward prevention and research. What caught our eye was the assertions in her news release that "Lyme disease is one of the fastest growing infectious diseases in the United States, and Rhode Island has the second-highest incidence of this disease in the country." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which tracks diseases in the United States, doesn't rank infectious diseases by growth rate. But the CDC does release annual reports on the number of cases. We took their numbers and did some additional math. We picked 2008 -- the most recent online report -- and looked at growth rate of infectious diseases from 2004. While there were higher growth rates for much rarer diseases, such as measles, in terms of the actual number of additional cases, Lyme ranked third. Because she couched her language, the first part of Sosnowski’s statement was true. The second question is whether Rhode Island really ranks second in incidence of Lyme cases nationwide. We were intrigued by that figure because we had heard that the disease has become very common in other parts of the country. (Lyme was first identified in 1975 in Lyme, Conn., but scientists believe it has been around for at least a century -- and maybe since the last Ice Age.) The CDC gave us state statistics from 2005 to 2009, and we found earlier numbers, showing that Rhode Island isn't even near the top among states where Lyme is common. The numbers showed that Rhode Island was number two in the country in 2002 (behind Connecticut) and number one in 2003. But since then, our ranking has declined. Six states -- Delaware, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts -- beat us out in 2004. We went back up to fourth in 2006, but in the other years after 2004, we ranked 13th or lower. In 2009, the CDC numbers showed, a dozen states had a higher rate of confirmed cases of Lyme than Rhode Island. Nine states had rates that were double our rate of 142 cases per million people. In other words, these days we're not even close to being second. So we contacted Sosnowski. She said her statement was based on a July 2003 news release from the Lyme Disease Association of Rhode Island. "It might be out of date," she acknowledged. Thomas Mather, director of the University of Rhode Island’s TickEncounter Resource Center, who asked Sosnowski to submit the legislation, contended that the CDC numbers are not accurate. He believes Sosnowski, if not correct, is close. The problem: Rhode Island, which supplies the numbers to the CDC, stopped making a rigorous count years ago for budget reasons. That's why, he said, in 2004 the number of Rhode Island cases reported to the CDC plummeted from 736 to 249, even though there was no evidence that the problem had diminished. (The numbers have since rebounded, but most years they are far below pre-2004 levels.) Just based on the tick population in Rhode Island, he said, the state’s infection rate must be extraordinarily high. And, he said, it’s widely believed by people in the field that for every case reported, there are probably five other people who have been infected. "We are certainly in the top five" for Lyme disease cases, said Mather. "Before 2004, we sort of were second. Then in 2004, states like Rhode Island and Connecticut suspended new case surveillance because we couldn't afford to do it." And in the intervening years, "nothing has changed in Rhode Island to take away our ticks or our human exposure to ticks," he said. "I'm fairly certain Rhode Island is right near the top of the list, if not at the top of the list, in the real number of cases of Lyme disease, if we could only count them." Annemarie Beardsworth, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Health, said the state’s Lyme disease numbers dropped from 2005 to 2007 because the Health Department didn’t have anyone to evaluate the data. That subsequently changed, she said, and the numbers have been reliable since 2008. "Our sense is it is now fair to compare from state to state," she said. "Doctor Mather may be looking at ticks, but we're looking at diagnosed, laboratory-confirmed cases." We found that for 2009, even if you took all 85 "probable" cases of Lyme in Rhode Island and added them to the 150 "confirmed" cases (and only do it for Rhode Island), we would be ranked 11th in the nation, not second. From a broader perspective, Dr. Paul Mead, a chief of epidemiology and surveillance activity at the CDC, discourages people from focusing on state rankings because such numbers aren't as precise as you might expect. He said the uncertainty varies from disease to disease, and there may be more uncertainty in the numbers from some states than others. "Lyme disease advocates will often push the idea of counting every case and surveillance is terrible," said Mead. "I think much of that is borne from the notion that if you get your case count up, people will take it seriously and the disease will get more recognition." In the end, CDC data confirm that, even though Sosnowski was citing outdated information, it's still fair to say that Lyme is "one of" the nation’s fastest growing infections. But when she says that Rhode Island ranks second when it comes to the incidence of Lyme, she is giving a very precise statistic, citing it with authority, and using the present tense to make it sound current. Yet there's no data to support her claim. Both Sosnowski and Mather expressed fear that, when people hear what the latest numbers are, they will falsely conclude that Lyme disease is no longer a big deal. In fact, it is. And so is the truth, so we rate Sosnowski's statement Half True.	None	Susan Sosnowski	None	None	None	2011-02-20T00:01:00	2011-02-03	['United_States', 'Rhode_Island']
pomt-01290	Gina Raimondo "paid 70 million in taxpayer dollars to millionaire hedge fund managers."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/31/allan-fung/allan-fung-says-gina-raimondo-paid-70-million-stat/	In the race for Rhode Island governor, Republican Allan Fung is airing a TV commercial that questions the allegiance of his Democratic rival Gina Raimondo. "Who does she serve?" the commercial asks. Wall Street, if you believe what it goes on to say. The commercial cites contributions Raimondo received from donors in the financial services industry and also says she used state pension money to invest heavily -- and the commercial suggests, unwisely -- in hedge funds. "She paid 70 million in taxpayer dollars to millionaire hedge fund managers," the commercial states. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the decision by the State Investment Commission, which is chaired by Raimondo, to increase investments in hedge funds. Critics note the high fees charged by those funds -- management fees of 1 percent to 2.5 percent of investments and performance fees of 17.5 percent to 25 percent of profits -- in questioning the move. But Raimondo says those fees are justified because the pension fund’s portfolio is more diversified and less exposed to risk. Because it has become such a charged issue, we thought it was important to check the numbers in the Fung commercial. The ad cites a Providence Journal story from Aug. 25, 2013 as the source of the claim. We couldn’t find a story about investment fees from that date, but we did find one that was published on providencejournal.com on Sept. 25, 2013 and in the next day’s newspaper. That story reported that the state pension fund earned about $780 million in investment returns in the 2013 fiscal year after paying about $70 million in fees. Those fees were divided between management fees, which totaled about $36 million, and performance fees, which totaled about $34 million, according to the story. The story did not break down the fees that were paid to the different types of funds in which the state invests. This is an important point, because the state invests only a small portion of the $8 billion in pension money in hedge funds. Investments are divided between cash, bonds, real estate, private companies, publicly traded companies and other areas. Currently, 14.7 percent of the pension money is invested in hedge funds, according to the General Treasurer’s office. Fees are paid on all those investments. So how much was paid to hedge funds? We looked at the expense analysis for the 2013 fiscal year, which is available on the website for the General Treasurer. According to the document, the state paid $69.1 million in investment fees that year. Of that amount, $24.8 million went to equity hedge funds and $20.6 million went to absolute return hedge funds -- for a total of $45.4 million -- $25 million less than the number cited in the Fung commercial. That figure, or one very close to it, has been published by the media on numerous occasions. The first report we could find that included it was a June 2013 PolitiFact Rhode Island item. Since then, it has been cited in The Journal in at least five separate stories in 2013 and 2014. The fees for the 2013 fiscal year were made public more than a year ago. We were curious when numbers for the 2014 fiscal year, which ended June 30, would be available. The Treasurer’s office told us that they wouldn’t be ready until the end of the year. When the "Friend of Wall Street" commercial first aired, The Journal asked the Fung campaign about the $70-million figure. Spokesman Robert Coupe was quoted in an Oct. 10 story saying that the ad "faults Raimondo for paying $70 million in fees associated with alternative investments just in fiscal year 2013." When we asked Coupe about the figure this week, he said that it’s actually a sum of the $45 million paid in hedge fund fees for fiscal 2013 and an unspecified estimate for fiscal 2014. "Looking at the history of the pension fund and the information known about the rates of return and fee calculations, a conservative estimate of the total fees paid is equal to or exceeds the $70 million claim in the ad," he told us. Our ruling A TV commercial for Allan Fung says that Gina Raimondo paid $70 million in taxpayer money to cover fees to hedge fund managers. The commercial incorrectly cites an Aug. 25, 2013 Journal story as its source. But a raft of other Journal stories do give the exact figure -- about $45 million -- as does the website for the General Treasurer’s office. Fung’s campaign now insists that the figure they quoted is not just for fiscal 2013. They’re also assuming an equal amount or more will be paid in fiscal 2014. The commercial doesn’t say that, but that may be reasonable over the longer haul. If the 2014 fees are as much as they were in 2013, the two-year total would easily reach $70 million. (And even though the Fung campaign didn’t mention it, let’s not forget the $16 million paid in hedge fund fees in fiscal 2012.) But by citing only a 2013 Journal story, the ad implies that the fees were paid only in 2013. Finally, the commercial’s claim that Raimondo herself paid taxpayer money to hedge fund managers is misleading at best. Raimondo has recommended increasing hedge fund investments, but she is not solely responsible for how the state invests its pension fund. The 10-member State Investment Commission, of which she is the chairwoman, makes all decisions. Because the statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, we rule it Mostly False.

pomt-04866	Aaron Bean voted to give illegal immigrants in-state tuition.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/09/floridians-ethics-and-truth-politics/pro-weinstein-group-says-aaron-bean-voted-give-tui/	Looking for a way to attack a fellow Republican in a hard-fought primary contest? How about a 2005 vote on illegal immigration? Aaron Bean, a former House member, is challenging Rep. Mike Weinstein for the redrawn state Senate seat that covers residents outside of Jacksonville and all of Nassau County. The primary is Aug. 14. A pro-Weinstein group, Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, launched the attack with a commercial saying, "Bean voted for in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants." "That’s right. Bean voted to give illegal immigrants in-state tuition breaks, a policy supported by liberals like Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi and opposed by conservatives like Rick Scott and Mike Weinstein," the ad says. "Aaron Bean: Wrong on illegal immigration. Wrong for Jacksonville." An outraged Bean responded in an interview with Rich Jones of Jacksonville radio station WOKV. "It’s disappointing when they don’t tell the truth," Bean said. "Just this week, they’re making just crazy claims that Aaron Bean is in favor of illegal aliens getting reduced tuition, and nothing, Rich, could be further from the truth. Never have supported that, never will support that. But that’s the claim that the other side is making in our race, and that’s just crazy." Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics blasted missives to the Florida Times-Union and Miami Herald that questioned Bean’s recollection of the vote. In a written statement, Bean’s spokeswoman tried to quell the drama by saying Bean did not believe the legislation extended benefits to illegal immigrants. "To avoid any future confusion let me be clear, Aaron Bean did not support extending any benefits to illegal immigrants," spokeswoman Sarah Bascom said. "He did not then, and he does not now." The emphatic denials led to another commercial from Floridians for Truth and Ethics in Politics. The group, an electioneering communication organization chaired by Republican consultant Mike Hanna, accused Bean of lying about the tuition discounts for illegal immigrants and of voting two years later to give illegal aliens health insurance subsidies. With so much back-and-forth, we wanted to dive into the Senate District 4 race and examine the claim that started it all: "Aaron Bean voted for in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants." Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics (a mouthful) is not directly part of Weinstein’s campaign, but it has received all of its money this cycle from a fundraising group controlled by Weinstein, reported the Florida Times-Union. The ad cites a bill from the 2005 legislative session as backup for its claim that Bean voted to give illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates. The proposal, HCB 6005, was a combination of several education-oriented bills, and Bean signed on as a cosponsor. Among the proposal’s offerings: creating a program to offer discounted computers and Internet access for students; expanding the capacity of Florida nursing programs; and allowing community colleges to offer some baccalaureate degree programs. One part (originating from H 119, which Bean did not co-sponsor) would have allowed for certain undocumented students to apply for in-state college tuition rates. Those students would have had to fulfill the following requirements, according to a nonpartisan House analysis: • Lived in Florida with a parent for at least three consecutive years immediately before receiving a diploma from a Florida high school • Enrolled and registered in a community college or state university • Given the institution a sworn affidavit stating he or she will apply for permanent U.S. residency • Submitted an application for the exemption The out-of-state tuition exemption would have been available only to the state’s top 2,000 highest performing undocumented students. "People think that students are asking for scholarships. They don’t realize that it means the students that have lived in the state and graduated from our high schools are paying more," said Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy. "It’s not a handout." The measure passed the House by a whopping 113-2 vote. House Republicans who voted yes that day include Sen. Marco Rubio, current Speaker Dean Cannon, Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll and U.S. Reps. David Rivera and Sandy Adams. Oh, and Aaron Bean. The Senate did not take up the measure. Current Senate President Mike Haridopolos took a hard-line approach back then, telling the Tampa Tribune "If you get an in-state tuition rate, it's 75 percent off. That 75 doesn't come out of thin air. It comes from hard-working Floridians and taxpayers … They have proven to be outstanding workers. They work hard and help our economy run, but there are rules. Illegal is illegal." In an interview with the Times-Union, Bean reportedly said he did not know the provision was part of the 100-page bill. "The bill did a lot of things," Bean said, according to an Aug. 3 Times-Union story. "If I knew there was the tuition thing in there, I would not have voted for it." We can't let Bean off so easy. Yes, the final combined bill was 100 pages and spanned many education topics. But all Bean had to do was read the bill analysis, published on April 27, 2012, the day after the combined bill was filed. The analysis shows the big bill clearly incorporated the language of HB 119 and outlined the requirements for undocumented students to receive in-state tuition rates. Our ruling Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics says "Bean voted for in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants." It's true that in 2005, Bean voted for a wide-ranging House bill that would have allowed up to 2,000 undocumented students to receive in-state tuition rates. But only some undocumented students would have received the in-state tuition rates -- specifically, high-achieving students who lived in Florida and graduated from Florida high schools. Whether Bean meant to vote for the bill is a different story. Sometimes legislators sneak provisions into bills at the last minute that go unnoticed. We don't see any evidence that happened here. Bean is responsible for knowing what is inside the bills that earn his votes, even if they are long. This claim is accurate but needs a little clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03700	A bipartisan background check amendment "outlawed any (gun) registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/obama-says-bipartisan-background-check-plan-outlaw/	President Barack Obama accused the "gun lobby and its allies" of lying about a bipartisan background check proposal that failed Wednesday in the Senate. From the Rose Garden, he charged: "They claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn't matter." The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Did it, in fact, outlaw any gun registry? ‘A path to a national gun registry’ The government requires background checks for gun sales by licensed firearms dealers — but not for sales between folks who aren’t in the business of selling guns. Manchin and Toomey’s amendment expanded the background check requirement to sales at gun shows and those advertised in publications and on the Web. But it didn’t go as far as the original bill, which required background checks for all gun transfers with limited exceptions. That compromise wasn’t enough to attract the 60-vote supermajority required to pass the amendment. It failed on a 54 to 46 vote. Opponents had, indeed, raised the specter of a national gun registry. "If your private gun transaction is covered by Toomey-Schumer-Manchin (and virtually all will be) ... you can assume you will be part of a national gun registry," wrote Michael Hammond of lobbying group Gun Owners of America. The existing background checks require filling out ATF Form 4473. That personal information is then run through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The government is supposed to destroy personally identifying information, but gun dealers are required to store the forms. The government is then allowed to inspect them in the course of criminal investigations or to ensure gun dealers keep the records they’re supposed to keep. So what did the Manchin-Toomey amendment say about a registry? First, it made reference to federal law that already bans creation of a federal registry. Since the mid 1980s, it’s been against federal law for information from background checks to be "recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions be established." That’s why, if you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the FBI is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. The Manchin-Toomey amendment doubled down on this ban, declaring: "Congress supports and reaffirms the existing prohibition on a national firearms registry." It also declared that nothing in the legislation should be construed to "allow the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a federal firearms registry." Later, it added these provisions: • "The Attorney General shall be prohibited from seizing any records or other documents in the course of an inspection or examination authorized by this paragraph other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law." • "The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the records of the ... acquisition or disposition of firearms, or any portion thereof." • "Any person who knowingly violates (the prohibition against consolidating or centralizing records) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.'' So, the amendment prohibited the centralizing of federal records — and added the threat of prison. But those protections didn’t reassure gun rights proponents. The National Rifle Association argues that gun control supporters believe expanding background checks is a precursor to gun confiscation. An Arizona gun group spokesman told us the federal government would illegally collect background check information submitted to the FBI. Sarah Palin, arguing against the Toomey-Manchin amendment, said it "creates a path to a national gun registry" since dealers store background check forms and the bill didn’t explicitly ban copying them, storing them in various locations (rather than centrally), or keeping a list of them. She didn’t mention that existing federal law — referenced by the bill — already prohibits "any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions." Our ruling Obama said opponents of compromise gun legislation "claimed that it would create some sort of ‘big brother’ gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text." The Manchin-Toomey amendment referenced a registry ban already in federal law, then expanded it, prohibiting seizure of records, forbidding the attorney general from consolidating or centralizing records, and providing for fines and imprisonment for anyone who did consolidate or centralize records.

pomt-09368	"On the day that (the Republican) state leader resigned in disgrace, a ‘Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/30/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-florida-gop-rotting-carcass/	When one of his challengers switched from being a Republican to the Tea Party, Orlando Democrat Alan Grayson issued a news release that included another memorable series of one-liners. Yes, he's the guy who compared former Vice President Dick Cheney to a vampire and called Sarah Palin a wild Alaskan dingbat. "I read (Peg) Dunmire’s announcement," Grayson said in a March 23, 2010, press release. "I then forwarded it to the Guinness Book of World Records, for consideration under the category 'Most Consecutive Cliches.' This kind of right-wing drivel gave America $4-a-gallon gas and two endless wars, and drove us all to the brink of national bankruptcy. Was she living in a cave for eight years?" Grayson then explained why he thought Dunmire decided not to run as a Republican. "Dunmire is not running as a Republican, because the Republican Party of Florida smells worse than a rotting carcass," he said. "The stench reaches all the way to the Georgia state line. For goodness' sake, on the day that their state leader resigned in disgrace, a 'Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters." At PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to thoroughly analyze Grayson's claim about the Guinness Book of World Records. But alas, there is no "Most Consecutive Cliche" category. (We checked). So we settled on Grayson's accusation that on the day former Republican Party of Florida chairman Jim Greer resigned, a "Shred-It" truck was spotted at the party headquarters. Greer, who was chosen by Gov. Charlie Crist, resigned under pressure from big GOP donors Jan. 5, 2010, after a series of stories documented troubled spending patterns of state party political donations. Greer suggested he was a victim of a witch hunt. On the day he resigned, reporters working in Tallahassee did notice a white "Shred-It" truck parked outside RPOF headquarters. Indeed, it was a mobile paper shredding company. Whitney Ray of the Capitol News Service filed the first report that day: "It was a quiet and somber day outside the Republican Party of Florida headquarters, the only noise was traffic, and the sound of a paper shredding truck. "The driver came out wheeling an empty cart and a blue bag, one hour before embattled chairman Jim Greer made this announcement, on a conference call with reporters." A party spokeswoman said the timing of the Shred-It visit was just a coincidence. The mobile shredder comes monthly and just happened to coincide with the day Greer was announcing his resignation. But there was the image nevertheless. In mocking Republicans and his new Tea Party challenger, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson said that on the day the state party chairman resigned, "a 'Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters." It did. We rate his statement True.

pomt-11223	Says Benito Mussolini "initiated a campaign to 'drenare la palude' ('drain the swamp') by firing more than 35,000 civil servants."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/09/madeleine-albright/madeleine-albright-right-about-mussolini-and-drain/	One of Donald Trump’s more memorable campaign slogans was his promise to "drain the swamp," a push to end corruption in Washington. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That phrase showed up recently in an unexpected place: a book by Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton. The publication of Albright’s Fascism: A Warning during the Trump era is not coincidental. "Why, this far into the twenty-first century, are we once again talking about fascism?" Albright wrote. "One reason, frankly, is Donald Trump. If we think of fascism as a wound from the past that had almost healed, Trump in the White House was like ripping off the bandage and picking at the scab." Albright went on to describe the rise of Benito Mussolini, Italy’s fascist leader in the early 20th century. She wrote that Mussolini used the phrase "drain the swamp" when he made moves to overhaul the country’s unpopular government bureaucracy. "He knew that citizens were fed up with a bureaucracy that seemed to grow bigger and less efficient each year, so he insisted on daily roll calls in ministry offices and berated employees for arriving late to work or taking long lunches. "He initiated a campaign to 'drenare la palude' ('drain the swamp') by firing more than 35,000 civil servants," Albright wrote. A PolitiFact reader was struck by this linguistic link and wondered whether the Italian fascist leader had really been the source of Trump's famous phrase. So we asked U.S. and Italian historians about it. We found that Mussolini’s government made a big point of draining literal swamps, as public works projects, and he did conduct mass firings of civil servants. In addition, Mussolini touted the metaphor of purification as a defining principle of his political philosophy. "We can understand fascism's social, agricultural, and racial policies through the concept of ‘reclamation’ — draining or cleansing something to regenerate or remake it," said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and author of Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945. However, Mussolini does not seem to have used the Italian version of Trump’s "drain the swamp" term. Indeed, the phrase’s origin appears to be as American as apple pie. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Benito Mussolini salutes a crowd in Rome. (Wikimedia Commons) Mussolini and the Pontine marshes The swamps Mussolini sought to drain are known as the Pontine marshes. Located on the outskirts of Rome, the marshes were unhealthy and largely uninhabited for centuries due to malaria. Several years into his tenure as Italy’s leader, Mussolini made a big push to drain the marshes, building new towns with modernist architecture and settling the area. The government installed "six pumps as huge and noisy as airplanes," as the New York Times put it, in an effort to "pull millions of gallons of water — up to 9,500 gallons a second — out of the soggy ground, directing it into an elaborate system of cement-lined canals that ultimately dump it into the sea." The region’s infrastructure was damaged during World War II, but it was repaired after the war and became a fertile area for growing fruits, vegetables and livestock. The town of Latina doesn’t shrink from its Mussolini heritage; in 2015, Newsweek reported that locals retain affection for the fascist leader and the buildings he constructed. "Not every aspect of the Pontine marshes was a success, but for the most part the regime, and outsiders, viewed it as such," said Michael R. Ebner, a Syracuse University historian and author of The Politics of Everyday Life in Fascist Italy. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com A portion of the Pontine marshes near Rome. (Creative commons) From literal swamps to metaphorical swamps So Mussolini literally drained the swamps. But he also liked the metaphor, and he sought to apply it to other areas of Italian life. "The term the regime used for land reclamation was ‘bonifica,’" Ebner said. "In English, it might be translated as ‘reclamation,’ as in land reclamation, but was also used more generally by the regime for reclaiming the race or the state." David I. Kertzer, a Brown University professor and author of The Pope and Mussolini, said Albright’s comment describes the purging of the bureaucracy accurately early in Mussolini’s tenure. "Mussolini attacked the bloated public payroll and, in line with this, in the first months of his coming to power, he fired 36,000 workers for the state-owned railroad," Kertzer said. The subsequent land reclamation in the Pontine marshes "gave the regime confidence that it could expand Italian territory and engage in projects of fascist social engineering," Ebner said. "These goals were highly relevant to fascism going forward." Ultimately, Mussolini followed a philosophy of " ‘bonifica umana,’ or human reclamation, which had to do with remaking the Italians eugenically and also racial policies to keep Italians pure," Ben-Ghiat said. At the same time, most of the experts we contacted agreed that Mussolini didn’t use the catchphrase drenare la palude, or "drain the swamp," to refer to his metaphorical efforts. "I don’t think this phrase was a big deal for Mussolini or his regime," said Richard Bosworth, a historian affiliated with Oxford University who has written two books about Mussolini and his era. The written record supports the historians’ recollections. Barry Popik, who has blogged extensively about etymology, scoured a variety of online databases commonly used by etymologists and found essentially no examples of the phrase drenare la palude during Mussolini’s time. So where did the phrase "drain the swamp" originate? The English phrase "drain the swamp" appeared at least as long ago as 1903, in an Oshkosh, Wis., newspaper. "Socialists are not satisfied with killing a few of the mosquitoes which come from the capitalist swamp; they want to drain the swamp," the newspaper wrote, quoting a Social Democratic Party organizer. Two other prominent members of the socialist or social democratic movements used the term in similar contexts: Victor Berger in 1912 and Mary Harris (Mother) Jones in 1913. That said, the phrase remained rare until about 1970, Popik found, and it didn’t really catch on until President Ronald Reagan used it in 1983 to take a shot at the Washington bureaucracy. Popik suggests that, rather than referring to the Pontine marshes, "drain the swamp" probably came from a folksy aphorism that posits that "when you’re up to your neck in alligators, it’s easy to forget that the initial objective was to drain the swamp." Through her publisher, Albright's communications staff agreed with our finding that "drain the swamp" or its Italian-language equivalent was not a major slogan for Mussolini's government. They said her point was to draw attention to his actions of purging the bureaucracy. "The reference in Dr. Albright’s book is not to a specific statement by Mussolini, but rather to the Italian dictator’s policy of purging the bureaucracy," Albright's office said in a statement. Our ruling Albright said Mussolini "initiated a campaign to 'drenare la palude' ('drain the swamp') by firing more than 35,000 civil servants." She’s on target about Mussolini’s bureaucracy-busting efforts, as well as the importance of draining swamps — both literal and figurative — within his fascist philosophy. However, experts said Mussolini did not use the Italian version of Trump’s "drain the swamp" term, weakening Albright's rhetorical connection between the leaders. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-03981	"Our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012."	true	/florida/statements/2013/feb/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-us-economy-shrank-last-quarter-20/	During the televised Republican response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union Address, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio criticized Obama’s handling of the economy. "Economic growth is the best way to help the middle class," Rubio said during the Feb. 12, 2013,response. "Unfortunately, our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012." Is that correct? We located the announcement from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal agency that calculates gross domestic product, or GDP -- the benchmark statistic for measuring the size of the economy. On Jan. 30, 2013, the bureau announced that in the final quarter of 2012, GDP shrunk by 0.1 percent -- a small enough decline to prompt the qualifier "slightly" in the news release’s headline, yet notable because it represented the first quarterly decline in GDP since the second quarter of 2009, when the economy was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month. The fourth-quarter decline was striking because the third quarter had seen GDP growth of 3.1 percent, the third-fastest quarterly expansion since the end of the recession. The bureau cited several reasons for the decline, most notably a fall in defense spending. Economists said the data was not necessarily a sign that the economy was heading back into recession, and indeed, within a few days, a different federal agency -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- released rosier data on job growth, showing a monthly increase of 157,000 jobs in January, plus upward revisions of two prior months totaling 127,000 jobs. Our ruling It’s too early to say whether the fourth-quarter decline in GDP represents a reversal of economic fortune or just a blip, so it’s prudent not to place too much weight on one quarter’s worth of data. But we have no quarrel with the way Rubio phrased it -- that the economy "actually shrank during the last three months of 2012." We rate his statement True.

In a recent press release, the Democratic Party of Oregon accused Starr of coming down hard on unemployed workers at the height of the recession. Starr, the release said, revealed "his hostility to the basic mission of the Bureau of Labor and Industries" with one vote in particular. Back in 2009, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3483. The bill did a few things. First up, it offered a 13-week extension in unemployment benefits. Second, it allowed those who were receiving unemployment benefits to turn down work, so long as they were enrolled in a worker training program and the job paid less than 110 percent of minimum wage. The measure passed pretty overwhelmingly in the House with 47 members voting in favor. It was the same story in the Senate where 25 voted "yes." Starr, however, was one of four who voted "no." "At the time, Bruce Starr's vote would have thrown 6,000 Oregonians off unemployment," the press release alleges. PolitiFact Oregon decided to do a little digging. First, we pulled up the legislative fiscal analysis of the bill. It mentioned that 2,400 additional claimants would be added to the program each year if the bill passed, but it didn’t say anything about 6,000 people losing their benefits. We asked folks at the Democratic Party of Oregon where they got the number and they pointed us to a story that appeared in The Oregonian, which attributed the figure to "the state."Still, we needed the actual source. After a few more phone calls, we were pointed toward Craig Spivey, a spokesman with the Oregon Employment Department. He confirmed the number. Back when the bill was passed, folks could stay on unemployment for about 100 weeks, thanks to a series of federal and state extensions passed for the recession. That time frame has since been reduced to the more standard 26 weeks. We called Sen. Starr to see why he voted the way he did on the legislation. He said he was more concerned about the change in policy that allowed (albeit temporarily) those on unemployment to turn down work. "That's a significant departure," he said. "The goal is, we need people to get back to work, we need to create an environment where people have jobs." Without the bill, it’s clear, based on numbers from the Unemployment Department, that 6,000 people would have been cycled off unemployment. (In fact, that number is closer to 12,000 if you consider the full life of the extension.) That said, we think there’s a difference between voting against an extension and actively voting to kick people off of something -- as the Democrats allege. Moreover, the bill wasn’t a matter of a simple extension; it also temporarily allowed certain beneficiaries to turn down work. In the end, we think the claim is partially accurate but leaves out some important context. We rate this claim Half True. CORRECTION: Democratic Reps. Mary Nolan and Brad Witt sponsored House Bill 3483, legislation passed in 2009 that extended the number of weeks an individual living in Oregon could collect unemployment benefits. Rep. Bill Garrard, a Republican from Klamath Falls, had initially sponsored a different bill under the same number, but dropped his support after the content was changed. An earlier version of this PolitiFact Oregon item was incorrect on the bill's sponsorship.

pomt-13615	Hillary Clinton "has already said she's going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment"	false	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/12/chris-collins/clintons-views-do-not-go-against-constitution/	Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in the Iraq War, accused Donald Trump of not reading the Constitution. Rep. Chris Collins, a Trump supporter, turned the claim around on Hillary Clinton. During an interview on MSNBC, Collins made assertions about Clinton’s views on the Constitution in the context of the Gold Star father’s Democratic National Convention speech. "He stood next to Hillary Clinton, who has already said she's going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment." Collins said during the interview. "That was absolutely hypocritical." Collins based his claims on a few of Clinton’s positions. She has criticized the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that deemed spending money to influence elections "free speech" that may not be limited. She supports gun control. Collins said he also believes Clinton will continue to issue executive orders similar to those by President Obama. His office says that practice violates the 10th Amendment. Is Collins right about Clinton’s positions on the First, Second, and 10th Amendments? The First Amendment Hillary Clinton does not agree with the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission. The Supreme Court held in the case that restrictions could not be placed on how corporations spend money to influence an election. In the opinion of the court, since corporations have the same rights as individuals, they are also guaranteed free speech under the First Amendment. That does not mean Clinton does not believe in the First Amendment. It means she, like many others, does not agree with the court’s interpretation of the First Amendment in this case. The Second Amendment The Supreme Court has ruled the Second Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to bear arms. Clinton supports gun control policies that gun-rights advocates call contrary to its interpretation. Clinton said in her speech to the Democratic National Convention that she was "not here to repeal the Second Amendment." In an interview on ABC's 'This Week,' Clinton said, "I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment." PolitiFact earlier this year rated as False Trump’s claim that Clinton "wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment. The 10th Amendment Republicans have criticized President Barack Obama’s use of executive orders to address issues Congress has not acted on. Clinton’s campaign has said in the past she would consider using that power, too, if she cannot reach agreements with Congress. Collins calls that a slippery slope to violating the Constitution. The 10th Amendment reinforces the idea of federalism. Some laws are decided at the state level while others are under federal control. We spoke to constitutional law experts Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School and Matthew Steilen from the University at Buffalo about Collins' claim. In this case, they said executive actions and orders typically do not directly contradict the 10th Amendment. The argument stems partly from Obama’s actions on gun control earlier this year and immigration in 2014. Executive actions are not new. George Washington even issued them. Obama has issued more than many presidents, but fewer than others. Ronald Reagan issued 381, while Obama issued 244 through July. Our ruling In an interview on MSNBC, Collins said Clinton is "going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment." Clinton holds positions that contradict certain interpretations of those amendments, but Collins’ claim is too broad.

pomt-02911	Due to Obamacare, Arkansas "has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-arkansas-has-covered-almost-14-p/	Given the troubled launch of the national health insurance marketplace at healthcare.gov, President Barack Obama has been forced to trumpet good news about his signature health care law wherever it can be found. During a speech on the new law in Boston on Oct. 30, 2013, Obama pointed to examples of states that had succeeded in signing up lots of new enrollees. Hearing one of these states Obama cited -- Arkansas -- struck us as notable, because it has become a solidly red state. In addition, a reader from Arkansas emailed us to see if we could check it out. In the speech, Obama said that Arkansas, a state he didn’t win in 2008 or 2012, "has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already." The White House later reiterated this claim in a tweet. Is it true that Arkansas has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured residents? The state’s Republican Legislature wasn’t inclined to expand Medicaid to adults and families with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level -- as provided for under Obamacare -- but the Democratic governor, Mike Beebe, proposed an alternative. He proposed using the federal payments the law was offering to Arkansas to expand Medicaid and instead give it to qualified Arkansas residents, who would then use it to purchase private insurance plans on the new marketplace. In September, as the Oct. 1 startup date for the new marketplace was approaching, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services gave Arkansas the green light to pursue this effort. It’s been dubbed "the private option." The state sent out notices to potentially eligible residents. Once a recipient of one of these notices returns an application to accept the "private option," the department will check their income eligibility and, if they qualify, will direct them the Insure Ark website to select their plan. (The state does steer a small fraction of those newly eligible -- those with medical issues that can be better treated under Medicaid -- to traditional Medicaid instead.) Even if someone who’s eligible doesn’t select a plan, that person will be automatically assigned a plan by the state. After the person is informed about this automatically assigned plan, they will still have a chance to choose another one if they wish. While the new insurance is set to kick in on Jan. 1, the state considers residents to have completed the coverage process as soon as the department approves their application and directs them to Insure Ark. This mirrors the situation with people who secure coverage from the national healthcare.gov site -- they are considered "signed up" even if their coverage officially starts Jan. 1. When we checked with the Arkansas Department of Human Services, spokeswoman Amy Webb said that through Oct. 26, the state had received 70,595 applications from potentially eligible residents, which probably undercounts the actual number received four days later, when Obama gave his speech. (This figure does not include anyone who’s signed up for the federal plan on healthcare.gov.) Of the 70,595 applicants, Webb said, 65,138 have already been determined eligible. The remaining 5,457 have applications pending and will be processed soon, she said. Webb added that the state has been using the ballpark figure of 500,000 for the number of uninsured residents. Using that figure, 13 percent of uninsured Arkansans have secured insurance through Obamacare. Especially if you account for the extra couple of days’ worth of applications not counted in this figure, this qualifies as the "almost 14 percent" Obama cited. However, to the extent that Obama was using the Arkansas case as an example of how the law was working well, it’s important to note the limitations of his example for a national audience. Residents who are eligible for Arkansas’ private option via Insure Ark only account for a fraction of the state’s uninsured population, perhaps 40 percent. A majority of the uninsured in Arkansas earn too much to qualify for the private option and must instead use a different, and for now, less functional, website -- the national healthcare.gov site. In other words, while the success of Arkansas’ private option is real, using it as an example in a national speech glosses over the fact that the state's uninsured population that doesn't qualify for Medicaid is going to have to use the troubled national website. Our ruling Obama said that due to the health care law, Arkansas "has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already." That number is very close, if not spot on. But it's a case study that has limited application for the rest of the country, because of the state's unique approach to Medicaid. Many of the state's uninsured still have to get coverage from the troubled healthcare.gov website. The statement is accurate but needs additional information or context, so we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-11-04T15:46:58	2013-10-30	['Arkansas']
pomt-06778	"I started with a $3.7 billion budget deficit. Now we are projecting a $1.2 billion surplus."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/18/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-deficit-turned-surplus/	The state's finances are in the black -- with more than a $1 billion surplus, according to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. In an Aug. 10, 2011, interview with the Miami Herald editorial board, Scott summarized the state's financial picture this way: "When I walked into office we were projecting somewhere between a $3.4-3.7 billion budget deficit. Right now we are projecting for the fiscal year that started July 1 a $1.2 billion surplus, on top of that right now state revenues are up a little bit better than that." He repeated that claim Aug. 17 in an interview with CNBC: "I started with a $3.7 billion budget deficit. Now we are projecting a $1.2 billion surplus." Scott's using the language of the federal government, but the state budgeting process is different. Scott referred to a budget "deficit" -- but the state's Constitution forbids a deficit -- not having enough money to pay its expenses. What Scott was referring to is a "shortfall" -- projected revenues falling short of projected expenses. When facing a shortfall, legislators have to come up with a way to erase the gap and balance the books. We wanted to check both of Scott's figures so we turned to Amy Baker, the state's chief economist. Baker sent us this summary showing how they started planning for the 2011-12 year with a shortfall and ended with what Scott called a surplus. The same information -- plus additional details about Florida's budget -- are included in this August 2011 report from the state's Office of Economic and Demographic Research. State budgeting process When the state puts together its long-term financial outlook, it looks at what it would cost to continue existing services taking into account growth factors such as inflation and whether the number of students or prisoners will increase. When the state released its initial long-term financial outlook for the current 2011-12 budget year, economists projected a budget shortfall of about $2.5 billion. But as estimated revenues declined and projected expenditures grew, the shortfall rose to $3.6 billion. That's where Scott got his figure about the "deficit" -- or more accurately, "shortfall." On top of that, legislative leaders decided to increase the state's reserves -- setting aside $1 billion for its general revenue reserve fund. So legislators crafting the 2011-12 budget had to cut $3.6 billion in order to balance the books and an additional $1 billion to offset an increase in reserves. Legislators ultimately cut about $4.5 billion in projected, additional spending from the budget -- eliminating thousands of state jobs and slashing money for schools, hospitals and other services. Combined with Scott's vetoes, the state spent about $181.2 million less then it had available in addition to the $1 billion it set aside in reserves. That's the $1.2 billion "surplus" cited by Scott. (As of July, that figure grew to about $1.3 billion because of increased revenue estimates.) But do you call it a surplus? The dollar figure isn't in dispute, but would we call the unspent reserves a "surplus?" Scott spokesman Lane Wright argued that it is a surplus and sent us a dictionary definition of a surplus: "An amount of something left over when requirements have been met; an excess of production or supply over demand," he wrote. We asked Baker to define surplus. "A surplus means it was available for expenditures," she said. The $1.2 billion was available and the Legislature decided not to spend it and set it aside, she said. "Normal folks in their daily lives might think of 'surplus' as a windfall. It wasn't a windfall -- it was planned, it is still a surplus. The more accurate term would be 'reserve' since they planned to do it. It's really more clear to say 'reserve' but surplus isn't wrong. ... It is only a surplus to the extent that it wasn't appropriated." Technically, the state's economists including Baker call the extra money "planned general revenue reserve after appropriations" or "unallocated general revenue," not a "surplus." And in fact, having money left over is commonplace. Baker provided us a chart that shows Florida having "unallocated general revenue" every year since the 1984-85 budget year. The amount of leftover money has fluctuated from year to year. From 1984-2003, the size of the reserve has generally been less than $400 million. The reserve fund grew to a peak of $1.9 billion in 2006-07, before decreasing. Wright, the governor's spokesman, sent us a different chart showing the general revenue fund financial statement as of July 27, 2011. That chart doesn't use the word "surplus" but it shows an ending balance for the 2011-12 year of about $1.3 billion. The balance was $433 million for the 2010-11 year (Charlie Crist's last as governor) and about $1.5 billion the year before that. That means, by Scott's definition, Crist left office with both a $433 million surplus and a $3.6 billion deficit. How can that be? Because Scott is comparing apples to oranges -- a projected budget shortfall that accounts for growth and inflation, versus an actual budget "surplus" that is a result of the state's requirement that legislators pass a balanced budget. No matter how big a projected shortfall the state has at the beginning of its budgeting process, it will end up with some type of "surplus" as Scott calls it, or "reserve" as Baker calls it. "We can't end the year with a deficit," she said. "They cannot pass a budget that's not balanced." Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, said that Scott should have used the word "shortfall" rather than deficit but generally agreed with Scott characterizing the money as a surplus. But he also agreed that the two figures are analyzing different things. Wenner described the shortfall as a soft number while the surplus is an actual number. Our ruling Let's go back to Scott's statement. He said, "When I walked into office we were projecting somewhere between a $3.4-3.7 billion budget deficit. Right now we are projecting for the fiscal year that started July 1 a $1.2 billion surplus." Scott's numbers are generally right but his word choice is problematic and the comparison is misleading. The Legislature had to cut around $3.6 billion from the amount of money it was expected to have to spend in 2011-12. It wasn't a deficit -- which would mean the state didn't have the money to pay its bills -- but rather a projected shortfall. After making those cuts -- and cutting an additional $1 billion so it could beef up its reserves -- the state now has around $1.3 billion more than it needs to pay its bill as part of the 2011-12 budget. But having the extra money is actually common practice for the state. In fact, after Crist's last budget as governor, the state had an extra $433 million, or as Scott would say, a "surplus." It also had a projected $3.6 billion shortfall. See the problem in making the comparison? In reality, the state ends most every year with what Scott calls a surplus because the state is required to pass a balanced budget and generally can't borrow money to pay its bills. And in recent years, because state revenue has been declining, the state enters the next year with a projected "deficit" using Scott's word -- or more accurately a shortfall. The fact is that while Scott has his numbers right, he's comparing apples to oranges to paint his fiscal policies in the best light. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13658	"I’m beating (Kelly Ayotte) in the polls by a lot."	pants on fire!	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/aug/05/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-about-doing-better-/	Presidential nominee Donald Trump waded into New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate race this week, claiming he is doing better than fellow Republican Kelly Ayotte in statewide polls. "You have a Kelly Ayotte, who doesn’t want to talk about Trump, but I’m beating her in the polls by a lot," Trump told the Washington Post in an interview on Aug. 2. "I don’t know Kelly Ayotte. I know she’s given me no support, zero support, and yet I’m leading her in the polls." Do the numbers bear that out? We took a closer look. Of course, the Republican businessman is running for president, not against Ayotte for Senate. But we interpreted his comment as saying he is having a better showing in polls in New Hampshire. Trump didn’t name any specific polls in his interview, and his campaign did not provide source material or respond to a request for comment. So we looked at their favorability ratings among the state’s voters, and also examined how tight their races are in New Hampshire. We turned to RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks polling data and calculates an average of the most recent voter surveys. The site’s New Hampshire presidential polling average showed that on Aug. 2, when Trump made the comment, Democrat Hillary Clinton led the businessman in the state, 43.25 percent to 40.5 percent, a margin of nearly three percentage points. By contrast, the RealClearPolitics.com polling average for the state’s U.S. Senate race showed that Ayotte was virtually tied with Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan, 45.8 to 45.2 percent, on the same day. Those averages have since changed slightly. WBUR released a new poll two days after Trump’s interview that showed both Democrats widening their leads in New Hampshire. Clinton led Trump by 15 percentage points, the new survey showed, while Hassan led Ayotte by 10. So, not only is Trump not "beating (Ayotte) in the polls by a lot," he’s not beating her in the polls at all. Ayotte is doing better than Trump in New Hampshire. Just to be extra careful, we also checked to see whether there was a period in which Trump was performing better against Clinton than Ayotte was against Hassan but couldn’t find one in the RealClearPolitics.com archive. How about favorability ratings, which show how warmly voters feel towards a candidate, rather than whether they would or would not vote for them in an election matchup? The most recent WMUR Granite State Poll, released in late July, showed that Trump had a net favorability of negative 29 percent, while Ayotte scored a positive two percent net favorability rating. (Net favorability refers to the candidate’s favorability score minus his or her unfavorability score.) Specifically, the survey found 32 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, while 61 percent had an unfavorable opinion of the businessman. Six percent were neutral. And the poll showed that 42 percent of state voters had a favorable opinion of Ayotte, 40 percent had an unfavorable view, seven percent were neutral and 11 percent didn’t know enough to say. The WBUR poll, released on August 4 after Trump’s comment, showed similar patterns. Twenty-nine percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, it found, while 60 percent had an unfavorable opinion, with 10 percent are undecided. The same poll showed 42 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Ayotte, compared to 38 percent who had an unfavorable opinion. Sixteen percent were undecided and three percent hadn’t heard of her or refused to answer. So the two recent polls showed that Ayotte’s favorability rating in the Granite State was far higher than Trump’s. Our ruling Trump said he is beating Ayotte in the polls "by a lot." However, Ayotte recent surveys have shown that New Hampshire voters view Ayotte more favorably than Trump. The polls also indicate that Ayotte is locked in a closer race against her Democratic challenger than Trump.

pomt-02028	Medicare is "going broke. The trust fund goes bankrupt in 2026."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/05/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-medicare-going-bankrupt/	Generally speaking, 7.65 percent of your paycheck is withheld for FICA -- 6.2 percent for Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare. If your annual pay is $46,000, the average for full-time-working Americans, the Medicare portion of those Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes approaches $700 per year. It’s not enough, according to U.S. House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. Not that the Wisconsin Republican is angling for a tax increase. Ryan’s point, made at a WisPolitics.com event on May 5, 2014, is that Medicare must be reformed because it is "going broke. The trust fund goes bankrupt in 2026." We've long heard that the nation’s largest health insurance program faces future trouble as health care expenditures continue to rise and the Baby Boom generation continues to gray. Indeed, retirees can expect to receive $3 in Medicare benefits for every $1 they paid in Medicare taxes. But is the program really headed for the rocks? Medicare primer Medicare, which pays for medical care for senior citizens, as well as for younger people with certain disabilities, covers 51 million people. At a cost approaching $500 billion per year, it accounts for about 14 percent of all federal outlays -- third behind defense spending and Social Security. Medicare has two main components: Part A -- Hospital Insurance. Helps pay for hospital, home health following hospital stays, skilled nursing facilities and hospice care. Most people pay no premiums. The primary source of financing for Part A is the FICA payroll withholding. In other words, it’s pay-as-you-go: the contributions of current workers (and their employers) finance the care for current beneficiaries. If revenue exceeds expenditures in a given year, the extra money goes into the Part A trust fund. And when expenditures are higher, the trust fund gets tapped. Part B -- Supplementary Medical Insurance. Helps pay for physician, outpatient hospital, home health and other services. Medicare recipients can opt for these benefits and they pay premiums. Most of the costs for Part B are covered by the government’s general fund and, to a lesser extent, premiums paid by beneficiaries. Part B also has a trust fund. But it’s different from Part A in that whenever expenditures exceed revenue, the difference is automatically covered by transfers from the general fund. So, as structured, it can’t go broke, though it could draw an increasing amount from the general fund. There is also a Part C -- Medicare Advantage, which is a private-insurance alternative to Part A and has no trust fund. And there is Part D, a prescription drug benefit included in Part B. Regarding Ryan’s claim, we’re concerned only with Parts A and Part B. Ryan’s evidence Ryan advocates reforming Medicare into a "premium support" program in which retirees, starting in 2024, would get money to pay toward the cost of traditional Medicare or competing private plans. To back his claim about Medicare’s financial condition, Ryan cited four excerpts from the latest annual report of the Medicare trustees, published in May 2013. The excerpts address the trust fund for Part A, which is a common way -- albeit an incomplete one -- of measuring Medicare’s overall financial health. One excerpt says: "Payment of expenditures in full and on time will continue to require redemption of trust fund assets most years until the (Part A) trust fund’s depletion in 2026." In other words, it's projected that in 2026, not only will expenditures exceed revenues for Part A (hospital care), but the trust fund available to cover the difference -- $220 billion, according to the report -- will be zero. So, what to make of Ryan's characterization of Medicare going broke or bankrupt? More to consider The trustees’ report concludes that "Congress and the executive branch must work closely together with a sense of urgency to address the depletion" of the Part A trust fund and the projected growth in expenditures throughout the Medicare program. But PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker have all rated claims similar Ryan’s (including some previously made by Ryan) and have all concluded that saying Medicare is going bankrupt goes too far. PolitiFact Ohio, for example, rated as False a 2012 claim by singer Pat Boone, a spokesman for the conservative 60 Plus Association, that Medicare would be bankrupt in nine years. Some key points: Since 1970, five years after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare into law, there have repeatedly been projections of the Part A trust fund running out of money. Over the years, Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower spending to keep the fund from going dry. Even if the Part A (hospitals) trust fund ran out, the report Ryan cites projects that revenue would still be enough to pay 87 percent of the Part A expenses. Not a good situation, perhaps, but also not Medicare being bankrupt or shutting down. The projected depletion of the Part A trust fund in 2026 is nine years later than what the Medicare trustees projected in 2009, the year before the adoption of the Affordable Care Act, according to Medicare expert Paul Van de Water of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that Part B is not projected to run out of money and that Part A would continue operating, though providing fewer benefits, even if it’s trust fund becomes depleted. But she said that Ryan’s claim underscores the overall point that Medicare’s current structure is not financially viable. Our rating Ryan said: Medicare is "going broke. The trust fund goes bankrupt in 2026." The trust fund for Medicare Part A (primarily hospitals) is projected to be exhausted in 2026, but that doesn’t mean the program would be bankrupt or stop operating. Part A would continue to receive revenue and continue to operate, albeit at a reduced level, if Congress doesn’t make any changes in Medicare -- even though, since 1970, Congress has always made changes to keep the trust fund solvent. Meanwhile, there is no projection that the other parts of Medicare will run out of money. For a statement that contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Ryan a Mostly False.

pomt-09068	Canada "does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/28/mary-landrieu/sen-mary-landrieu-says-us-doesnt-allow-open-water-/	While discussing the continuing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico recently on Meet the Press, David Gregory asked Senator Mary Landrieu, "Is there a problem here of a learning curve, Senator?" Gregory added that "we know the federal government's not equipped to stop the, the spill or plug the leak. You've got to have that level of expertise. But it does seem, and Thad Allen even referred to that in The Wall Street Journal this week, as if there is a learning curve because nobody's got the experience to deal with a large-scale spill like this." "We're all on a learning curve,'' Landrieu responded. "I learned this week that Canada ... for instance, does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States. Maybe we should think about that." She added that "this is like going through something where we've never had a fire drill." We were curious about the two related claims: Whether Canada does such practice sessions in open water, and whether the United States does not. Canada does practice controlled oil spills in the open water. In a congressional hearing featuring Kevin Costner, the woman sitting to his left, Dr. Nancy Kinner, the co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, mentioned that both Canada and Norway have controlled oil spills so that they can test new technologies. The United States does not share that capability with their neighbor to the north, according to Kinner. "The United States is the only country that does oil spill R&D that has no opportunity to actually have on-water controlled spills to test technology," Kinner told members of Congress. The Minerals Management Service confirms that "the U.S. prohibits training with real oil in the open ocean or conducting testing of equipment, technologies or methodologies with real oil in the open ocean. In North America testing, training and research using real oil is conducted in test tanks and in laboratories." According to the Evironmental Protection Agency, it is technically possible to obtain a permit to spill oil on the open ocean through the EPA, but that type of permit has not been granted for at least 20 years. As of now, the main training capability inside the U.S. is the National Oil Spill Response Research & Renewable Energy Test Facility, also known as Ohmsett. Real oil is used inside the training facility, but that is an enclosed system. The advantages of the Ohmsett system include the ability to control for all variables, allowing participants to test in a variety of different conditions. However, many experts, including Kinner, believes there is value to testing in the real world. "I think we need to open up that possibility,'' she said, "that we have small releases where we can have open water testing, outside of Ohmsett, to test the in real world conditions, instead of in a big test tank." The U.S. does have the Ohmsett's testing facility, and MMS has participated in the open-water exercises in Canada and Norway, so Landrieu overstates the situation when she says it is the equivalent to never having a fire drill. Landrieu is right when she says that Canada practices in open water for oil spills, and that such testing is de facto prohibited here because the EPA has not issued a permit in two decades. Still, the application process does exist. It remains legally possible to ask for permission. So we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-12353	Says former FBI Director James Comey admitted to leaking classified information.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jun/09/north-carolina-republican-party/james-comey-hearings-did-former-fbi-director-admit/	Not long after former FBI Director James Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, 2017, about his relationship with and firing by President Donald Trump, the North Carolina Republican Party sprang to impugn Comey’s credibility. "James Comey's only accomplishment today was proving once and for all that President Trump was right to fire him," said Robin Hayes, the chairman of the N.C. GOP, in an official party statement. "It is a matter of national security when disgruntled employees leak classified information, which is exactly what Comey admitted to doing with his notes." The accusation that Comey admitted to leaking classified information, possibly damaging national security, quickly caught our attention. If true, Comey might have committed a federal crime under the Espionage Act. If found guilty he could be fined, imprisoned or even sentenced to death, depending on the severity of the offense. Hayes’ claim, however, has no basis in reality. In fact, the opposite is true. Comey’s memo This claim revolves around a memo described to the press by a friend of Comey’s. In May, Trump fired Comey and then tweeted that Comey "better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations." Several days later, the New York Times reported the existence of a memo Comey wrote after a meeting in which Trump reportedly asked Comey to drop an investigation into Michael Flynn. Flynn is Trump’s former national security adviser who allegedly has ties to the Russian government and also allegedly took more than $500,000 to advance the Turkish government's interests. Comey’s testimony During the June 2017 hearing, Comey admitted to being behind the leak of that memo last month. He said he authorized it after seeing Trump’s tweets about tapes. However, Comey also testified – while under oath – that the memo in question did not contain any classified information. And he said that was not by accident. "My thinking was if I write in such a way that I don’t include anything that’ll trigger a classification, that will make it easier to discuss within FBI and government," he said. We’re unsure how Hayes could have gotten Comey’s testimony so wrong; the NC GOP did not respond to multiple requests for comment. For the record, we don’t know exactly what’s in the memo. Neither does Hayes or almost anyone else in the world. That’s because the memo itself hasn’t been made public yet; just a description of it. But we do know Comey never testified that he was behind a leak of classified information, despite Hayes’ claim to the contrary. Legal to leak? Michael Kohn, an attorney who represents whistleblowers, said that as long as Comey is right that the memo didn’t contain classified information, he was well within his rights to release it. Kohn is a partner at the Washington, D.C., firm of Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto and is president of the National Whistleblowers Center. He has represented multiple government leakers, including Linda Tripp, who was fired from her government job after secretly recording and then publicizing tapes of Monica Lewinsky talking about her affair with then-President Bill Clinton. He said he would be shocked if Comey was so careless as to have authorized the leak of a memo with anything classified in it. "Former director Comey would have the knowledge-base to know that he could leak non-classified information, and it's ludicrous to think he would have leaked classified information," Cohn said. Writing for the Washington Post, University of Texas law professor and national security legal expert Stephen Vladeck had this to say after Comey’s testimony about his memo: "Federal law proscribes certain unauthorized disclosures, including of "information relating to the national defense" or information that has pecuniary value to the United States. But it’s hard to see how Comey’s after-the-fact transcription of his relevant conversations with the president fall within either of these provisions. No one is making an argument that the material in Comey’s memos was classified …" Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court have both given protections to government employees who leak non-classified information in the general interest of the country. Comey said that’s exactly what he did, since he was disturbed by Trump’s behavior. "My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square," Comey testified. "I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel." Other Republicans have launched a less aggressive accusation than Hayes and the NC GOP, suggesting that Comey’s leaks might have violated something called executive privilege. PolitiFact has a separate explainer on that here. But on the topic of legal confidentiality, Cohn said the contents of a conversation with the president don’t automatically become classified just because the conversation was private or potentially damaging. "In fact, that is what our constitution is aimed at protecting – the right to speak up against the government, for what is right or proper," Cohn said. "Otherwise, we would have a king." Our ruling Speaking for the North Carolina Republican Party, former U.S. Rep. Robin Hayes said former FBI Director James Comey admitted to leaking classified information. That’s wrong. Comey never admitted to leaking classified information, which would be a crime. In fact, he said he was careful to write the one memo that he did leak so that it would not contain any classified information. The accusation was incorrect and easily debunked.

pomt-02504	"Large parts of Florida" have experienced "years of below average rainfall."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/feb/13/associated-industries-florida/business-lobbying-group-says-large-parts-florda-ha/	Florida may be the Sunshine State, but what really sets it apart is its water -- where it comes from, how much there is and who uses it. Lawmakers are paying more attention to water policies in an election year. That means the business-backed lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida is also announcing a new group to help the state make decisions about water quality and quantity. In a Feb. 6 press release, AIF announced the H20 Coalition, a group described only as "stakeholders" who plan to help mold legislation for water laws. The group points out some reasons for this marked interest. "Years of below average rainfall in large parts of Florida combined with reduced infrastructure spending during the recession, have exacerbated a growing shortfall in water supply across the state, drawing the attention of Florida's businesses, environmental groups, utilities and government," the release said. It seems like there’s been a lot of rain across the state lately. Is it true swaths of Florida have been experiencing a persistent lack of rain over the years? We decided to examine the rain gauges and find out. Rain check The state’s main groundwater supply is the Floridan Aquifer, which also supplies parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. The aquifer’s network loses water as it is pumped out of the ground through wells or city water systems, and relies on rainfall to recharge water levels. Andy O’Reilly, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geologic Survey’s Florida Water Science Center in Orlando, says that across the state, anywhere from less than one to 25 or more inches of annual rainfall has the potential to soak into the aquifer, depending on the local geology. Even much of that ends up as runoff in rivers and streams. The rest of the precipitation either evaporates or is used by plants for transpiration. "Rainfall is the biggest component in maintaining the aquifer on a regional level," he said, noting that the Floridan Aquifer is particularly sensitive to precipitation levels -- and from overpumping by homes and industries during dry spells. So the first thing we did was look into statewide rainfall totals. Checking in with the Florida Climate Center provided a quick look at statewide totals over the years. Over the last 30 years, Florida has averaged a little more than 54 inches of rain per year, among the highest in the country. Going back to 2000, an extremely dry year, there have been five years of below-average rainfall statewide (2012 was the most recent complete year available): Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 43.2 54.5 59.4 61.1 59.2 62.7 42.6 45.2 55.1 56.0 49.1 48.9 55.5 So, five out of 13 years were below average, which is about 40 percent. We checked the state’s five water management districts, designed to tend to water resources across Florida. AIF said that "large parts" of Florida had below average rainfail, so numbers by district give us a sense of how rainfall measures up on a regional basis. For instance, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, which extends from parts of Marion County down to Sarasota County, has a 30-year rainfall average of 51.2 inches. For that district, rainfall totals were: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 37.8 45.6 56.9 65.9 62.9 55.1 45.8 39.5 50.7 47.5 53.3 46.6 51.1 So there were six years out of 13 that were below the regional average, which is about 46 percent. The South Florida Water Management District, covering the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach metroplex over to Fort Myers and Naples, extending north of Lake Okeechobee into Orlando, has a 30-year average of 51.4 inches. Its rainfall totals were: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 39.4 53.2 54.3 53.3 48.4 60.0 40.7 42.8 53.3 48.4 48.9 49.3 52.2 There are seven years below that average since 2000, or about 54 percent. The data is broken down different ways in different districts, but all of them give you a decent idea of which parts of the state are experiencing less rainfall than usual. In the Northwest Florida Water Management District, covering the Panhandle from Escambia County to the western half of Jefferson County, district-wide data isn’t kept, but rather organized by cities where rainfall totals are measured. In Panama City, for example, the 30-year rainfall average is 61 inches. They’re an example of a location being hit by some below average years lately: Yr ‘00 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 Avg 41.2 50.4 49.0 64.7 46.3 52.6 42.5 35.8 57.8 53.6 48.7 38.7 65.8 That means 11 years between 2000-12 had below average rainfall, or 85 percent. What the climatologists say But do these numbers mean there’s a shortage of rainfall in the state? Climatologist David Zierden with the Florida Climate Center says no. While it’s true there have been some drier years than normal in the past decade or so, there have been plenty of wetter than average years, too. He said 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895. Tracking average rainfall means "there will be some winners and some losers," Zierden said. Sometimes the totals are above the average, and sometimes they’re below, which is the nature of Florida’s rainfall. This is a pattern that repeats across the state’s climate zones. He added the state has been in and out of drought over the last decade, but recent years are no worse than 2000 and 2001, which coincided with three dry years of La Nina conditions. "Here in Florida we’re really dominated by year-to-year totals," he said. "There’s no statistically significant trend at work here." Those rainfall variances, as inconsistent as they may be, still mean parts of the state have had dry years, and hydrologist O’Reilly said they still could affect the aquifer. That’s because the recharge rate is not a direct ratio to the rainfall total; for example, a 20 percent decrease in rainfall could mean quite a bit more than a 20 percent decrease in the recharge rate. Overall, the accumulated effects of rainfall deficits and surpluses combine with the rate at which people pump water out of the aquifer to affect the water supply’s long-term balance, he said. The AIF press release doesn’t mention overpumping from the aquifer as part of the problem maintaining the water supply, but some experts say that would be the real driver of any shortfalls. And commercial interests, especially agriculture, are responsible for most of that overpumping during dry periods. Tom Swihart, the former head of the Office of Water Policy in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, says not only are estimates of future water supply shortfalls historically too high, but currently funded water projects all but meet those goals. Water usage by residents is on a downward trend as well, not just in Florida, but nationwide. But even keeping that in mind, ensuring quality should take precedent over quantity, Swihart said. "All of this concern about water supply deflects attention from the much more serious problem of excessive nutrients in Florida waters," he said, referring to the proliferation of fertilizers, pesticides and dangerous chemicals in the water supply from the industries for which AIF lobbies. "That truly is a statewide issue and needs urgent attention." Our ruling The Associated Industries of Florida said in its press release that "large parts of Florida" have experienced "years of below average rainfall." While parts of Florida have had below-average rainfall, we also saw years of above-average rainfall. Climatologists told us the state overall is doing fine, thanks to the years when it was above average. Most recently, 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895. While the record on rainfall is mixed, there are other issues that affect water levels in the aquifer. Overpumping for residential and commercial uses, especially during dry spells, has a lot to do with the dwindling water supply as well, but AIF, which lobbies for business interests that pump from the aquifer, makes no mention of that. The claim is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Associated Industries of Florida	None	None	None	2014-02-13T16:28:21	2014-02-06	['None']
pomt-13787	"Neighborhoods have become more violent" under President Barack Obama's "watch."	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/jul/20/darryl-glenn/darryl-glenn-says-neighborhoods-have-become-more-v/	U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn, a Colorado Republican, chided President Barack Obama that violent crime had escalated under his presidency during Glenn’s Monday night speech at the Republican National Convention. "Here's some more facts, Mr. President. Neighborhoods have become more violent under your watch," Glenn said. But is that true? Has violent crime worsened in neighborhoods during Obama’s tenure? Law enforcement experts warn against politicians distorting crime trends in an effort to grab voters' attention. Anticipating that speakers would focus on the convention’s first day theme -- "Make America Safe Again" -- the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University predicted, "Their narrative will likely parallel recent statements from presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has said, 'Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse.'" "The claim is not supported by data. Nationally, crime has dropped 23 percent since 2006," the Brennan Center said, citing an analysis it released last month. The Brennan Center advocates for what are generally considered liberal policies, including reforms to reduce the prison population and increase rights for voters. Glenn and other speakers, including former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ("It’s time to make America safe again"), pounded the national security theme. But experts countered with a dose of a reality, saying crime rates remain at a historic low. Let’s take at a closer look at Glenn's claim. Violent crime -- which includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- has been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. The data below shows violent crime per 100,000 population from 1993 to 2014, the last full year for which data is available. We also looked at the other widely used data set -- the National Crime Victimization Survey, collected by the Justice Department. Here, the trend looks quite similar: But there was a spike in violent crime rates in the first six months of 2015 that drew news coverage. In January 2016, the FBI released a Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Report that showed overall increases in the number of violent crimes reported for the first six months of 2015 when compared with figures for the same period of 2014. The number of rapes increased 9.6 percent, murders increased 6.2 percent and aggravated assaults increased 2.3 percent. Property crimes were down. The New York Times reported in August 2015 that at least 35 cities were reporting increases in murders, violent crime or both. But the Times later issued a clarifying editorial titled "False Alarms About a National Crime Wave." It pointed to "unmistakable longer-term trends: The rate of violent crime, including murder, has been going down for a quarter-century, and is at its lowest in decades. On average, it is half of what it was in 1990, and in some places even lower." In April, the Brennan Center issued a final analysis on 2015 trends, saying that overall crime rates in America's 30 largest cities were nearly identical from 2014 to 2015. Crime declined over that time period by 0.1 percent. "The data show that crime rates remain at historic lows nationally, despite recent upticks in a handful of cities," the report said. Violent crime rose "slightly," by 3.1 percent, the report said, pointing out that aggravated assaults in Los Angeles accounted for more than half of the national rise in violent crime. Yet the report noted: "The 2015 murder rate rose by 13.2 percent in the 30 largest cities, with 19 cities seeing increases and 6 decreases." The murder rate continues to rise in some some cities. Chicago, a city plagued by gang violence, had 332 murders through July 10 -- a 43 percent jump over the same period last year, according to the Chicago Police Department. One expert cautioned against the pitfalls of reading too much into a snapshot of crime figures. "You need to take six months of crime data, not just with a grain of salt but the entire shaker," said James Alan Fox, the interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. "I can point to situations where crime patterns seen for the first six months are reversed once the year is over. Because six months is a fairly narrow window of time." Fox also questioned Glenn’s claim. "If (Glenn) is pointing at the first six months of 2015 as evidence of what happened during Obama's watch, then clearly you don't judge eight years (of his presidency) on half a year," Fox said. "We are at relatively low crime levels, and it would be incorrect to say that street violence has gotten worse under Obama's watch." Fox suspects the idea of rising crime is steeped more in anecdotal news reports than hard statistical trends. We asked Glenn about PolitiFact’s findings that violent crime has steadily declined in recent decades. "Well, when you're saying the crime rate ... we're in a position right now where I think people would argue whether or not the crime rate has gone down," Glenn said in an interview after his speech. He did not cite any specifics about national or neighborhood crime statistics. We'll also note that by citing Obama’s "watch," Glenn seems to suggest that he bears some blame for rising crime. However, while some presidential policies may contribute to increases or declines in crime, they are only one of many factors that shape how much crime there is in the nation, including demographics, gang warfare, and broader economic trends. Our ruling Glenn said, "Neighborhoods have become more violent under your watch," referring to President Obama. Overall, violent crime trends have been falling almost continuously for roughly a quarter-century. Glenn has a point that violent crime has increased in some neighborhoods. The 2015 murder rate rose by 13.2 percent in the nation's 30 largest cities -- with three cities accounting for more than half of the national increase in murders. One expert said it was "inaccurate" for Glenn to claim violent neighborhood crime has increased during Obama's "watch," because violent crime overall has declined during his eight years as president.

pomt-02629	"(M)ore Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/21/nathan-deal/deal-says-more-working-georgia-financial-crisis/	Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal sounded as optimistic as Ronald Reagan in the early moments of his State of the State address. "The state of our state is excellent and it is a great day in Georgia," the Republican said. Excellent is a strong word considering the economic doldrums that Georgia has faced since 2008, when the American financial system nearly collapsed. But things are getting better, particularly the job market, Deal said. "(M)ore Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008," the governor said in his prepared remarks. Is this correct, we wondered. The Georgia Department of Labor keeps the most detailed data on employment in the Peach State. In October 2008, when the national economy was at the height of its financial crisis, there were 4,076,000 people employed in Georgia, its numbers show. The following month, the number of Georgians employed dropped to 4,051,500, the data shows. The employment numbers gradually declined and fell to its lowest levels in February 2010, the records show. That month, an estimated 3,838,500 Georgians were employed. Employment in Georgia has steadily increased since then. Last February was the first month in more than four years with the state’s employment exceeding the 4 million mark. As of November, the most recent month available, the estimated total was 4,072,200. That’s an increase of about 21,200 jobs since November 2008. It is the highest number of Georgians employed since that time. Georgia’s overall population increased about 4.7 percent during the same time period. So what’s happening here? Deal, who was sworn in as governor in January 2011, has touted initiatives such as increasing the deal-closing fund and ending the sales tax for energy used in manufacturing as helping bring jobs to Georgia and improving the state’s economy. The increase in Georgia mirrors a national increase in employment. The number of Americans employed increased by about 1.7 million people between November 2008 and November 2013. Critics say that despite the increase and a significant decline in the national unemployment rate over the past four years, all is not well with the economy. They say the decline in the unemployment rate doesn’t reflect how many people have given up looking for work. PolitiFact Georgia was still curious whether Deal was cherry-picking the job numbers to make him look good for his re-election bid. We looked at the employment numbers in Georgia since Deal took office on a cold and snowy morning in January 2011. There was an increase of about 217,000 jobs between that time and November 2013, according to the state Labor Department figures. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said the employment numbers cited in the governor’s speech were seasonally adjusted to take into account changes in weather, harvests, major holidays and school schedules. Robinson said the actual numbers for Georgia may be even higher. In December, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Georgia had gained 91,200 jobs over the prior 12 months. The top areas for new jobs were professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, education and health services, transportation and warehousing, and construction. Still, the AJC noted that the state has replaced only 65 percent of the jobs that were lost when the recession began. Economists believe the job market will continue to improve in 2014, but some caution that the kinds of jobs available aren’t exactly offering the same kind of pay as baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who last week signed a contract to make $30 million a year. Some prominent economists have projected that only one in five jobs added in 2014 will pay more than $60,000 a year, the AJC reported. To sum up, Deal said in his State of the State address that more Georgians have jobs than they did at any time since October 2008. Data from the state’s Labor Department supports the governor’s argument. We rate Deal’s claim True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2014-01-21T00:00:00	2014-01-15	['None']
pomt-04778	"For Social Security, which is projected to remain solvent through 2033, Whitehouse has cosponsored [a bill that] . . . would extend the life of the program by an additional 75 years."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/26/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-proposal-would-keep/	With Social Security paying out more money than it has taken in and a growing number of baby boomers swelling the retirement rolls, there's concern that the Social Security trust will run out of money. There are several proposals for extending the life of the fund. To mark an Aug. 15 visit to a group of East Providence seniors, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's office issued a news release mentioning one of them. We found it on his website. "For Social Security, which is projected to remain solvent through 2033, Whitehouse has cosponsored the Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act, which would raise the cap on Social Security payroll taxes to include income over $250,000. By doing so, the bill would extend the life of the program by an additional 75 years." We had seen a different projection for when the Social Security trust fund is expected to run out of money. We also wondered if something as simple as lifting the payroll tax cap would provide a funding solution through 2108. We were right. The projection has changed, and not for the better. According to the 2011 Annual Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund Reports, the interest earned from investing trust fund money into U.S. Treasury bonds -- combined with money collected each year from Social Security taxes -- will cover the costs of the program through 2022. After that, Social Security will have to start tapping the principal as well as the interest. That principal will be depleted in 2036. But those numbers are outdated. Whitehouse was actually citing the key number from the 2012 report showing that, as a result of the bad economy, Social Security is draining its trust fund faster than before. Interest from investments will stop covering the costs of the program in 2021 (not 2022) and the fund's assets will be exhausted by 2033 (not 2036). So Whitehouse was correct on that count. Now let's talk about his plan to save it. Under the current system, Social Security is financed by a flat income tax of 12.4 percent on the self-employed. For people who are employed, the worker and the employer split the tax. But there's a limit to the amount a person can be taxed. Once a person's income hits $106,800, the tax is frozen. (That $106,800 ceiling goes up as average U.S. wages rise.) Thus, a person earning $106 million annually pays the same amount as someone earning $106,800. The Whitehouse proposal would remove that cap, but in a somewhat complicated way. Under the current system, a self-employed person earning $300,000 in 2011 would have paid the Social Security tax only on the first $106,800 of income. If the Whitehouse proposal had been in place for the 2011 tax year, that same individual would have paid the tax on the first $106,800 and on any income over $250,000 but not on income between $106,800 to $250,000. Why the gap? Because President Obama promised not to raises taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. (If the $106,800 cap grew to $250,000, the gap would disappear.) That change would add a lot of cash to the system. But would it be enough to finance Social Security into the next century? When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson said the wording on the press release had been unclear. Changing the law to lift the cap would not extend the solvency of the trust fund for 75 years beyond 2033. It would keep the program solvent for 75 years beginning now. Larson said, "75 years is as far as the actuary projects when looking at long-term solvency." To back that up, he sent us a letter from the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. In fact, that report, which uses numbers from 2010, does say the proposal would keep Social Security solvent for the next 75 years by raising an estimated $6.5 trillion dollars during that period. It forecasts running out of money by 2088 or sooner, and that's assuming an annual yield of 2.9 percent when the trust fund loans money to the U.S. government to pay expenses. After our e-mail, Whitehouse's office went to its website and changed the news release. The last paragraph now says: "Whitehouse has cosponsored the Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act, which would raise the cap on Social Security payroll taxes to include income over $250,000. By doing so, the bill would keep the program solvent for 75 years." Our ruling Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said, "For Social Security, which is projected to remain solvent through 2033, Whitehouse has cosponsored [a bill that] . . . would extend the life of the program by an additional 75 years." In fact, removing the income cap for collecting tax money to pay for the program would extend the viability of Social Security for 75 years from now, not from 2033.

pomt-02895	Says Alex Sink supported "a $5.2 billion increase in Florida's debt."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/07/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-alex-sink-supported-52b-debt-incr/	The Republican Party of Florida has wasted no time launching attacks against Democrat Alex Sink, the former state CFO who just announced her run for the late C.W. Bill Young’s congressional seat. There’s a lot of different claims out there, most of which are summed up in a YouTube ad: "As Florida’s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state’s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida’s debt." We’ve already checked Sink’s ties to the pension fund. In this fact-check, we’ll look into her relationship to the Florida debt. First things first: We broke down the state debt level at the end of each fiscal year, according to a report by the Division of Bond Finance. Dollar figures are in billions. 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 $23 $24.1 $24.3 $26.4 $28.2 $27.7 $26.2 The GOP subtracted the 2006 number from the 2010 number, which does give us a difference of $5.2 billion. But since Sink took office in January 2007, the first budget she was in office for was fiscal year 2008, and the last would’ve been 2011. When we take that difference, we get $3.4 billion. It’s still a significant amount of debt, to be sure, but it’s not quite as high as the ad made it out to be. As we’ve noted in similar fact-checks, the implication here is that Sink in particular played a large role in increasing Florida’s debt. As chief financial officer from 2007 to 2011, her duties included accounting, auditing and managing Florida’s finances, in addition to serving on the State Board Administration with the governor and attorney general. In Florida, legislators are required to balance the budget each year, unlike in the federal government. But the state can issue bonds to pay for capital improvement projects like road improvements and the construction of educational facilities. A significant part of the debt during Sink's term was $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds to add class space to the state's schools, brought about by a 2002 amendment to the Florida Constitution that reduced class sizes. Additionally, while the CFO oversees finances, it's the state Legislature that passes a budget. "It’s the Legislature who decides how much bonding is going to be done," said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. The Cabinet and the governor sign off on the Division of Bond Finance’s bond issues after the Legislature appropriates money for projects. The Cabinet consists of three members, including the the CFO, the attorney general and the commissioner of agriculture. Neither the Republican Party of Florida nor the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee could point us to an instance where Sink voted against issuing bonds. But approving the bond issues is business as usual for the governor and Cabinet, so it’s routine for the vote to pass without disagreement. It is considered acceptable for the CFO to disagree with the governor on financial matters, said Susan MacManus, University of South Florida state government professor. But the fact that so many Cabinet and legislative officials (many of whom were Republicans) get a say in appropriations means the financial blame doesn’t fall to Sink alone. "You can’t say that she has no responsibility for it," MacManus said. "You could probably say that it’s shared responsibility." The CFO also doesn’t have the same veto power the governor does over bond appropriations, said Khi Thai, Florida Atlantic University public budgeting professor. "Alex Sink can express her ‘support’ but cannot ‘vote down’ the Legislature's bond appropriations," Thai added. Aside from that distinction, it’s worth remembering that the entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink’s term as CFO, not just Florida. The state’s trends of increasing debt are consistent with the nation’s. Florida government, be it the Legislature or the Cabinet, shouldn’t shoulder all the blame for a widespread recession. Our ruling As CFO, Sink did watch the debt increase over her term, but by $3.4 billion, not $5.2 billion. Plus, the Legislature, not the Cabinet, has most of the say in bond appropriations. Not to mention there was a nationwide recession that took its toll on the Florida economy, which is out of the hands of state officials. Given all these hefty clarifications, we rate the Florida Republican Party of Florida’s claim Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2013-11-07T15:59:34	2013-10-30	['None']
pomt-01582	"Social Security has never contributed one cent to the deficit. Not one cent."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2014/sep/08/jeff-merkley/has-social-security-never-contributed-one-cent-fed/	U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., running for re-election against Republican challenger Monica Wehby, addressed Social Security during a meeting with about a dozen Bend-area senior citizens in August. The claim: Just in case PolitiFact Oregon had forgotten about that roundtable, Wehby’s campaign seized on the opportunity to remind us by sending along a video clip in which Merkley defended Social Security’s fiscal soundness. "Social Security has never contributed one cent to the deficit," he said. "Not one cent." We decided to check. The analysis: Social Security constitutes one of the federal government’s most important functions. The program pays out about $60 billion in benefits each month to about 60 million recipients. About two-thirds of those are retirees. The rest are disabled workers, survivors or the spouses and children of retired or disabled workers. The program is financed mainly by payroll taxes paid by covered workers and their employers. Any surplus must be used to buy nonmarketable U.S. government bonds. The issue has jumped to the front burner because, after years of rolling up surpluses, Social Security in 2010 began paying out more in benefits than it was collecting. Current projections show the gap continuing to widen as aging baby boomers retire, then running dry by 2033. We contacted Merkley’s office and asked how a program that’s leaking money avoids adding to the deficit. Campaign spokeswoman Lindsey O’Brien, in an email, said Merkley was talking about Social Security’s status as an "off-budget" program -- a federal budget category encompassing programs that aren’t included in the annual congressional budget process. She passed along articles and columns defending her boss’s point -- that Social Security is legally prohibited from contributing to the deficit. This from the Center for Economic and Policy Research: "Under the law, Social Security cannot possibly contribute to the on-budget deficit. It can only spend money that has been collected from the designated payroll tax or from the investment of past surpluses." And this from Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik: "By law, it can’t contribute to the federal deficit, because Social Security isn’t allowed to spend more than it takes in." We called Paul Norr, a California-based financial expert who has written extensively about Social Security. Legally, the program is totally self-contained, Norr said. "Its finances NEVER intermingle with the overall federal allocations of funding," he wrote in a follow-up email. "SS either has or doesn’t have enough funds." Other PolitiFact checks around the country, however, have arrived at a different conclusion on what happens when the program bleeds red ink. "When Social Security runs a deficit," according to PolitiFact New Hampshire, "the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference." PolitiFact Wisconsin weighed in on the topic last year: "Since 2010, Social Security has been paying more in benefits than it has collected in payroll taxes. To meet its payments, Social Security began redeeming the bonds, plus interest, from the federal government. … Because the government had to borrow money in order to pay the interest on Social Security, that contributes to the deficit." The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, in a 2013 "Social Security Primer," said this: "Because the federal securities held by the trust funds are redeemed with general revenues, this results in increased spending for Social Security from the general fund." The ruling: Merkley told a gathering of seniors that "Social Security has never contributed one cent to the deficit." Until 2010, that was true. However, the program has chalked up increasingly large deficits each year since, requiring money to be taken from its bonds to make up the difference. The senator argues, reasonably, both that Social Security is by law a closed system, and that its trust fund is sufficient for now to cover the current gap. It’s also true, however, that these gaps do affect other parts of the federal government because they require borrowing elsewhere to make up the difference. We rate Merkley’s claim Half True.

pomt-03313	"Rhode Island has the highest percentage of lawyers per capita in the country."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/28/helio-melo/rep-helio-melo-says-ri-has-highest-percentage-lawy/	Rhode Island state Rep. Helio Melo, chairman of the House Finance Committee, recently questioned Governor Chafee’s nomination of Eva-Marie Mancuso, chairwoman of the state Board of Education, as interim commissioner of higher education. Even though she’s a lawyer, Mancuso is not necessarily qualified to be commissioner, Melo said. "I’m not sure that someone with a law degree is what the state should be looking for," Melo told a Providence Journal reporter in an interview published July 13. "I understand that Rhode Island has the highest percentage of lawyers per capita in the country. Does that make all lawyers here potential commissioners of education? The board doesn’t have to follow the governor’s recommendation, and I would urge it to take a serious look at her qualifications." A Journal reader was fascinated. Is it true, he asked us, that the Ocean State is awash in lawyers? We wondered, too. We called Melo. He said he had heard -- probably at a government seminar out of state, he thought -- "that we had a very large or probably the largest percentage of lawyers in Rhode Island per capita. I found that to be intriguing and it kind of stuck in my head." We also went online and found U.S. Census data and state tallies of practicing lawyers compiled by the American Bar Association. Then we created a spreadsheet and melded them. Here’s what we discovered through our calculations. Rhode Island, with an estimated population of 1,050,292, and, according to the ABA, 4,060 residents who were active as lawyers in the state as of December, has one lawyer per 259 people. We’re definitely not number one. The most lawyer-saturated state is New York, with one lawyer per 118 people, followed by Massachusetts, ranked second, with one lawyer per 155 people, and Connecticut, in third place, with one lawyer per 170 people. The state with the fewest lawyers per capita is Arkansas, with one lawyer per 495 people, according to our math. We omitted the District of Columbia from our comparison list because it is unique as the capital of national government and thus is swarming with lawyers. Where does Rhode Island emerge on the list of 50 states? Thirteenth. Melo’s reaction? "Actually, that doesn’t put my pants on fire," said Melo, who has been singed before on the Truth-O-Meter. "That’s high," he said of 13th place. "... I guess it is one of the highest." Our ruling Helio Melo said Rhode Island has the highest percentage of lawyers per capita in the nation. We found that Rhode Island actually ranks 13th. That does put us in the upper third of the states, but here at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we tend to be literal. He’s still way off. The judges rule False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-08536	Says Scott Bruun supports "cutting the Department of Commerce and eliminating NOAA."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/04/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-scott-bruun-wants-cut-departmen/	When the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration affirmed Newport as the location of its new Pacific Marine Operations Center earlier this year, it was a rare bit of good news in an otherwise dim year for Oregon, economically speaking. The center will bring hundreds of jobs to the area. It’s little wonder, then, that Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., has been telling constituents lately just how hard he lobbied for the move. But last week, in an interview that aired on Newport-based radio station KCUP, Schrader went a step further. He took his Republican challenger Scott Bruun to task, saying Bruun was poised to undermine the whole deal. "(I was) very concerned at the forum the other day when he said he wanted to cut the Department of Commerce and, you know, NOAA would be, of course, a big part of that," he said, referring to a debate held at the Salem City Club on Sept. 10, 2010. "I just think that's very, very scary for residents on the coast when everybody in the community and our office, in particular, fought so hard to make sure that the NOAA fleet is going to come to Oregon. And I think that's a very, very bad statement for a candidate in the 5th District to say when we're working so hard to make sure this comes to fruition. Cutting the Department of Commerce and eliminating NOAA is not going to be a good message to those guys." Schrader’s right: That wouldn’t be a good message to send to the 5th District, which includes Newport. But did Bruun really say he wanted to eliminate NOAA? PolitiFact Oregon went back and listened to the exchange at the Salem City Club. The Department of Commerce cropped up after an audience member asked the following question: "I would like to ask the candidates what specific expenditure of the federal government they would like to discontinue." Here’s what Bruun replied: "We have to look at some of the agencies that are out there right now -- I'll name a few, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of Housing and Urban Development -- to see whether or not what they're doing is valid, it's meeting its purposes and even if it is valid, is it better putting it in local governments. Is it better putting it in county government or state government, pushing some of it out into the states?" (If you want to listen for yourself, this all starts around the 35-minute mark.) We followed up with Schrader’s campaign to see whether it had any additional evidence to support the congressman’s claim that Bruun had it out for NOAA. James Atkins, a spokesman for the campaign, pointed to a 1996 article in The Oregonian from the last time Bruun ran for national office. Back then, Bruun said he would vote to eliminate the same three departments he brought up in the most recent debate. Of course, we know how much can change in 24 hours when it comes to politics, let alone 14 years, so PolitiFact Oregon brought the article up with the Bruun campaign. Spokeswoman Alee Lockman said Bruun no longer supports eliminating those departments, but he stands behind his statement that the departments need to be reviewed for possible savings. What Lockman says tracks with what Bruun told KCUP in his own interview on the radio station on Sept. 16, 2010. "I did name some big agencies that are big and encompassing and we do need to look at doing things better in those agencies. The Department of Commerce is one of those agencies," he said. Bruun also said he wholly supports NOAA coming to Newport and would fight, if ever necessary, to keep the agency there. So far as we can tell, there are basically two pieces to Schrader’s initial claim: 1) Bruun advocates possible cuts to the Department of Commerce and 2) Bruun advocates eliminating NOAA. It’s clear enough that the first bit is true, but even though NOAA is a part of that department, there is scant evidence that Bruun wants to do away with the agency entirely. We’ll split the difference here and call this claim Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Kurt Schrader	None	None	None	2010-10-04T06:00:00	2010-09-15	['None']
pomt-13367	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to bring in thousands of refugees to America from all around the world without any kind of security screening."	false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/29/rick-scott/clinton-wants-admit-thousands-refugees-no-vetting-/	Gov. Rick Scott backed up Donald Trump’s first presidential debate performance, praising the Republican nominee and lamenting that Hillary Clinton wasn’t pressed hard enough on her policy positions. In a Sept. 27 Facebook post touting an ad from the pro-Trump Rebuilding America Now PAC, Scott declared the real estate mogul "the winner in last night’s debate because he is the candidate for change." "The biggest loser was the American people," Scott wrote, "because we never got to hear a vigorous conversation about why Hillary set up an illegal email server for classified information or why she wants to bring in thousands of refugees to America from all around the world without any kind of security screening." We’ll set aside the email controversy and focus on the assertion about vetting refugees. Does Clinton want to bring in thousands of foreigners with no background checks at all? She does want to allow refugees into America, although the figures are up for debate — but the idea that there will be no security screening is wrong. Refugee review Scott’s office did not clarify anything about his post when we contacted them. But he’s using fairly broad language by saying Clinton wants to bring in thousands of refugees from across the globe. That would not be a shocking plan, because the United States routinely accepts tens of thousands of refugees annually, averaging more than 83,000 refugees a year worldwide from 1980-2008. In fiscal year 2015, the last year for which we have data, the State Department said it would admit up to 70,000 refugees. It ended up admitting 69,933, records show. These refugee slots are allocated by region, so the United States takes different numbers of refugees from different parts of the world. Scott’s accusation echoes Trump, who falsely said Clinton planned to bring in 620,000 refugees during her first term and denied they would be subjected to a vetting process. Clinton has only talked about a single year’s plan for how many refugees to let into the country — specifically expanding Obama’s plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016. "I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in," she said in a September 2015 interview on Face the Nation. Clinton’s campaign has not elaborated beyond that initial 65,000 refugees, which would have been a 550 percent increase. Syrian refugees have been a focus of political arguments because of fears radical Islamic terrorists would infiltrate the United States. Trump once advocated banning all Muslims as his response. That’s why the vetting process is important to the discussion — and let’s be clear, there is a vetting process. The United States can perform background checks for refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Homeland Security Department, the Defense Department and other agencies. This can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. With so much concern over terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. For her part, Clinton has repeatedly said that while she supports bringing refugees into the country, screening protocols must be followed. "Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people," she said in a November 2015 national security speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. "So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners." During a December 2015 counterterrorism speech at the University of Minnesota, she noted, "Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months." She told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in July that "we should only let people into this country after we have thoroughly screened them, no matter how long it takes and no matter, you know, what the pressure might be to act more quickly." And as recently as a Sept. 19 press conference in White Plains, N.Y., she said "I am absolutely in favor of and have long been an advocate for tough vetting." Our ruling Scott said Clinton "wants to bring in thousands of refugees to America from all around the world without any kind of security screening." Clinton has said she would welcome thousands more Syrians fleeing civil war, but the United States routinely admits tens of thousands of global refugees annually. There is already a strict vetting process in place, and Clinton has routinely advocated following it.

pomt-01201	"Every president since Eisenhower has taken executive action to address immigration issues."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/30/tim-kaine/kaine-says-all-presidents-eisenhower-have-taken-ex/	U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine was quick to defend President Barack Obama’s recent decision to bypass Congress and unilaterally extend legal status to many illegal immigrants. Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he would delay deportation for immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If the applicant can pass a background check and pay a fee, he could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which will open for applications in the spring. Kaine, in a news release on the night of the president’s announcement, said Obama’s action was necessary because the House of Representatives has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Kaine, a Democrat, made a fleeting reference to Republican claims that the president’s executive action is unconstitutional. "Every president since Eisenhower has taken executive action to address immigration issues," he said. We checked whether Kaine’s history is correct. Amy Dudley, Kaine’s spokeswoman, sent us an October report from the American Immigration Council that’s being circulated by the White House and its allies to defend the president’s action. Although the council is pro-immigration, a number of experts say the raw data in the report is solid. The council cited 39 instances in which a president used executive authority to defer deportation of certain immigrants. The list starts with an action by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 and does indeed include actions taken by every president since then. Many of the actions were designed to keep families together or to shield illegal immigrants from returning to repressive nations where they might face punishment. The report, however, does not settle a broader question: Were any of the past presidential actions equivalent to what Obama is doing? Let’s take a look: Size. With more than 4 million potential beneficiaries, Obama’s is easily the biggest such action ever taken by a president, at least in raw numbers. The second largest action -- by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 -- forestalled deportations of what the White House then estimated to be 1.5 million illegal immigrants. It was a consequence of a 1986 law that offered legal status to unauthorized immigrants who been living continuously in the U.S. since 1982. The problem was that many spouses and children of eligible immigrants had not been in the country long enough to qualify. Bush’s action was designed to prevent families from being split. When Congress failed to extend the law to ineligible spouses and children, Bush did so on his own. It’s worth noting that Bush’s action and Obama’s affected the same proportion of the undocumented population at the time each was announced, about 40 percent. Other presidential actions that had a potential affect on more than 100,000 people included extended asylum to: Cubans who fled their nation’s communist revolution, offered from 1957 to 1972 by Presidents Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Southeast Asians, most of whom were evacuated at the end of the Vietnam War, offered between 1975 and 1979 by Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Nicaraguans fleeing the Sandinista revolution, offered by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Scope. Most of the past presidential actions affected small, specific populations that were experiencing humanitarian or political crises in their home country. For instance: About 15,000 Ethiopians who fled a Marxist regime in their nation were allowed to stay in the U.S. under an order made by Carter in 1977 and extended by Reagan in 1982. 2,227 Kuwaiti evacuees during Operation Desert Storm in 1990 were given four-year extensions of their temporary visas under orders by George H.W. Bush. About 10,000 Liberians fleeing civil war in their nation received extended permission to stay in the U.S. by President Bill Clinton in 1999. President George W. Bush extended it again to 3,600 Liberians in 2009. What undocumented immigrants could receive. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that Obama has not just deferred deportation for certain undocumented immigrants but gone a step further, allowing them to receive work permits and other related benefits, such as Social Security numbers. There’s at least one precedent for this: the George H.W. Bush action in 1990, which included a pathway to receiving green cards. Some of the other previous actions may have as well, but experts said allowing work permits are the exception rather than the rule. We should note that PolitiFact National recently rated as Half True this statement by Obama: "The actions I’m taking are not only lawful, they’re the kind of actions taken by every single Republican and president for the past half century." Kaine’s statement is narrower in scope. Our ruling Kaine, in backing Obama, said, "Every president since Eisenhower has taken executive action to address immigration issues." Historical records back Kaine. But Kaine’s compact claim omits important context: Obama’s immigration actions can be viewed as much more sweeping than those of his predecessors. So Kaine’s statement is accurate but needs more information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2014-11-30T18:03:24	2014-11-20	['Dwight_D._Eisenhower']
pomt-11031	"Watch those GDP numbers. We started off at a very low number, and right now we hit a 3.2 (percent). Nobody thought that was possible."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-base-describing-gdp-growth-his-watch/	During a June 28 visit to Mount Pleasant, Wis. -- the site of a planned Foxconn manufacturing facility -- President Donald Trump touted his economic record, including the growth of the nation’s gross domestic product, which measures the size of the economy. "Watch those GDP numbers," Trump said. "We started off at a very low number, and right now we hit a 3.2," or 3.2 percentage growth compared to the last quarter on an annualized basis. "Nobody thought that was possible." This statement includes both factual inaccuracies and an apparent misunderstanding of the statistical measurement Trump is citing. Here is a chart showing the quarter-by-quarter growth in gross domestic product since 2008. The red bars indicate the tenure of Republican presidents George W. Bush and Trump, while the blue bars indicate the tenure of President Barack Obama, a Democrat. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s first problem is a straightforward factual inaccuracy. He said that "right now," growth was 3.2 percent. However, the most recent growth number, for the first quarter of 2018, wasn’t 3.2 percent. It was considerably lower, at 2.0 percent. (The next growth number, for the second quarter of 2018, won’t be available for several more weeks.) On Trump’s watch, the U.S. did see one quarter of 3.2 percent growth -- the third quarter of 2017. By now, that data point is three quarters old. Arguably, the bigger problem with Trump’s assertion is the idea that "nobody thought that was possible." Here, Trump is confusing 3 percent growth during a single quarter with 3 percent growth sustained over an entire year. Due to normal variations in the economy, meeting the 3 percent threshold for a quarter is not uncommon. But it has been almost a decade and a half since the U.S. economy grew at a 3 percent pace over an entire year. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com As the chart shows, the last time the economy as a whole grew at 3 percent for an entire year was in 2005, when it grew at 3.3 percent. "Economists do not expect a consistent 3 percent annual growth from the U.S. economy given our demographics and our current productivity numbers," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. (Read our more detailed explanation of economists’ reasoning.) By contrast, quarterly increases of 3 percent are not rare -- in fact, they happened eight times under Obama, including levels Trump has not yet reached, such as 4.6 percent (twice) and 5.2 percent (once). The one caveat to keep in mind is that Trump’s task in expanding GDP rapidly is harder than it was for Obama, said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. That’s because the recovery has been going for so long -- since June 2009 -- that the economy has less "slack" in it that could feed quick growth. "Experience shows that it is easier to see quarters with relatively rapid real GDP growth when the economy can grow both because of a growing working-age population and rising productivity and because many of the involuntarily unemployed are finding jobs," Burtless said. Our ruling Trump said, "Watch those GDP numbers. We started off at a very low number, and right now we hit a 3.2 (percent). Nobody thought that was possible." This is inaccurate two ways. First, the most recent saw GDP growth of 2.0 percent, not 3.2 percent. And second, exceeding 3 percent GDP growth in a quarter is not an unusual achievement -- Obama accomplished it eight times. The real achievement would be a full year at 3 percent, which hasn’t happened under Trump yet. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00390	"We passed the toughest gun control law in the United States of America, the SAFE Act."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2018/sep/06/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-claims-his-gun-control-law-toughest/	In his campaign for re-election, Gov. Andrew Cuomo faces a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, and he points to his record as proof that he can be a line of defense against President Trump’s policies. Part of Cuomo’s record is the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, often referred to as the SAFE Act. "We passed the toughest gun control law in the United States of America, the SAFE Act," Cuomo said at the Democratic gubernatorial primary debate at Hofstra University. "He will roll it back with his Supreme Court. He has to be stopped," Cuomo said of Trump. Cuomo has called the SAFE Act the nation’s toughest gun control legislation several times since he signed it into law in January 2013. He includes a similar claim on his campaign website. So is Cuomo right? Is the SAFE Act the nation’s toughest gun control law? Background New York was the first state to pass major gun control legislation after a gunman fatally shot 20 children and six adults on Dec. 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Cuomo used a message of necessity to hasten passage of the law. The SAFE Act has several provisions, including a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, a requirement that ammunition be purchased through a dealer who performs a background check on the buyer, and background checks for buyers who purchase guns through private sales. The act also included provisions to keep guns away from people with mental illness. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence called it a "model for the nation." Some of the law’s provisions were challenged in court, including a provision that magazine capacity be seven rounds instead of 10, which a federal judge struck down. Other legal challenges to the law were not successful. Though the SAFE Act was controversial in parts of the state, Cuomo has continued to pursue gun control policies during his tenure. His actions have attracted negative attention from the country’s most powerful gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, as he pursues a third term. But is it the toughest? Cuomo calls the SAFE Act the toughest gun legislation in the country. News outlets echoed that language when it was passed. The New York law ranks as the nation’s toughest by virtue of "mandating universal background checks, creating a first-of-its-kind mental health database, closing the gun-show loophole, and strengthening the state’s ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines," said Cuomo spokeswoman Abbey Collins. At least one gun control research think tank considers the SAFE Act the most comprehensive measure passed in 2013. The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks legislation around the country and assists lawmakers in crafting gun control measures, characterized "the SAFE Act as the most comprehensive law" enacted that year because it included "many different areas of gun violence prevention, more so than any other law enacted that year," according to a statement from Jason Phelps, the law center’s national press secretary. Phelps declined to use "toughest" to describe the law. He said the word is subjective and could have different meanings to different people and organizations. "Accordingly, we do not think it is unfair or inaccurate for Gov. Cuomo to characterize the SAFE Act as the toughest law enacted that year," Phelps said. But that is not the whole story. In several scorecards rating states for gun laws, New York does not come in first, either in 2013 or in later years, for the toughest. The Brady Campaign and Giffords Law Center’s joint 2013 evaluation of state gun laws puts New York in fifth place for strongest laws, after California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maryland. New York moved up from sixth place on Giffords’ 2012 state scorecard. Giffords also ranked New York fifth in its most recent ranking. In the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence’s most recent evaluation of the "strongest" state laws, published in March 2015, New York also came in fifth, after California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Giffords and the Brady Campaign have endorsed Cuomo in his re-election bid. Our ruling Cuomo claims New York enacted the toughest gun law. At least one gun violence prevention research outfit agrees with him. But while the SAFE Act on the whole may be tougher than other states’ individual gun laws, when several other states’ individual gun laws are taken together, they consistently rank higher than New York for toughness.

pomt-08888	Some cardiologists estimate "70 percent of all males over 50 have some form of heart disease."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/31/gordon-quan/gordon-quan-harris-county-candidate-says-70-percde/	Gordon Quan, the Democratic nominee for Harris County judge, sent an e-mail blast last month noting he’d recently undergone cardiac bypass surgery. "Like many, I had no signs of heart disease," his June 30 e-mail continues. "Fortunately, my wife had insisted that I have a complete examination in March which detected growing blockage in my arteries. It is estimated by some cardiologists that 70 percent of all males over 50 have some form of heart disease. Unfortunately, we have lost many too soon due to untreated heart disease." Seven in 10 men older than 50 have heart disease? We—OK, I—urgently desired back-up. Quan told us he saw the statistic while looking through information posted online by the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, which says it performs scientific research on the effects of diet and lifestyle choices on health and disease. The California-based institute was founded by Dean Ornish, a physician who has long studied the effects of lifestyle changes on health. We didn't find a similar statement on the institute's site and didn't hear back from its online contact. Separately, we reached the Houston-based Texas Heart Institute, whose spokesman forwarded the American Heart Association's 2010 update of national heart disease and stroke statistics. It has a chart indicating nearly 40 percent of men and women aged 40 to 59 have some kind of cardiovascular disease, while 74 percent of men and 73 percent of women aged 60 to 79 fit into that un-wellness field. All told, the update says, 81.1 million Americans (or one in three residents) have one or more types of cardiovascular disease, 38.1 million of them being 60 or older. But what about -- ahem -- men between 50 and 60? Frank Michel, the institute’s director of public affairs, agreed the chart didn’t speak directly to them. "The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in one form or another is somewhere in between 40 percent and 70 percent for males aged 50 and over and it rises above 70 percent by the time they reach age 60," Michel said in an e-mail. In Austin, we sought perspective from Glen Huschka, director of communications for the South Central Affiliate of the American Heart Association. Huschka initially noted that cardiovascular disease refers to a "broad range of conditions including coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and high blood pressure," which he said seems to fit with Quan's statement. Huschka said in an e-mail that if the candidate had said men over 50 are "at risk of developing" heart disease, that would be a slam dunk. Huschka’s point: More than 71 percent of men over age 20 are considered overweight or obese, a major risk factor. Huschka floated our question to Melanie Turner, associate science and medicine adviser with the American Heart Association’s Dallas-based National Center. She shared information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey taken by the National Center for Health Statistics from 2003 through 2006. According to the survey, the prevalence of heart disease among U.S. men 50 and older was about 19 percent — if one limits the definition of coronary heart disease to people with heart attacks, angina and heart failure. Under a broader definition that includes stroke and hypertension, 61 percent of males 50 and older were diagnosed as having heart-related difficulties. Huschka told us in an e-mail that such estimates wouldn't include men with undiagnosed heart disease, meaning the prevalence of heart disease among males 50 and older is probably higher. That sounds believable. All told, however, the statistics don't confirm Quan's statement that 70 percent of men over 50 have a form of heart disease, though we found numbers that were close.

pomt-09595	In Massachusetts, Scott Brown's Republican affiliation is "not a secret, but clearly not on display."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/20/kelly-odonnell/scott-brown-mostly-avoided-mentioning-hes-republic/	The closely watched race to fill the U.S. Senate seat of the late Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., ended with victory by a long-shot Republican. In the runup to Scott Brown's special election victory on Jan. 19, 2010, pundits floated a variety of possible explanations for his surprise surge in the historically Democratic state, from dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama's domestic agenda to a poorly run campaign by Brown's Democratic opponent, state attorney general Martha Coakley. Another explanation was that Brown went to great lengths to avoid identifying himself as a Republican. One place this claim surfaced was in a Today show piece by NBC correspondent Kelly O'Donnell. The segment -- which aired Jan. 19, 2010, the day of the election -- included an interview with Brown himself. In it, O'Donnell asked Brown, "You don't mention the Republican Party much in your campaign. Why is that?" Brown responded, "I think people know I'm a Republican. That's never been a secret." O'Donnell, in a voice-over, continued, "Not a secret, but clearly not on display. No mention of being a Republican on Brown's bus, signs or campaign ads." That's not unusual in some congressional races, but a caller on C-SPAN asked us to check if it were true in this case. Did Brown go through the campaign without mentioning his party affiliation? First, we looked at the specific contexts that O'Donnell had mentioned. In addition to the footage in her piece, we found a blog post that featured various photos of a Brown bus tour through the Bay State, and the images clearly show that the exterior of his bus reads, "Bold, New Leadership: Scott Brown, United States Senate," along with a number for accessing the campaign by text message and a reminder to vote on Jan. 19. So no mention of Brown's party on his bus. Ditto for his campaign signs. In all the pictures we saw, Brown's signs were devoid of any mention of the Republican Party. Finally, we looked at the broadcast and Web advertisements posted on Brown's campaign Web site. We found that the candidate consistently avoided any mention of what party banner he was running under. Then we broadened the search to take in the whole Brown campaign Web site. We found nothing referring to his party on the home page, on his biography page, or in any of his Web videos. In fact, most of the scattered mentions of the word "Republican" on his site were extremely minor -- and nearly impossible to locate without a Google search. For instance, he posted an endorsement by Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele as well as a couple of other endorsements, including some by Massachusetts Republican officials. In the news section, he linked to a number of newspaper articles identifying himself as a Republican, and on his calendar, he listed events with the Republican Jewish Coalition and a "Republican rally." "He and his team clearly sought to emphasize the word 'independent' over 'Republican,'" said Scott Helman, political editor at the Boston Globe. Rare was the document posted on Brown's Web site that clearly identified the candidate as a Republican. In his victory speech after the Dec. 8, 2009, primary, Brown introduced himself to the state's electorate by saying, "For my fellow citizens watching at home, my name is Scott Brown. I'm the Republican in the race. You may not have heard of me before now because all the focus has been on the other side where the candidates were competing for title of ‘most liberal.’ " But even in that speech, Brown made a point of undercutting his partisan label, saying that he was speaking "in the name of every independent-thinking citizen, whether they be Democrat, unenrolled-independent or Republican." Political analysts said that over the past decade, it has become common for Republican candidates in increasingly Democratic New England to avoid mentioning their party affiliation in official communications. "One of the ways you can see this most clearly is in the lawn sign wars," said Roy Occhiogrosso, a Democratic consultant in neighboring Connecticut. "Democrats frequently have the word 'Democrat' on their lawn sign, while Republicans, unless they are running in a solid Republican legislative district, almost never have the word 'Republican' on their signs." But before we conclude that Brown dwelled in a universe beyond partisanship, it's worth noting that his message managed to communicate clear opposition to the Democratic majority in Washington and Boston even as he declined to tout the Republican Party by name. The balance between being explicit and implicit began with his Sept. 12, 2009, speech announcing his candidacy. In that address, Brown said, "We have 11 other elected officials from the majority party in Washington, and the governor has a Washington office to assist Massachusetts there as well. All of these officials usually vote the same way and take their orders from the same special-interest groups and political leaders. Does Massachusetts need another elected official to merely rubber stamp the policies of one party or administration?" "People know Scott Brown's a Republican," said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to the Brown campaign. "If they don't know, then they're not paying attention." Later, as his campaign gained steam, Brown reveled in the possibility that he could become the 41st Republican senator -- enough to keep the Democrats from passing health care reform or other parts of the president's agenda. He even took to signing autographs "Scott Brown 41." In a Jan. 13, 2010, news release attacking Coakley's "negative and untrue attacks" on health care, Brown took the rare step of referring to himself explicitly as a Republican. "Time and again, Martha has said she would be the 60th vote for a health care bill that will slash Medicare by a half-trillion dollars, raise taxes and increase spending. As the 41st Republican senator, I would insist we start over on health care and craft a bipartisan bill that will lead to meaningful reform." Tufts University political scientist Jeffrey Berry calls the notion of Brown being the 41st vote "the most powerful thing he said on the campaign trail. Everyone in Massachusetts understood that meant he would vote like a national Republican once he joined the Senate. He nationalized the election and that brought him money, volunteers, attention, and, ultimately, votes." So, back to O'Donnell's claim that Brown's Republican affiliation was "not a secret, but clearly not on display." O'Donnell was correct that during the campaign there was "no mention of being a Republican on Brown's bus, signs or campaign ads." We did find two brief instances -- one in a speech, one in a news release -- in which Brown referred to himself as a Republican. But while news coverage regularly mentioned his party affiliation, meaning that it should have been no secret to voters, the candidate clearly downplayed his partisan ties. So we find O'Donnell's statement Mostly True.	None	Kelly O'Donnell	None	None	None	2010-01-20T18:26:40	2010-01-19	['Massachusetts', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Scott_Brown']
pomt-13886	Says Hillary Clinton "presided over $6 billion lost at the State Department, sold uranium to the Russians through (her) faux charity, illegally deleted public records, and murdered an ambassador."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/30/michael-cohen/pants-fire-trump-lawyer-tweets-meme-accusing-clint/	Donald Trump’s lawyer accused Hillary Clinton of incompetence, treason, breaking public disclosure law and murder. A week after his client delivered a major speech knocking Hillary Clinton, Trump Organization executive vice president and special counsel Michael Cohen used his client’s preferred social media platform, Twitter, to paint "Crooked Hillary" as a disaster for national security. Cohen told us he didn’t create the meme and pointed out it’s been widely shared on social media. But virality and retweets don’t make a claim accurate, and this meme distorts the facts. Each claim is either misleading or outrageously wrong. We'll explain why. ‘$6 billion lost at the State Department’ This echoes reports from many conservative pundits and outlets (and some nonpartisan news sites) about a State Department Inspector General alert in March 2014. The alert warned that files for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 — spanning the entirety of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 — "were incomplete or could not be located at all." A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told PolitiFact the alert speaks for itself, but many seemed to misinterpret what it actually said. The confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Linick to pen a clarification in the Washington Post. "Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion," he wrote. "Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files — documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars — ‘creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department’s contract actions.’ " In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It’s akin to spending $20 on lunch and losing or not asking for a receipt. Documentation over where that $20 went was lost, but not the $20 itself. So the State Department under Clinton, who wasn’t mentioned in the alert, may have been financially disorganized, but it didn’t "lose" $6 billion. ‘Sold uranium to the Russia through my faux charity’ Trump offered a more nuanced (but still Mostly False) version of this claim: "Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation." The State Department didn’t unilaterally greenlight Russia’s purchase of a company with U.S. uranium assets. It was one of nine government agencies, along with federal and state nuclear regulators, that approved the deal. Moreover, there is no evidence that Clinton personally advocated for approval. Nine people related to the company did give to the Clinton Foundation at some point in time, but most of their donations occurred before the Russian deal. Cohen’s meme is a more outlandish. Given the available evidence, the most that can be said is the State Department had a hand in the approval process, and Clinton Foundation donors were linked to the company Russia purchased. That may look fishy, but there’s no proof of quid pro quo. ‘Illegally deleted public records’ This part of the meme refers to Clinton’s use of a private email server. While Clinton’s actions in deleting some 31,000 emails certainly broached the rules of record keeping, the meme’s use of the word "illegally" is premature. Before she turned over the server to the State Department, she and her staff deleted half of all the emails without government review, saying they were personal correspondence. Her decision is the subject of FBI scrutiny. But was this illegal? It depends, according to Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation. "If Clinton destroyed work emails knowing they should have been kept and was intentionally trying to remove them from the public record, then yes, that is illegal and it is a crime," he said. "In the end, I think there is not enough public information available to know whether Clinton did ‘illegally’ destroy public records." Clinton’s overall defense that her email practices were "allowed" is False. "The whole situation also again raises questions about the process by which Clinton decided what was, and was not, a federal record, a process she enshrouded in a black box of attorney-client privilege when she involved her personal attorneys, and a process she made final when she destroyed anything they determined was ‘personal,’" Cox said. Ultimately, Clinton hasn’t been charged with any crime at the time of Cohen’s tweet. ‘Murdered an ambassador’ Rhetoric about the Benghazi attacks seldom matches up with reality, and this part of Cohen’s claim is no different. The day of Cohen’s tweet, the Republican-led House Benghazi Committee released its findings after a two-year investigation. The partisan 800-page report concluded that a series of missed cues, intergovernmental miscommunication, inadequate security and general incompetence delayed attempts to rescue Americans in Benghazi. It also accused the Obama administration of misleading the public to save political face in the aftermath of the attacks. But neither the report, nor the seven other probes before it, held Clinton specifically responsible for the events that led up to the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others, let alone charge her with murder. Here’s an exchange between the chair of the Benghazi committee, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, and a reporter that demonstrates his thinking on the matter: Reporter: "There are bumper stickers and T-shirts all over this country that say, ‘Hillary Clinton lied, people died.’ ...Is that true?" Gowdy: "You don’t see that T-shirt on me, and you’ve never seen that bumper sticker on any of my vehicles, and you’ve never heard me comment on that." To review, the ambassador died during attacks at the U.S. compound in Benghazi, which began suddenly on the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2012. Sean Smith, a State Department foreign service officer, was found dead within an hour and Stevens was missing and pronounced dead from smoke inhalation later that night. Clinton, as we have previously reported, learned of the attacks in real time and said she worked late into the night. According to her memoir Hard Choices, she called White House National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, CIA Director David Petraeus and the president of Libya; directed State Department officials to secure other American facilities in Libya; convened a meeting of department leaders, among other actions. But was there something she could have done that day to prevent Stevens’ death? Barring conspiracy theorists, no one seems to think so, including the Benghazi committee. "We now know neither one of these brave men could have been saved," Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., said in a video explaining the committee’s findings. "I do not blame Hillary Clinton or (Defense Secretary) Leon Panetta," Ann Stevens, the ambassador’s sister who serves as the spokesperson for the family, told the New Yorker. "I don’t see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her. It is very unjust." It’s one thing to say Clinton and other top government officials should shoulder some responsibility for the institutional failure that contributed to the inadequate response to the Benghazi attacks, but it’s ridiculous to accuse Clinton of murder. Our ruling Cohen tweeted a meme that says Clinton "presided over $6 billion lost at the State Department, sold uranium to the Russians through (her) faux charity, illegally deleted public records, and murdered an ambassador." There are significant problems with each part of the post. During Clinton’s tenure at as secretary of state, the department was reprimanded for shoddy paperwork affecting $6 billion worth of contracts, not "losing" the money. The Clinton Foundation did not sell uranium to the Russians. Clinton’s State Department approved Russia’s purchase of a company with uranium assets in the United States but it was one of 11 organizations to do so. There’s no evidence that she personally advocated for the deal, nor is there evidence that people related to the company who donated to the Clinton Foundation did so on a quid pro quo basis. Clinton deleted over 30,000 emails off her private email server without government review. Experts say that’s certainly skirting the rules and her email server in general was not allowed. But to say that it was "illegal" takes it too far, at least for now. Finally, terrorists murdered the U.S. ambassador. None of the seven probes into the Benghazi attacks held Clinton personally responsible for the ambassador’s death, let alone charge her with murder. This claim is outrageous.

pomt-07297	"The health care price tag for childhood obesity in Georgia is $2.4 billion annually and rising."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/may/20/nathan-deal/deal-uses-wrong-number-make-case-about-childhood-o/	Georgia’s weight problem is making us lighter in the wallet. And we’re not just talking about the adults. Gov. Nathan Deal last week went to an intermediate school in White County to talk about his plans for a statewide initiative to battle childhood obesity. Not only did the governor speak to students about the health concerns that come with obesity, Deal also mentioned its financial impact. "The health care price tag for childhood obesity in Georgia is $2.4 billion annually and rising," Deal said, according to the Gainesville Times. Atlanta Braves president John Schuerholz, who is also involved in the effort, led by the SHAPE Partnership, used the same cost estimate for childhood obesity in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed. The SHAPE Partnership is a public-private partnership that includes several state agencies. Considering these austere times for Georgia families and state government, we thought it worthwhile to dig deeper into the $2.4 billion estimate. Deal’s office sent us a 2009 report on obesity in Georgia to back up the governor’s point. It mentioned that obesity costs the Peach State about $2.4 billion a year. However, that did not specify children. The report mentioned that the average cost in medical care for the obese is $250 a year. We called the authors of that report. One of them, Justin Trogdon, said the average annual medical cost for children is $200. He did not have a specific total for how many obese children there are in Georgia. Trogdon said the $200 estimate comes from examining annual medical spending for obese people and comparing it with non-obese people. The estimate includes out-of-pocket costs and other expenses. The annual cost for children is less than adults because they face fewer health problems, said Trogdon, a research economist at RTI International, an institute that does studies on topics that include health, education, the environment and technology for businesses and governments in more than 40 countries. Researchers are noticing more cases of high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes among children, Trogdon said. "A lot of the expensive issues don’t manifest until later in life," Trogdon said. Nearly 22 percent of Georgia’s children between the ages of 10 and 17 are obese, according to one study sent to us by Deal’s office. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep specific data on how many children in Georgia are between 10 and 17, but it does mention that nearly 7.2 million of Georgia’s 9,687,653 residents are 18 or older. That leaves us with about 2.4 million Georgians younger than 18. We did some more math using that census estimate to determine the percentage of children considered obese and the $200 annual medical cost estimate to see how close that came to what the governor told those students. The total was about $110 million. Not close to $2.4 billion. Was our estimate wrong? We talked about it with Deal’s office. His communications director, Brian Robinson, said the governor misspoke. "The figures he offered are for obesity overall," Robinson said, noting the $2.4 billion annual medical care estimate for all obese Georgians mentioned in the 2009 Georgia study. "His overall point is accurate," Robinson added. "Obesity comes at a high cost to our state and Governor Deal wants to give children a chance to learn about healthy living and engage in healthy living practices." The $2.4 billion estimate was used by various Georgia news organizations and mentioned to students. We appreciate the efforts of the governor’s office to clarify the estimate. Still, it was the wrong estimate and rates the claim False.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2011-05-20T06:00:00	2011-05-09	['None']
pomt-12520	"Nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations."	false	/missouri/statements/2017/apr/24/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-doesnt-account-all-refugee-cases/	During a January debate regarding Rex Tillerson’s nomination to U.S. Secretary of State, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, spoke out against what she claimed to be "misinformation" coming out of the White House on refugees looking to enter the United States. McCaskill addressed the extreme vetting process refugees entering the United States had to undergo even before the ban introduced by Donald Trump on Jan. 27, which temporarily blocked refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries. To reach the United States, she said, refugees must first go through international powers. "Let me first start with this important principle: Nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations," McCaskill said. We decided to verify this claim. Do all people seeking refugee status have to go through the United Nations first? Refugee status vs. refugee resettlement First a bit of context. McCaskill talked about getting "refugee status," but it seems evident she is speaking about permanent resettlement. While there are millions of refugees worldwide, only a sliver of them qualify for refugee resettlement, said Nayla Rush, a senior researcher at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors lowering immigration. And resettlement is only sought by the world’s most vulnerable refugees — those who have fled their home countries for a second country and either cannot return home or must then flee to a third. These "third" countries, according to the U.S. Department of State, are "typically more developed countries, further from conflict regions, such as the United States." Resettlement does not apply to every person seeking refugee status. "You cannot resettle millions," Rush said. "This resettlement program was offered to people who even in their country of refuge, they cannot stay." Priority categories So not every refugee is resettled. But among those who are, is the process always directed through the United Nations? To get an answer, we spoke with Larry Yungk, a senior resettlement officer at the U.N. He told us that McCaskill is incorrect. Although uncommon, the United States does see direct applications for refugee resettlement, Yungk said. Yungk directed us to a State Department report to Congress on proposed refugee admissions for fiscal year 2017. The document explained that refugees looking to apply for resettlement are categorized into three different "priority" groups. The way an individual reaches the United States – through the United Nations or not – depends on the priority group he or she is in. -- In Priority 1 cases, individuals are referred to the United States Refugee Admissions Program by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees based on their circumstances and need for resettlement. This means that the people in this category apply and are admitted to the program individually, on a case by case basis. --In Priority 2 cases, groups of people are referred to the Refugee Admissions Program based on their circumstances and need for resettlement. This means that those in this category apply and are admitted to the program in groups, and not on a case-by-case basis. -- In Priority 3 cases, refugees are referred to the Refugee Admissions Program through applications submitted by nuclear family members already living in the United States. These refugees are "granted access for the purposes of reunification" with their families, according to the report to Congress. Resettlement cases in each priority group can be processed either through the U.N. or the United States depending on the circumstance, Yungk said, though the majority of cases are handled through the U.N. In Priority 3 cases, the United States is most involved. In Priority 1 cases, the U.N. is most involved. Overall, Yungk estimated that about 20 percent to 30 percent of resettlement cases are handled by the United States and not the U.N. "We don’t refer anybody under P3 because that’s a U.S. program," Yungk said. "In P2, I would say about half the group are ours and about half are U.S.-defined P2s ... most of the individual cases come from us," he said. Our ruling McCaskill said "nobody applies to the United States for refugee status. They apply to the United Nations." Overall, most refugees seeking resettlement to the United States must first go through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. However, refugees with nuclear family members already living in the United States are given a different priority that isn’t processed through the United Nations. We rate McCaskill’s claim False.

pomt-07437	Says Wisconsin state Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, has already been recalled.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/22/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-wisconsin-calls-state-sen-randy-h/	He may not be widely known, but state Sen. Randy Hopper’s political fate could help write the final chapter in the historic Wisconsin legislative battle over the future of public employee unions. The Republican is one of eight GOP senators targeted by state Democrats for removal from office as part of a coordinated series of recall campaigns that aim to reclaim the chamber for the Democrats. As residents gathered signatures in an attempt to force him into a recall election, the state Democratic Party focused on casting Hopper in a negative light. The party issued a news release highlighting an embarrassing flub in which a Hopper constituent newsletter included a phone number that directed callers to a sex chat line promising access to nasty talk with hundreds of hot, horny girls. Hopper said it was an inadvertent mistake. Ahem. The party’s press release caught our eye -- but only for professional reasons, we assure you. This was the headline on the party’s release, which quoted party chairman Mike Tate: "Recalled Randy Hopper Directing Constituents to Adult Chat Line." Recalled already? That struck us as an unusual claim. With recall fever hitting the state -- eight Democrats are also the target of recall attempts -- we thought we’d look at whether the "recalled" label is appropriate at this point in the process. In the case of Hopper, the senator from Fond du Lac, recall advocates filed petitions on April 7 seeking an election. A review of the signatures on the petitions -- by the state’s Government Accountability Board -- is pending. We asked Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski to explain the "recalled" label. He called our request a waste of time and our questions "an act of pedantry." With the party offering no clear rationale, we turned to some election experts. They noted the term "recall" has inspired much confusion among the public. And legal and political professionals disagree over the point in time when it is appropriate to label an elected official "recalled." John Coleman, a political scientist at UW-Madison, said you can make a case for two points in time. One: When the state certifies the need for an election after confirming the validity of signatures on recall petitions. Two: When the incumbent loses the election. The term recall "suggests an official who is being brought back to stand before the people," Coleman told PolitiFact Wisconsin. "This has some historical resonance along the lines that in days gone by, transportation and communication were difficult, and the elected official was in some far off place remote from his or her constituents. The recall election was a way to bring them back to the constituents." Coleman said that in everyday conversation, "when people say ‘Legislator X has been recalled,’ they’ll probably mean the legislator has to face a recall election. It’s a handy shorthand term." Coleman, who has a national perspective on elections, said he personally leans toward "recall" meaning removal from office. By either measure, though, the state Democratic Party’s depiction of Hopper’s status would be wrong. We asked Hopper’s campaign manager, Jeff Harvey, when he would consider his candidate "recalled." He said it would be after state elections officials certify the request for a recall election -- and only after a Hopper defeat in the contest. "If he wins that means he was never recalled," Harvey said. OK, so that’s the other end of the spectrum from the Democrats. Let’s go to Kevin Kennedy, the state’s lead elections official as director of the Government Accountability Board. Through a spokesman, Kennedy said an incumbent is "recalled once they have to stand for election." Here’s what the state’s official recall manual says about it: "Recall gives voters the right to reconsider their choice of an elected official. However, it does not automatically result in removal of an official from office." Where exactly does the Hopper case stand in the process? Pro-recall workers on April 7, 2011 turned in signatures to the Government Accountability Board seeking to force an election. Hopper’s side filed a challenge to some signatures on April 21. The GAB will take weeks to review the signatures and decide whether a sufficient number are valid. At that point, either Hopper or the recall forces could appeal the GAB’s decision to court. So there is a long way to go before an election is set to proceed -- the trigger point for the "recall" label being accurate. Coleman, the UW political scientist, said the notion that somebody is "recalled" at the point when signatures are turned in is a "non-starter." It strikes us that the Democrats’ labeling of Hopper is akin to calling a criminal suspect "charged" at the point at which police have turned over evidence to the district attorney -- but before prosecutors have decided whether to file charges. Let’s return to the statement: The state Democratic Party issued a statement that labeled Hopper as already "recalled." There is some disagreement among experts about when it’s accurate to use the term "recalled." But there is no dispute that the party jumped the gun by at least several weeks. Hopper might be recalled sometime this spring, but we are not there yet. We rate the party’s statement False.

pomt-06613	"In 1976, the first year that Pell Grants were fully funded, a full Pell Grant paid 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. Today, a full Pell Grant covers just 34 percent of those costs.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/22/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-says-full-pell-grants-cover-only-34/	On July 28, 2011, The Hill newspaper ran a story saying, "House conservatives who have stalled legislation to raise the national debt limit are angry that it includes $17 billion in supplemental spending for Pell Grants, which some compare to welfare." Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse cited that article when he rose to speak on the Senate floor the following day. He criticized House Republicans for an earlier failed attempt to cut Pell Grant funding, and he defended the debt deal’s increase in Pell Grant funding, noting the program’s Rhode Island roots. "When Rhode Island’s great Senator Claiborne Pell first proposed the grants that now bear his name, he envisioned a grant that would enable low-income students to attend our country’s wonderful colleges and universities so they, too, could share in the American dream," Whitehouse said. "In 1976, the first year that Pell Grants were fully funded, a full Pell Grant paid 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college. Today, a full Pell Grant covers just 34 percent of those costs. Still, this vital assistance can often mean the difference between being able to attend college or not. With many families in Rhode Island and the country still struggling in this economy, we should be looking for ways to strengthen Pell Grants, not weaken them." Whether Pell grants should be cut or increased is for others to decide. But we wondered whether their buying power has really plunged as far as Whitehouse claimed. We asked Whitehouse’s office to provide the basis for his assertion. The senator’s spokesman provided a document, dated July 12, from the Federal Education Budget Project of the New America Foundation, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. "In fiscal year 1976, the first year that the Pell Grant program was fully funded at its authorized level, the maximum Pell Grant was $1,400 and covered 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college," the document said. "Despite regular increases in funding and grant levels, the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has decreased over the past 30 years as the price of college has risen. In the 2009-10 school year, the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical four-year public college." To check the think tank’s numbers, we turned to the U.S. Department of Education, which administers the Pell Grant program. It said the maximum grant was $5,350 in 2009-10 -- up from $1,400 in 1976-77. The department’s National Center for Education Statistics said the average cost of attending a four-year public institution was $15,014 in 2009-10 -- up from $1,935 in 1976-77. Do the math and you find the maximum Pell Grant covered 36 percent of the average cost of attending a four-year public institution in 2009-10 --- down from 72 percent in 1976-77. That’s exactly what the New America Foundation document said, but it’s not exactly what Whitehouse said on the Senate floor: that Pell grants "now" cover 34 percent of those costs. So why the slight discrepancy? Whitehouse’s spokesman said the senator was referring to more recent figures, for the 2010-11 academic year. He cited a report from the Advocacy & Policy Center of College Board, a nonprofit membership organization that sells standardized tests and does education research. That report notes that the maximum Pell Grant has risen to $5,550 for the 2010-11 academic year. "This amount covers 34 percent of the average published tuition, fees, room, and board at a public four-year college," the report says, using an average cost of $16,140 for attending a four-year public institution in 2010-11. Whitehouse appears to have done his homework. We rate this claim True.	None	Sheldon Whitehouse	None	None	None	2011-09-22T00:01:00	2011-07-29	['Pell_Grant']
pomt-03186	Says Cory Booker "supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/sep/01/bookerfail/cory-booker-supports-late-term-abortion-opposes-sa/	U.S. Senate hopeful Cory Booker supports a woman’s right to choose, according to his campaign website. But to hear two conservative groups tell it, Booker supports much more than choice. The American Commitment Action Fund, a conservative Political Action Committee behind the #BookerFAIL website, and the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti abortion-rights group, funded a new ad that claims Booker, a Democrat and Newark’s mayor, condones abortion at any stage of pregnancy and without restrictions. "He supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations," the ad states. Conservative activist Steve Lonegan is Booker’s challenger in an Oct. 16 special election for a Senate seat left vacant after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg’s death in June. The groups say Booker’s support of the Democratic National Committee’s platform gives credence to their claim, but the Truth-O-Meter has determined there’s a little more to this story than what the ad portrays. Let’s begin by reviewing how the groups came to identify Booker’s supposed support of late-term and partial-birth abortions, and opposition to safety regulations. Mallory Quigley, communications director for the Susan B. Anthony group, directed us to Booker’s support of the national committee’s platform. "We’re taking a look at the Democratic Party platform which unequivocally supports a woman’s right to choose without any restrictions and regardless of ability to pay," Quigley said. "That was supported by Booker and a host of others." Indeed, the ad shows a clip from Booker’s Sept. 4, 2012 address during a Planned Parenthood rally at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C "I was a co-chair for the DNC platform, when we affirmed a woman's right to choose," Booker said during the rally. So Quigley is correct that Booker and others supported the Democratic National Committee platform and women having the right to choose. Now let’s review the national committee’s platform on abortion. The platform makes no mention of specific procedures such as late-term or partial-birth abortion, and states support for a woman’s right to make decisions about her pregnancy, "including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay," according to a statement from the Democratic National Committee. The committee also supports a woman’s decision to carry a pregnancy to term. "We strongly and unequivocally support a woman's decision to have a child by providing affordable health care and ensuring the availability of and access to programs that help women during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including caring adoption programs," the platform states. Next, we checked with Booker campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis about the mayor’s stance on abortion. "We can all agree that we want to prevent unintended pregnancies, and therefore the need for abortion," Griffis said in an e-mail. "Fundamentally, Mayor Booker believes that a woman's health decisions should remain between her and her doctor. Mayor Booker supports Roe v Wade, which allows women the right to choose up to the point of viability." As for late-term and partial-birth abortions? "Cory Booker does not oppose restrictions on post-viability abortions if exceptions are made for the health and the life of the mother," Griffis said, meaning the mayor would support a woman’s choice in that case to decide the fate of her pregnancy with her doctor. The American Commitment Action Fund did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling A new ad targeting Booker claims, "He supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations." A spokeswoman for one of the groups behind the ad notes that Booker’s stance on abortion comes from his support of the Democratic National Committee’s 2012 platform, which Booker co-chaired. The platform, though, makes no mention of late-term or partial-birth abortion, which a Booker spokesman agreed the Democrat would support a woman’s right to choose if her life or health is in danger. The platform says nothing else about safety regulations, which some states – such as Texas – have cited in attempts to ban abortion after a certain point in pregnancy. That makes this claim partially accurate, but lacking important details -- and that fits the definition of Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09356	The Senate Republican education plan is an unfunded mandate for local school districts.	true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/05/alex-sink/alex-sink-education-bill-unfunded-mandate/	Count Alex Sink among those fighting a controversial series of education reforms being pushed by state Republican leaders. SB 6 would link teacher pay increases to student performance, eliminate long-term job security for new teachers and require end-of-course exams for subjects not covered by the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test starting in the 2013-2014 school year. Most Democrats and some moderate Republicans in the Legislature oppose the changes; so does the teachers union. Sink, the state's chief financial officer and a Democrat running for governor, added her opposition in a March 31, 2010, statement. "These proposals are bad for our children and our state," Sink said. "As a mother whose two children went to Florida public schools, I feel strongly that our local school districts should be the ones making these kinds of decisions for our students and teachers -- not politicians in Tallahassee. I also have a serious problem with placing even more unfunded mandates on our local school districts, as they are already facing significant budget concerns." The education bill proposed by Sen. John Thrasher, R-Jacksonville, has been one of the more hotly debated issues of the 2010 legislative session. It passed the Senate 21-17 on March 24, 2010, and awaits action in the House. As part of the bill, teachers hired after July 2010 would work under one-year contracts instead of the current multi-year contracts awarded to teachers after three years of service, which is informally known as tenure. School districts would have to create base salaries and set aside a pool of money for performance bonuses that would be based on test scores and other guidelines developed by 2014. The legislation would cause a major shift from current pay scales, which base salaries on degrees and years of experience. A good recap of the bill and what's happened so far is here. In this item, we want to explore Sink's claim about who would pay to implement the new education initiatives, and whether or not the bill creates an "unfunded mandate." We've heard others make a similar claim, including Duval County Schools superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals and Republican state Rep. Julio Robaina of Miami. What's the cost? First, we need to set some boundaries -- in this case, by defining unfunded mandate. We like this definition, which was offered by the presidents of the Florida Association of Counties and the Florida League of Cities in a recent guest editorial: A mandate is a program or service that the state or federal government requires local governments to provide, but they do not provide funding to pay for it. Second, it's very clear there are costs associated with passing SB 6. The actual price tag, however, is "indeterminate," according to a legislative analysis. It points to unknown costs associated with: Developing and modifying the system to assess student learning gains; Developing and revising the teacher and school-based administrator appraisal system to include student learning gains; Developing a system of teacher compensation to include student performance, as measured by student learning gains, and differentiated responsibilities, such as assignment to a school in a high priority area or teaching in a critical shortage area; Revising teacher contracts to assist in making personnel decisions; and Training personnel to implement the revised systems. "School districts will incur additional costs associated with the development or acquisition of end-of-course assessments for each subject area and grade level that is not tested by statewide assessments or AP, IB, AICE, or industry certification examinations," a House analysis of the companion bill, HB 7189, found. "However, the fiscal impact of these activities is indeterminate." The Department of Education says overall teacher salaries could also increase, depending on how teachers perform in the new system. The overall pricetag depends on how much it costs local districts to implement the changes and how teachers perform, spokesman Tom Butler said. Butler noted that the implementation costs "could be supplemented" if the state receives a federal Race to the Top grant award. Florida lost in round 1 of the grant process, but plans on applying in round 2. Applications are due June 1, Butler said. Who's got the bill? At this point, it's crucial to get background about how Florida's schools are funded. Florida's K-12 schools are funded through a combination of federal, state and local dollars. The core funding is filtered through the Florida Education Finance Program, a 1973 legislative initiative that attempts to equalize funding levels among school districts. The state's contribution is almost entirely set by the Legislature, while local funds come almost entirely from property taxes. The Legislature sets how much property taxes a school district must collect in order to receive state funding. The local school district then has the ability to levy additional property taxes. According to the Florida Department of Education, school districts in 2007-08 received 40.27 percent of their financial support from state sources, 51.05 percent from local sources, and 8.68 percent from federal sources. SB 6 sets aside 5 percent of federal, state and local Florida Eduaction Finance Program funds beginning in 2011 (roughly $900 million) to implement the new education initiatives, including end-of-course exams and the new performance pay system. Starting in 2014 that money would then be used to actually pay teachers (remember, that's when linking pay increases to student performance would start). The money isn't new money, in the sense that it's in addition to current school budgets. It's simply carved out of the existing funding structure. Let's think this through from both sides. On one hand, the money is set aside to implement SB 6, so it clearly cannot be an unfunded mandate. But on the other hand, the money essentially is being taken out of existing school budgets and spent a different way. "I've heard that maybe they won't take it out of district money, that they'll take it out of state money," said Duval County Schools superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals, who recently wrote a letter to the editor about SB 6. "Well, however they carve it up, if they fence in 5 percent, I'm still 5 percent down." Pratt-Dannals said his district would face a $42 million budget shortfall beginning in 2011 if SB 6 is approved, the same year the district also loses $43 million in federal stimulus money. A Race to Top grant could help, but it's unclear if the money would cover all the costs associated with SB 6. "This is an UNFUNDED mandate," state Rep. Julio Robaina, R-Miami, said in a press release April 1, 2010. "School districts will have to 'cobble-wobble together' the funding to put all the provisions into place or they will be PENALIZED and lose state funding." The ruling In its simplest terms, SB 6 identifies funding for the education policy changes. What's different is the funding the Senate identified already is being used by schools for something else. It's not like the Senate is paying for the education reforms with an increase to the cigarette tax, or some other revenue stream. To fund their proposed reforms, Republicans in the Legislature are essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul. And it's that funding scheme that produces the same result as if the Legislature didn't fund SB 6 at all. They are fencing in 5 percent of a school district's budget to implement the statewide changes, without any promise that additional funds will be coming down the road. The funding mechanism will force school districts to either cut budgets or raise taxes. Yes, a Race to the Top grant may help. But no one knows if the money's coming, or if it's enough. Sink called the Republican education plan an "unfunded mandate." We rate her claim True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-04-05T15:15:35	2010-03-31	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-00756	Says Howard Zinn, "an anti-American Marxist," wrote "the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/15/rick-santorum/book-howard-zinn-most-popular-high-school-history-/	A debate over high school history books doesn’t seem like the most obvious point to bring up during a speech to members of the National Rifle Association. But potential presidential candidate Rick Santorum did just that during the group’s annual convention last week. In addition to touching on gun rights issues in his speech, Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania, criticized teachers for assigning works by the late Howard Zinn, including A People’s History of the United States, that cast a critical -- and often sharply negative -- light on the past actions of the U.S. government. "Do you know the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America is written by a man named Howard Zinn, who is an anti-American Marxist, and that is the most common textbook?" Santorum said in the April 10, 2015, speech. (It’s around the 10:15 mark.) We wondered whether Santorum was correct, so we took a closer look. Who was Howard Zinn? First, some background on Zinn. Zinn was born in 1922 to Eastern European immigrants and grew up in working-class Brooklyn. "By his late teens, his reading had veered into politics, especially Marxism," wrote Rutgers University historian David Greenberg. Greenberg noted that historians have divided over the question of whether Zinn ever officially joined the Communist Party, but there is no doubt that his politics were -- and remained -- left-wing until his death in 2010. Zinn earned a Ph.D. in history from Columbia, taught for more than two decades at Boston University, and went on to write a number of books and plays, but A People’s History became his most famous work, selling more than 2 million copies since its publication in 1980, including various updated editions, according to Amazon.com. Zinn intended it as history from the bottom-up -- "the Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish ... ." It’s a black-and-white, heroes-and-villains history of the United States in which the United States is almost always in the wrong. The book clearly hit a nerve: It became a cultural icon, name-checked on such television shows as The Sopranos and The Simpsons and receiving a prominent endorsement by Matt Damon’s character in the movie Good Will Hunting. The book also informed a number of historical documentaries and has inspired a national effort to promote his approach to history called the Zinn Education Project. So Zinn clearly has his admirers. But he also has detractors -- and they are not just conservatives. Some of Zinn’s fiercest critics have been liberals. Greenberg, writing in the liberal magazine The New Republic in 2013, called it a "pretty lousy piece of work" and said Zinn’s scholarly contributions were "meager." Zinn "renounces the ideals of objectivity and empirical responsibility, and makes the dubious leap to the notion that a historian need only lay his ideological cards on the table and tell whatever history he chooses," Greenberg wrote. Even a publication of the American Federation of Teachers -- one of the nation’s two leading teachers’ unions -- ran a piece critical of Zinn by Stanford education and history professor Sam Wineburg. "It seems that once (Zinn) made up his mind, nothing—not new evidence, not new scholarship, not the discovery of previously unknown documents, not the revelations of historical actors on their deathbeds—could shake it," Wineburg wrote. He added that "history as truth, issued from the left or from the right, abhors shades of gray. It seeks to stamp out the democratic insight that people of good will can see the same thing and come to different conclusions." What’s the evidence? We won’t take a position on the merits of Zinn’s historiography, but we will look at the evidence for whether Santorum is correct that Zinn is the author of "the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America." We’ll start by noting that, contrary to Santorum’s wording, A People’s History is "not a textbook but a trade book," said Gilbert T. Sewall, director of the New York City-based American Textbook Council. While A People’s History might serve as supplementary material in a high school history class, "its choices are highly idiosyncratic and it really wouldn’t do as your main text for a U.S. history survey class," Greenberg of Rutgers told PolitiFact. Beyond this, though, is there hard evidence that Zinn is the "most popular" book in high-school history classes? The short answer is no. When we asked Matt Beynon, a spokesman for Santorum, for supporting evidence, he referred us to two articles that mentioned the book but didn’t provide any hard evidence that it was the "most popular." Other experts also came up empty in the search for hard data. "I have never heard anyone in our organization suggest that it is the most popular by any stretch of the definition of ‘most,’ " said Susan Griffin, executive director of the National Council for the Social Studies, which represents high school history teachers. Peter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, said that while he believes anecdotally that Zinn’s books are "widely used" in American high schools, he is unaware "of any hard data on how often it is assigned relative to other textbooks or how popular it is compared to other historical surveys." Sewall, of the American Textbook Council, concurred. While Zinn’s impact on social studies teachers "is prodigious and possibly unparalleled," he said, "there is no way to determine the most popular base history instructional materials used in U.S. high schools." In an interview, Wineburg of Stanford added that "not a single state in the union" has put Zinn’s books on an "approved adoption list for middle or high school. Three big companies, including the biggest, Holt-McDougal, control about 90 percent of the market. They issue conventional, 1,000-page behemoths. … Find me one instance in which Zinn appears on any one of 50 state adoption lists, and I'll find you a unicorn." Not even Zinn’s supporters agree with the claims that his influence in high school classrooms is unmatched. Alison Kysia, who has taught history at Northern Virginia Community College and has served as a fellow with the group that co-sponsors the Zinn Education Project, has written that "for as much as I wish" it were true that A People’s History was the most popular history textbook used in classrooms today, "it isn’t." Not only is there no comprehensive study, she wrote, but the evidence of the volume’s use in college classes shows that it’s not used especially widely. Specifically, a study by Dan Cohen, the founding executive director of the Digital Public Library of America and a former historian at George Mason University, found that of 258 undergraduate U.S. history survey courses in spring 2004, only three assigned Zinn’s book. The most commonly assigned volumes were The American Promise, by Roark, Johnson, Cohen, Stage and Hartmann, and The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society, by Nash, Jeffrey, Howe Frederick, Davis, Winkler, Mires and Pestana. "I doubt that high school is much different," Cohen told PolitiFact. "There are a lot of textbooks out there, and Zinn's is a tiny fraction of the assigned books." Anecdotal evidence So we find no evidence to support the statistical claim that Zinn’s is "the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America." But we do think it’s worth paying at least some attention to the broader question of whether Zinn remains influential. For starters, Zinn’s sales are still strong, even five years after his death. He ranks about 30th on Amazon.com’s list of best-selling history authors. (The ranking changes constantly based on new sales, so it’s impossible to pinpoint a specific number.) While this bit of evidence should be taken with a grain of salt -- Fox News host Bill O’Reilly ranks about 10th on the same list -- it does suggest a continuing interest in his works. Indeed, Wood of the National Association of Scholars said it’s possible to interpret Santorum’s use of the word "popular" as meaning best-liked, rather than most widely used. While he acknowledges that this would be impossible to test empirically, he said it’s not implausible to think that Zinn’s supporters have an unmatched level of passion for his writings. "There really is no other history textbook that enjoys the level of enthusiasm among students as Zinn’s book enjoys," he said. There’s anecdotal evidence for this. Wineburg of Stanford noted in his article that "in 2008, the National Council for the Social Studies invited Zinn to address its annual conference—the largest gathering of social studies teachers in the country. Zinn's speech met with raucous applause." Greenberg of Rutgers, while he called Santorum’s claim "hyperbole," agreed that Zinn’s works are "influential." "It’s very simplistic and appeals to the high school mind," he said. "I think there is a germ of truth in the conservative complaint that the academy is captive to left-wing ideas." Our ruling Santorum said that Zinn wrote "the most popular textbook that's taught in our high schools in America." While there is anecdotal evidence that Zinn’s work is popular among some high-school teachers, there is zero hard evidence to support Santorum’s core statistical claim -- that Zinn’s volume is taught in more high-school history classes than any other book. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08653	Says opponent Bill Flores helped run a company that laid off over 3,000 workers and paid off executives with millions.	false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/15/chet-edwards/chet-edwards-says-republican-challenger-bill-flore/	Democratic U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, seeking re-election against GOP hopeful Bill Flores, says that as a businessman Flores helped run a company that laid off several thousand workers and then paid off executives. In a TV ad that debuted online Sept. 6, Edwards first notes Flores’ boast he’s helped build energy companies and has created over 500 jobs—a claim PolitiFact Texas is reviewing. In Edwards' ad, the narrator says: "What (Flores) doesn’t say is that an oil company he helped run laid off over 3,000 workers and then paid off its top executives with millions." Ouch. Is that so? Edwards’ campaign said in back-up materials for its ad that in May 1998, two oil-field services companies--Baker Hughes Incorporated and Western Atlas, which employed Flores as senior vice president and chief financial officer--announced plans to merge. In July 1998, Flores signed an amended merger agreement on behalf of Western Atlas that was approved by shareholders for the companies in August 1998. According to information later submitted by Flores to Gov. Rick Perry’s office, Flores had joined Western Atlas in August 1997 and after the merger assisted Baker Hughes with special projects through December 1998. To support its layoff tally, the Democrat’s campaign refers to a July 19, 1999 Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Baker Hughes, which is based in Houston. "Approximately 3,600 employees were terminated as of Dec. 31, 1998," the filing says. Edwards’ campaign says that the terminations occurred after the merger and while Flores still worked for the company. Finally, Edwards’ campaign says, the same July 1999 SEC filing indicates that Baker Hughes reported spending $87.7 million related to the termination of employees whose "responsibilities were deemed redundant" and executives "due to change in control provisions" triggered by the merger. The filing says executives were paid $60.8 million in total. In response to Edwards’ ad, Flores’ campaign issued a Sept. 7 "fact sheet" challenging the ad's message. In follow-up interviews, Flores told us he continued working for Western Atlas after the merger--even keeping his title of CFO--but was limited to working on the sale of Western Atlas's share of a joint venture that operated in parts of the former Soviet Union. His big point: He did not work for Baker Hughes as a top-level executive and had no role in the layoffs or executive payments at issue. Flores allowed, however, that before the merger he and other executives had expected about 170 terminations afterward due to "redundancies" in duties between top staff of the two companies. He said about 90 to 105 of the ultimately terminated workers--including Flores--were Western Atlas employees. In separate moves that year, Flores said, Baker Hughes had already begun layoffs in response to a downturn in the world economy reflected in lower oil and gas prices and rig counts. He said Baker Hughes cut 700 workers in the second quarter of 1998, before the merger; another 2,000 because of industry conditions in the third quarter, and 700 to 800 additional employees in the fourth quarter, for a total of about 3,400. In an online search, we found a Houston Chronicle news report reflecting a similar count and interpretation. Flores said Western Atlas had ended 1997 with more than 10,000 employees. "To the best of my knowledge, virtually all the Western Atlas employees remained with Western Atlas (after the merger) except the 100 or so deemed redundant," Flores said. Flores' campaign forwarded sworn statements from several Western Atlas executives at the time including one from John Russell, who says he served as president and ceo of Western Atlas up to the merger and as president of Baker Hughes after that. After the merger, Russell's Sept. 8 statement says, Flores "was relieved of his management authority; however, as is typical in many acquisitions and mergers, (he) was retained on (the Western Atlas) payroll through" the end of the year. Separately, we contacted Baker Hughes where spokesman Gary Flaharty said Flores "was not in a role to affect employment levels at the combined company after the merger." He said that despite the 3,000-plus layoffs, Baker Hughes Inc. ended the year with 32,200 employees, up from 31,600 in 1997, the year before the merger. For outside perspective, we called Miguel Quinones, a management professor at the Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business. After reviewing one of the SEC filings by Baker Hughes and Edwards' TV spot, Quinones said: "I do note that the positions eliminated cover all levels, including executives. I also don’t see how the layoffs can be blamed on Flores." Quinones speculated the payments would have reflected contractual commitments tied to the merger, not actions taken by Flores personally. To round out our exploration, we asked Edwards' campaign if it was fair to say Flores had no role in the Baker Hughes firings and payments to executives. Spokeswoman Megan Jacobs reminded us that Edwards' ad doesn't say Flores is to blame for either, only that Flores helped run a company that had over 3,000 layoffs and paid millions to its executives. "The ad does not say the merger caused the layoffs," Jacobs said. True--though Flores' campaign pointed out a Sept. 8 news article in the Cleburne Times-Review quoting Jacobs saying: "It's pretty clear the layoffs were the results of the merger." Jacobs then told us that's how it appears to Edwards. Finally, Jacobs stressed a version of Flores' resume that Flores filed with the state in 2004 to steel their case that Flores helped run Baker Hughes. She noted that the page describing Flores' time at Western Atlas recaps the merger with Baker Hughes right before a sentence that begins: "During his tenure, he reported to the President and CEO and maintained an open dialogue" with the board chairman and members of the board of directors. The entry goes on to say "his scope of authority included (i) mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, (ii) financings and capital market activities, (iii) investor and institutional relations, (iv) planning and budgeting, among other executive responsibilities..." Flores told us that "during his tenure" refers to his time with Western Atlas, hence the reference to his contacts with the president, ceo and other highers-up. All told, how does Edwards' statement settle out? Undenied: Flores retained an executive title at Western Atlas in the same year its new parent company, Baker Hughes, laid off more than 3,000 employees and paid post-merger millions to executives. But do these facts prove Edwards' lynchpin statement that Flores "helped run" Baker Hughes? Not so, documents and our interviews indicate. Instead, we're told that after his old company merged with Baker Hughes, Flores' duties were limited to a single small project before his departure less than six months later. We don't see significance in the Flores' resume snippet touted by Edwards. We rate Edwards' statement as False.	None	Chet Edwards	None	None	None	2010-09-15T06:00:00	2010-09-06	['None']
pomt-00497	Says Beto O’Rourke is "open to abolishing ICE."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/06/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-beto-orourke-open-abolishing-ice/	Republican Ted Cruz, seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate, calls Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke too extreme and reckless for Texas in a video ad including the charge that O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman, is amenable to wiping out the nation’s lead immigration agency. In the ad, brought to light by an Aug. 3, 2018, Texas Tribune news story, Cruz’s narrator says: "Not even Nancy Pelosi is open to abolishing ICE. But Beto is." Imagery shows Pelosi and O’Rourke and what looks like a July 2018 Tribune excerpt stating: "...I’m open to doing that…" By email, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Emily Miller pointed us to a July 1, 2018, Cruz press release taking note of the Tribune reporting that O’Rourke had said he was open to abolishing Immigration & Customs Enforcement, an idea embraced by some Democrats upset by actions including the separation of children and parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Miller also pointed out a Cruz release noting that O’Rourke on July 18, 2018 voted against a resolution offering support to ICE officers. O’Rourke was among 34 Democrats to vote against the House-advanced resolution, which was described by The Hill, a Capitol newspaper, as a move by Republicans to divide Democrats by holding a vote on ICE's vitality to public safety. "Republicans have pounced on those Democrats seeking to abolish ICE," the Hill reported, "accusing them of defending immigrants with no legal status — including violent criminals — instead of protecting the American public." So, is O’Rourke open to offing ICE? He said as much in July 2018, we confirmed, though he also declared that he wouldn’t support abolition without a plan to shift its responsibilities elsewhere. More recently, O’Rourke has said abolition by itself doesn’t make sense. O’Rourke says he’s open to abolition if duties transfer Our search for relevant news accounts led us to a July 2, 2018, Tribune news story quoting O’Rourke initially saying at a San Antonio stop that he’s open to doing away with ICE or changing how it performs and giving its enforcement duties to another entity--and, in the same appearance, saying he opposes abolishing ICE. From the story: "Asked about abolishing ICE Friday at a town hall in San Antonio, O'Rourke discussed the need to eliminate fear in immigrant communities under Trump and to find a better way to enforce immigration laws. ‘And if that involves doing away with this agency, giving that responsibility to somebody else, changing how this agency performs, I’m open to doing that,’ O’Rourke said. "Yet he went on to flatly answer no when directly asked if he would abolish ICE, explaining that he does not currently know enough about how immigration law would be enforced without the agency. "‘I understand the urgency of this,’ O’Rourke said in conclusion. ‘I just want to make sure that we’re constructive in how we talk about meeting this challenge and that I understand what abolishing ICE would mean in terms of enforcing our laws going forward.’" The day before, Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek posted a tweet quoting O’Rourke at greater length. According to Svitek, O’Rourke agreed with the individual who asked him about ICE that there’s got "to be a better way of enforcing our laws, not using those tactics that instill fear, that do not reflect the best of us, not separating children from their parents at the border and keeping them in cages. And so if there’s another, better way to enforce our immigration laws--and I hope we’re all on the same page that we want to make sure that laws are enforced, we want to make sure that our laws reflect who we are and that we change those laws to make sure that we make the most out of all of us--then I’m open to that." O’Rourke’s reply went on: "And if that involves doing away with this agency, giving that responsibility to somebody else, changing how this agency performs, I’m open to doing that." Next, Svitek reported, someone asked: "So would you abolish ICE?" O’Rourke replied, per the tweet: "No. So let me be really clear: I don’t know enough about how we would perform those same enforcement functions, if through another part of the Department of Homeland Security. But if you’re saying abolish the tactics that I just described, yes. I don’t know if you have to abolish the agency to do that…" He added: "I just want to make sure that we’re constructive in how we talk about meeting this challenge and that I understand what abolishing ICE would mean in terms of enforcing our laws going forward." Other news accounts Next we, searched the Nexis news database for instances of O’Rourke speaking about ICE, finding: --A July 5, 2018, Longview News-Journal news story quoting O’Rourke saying in a phone interview that he would join discussions of ICE’s future and how it fulfills its mandate. --A July 6, 2018, Houston Chronicle news story stating O’Rourke had stopped short of calling for ICE’s elimination but was willing to discuss the idea. According to the story, O’Rourke expressed a willingness after a stop in Hillsboro to discuss eliminating ICE, but he said that alone would not solve the problem. O’Rourke said it doesn’t matter if agencies like ICE and Homeland Security are eliminated if such moves don’t address practices including the separation of children from parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. "I want to make sure we are ending the practices of taking kids from their families," O’Rourke said. "I want to focus on ending the practices." --Most recently, O’Rourke was asked in an interview posted online July 25, 2018: "Some of your Democratic colleagues are saying just abolish ICE altogether. A bridge too far for you?" O’Rourke replied on ABC Radio’s Powerhouse Politics Podcast: "I just don’t understand it. It’s not clear to me what that would accomplish." O’Rourke elaborated that abolishing the agency wouldn’t solve the separation of children from parents or the deaths of migrants near the border. "Abolishing ICE does nothing to solve any of those issues," O’Rourke said, in contrast to making changes in federal policy. Ad also touches impeachment, narcotics Cruz’s ad also says O’Rourke supports impeaching President Donald Trump and suggested legalizing all narcotics including heroin--topics we’ve explored. O’Rourke said in an interview for Showtime’s "The Circus" in May 2018 that he was willing then to vote to impeach Trump, which constitutionally occurs in the House, though he’s since stressed that he’s not campaigned for impeachment proceedings to commence and he voted against a December 2017 impeachment resolution. This summer, we rated False a Cruz claim that O’Rourke was the nation’s only Senate candidate to call for impeaching Trump. On his campaign website, O’Rourke calls for ending the war on drugs and leaving marijuana regulation to the states. As a member of the El Paso City Council, O’Rourke in 2009 amended a council resolution to include language supporting "an honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics." At the time, O’Rourke was explicit about not yet personally favoring across-the-board legalization. The council-approved resolution, which didn’t specify any drugs including heroin, was later vetoed. In May 2018, we rated False a claim by Cruz that O’Rourke had a resolution to legalize all narcotics. Our ruling Cruz said in his ad that O’Rourke is "open to abolishing ICE." In June 2018, O’Rourke said he’s open to abolishing ICE. However, he also said he wasn’t in favor of eliminating the agency without ensuring its enforcement duties were assigned elsewhere. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-13738	"There are fewer people crossing (the southwest) border than in the last 30 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/luis-gutierrez/rep-gutierrez-says-fewer-people-crossing-border-la/	U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., used his speech at the opening night of the Democratic National Convention to be an advocate for immigrants, saying they work, pay taxes and defend democracy. Gutierrez continued to press the message in an interview with Fox News host Bill O’Reilly from the floor of the Wells Fargo Center. "We could solve the problem tomorrow because there are good men and women in the Republican party who can work with good men and women in the Democratic party," Gutierrez said. "Look Bill, there are fewer people crossing that border than in the last 30 years. We've already doubled the enforcement on the border." This fact-check will examine his statement that border crossings are at a 30-year low. U.S. Border Patrol border apprehension data serves as a way to gauge illegal immigration patterns, though it’s difficult to say for certain how many have tried crossing the border. "If they are crossing without anyone noticing, then we have to make assumptions based on what can be measured," said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute, in an interview. Two ways to measure is by looking at border apprehensions and by making estimates based on on the number living in the U.S. as a proxy for the size of the flow, she said A spokesman for Gutierrez directed us to recent research published by Pew Research Center saying that the number of Mexican immigrants apprehended at U.S. borders in fiscal 2015 was the lowest in nearly 50 years. U.S. Border Patrol data tallying "illegal alien apprehensions" by fiscal year (Oct. 1 through Sept. 30) shows a total of 337,117 immigrants were apprehended in fiscal year 2015, including 331,333 at the southwest border. Border Patrol data going back to apprehensions nationwide since fiscal 1925 shows that apprehensions in fiscal 2015 were the lowest since at least the early 1970s. But numbers at the southwest border actually dipped a few years ago. Southwest border apprehensions were lower in fiscal year 2011 at 327,577 --- about 3,756 fewer people than were apprehended at that border in fiscal 2015. Some researchers offered Gutierrez the benefit of the doubt. "Given the uncertain ratio between apprehensions and actual crossings, it would be fair to call 2015 and 2011 a statistical ‘tie’," said Jacob L. Vigdor, a Daniel J. Evans professor at the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington. Before 2011, the lowest number of apprehensions was in 1972, at 321,326. Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, says there really is no way to know for sure if the number of people illegally crossing the border is less than in the last 30 years, as Gutierrez said. He says apprehensions are a weak way to measure new illegal immigration because it doesn’t count visa overstays or people using border crossing cards. The number of non-Mexican apprehensions, which used to be very small, has also increased and offset declines in immigration from Mexico, he said. Data collected by the Census Bureau shows 3.1 million new immigrants settled in the United States in 2014 and 2015 (legally and illegally). Our ruling Gutierrez said, "There are fewer people crossing that border than in the last 30 years" while discussing border security. While there’s no definite way to count all immigrants who try to cross U.S. borders, many immigration scholars use border patrol apprehension data as the basis for their assessments. Historically, Border Patrol data for apprehensions nationwide shows that apprehensions in fiscal year 2015 were the lowest since at least the early 1970s. There was one year with fewer apprehensions at the southwest border than 2015 -- the 2011 fiscal year, which had about 3,756 fewer stops than 2015. With that caveat, the point about the larger immigration trend is accurate.

pomt-11694	"We've seen funding increases for schools. We haven't seen a corresponding performance increase."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/26/parker-briden/governors-spokesman-fudges-education-funding-perfo/	Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens likes to talk about education, often critically. Greitens’ press secretary, Parker Briden, said funding has increased for K-12 schools. "It is one of our missions to create better schools," Briden told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Nov. 13. "You hear us talking about it all the time. We’ve seen funding increases for schools. We haven’t seen a corresponding performance increase." With funding cuts coming to a lot of areas from Greitens’ budget, especially higher education, we wanted to see whether Briden’s statement was true. The funding Briden did not respond to our questions, so we decided to start by looking at the general operating budget for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. For fiscal year 2016, $5.8 billion went to the department. This was about an $88 million increase from 2015. The budget in 2017, showed an increase from 2016’s total to about $5.9 billion. This increase happened despite about a $13 million decrease to the the portion of federal funds for the department. For Greitens’ first budget, fiscal year 2018, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education saw an increase to about $6.03 billion. So, on face value, there has been an overall increase in general funding for schools over the past few years. The budget just lists the funding for the department. The actual appropriations bill is what breaks it down, and it’s clear that not all of the $6.03 billion goes directly to the kids. Traci Gleason, director of communication and public engagement at the Missouri Budget Project, points out that the cost of educating students fluctuates . "While an appropriation may technically be higher, without being increased for inflation as well, the value of that increase diminishes. For instance, for schools, the costs of their supplies, teacher salaries, maintenance, etc., go up, so increases need to take that into account," she said. A dollar in 2015, when the 2016 budget was passed, is equal to $1.06 today. That means to keep pace with the $5.8 billion granted to K-12 education in fiscal year 2016, the 2018 budget would need to allot $6.15 billion. So, on an inflation-adjusted basis, the money allocated is less than it was three years ago. Student Performance Briden said there has not been a performance increase to match the funding increase. So we looked at data for student performance on standardized tests. Sarah Potter, the communications coordinator for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, said Briden is wrong. Missouri Assessment Program, or MAP, is the primary measure for K-12 schools in Missouri. MAP scores actually increased in all content areas between 2016 and 2017. English language arts saw a 1 percent increase, math saw a 1.4 percent increase, science saw a 2.1 percent increase, and American government saw a 1.7 percent increase. Potter said the governor’s office is referring to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, in which the state went up in two measures and down in two measures between 2011 and 2015. But this data is older, and new results won’t be out until February. Our ruling Parker Briden, the governor’s press secretary, said, "We’ve seen funding increases for schools. We haven’t seen a corresponding performance increase." While state funding has increased, it’s not keeping up with inflation. Meanwhile, student scores on the MAP test have increased. The results of a national test are mixed, not down, and in any case are outdated. We rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Parker Briden	None	None	None	2017-12-26T16:55:08	2017-11-13	['None']
pomt-12132	"Charlottesville car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/puppetstringnewscom/charlottesville-hit-and-run-driver-was-anti-fascis/	Internet posts claim an anti-Trump liberal was behind the wheel of the Dodge Challenger that drove into a crowd in Charlottesville, Va., killing one and injuring 19 others. But the posts are based on false, distorted and discredited information. The headline on an Aug. 12, 2017, PuppetStringNews.com post read, "Friendly Fire … Charlottesville Car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to fight fake news. The PuppetStringNews.com story said someone named Joel Vangheluwe (pronounced "vangelloway," with a hard g) — and not the suspect arrested, James Alex Fields, Jr., of Maumee, Ohio — drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger into a crowd of protesters demonstrating against white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville for a "Unite the Right" rally on Aug. 12. A 32-year-old woman named Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured before Fields was arrested. Soon after, PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said the Challenger had actually belonged to Vangheluwe, who was "a known antifa/anti Trump supporter." Antifa is shorthand for antifascist. It’s a catch-all term for demonstrators who organize on the local level to protest far-right causes, often resorting to violence. The loosely coordinated movement has roots in antifascist groups in Germany, Italy and Spain before World War II, and has grown increasingly visible in its opposition to Trump and his "alt-right" supporters. PuppetStringNews.com alleged that Vangheluwe, whose Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home, drove the Challenger into the crowd to make it look like a Trump supporter had attacked the protesters. There’s no proof Vangheluwe was involved in any way. Ohio vehicle records showed the 2010 Dodge Challenger is currently registered to Fields, who was at the Charlottesville rally and arrested shortly after the incident. Fields has been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, and was denied bail at a hearing on Aug. 14. The PuppetStringNews.com post included a batch of images of Facebook and Instagram posts from Joel Vangheluwe and registration information from SearchQuarry.com that showed Joel’s father, Jerome, had once owned the car: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It appears these images originated on 4chan.org, an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories. But none of the so-called evidence showed anything proving Vangheluwe was a violent, left-wing extremist. One Facebook image dated July 4, 2015, that was posted on PuppetStringNews.com showed Vangheluwe did have a liberal bent: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "Nationalism is brainwash, we'll always be separated until we come together, shit man the world and its people are beautiful. Not just America, pro world," Vangheluwe’s caption read. Another image apparent in the PuppetStringNews.com post showed a June 15 Instagram photo of Vangheluwe wearing a shirt with Jimi Hendrix on it. Vangheluwe’s selfie was simply announcing two art shows in Detroit: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The most outspoken post on any of his social media profiles looked to be from Jan. 24, when he wrote, "If only Trump was aborted" as a Facebook status: See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe. Sommerman said that Jerome Vangheluwe, Joel’s father, did own the Challenger years ago, and that Joel Vangheluwe did not like Trump, but any implications beyond that are, to use Sommerman’s word, "nuts." "He said some negative things about Trump that aren’t nice," Sommerman said. "He doesn’t support the president in everything he does." Our ruling PuppetStringNews.com said, "Charlottesville Car attacker is anti-Trump Antifa supporter." Most importantly, the car used in the incident is registered to the man currently in custody, not Vangheluwe. The site made the implication based on Vangheluwe’s social media posts, but a closer look revealed that even those posts didn’t reveal very much. We pored over the examples PuppetStringNews.com cited and looked through Vangheluwe’s public profiles. There was evidence Vangheluwe did not support Trump, which his lawyer confirmed, but there was nothing to suggest he was a destructive radical bent on violence. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-06984	Since President Obama took office, "2 million jobs. Gone."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/13/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committees-ad-says-2-million-j/	The Republican National Committee unveiled a commercial July 7 critical of President Barack Obama’s economic policies. The commercial, which will run in battleground states like Ohio the next several weeks, illustrates the unemployment rate, tax issues, the national debt and the new health-care law with images of disaster: a fiery car crash, a train wreck, and an out-of-control roller coaster, among other things. "Don’t let Obama drive us to disaster. Change direction," the announcer says as speeding car plunges into water. The commercial also includes a half-dozen figures the RNC believes underscore its message that the $800 billion for the stimulus, trillions for government health care, 2 million jobs gone, 6 million foreclosures, 14 trillion in debt, $500 billion in higher taxes are killing the economy. PolitiFact has examined many of these figures before. Jobs numbers, however, are among the most common statistics used in claims and have proven to be a potent issue in campaigns, including Ohio’s 2010 gubernatorial race. So, let’s look at how the RNC is using the 2 million job figure. Specifically, the RNC commercial says, "2 million jobs. Gone." To get started on any job figure, PolitiFact turns to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official score keeper of U.S. employment numbers. When Obama took office in January 2009, 133.5 million Americans were working in non-farm jobs, according to the BLS. On the day the RNC ad was released, the latest job figures available were from May 2011 and totaled 131 million. That produces a net loss of 2.5 million. (June preliminary numbers have since been released and show the economy added 18,000 jobs that month.) Case closed? Not yet. Before we make final arguments, important caveats about job statistics are worth repeating. As PolitiFact has frequently noted, slicing and timing make all the difference when framing job figures. If, for instance, PolitiFact, plugs into the RNC equation job figures from February 2009 – Obama’s first full month in office, when the U.S. had 132.8 million jobs – the total job losses through May 2011 equal 1.8 million. That’s a bit below the RNC’s claim in the commercial. Democrats could easily produce a more favorable job picture by comparing the June 2011 figures to June 2010 figures. This comparison shows the country has added just over 1 million jobs in the last 12 months. Vice President Joe Biden made a similar claim that PolitiFact Ohio checked in April and rated Mostly True. . As always, context is the most important and is buried in the monthly figures. Job losses were worse in the early part of the Obama administration. Since then the country has been slowly climbing out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, one that began before Obama took office. So where does this leave the RNC’s claim? The RNC figure -- 2 million jobs gone -- actually underplays the number of jobs lost since Obama took office. But it also ignores the trend line which has bobbed up and down but is headed upward, albeit slowly. That there are 1 million more jobs now than a year ago is an additional piece of information that provides clarification. Whether the administration is doing enough toward recovery is a policy debate we leave to others. But on the Truth-O-Meter, a statement like this one that is accurate but needs some clarification rates Mostly True.

pomt-00418	Says he’s a "small-town supervisor who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/aug/29/nathan-mcmurray/mcmurray-claims-about-grand-island-record-are-true/	As Democrat Nathan McMurray looks for votes in a Republican-leaning congressional district, he points to his record as Grand Island town supervisor the last two and a half years. On Aug. 8, the day Republican incumbent Chris Collins was arrested on insider trading charges, McMurray held a news conference and prepared his supporters for the attacks he said will come in the race for New York’s 27th Congressional District. "The cheaters are still going to fight," McMurray said. "They’re still going to try to cheat. They’re going to try to label me, someone who’s been a small-town supervisor, who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had, who is an Eagle Scout, who is a father and a husband and a dad, that I’m some type of radical because I have a D next to my name. When is this game of party affiliation going to end?" We decided to evaluate the claims he made about his tenure as Grand Island supervisor. He began a four-year term in January 2016. Balanced budget Local governments must adopt balanced budgets, according to the New York State Comptroller’s Office. Excluding capital projects which are funded by debt not included in balanced budget calculations, the town took in $19.9 million in 2016 and spent $18.6 million, according to the town’s financial statements. In 2017, the town posted revenues of $20 million and spent $19.1 million. Deducting spending on capital projects from the town's financial statements is the most accurate way to evaluate McMurray's balanced budget claim, said Pam Barton, Grand Island’s accountant. Surpluses Is that the same as a surplus? The generally accepted definition of "surplus" in town government is the amount of money in "unassigned fund balance" in the town’s general fund, Barton said. For Grand Island, the unassigned fund balance was $5.9 million in 2015, the year before McMurray took office, $6.8 million in 2016 and $6.7 million in 2017. It dropped a bit last year but was still higher than the surplus from the year before he took office. Credit ratings Grand Island received its highest credit rating since at least 2001 in September 2016, Barton said. When Barton became town accountant in 2001, the town’s bond rating was A2, she said, four notches below its current rating of Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service. The town’s current rating is the second-highest on Moody’s scale. Barton said because of the town’s size and budget, it likely will never reach the highest rating. Barton said the town has always been rated by Moody’s, and has not received ratings from Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings. Our ruling McMurray made three claims about his record of managing Grand Island’s finances. It’s fair to point out that Grand Island’s strong financial position is the result of years of sound management, not only changes made since McMurray took office in 2016, Barton said. "He’s been continuing the things that have been in place from before," the town accountant said. Still, his claim about keeping a balanced budget is true. McMurray’s claim about increasing surpluses is mostly true. The town had more surplus funds at the end of 2017 than it did when he took office, though it decreased slightly in his second year in office. His claim that the town has the highest credit rating it has ever had is true, based on all available information. We rate his statement True.

Now, Harris is accusing his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, of wanting to take legal steps to remove Trump from the Oval Office. "In our debate, Dan McCready doubled down on his support for Pelosi’s liberal agenda of gun control, disrespecting our flag, and impeaching our President," Harris tweeted after a televised debate on Oct. 10. The tweet was shared more than 160 times. Is that really what McCready said? Let’s look at the tape. The full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer website. Part of the debate is also available on c-span.org, which also has a partial transcript to make the candidates’ comments more easily trackable. (C-Span missed the first few minutes of the debate because it was broadcasting other news) For this fact check, PolitiFact is choosing to focus on the most specific claim, that McCready wants to impeach Trump. If you watch the debate, though, you’ll see that McCready said he favors "common sense" gun background checks, without elaborating on what that policy might look like. And McCready said he stands for the flag but added that he understands that someone who’s faced discrimination may kneel "because he or she doesn’t feel heard." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Pelosi and McCready McCready has repeatedly said he won’t vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker if Democrats gain control of the House. Harris, for his part, pushed back against McCready’s claim that he won’t support Pelosi as speaker, arguing that McCready’s individual vote for House speaker wouldn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. "There’s a certain naivete, if you will, to think that you’ll go to Washington as a Democrat and not support Nancy Pelosi who frankly is spending that $350,000 ... to run negative ads against me," Harris said. "There’s a reason for that. If Mr. McCready is elected, he just represents a number that would move the Democrats toward a majority." If that happens, "Nancy Pelosi has already done the math. She will become the speaker." The back-and-forth occurs between the 27- and 30-minute marks of the C-Span video. Speaker or not, Pelosi herself hasn’t committed to impeaching Trump. Republicans this election season have raised the possibility that Democrats might impeach the president. But, as our friends at FactCheck.org noted in March, Pelosi hasn’t called for Trump’s impeachment and has voted to table two attempts at impeachment, effectively stopping them. With the election nearing, Pelosi has maintained her position that impeachment isn’t a priority, but she hasn’t ruled it out. McCready in the debate So what about McCready? Did he say in the debate that he’d vote to impeach Trump? Just before the 26-minute mark of the C-Span video, a moderator notes that Democrats could gain control of the House in this year’s elections. If that happens, some Democrats might try to impeach Trump. "If you get elected, would you support that or would you not?" the moderator asks. McCready didn’t offer a yes or a no. "These kinds of decisions are very serious decisions and they’re decisions that need to be handled based on the facts and the evidence. As a small business owner, I don’t deal in hypotheticals, I deal in the facts," McCready said. "That is a decision — or, any decision related to the Constitution — that I would treat very seriously based on the facts at the time." Harris didn’t press McCready on impeaching Trump and the conversation moved on. Consistently noncommittal The Harris tweet says McCready in the debate "doubled down" on his support for impeaching Trump. But PolitiFact could find no evidence of McCready declaring that desire previously. In fact, several news articles noted that McCready is noncommittal about the prospect of impeachment, specifically. And he’s been criticized for being "too vague." In August, the Charlotte Observer quoted him saying the same phrase, "I don’t deal in hypotheticals," that he used in the debate. Also in August, the New York Times wrote that McCready "has shown little appetite to talk about impeachment." The Times story noted, however, that California billionaire Tom Steyer, "who has led a national pro-impeachment effort all year, has pledged $500,000 to aid" McCready. Our ruling Harris tweeted that in his Oct. 10 debate with McCready, McCready "doubled down on his support for Pelosi’s liberal agenda of ... impeaching our President." McCready has consistently distanced himself from Pelosi. Regardless, neither Pelosi nor McCready has committed to impeaching Trump. By not opposing impeachment, they’ve left the door open to the idea. But that’s not the same as publicly stating it’s part of the Democratic or McCready agenda. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07058	"For every dollar we invest in Head Start, we get $5 to $7 back into our economy."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/29/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-head-start-programs-are-cost-ben/	As part of Congress’ budget debates, Rep. Tim Ryan cautioned against major cuts while the economy is weak, and said he especially opposed cutting funds for Head Start. Head Start is a national program that tries to bolster school readiness through educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families. While interviewing Ryan on Fox News, Greta Van Sustern criticized Head Start because of the academic performance of 8th graders in the Washington, D.C., school system. Ryan defended the program, claiming that "for every dollar we invest in Head Start, we get $5 to $7 back into our economy." That kind of return got our attention, so we decided to follow the statistical threads to see if Ryan’s claim is backed by whole cloth or solid evidence. We started with Ryan’s staff. They cited a paper from 2007 by scholars Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Deborah A. Phillips of Georgetown University, which also alludes to other studies. The researchers conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the program and concluded that that Head Start’s return to taxpayers is greater than their investment in the program. They based their conclusion on studies that compared the performance over decades of siblings who enrolled in Head Start, and siblings that did not, for example. Among their findings: Children exposed to the Head Start program were more likely to finish high school. The are likely to have better jobs with greater earning power. They are less likely to commit crimes as adults. While Head Start doesn’t create jobs itself, children exposed to Head Start are more able to compete for better jobs than those without that exposure, they concluded. The Ludwig-Phillips paper also cited a study of Perry Preschool, an early care and education program in Michigan similar to Head Start, charting the progress of 3- and 4-year-olds through two years, and also examined their success rate through age 40. The researchers did issue a few caveats. Studying program participants over several decades allowed them to follow outcomes into adolescence and adulthood to assess longterm impacts, but they acknowledge that some of the data available to study children from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was limited. Also, Head Start has changed over time, making it a challenge to apply the data to children in the program now. Forecasting outcomes from kids in Head Start now involves use of "a number of untestable assumptions," they said. Nonetheless, they concluded that with the average cost of Head Start at $9,000 per child, the early education and social intervention programs "are likely sufficient to generate benefits in excess of costs in both the short- and long-term." A letter sent to Congress in March 2011, signed by more than 300 researchers from around the country, also supported the notion that Head Start is cost effective. It cited a $7 to $9 return for every dollar invested in the programs based on the findings of 12 different studies and reports. They estimated that the program’s required medical screenings, vaccinations and emphasis reduced annual Medicaid expenses by $232 per family. And commentary about the scholarly tract by Ludwig and Phillips in a 2007 edition of Social Policy Report suggests that Head Start might have low-balled its own effectiveness. Commentary by W. Steven Barnett of Rutgers University on the Ludwig-Phillips paper cites studies of three different programs similar to Head Start, one of which found a 2.5 to 1 return ($2.50 for each $1), one that estimated a 10.1 to 1 return, and one that noted a 16.1 to 1 return. Each study examined a different public early care and education program and based its findings on myriad categories including earnings by people who went through the programs in early childhood. So how does Ryan’s statement fare on the Truth-O-Meter? The statement is accurate. Numerous studies support the notion that Head Start is cost beneficial. Ryan’s numbers land right in the middle of the cost-benefit estimates. While some are as high as $16.10 for each dollar spent, there are some as low as $2.50. That the researchers caution that forecasting outcomes from kids in Head Start now is difficult is an additional piece of information. While there’s decades of data, programs have also changed over time. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Ryan’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Tim Ryan	None	None	None	2011-06-29T06:00:00	2011-04-14	['None']
pomt-05310	Says in U.S. Congress, members "don’t even have to be on the floor for debates or votes."	half-true	/tennessee/statements/2012/may/18/beth-harwell/tennessee-house-speaker-says-congressmen-dont-have/	Since the Tennessee General Assembly installed electronic voting systems in the House and Senate chambers more than 20 years ago, lawmakers have often cast votes for an absent colleague – a practice that has been nicknamed "ghost voting." The old custom got some fresh attention in the last days of the 2012 session when a Nashville television station, WTVF, filmed state representatives using long sticks to sit at their desks and punch voting buttons on the desks of other members who were missing. Subsequently, House Speaker Beth Harwell offered commentary on the matter in an interview with the station, saying she doesn't really condone the practice but it is permitted under legislative rules. That's true. But then the speaker went on to say that,"We're not like Congress. In Congress, they don't even have to be on the floor for debates or votes. I require my members to be on the floor." Was the speaker speaking the truth in contrasting Congress with the General Assembly in ghost voting? We consulted the U.S. House of Representatives rules, and rule III, section 2, states: (a) A Member may not authorize any other person to cast the vote of such Member or record the presence of such Member in the House or the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. (b) No other person may cast a Member’s vote or record a Member’s presence in the House or the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. So U.S.House rules explicitly prohibit "ghost voting." Recorded and roll call votes are normally taken by electronic device, and each member is provided with a personalized Vote-ID Card which can be used to vote electronically. A number of vote stations are positioned around the House chamber. Each vote station has a slot into which the voting card is inserted and buttons marked "yea," "nay," "present." The stations have an "open" indicator, which is lit when a vote is in progress and the system is ready to accept votes. The state House procedure is far more informal. There is no voting card. Each member's desk is equipped with three buttons – green for voting "yes," red for voting "no" and blue for abstaining or answering a roll call. The "roll call" votes come at the start and end of each House session. And being present for a roll call has consequences – those voting present automatically get their $174 daily expense payment, called "per diem." Members are allowed to vote a colleague present if he or she is absent from the chamber at the moment. Indeed, one legislator – state Rep. Lois DeBerry, D-Memphis – refunded her "per diem" payment after the WTVF video aired, acknowledging she wasn't present on a day when a colleague voted for her. State House rules permit one member to vote for another, so that legislators can take a short break to visit the restroom, get a sandwich, meet with a visiting constituent or perhaps a lobbyist outside the chamber. But the speaker can order that all members be at their desks to vote. This is done by the speaker declaring the chamber "under the rule." Harwell estimates that the House is "under the rule," meaning a member must be seated at his or her desk to vote, about half the time. The rest of the time, it's OK to push another member's voting button -- and often that's done on non-controversial or procedural matters. On the other hand, Congress is far more informal than the Tennessee General Assembly when it comes to being present for debates. We’ve sat through enough congressional proceedings to know firsthand that House members are not always present during debates. Often, the only lawmakers in the House chamber during a floor debate are those representatives who are speaking on the issue or waiting to speak. There are a number of reasons why there are a lot of empty seats in the House chamber during debates. For one, legislative committees often meet while the House is in session and a floor debate is taking place. Lawmakers can’t be two places at once, so unless they have a particular interest in the topic being debated on the House floor, they go to their committee meetings instead. House floor proceedings also are beamed live into the offices of each member via closed-circuit television. Lawmakers often monitor floor debates from their offices and head to the House floor when debate begins on a topic on which they have an interest or want to speak. At the state House, members are generally required to be in the chamber during floor sessions – with the exception of the permitted and presumably brief absences where "ghost voting" occurs. That's the case even when legislators embark on lengthy "personal orders," wherein guest speakers make sometimes long-winded speeches and are honored by the reading of a resolution. In contrast to Washington practice, legislative committees in Nashville do not meet when floor sessions are underway. Debates, both on the floor and in committees, are face-to-face, back-and-forth encounters with multiple members joining in on a hot topic. And only rarely does the speaker move to limit the debate. So Harwell is correct when she says that members of Congress don't have to be present for debates. But she was mistaken insofar as voting goes. Kara Watkins, spokeswoman for Harwell, acknowledges the speaker "misspoke" by including "votes" in the quoted remark and says her intention was to emphasize that Tennessee lawmakers are present on the floor a lot more than their counterparts in Washington. With that in mind, we rate the speaker's statement Half True.	None	Beth Harwell	None	None	None	2012-05-18T09:13:14	2012-05-07	['None']
pomt-03224	"We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/20/barack-obama/obama-says-exports-us-goods-all-time-high/	American manufacturing is more than just a shaded slice in a pie chart showing what makes the country’s economy tick. In the popular mind, it’s a measure of how well the nation competes in the world and whether "we still make things." So during a speech in Arizona, when President Barack Obama was listing the ways the economy has recovered, he made a point to include American exports. "We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before," Obama said. It’s worth noting that the president specifically referred to "products made in America" in contrast to a broader view on trade that blends both goods and services. The data check on Obama’s claim is straightforward. When tallying sales of everything from bushels of wheat to jet engines, the standard unit of measurement is dollars. The Bureau of Economic Analysis in the U.S. Commerce Department helps pull together the country’s trade statistics. The bureau’s June report showed the U.S. exported more than $134 billion worth of goods that month. That indeed is the largest dollar amount ever, even accounting for inflation. There are two important pieces of context for these numbers -- the impact of the recession and the overall trade deficit. We’ll look at the role of the recession first. Trade numbers can bounce around from month to month so we compared the total amount of goods sold in the first half of 2013 to the first half of the years right before and after the recession. Half year (Jan-June) Dollars (in millions, seasonally adjusted) Change from same period, year before 2007 $561,979 2008 $665,892 18.5% 2009 $507,812 -23.7% 2010 $619,101 21.9% 2011 $731,409 18.1% 2012 $779,426 6.6% 2013 $786,631 0.9% Source: BEA The recession took a big bite out of trade as the global economy locked up. The sale of goods fell by nearly a quarter from 2008 to 2009, again, just looking at the first half of each year. The rebound however was pretty quick. By 2011, sales were higher than just before the recession hit and they’ve continued to rise. But the rate of increase has slowed considerably. Andrew Bernard, a trade economist at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, runs the numbers a little differently but sees the same trend. The total dollars go up, but not as fast. "Touting the current numbers as the best ever is a bit disingenuous as, by my calculations, the last 12 months are up 1.4 percent over the previous 12," Bernard said. "Not exactly booming." Still, Bernard notes that when the country’s biggest trading partners face economic headwinds, one should expect American exports to suffer. "Europe has been pretty stagnant, and Chinese growth has been slowing, so any increase might actually be good news," he said. Bernard said both Europe and Asia are showing signs of improvement which he expects to help U.S. exports down the line. The balance of trade Generally speaking, strong economies sell more to others than they buy in return. This is an area where countries like China and Germany historically have done quite well and where the U.S. has struggled. When President Obama cheered the record level of sales for American products, that didn’t address the country’s trade deficit. However, while the U.S. is still in the red on trade, the news here also is slightly better than in the past. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the deficit for goods dropped nearly $10 billion between May and June. The average monthly deficit over the past 12 months has been about $59.5 billion. In June, it was about $53 billion. The sale of capital goods, things like construction equipment and machinery, did the most to boost the numbers. There was a $2.3 billion rise over the past 12 months. While the focus of this check is on goods, the sale of services regularly generates surpluses of about $18 billion to $19 billion a month that help offset the nation’s overall trade deficit. But even with that, the trade deficit for the past 12 months stands at $540 billion. Our ruling President Obama said the United States is selling more products made here to other countries than ever before. We should note that the overall outlook for U.S. exports has several trouble spots: While sales are expected to grow, they will grow more slowly in the months to come. Also, the nation’s trade deficit remains high. The president’s statement, though, focused only on the overall value of all exports. His statement was accurate, and we rate it True. Editor's note: This report has been updated to clarify the location of the Bureau of Economic Analysis with the Commerce Department.

"I won the South Carolina primary in 2004, and I was way behind in the polls at this stage in 2004," Edwards said. That certainly was the case nationally. In national polls conducted during November and December 2003, Edwards lagged significantly behind Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, Richard Gephardt and Joe Lieberman. But the poll numbers were a little different in South Carolina. A few polls showed Edwards trailing, but at least two state polls showed Edwards the leading named candidate after "Don't Know" or "Undecided." On the other hand, today Edwards seems to be trailing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in South Carolina in every published poll we were able to find. Edwards didn't say whether he meant national or local polls in his interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. Given the two polls that showed Edwards leading South Carolina, we can't give him full marks and instead award him Mostly True.

pomt-12301	The Senate bill "hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/26/barack-obama/obama-blasts-gop-senate-bill-tax-cut-rich-health-c/	Former President Barack Obama has maintained a low profile since leaving the White House, but recently he took to Facebook to blast a Senate health care bill that threatens to dismantle much of the Affordable Care Act, his signature legislative achievement. The Senate bill "hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else," Obama wrote in a Facebook post. We decided to look into the former president’s claim about the budgetary effects of the Senate Republican plan that repeals or reworks much of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Tax cuts on wealthy Americans and industry Obama is right that the Senate bill contains a tax cut for wealthy Americans and medical-related businesses. The Congressional Budget Office has yet to put a number on the Senate bill’s tax cut. But the amount will likely be in the same ballpark as its scoring of the House bill, which cut taxes by about $1 trillion over 10 years, with high-income households and the health care industry gaining most of those benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center. The Senate bill repeals Affordable Care Act taxes that levy a 3.8 percent fee on investment income, as well as a tax on individuals making $200,000 or more ($250,000 for couples). The bill also eliminates ACA taxes that target health insurers, and makers of prescription drugs and medical devices. We should also note that middle- and lower-income consumers would likely see benefits from tax cuts in the form of lower prices and reduced fees on health savings accounts, as we pointed out in an earlier check of a House version of the bill. Tax cuts paid for by cutting health care Obama is correct that tax cuts would be offset by cutting spending on health care. But it’s a stretch to say everybody’s health care would suffer, when what’s on the chopping block is federal funding for lower-income Americans. In the individual market, the Senate bill changes the formula for calculating how much help the federal government gives lower-income Americans to buy insurance. Compared with the Obamacare formula, the Senate GOP version would amount to a 15 percent across-the-board cut in premium subsidies, and result in low-income people paying higher premiums for bigger deductibles, according to Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care think tank. Starting in 2020, the Senate bill also repeals Obamacare’s cost-sharing subsidies that help lower-income Americans defray the cost of deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. But the biggest cut in federal spending comes out of Medicaid, by changing the share carried by the federal government, relative to states. The Senate bill converts federal Medicaid funding to a per capita cap starting in 2020, placing a ceiling on the amount of funding a state gets per enrollee. Alternatively, states could opt for a block grant, a fixed amount of federal funds. Under either approach, the federal government would provide less to states than under Obamacare. Separately, starting in 2021, the Senate bill begins a three-year phase out of enhanced funding given to the 31 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. As we noted in a previous check of the House bill, reducing this funding would likely cause states to end expansion. This graphic from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a side-by-side illustration of Obama’s claim that Republicans are rewarding wealthy Americans through a health care cut. The yellow bar shows $33 billion going to the top 400 highest-income households as a result of repealing the Obamacare tax cuts. The red bar shows how removing $33 billion in revenue translates to cutting off funding for Medicaid expansion population of four states―Alaska, Arkansas, West Virginia and Nevada. (Note: This graphic is based on the CBO’s earlier score of the House version, which will likely differ from its score of the Senate). Our ruling Obama said that the Senate bill "hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else." The Senate bill does give a tax cut to wealthy Americans and medical-related industry. Assuming a budget analysis of the Senate bill is similar to that of the House version, the tax cut will be to the tune of $1 trillion. It’s a bit hyperbolic to say everybody’s health care would be cut to finance the tax cut; it’s mostly lower-income people who lose out as a direct result of the bill. He’s right that the Senate bill would deliver a tax cut as it reduces the amount of federal funding lower-income Americans would get to help buy insurance. The bill would also repeal funding to defray deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for those eligible. It also lessens the share of Medicaid funding carried by the federal government, relative to states. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-09905	On the day the House voted on the climate change bill, "there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House, which is standard. It wasn't even written."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/09/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-claims-climate-bill-wasnt-written-when-it/	In Washington, it's not unusual for lawmakers to get as heated about the arcane rules of Congress as they do about the substance of a bill. Such was the case with a plan to slow climate change passed by the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009. Republican lawmakers not only opposed cap-and-trade because they fear it will be too expensive, but they were angry that they'd had only a few hours to vet 300 pages of last-minute changes to the already massive legislation. With such a quick turnaround, "pages of text were being passed around the speaker's desk by clerks," wrote Florida Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite on her party's blog. "Who knows what we voted on? Members of Congress sure didn't." Then came this lament from Rush Limbaugh: On the day the House voted on the climate change bill, "there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House, which is standard. It wasn't even written," he said during his June 29 radio show. Limbaugh is right on at least one point: It is standard for the reading clerk — you've probably seen them on C-SPAN reciting the text of a bill — to have a copy of the legislation at their desk. So, we found it hard to believe that there was not one complete copy of the cap-and-trade plan in the chamber the day the House passed the bill. But before we can solve the Case of the Missing Bill, we'll need a brief lesson in congressional procedure. Before the House debates a bill, it goes to the chamber's Rules Committee, a group controlled by the majority party that has the important role of deciding which amendments can come up for a vote and how long debate will last. Frequently, the Rules Committee will also adopt last-minute changes to the bill, which can range from minor technical tweaks to big compromises. All those decisions are compiled in one long document — which is called, simply, a rule — and brought to the House floor where it becomes the chamber's first order of business before lawmakers can get to the meat of the legislation. If the rule is adopted, lawmakers have officially agreed to make all those changes to the original version of the bill. The House then takes up the bill itself. The cap-and-trade bill followed this process. After the bill was passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee on May 21, its two lead authors, Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, set out to find enough votes in the full House. In the process, it appears the duo had to cut some deals; for example, one change made farms exempt from the emissions cap. And, not coincidentally, some farm-state lawmakers ultimately backed the bill. In the early morning of June 26, more than 300 pages of changes were adopted by the Rules Committee. And later in the day, the House voted 217-205 to accept those changes. After that, the chamber got down to debating the newly updated bill, and that's when the controversy over the missing copies began. "Is there somewhere physically in the House of Representatives a copy of what we are voting on?" asked Joe Barton, who is the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee. "My inquiry is how do I get a copy of the other 300 pages that people here on the floor haven’t had a chance to read or see? Where do we get that before we slam this and cram this down on the American people?" echoed Louie Gohmert of Texas. Markey came to the floor to reassure Barton and Gohmert that they could find the latest changes on the Rules Committee Web site. And besides, they had just voted on the new language and it could be found at the reader's desk, Markey said. But Gohmert wasn't satisfied. Here's an excerpt from the Congressional Record of his conversation with the the speaker pro tempore, the House member who then had the rotating duty of running the House: GOHMERT. My parliamentary inquiry, I was just at the dais and the clerks, as always, were immensely helpful. But apparently the official copy of the 1,090 pages are there, and then the additional 300 pages are sitting beside it, and the clerk is having to go through and is in the process as we speak of going through and figuring out where the extra 300 pages that has been added goes in the official copy. So even as I speak, Madam Speaker, the official copy is not truly an official copy because it doesn’t have all of the amendments in it. And since the rule says there is an official copy at the desk, my inquiry is whether it is truly an official copy if it, as yet, does not have all of the pages in the official copy. SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: The clerk is currently executing the order of the House in House Resolution 587. GOHMERT. Right, to put the extra pages into the official copy. But is it required that it actually be a full official copy put together before you satisfy the requirement of having an official copy at the desk? SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: The two components of the official copy are there together, so it is, in effect, the official copy. GOHMERT: So the two together in two different piles that are being worked out together is the official copy. In theory, House leadership could have called a recess to meld the 1,090 pages of the original bill with the more than 300 pages of changes as Gohmert and Barton wanted. But the leadership did not. So to determine if Limbaugh is correct, we have to decide if two stacks of paper at the reading desk instead of one mean the bill was not on the House floor. We went to House Parliamentarian John Sullivan, the guru of all things having to do with chamber procedure. He's been advising members on their rules since 2004. "It's not true," he said of Limbaugh's claim. "Obviously 'the' copy of the bill was at the reading clerk's desk the entire time. ... All the ingredients that made the final bill were at the desk," he said. In fact, it's not at all unusual for pages of legislation to be in flux during debate, Sullivan said. For example, as amendments are adopted on the House floor, someone literally sits at the front of the chamber, adding or subtracting language in a bill. And it's a time-tested tactic for the minority to complain that the majority has rushed a bill through and not given members enough time to read it. Limbaugh claimed that "there was not even a copy of the bill in the well of the House. . . . It wasn't even written." And indeed, it's clear from the Congressional Record that many lawmakers were frustrated that the copy at the desk consisted of two parts: the original bill and a second part that included changes that were compiled by the Rules Committee and adopted by the entire chamber. So in that sense, there is some truth to Limbaugh's claim that the bill "wasn't even written." But the Congressional Record and our interview with the parliamentarian show that Limbaugh is wrong to say that there was no copy of the bill in the chamber during the vote. As Sullivan said, every component of the final version was in the chamber from the start, available for members to read. The final House bill, the one that was sent to the Senate on July 6, included all those changes; two documents effectively became one. So we give Limbaugh a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02406	"When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage ... half of Republicans agree with it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-half-republicans-agree-minimum-w/	One of President Barack Obama’s signature issues at the moment is a push to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour. It’s such a popular policy, he said in a speech on March 5, 2014, that even Republicans have little quarrel with it. "When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage," Obama said, "not only is it good policy, but the majority of the country, including half of Republicans, agree with it." We wondered whether polling data backed up this claim. So we looked at independent polls taken recently that asked about the minimum wage. A review of the polling data suggests a more nuanced situation than Obama’s claim suggests. Our first look at the data showed that a minimum-wage hike is popular among Americans broadly. For instance, when the CBS News-New York Times poll asked, "Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10?" in February 2014, the poll found 65 percent support. And that was actually down a bit from the 72 percent support registered in the January edition of the poll. Similarly, a Pew Research Center/USA Today poll from January asked whether respondents supported an "increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour" and found 73 percent support. But what about Republicans specifically? More than half of Republicans favor a minimum-wage increase, polls found, but in most of these polls, less than half of Republicans supported raising the wage to $10.10, the amount Obama is seeking. One poll that did not specify a target amount for the minimum-wage hike was conducted by Quinnipiac University. It asked, "Would you support or oppose raising the national minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour?" Among Republicans, 52 percent expressed support, while 45 percent said they opposed it. That provides some support to Obama’s claim. But once respondents were asked by other pollsters about the $10.10 figure -- a roughly 40 percent increase from today’s federal minimum wage -- Republican support sagged. The clearest example is a CBS-New York Times poll from February that asked, "As you may know, the federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour. Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10?" Republicans expressed 42 percent support, 54 percent opposition. Another clear example was an ABC News-Washington Post poll from December, 2013 that asked, "The minimum wage in this country is now $7.25 an hour. What do you think it should be?" Among Republicans, only 21 percent favored keeping it the same or lowering it, but even fewer respondents -- 7 percent -- favored a minimum wage in excess of $10. Two other polls showed Republican support close to 50 percent, but falling just short. However, the differences were within the margin of sampling error -- it's possible that more than half of Republicans were in support of a $10.10 wage, though also possible that the actual support level was even lower than the official result. A CBS-New York Times poll from January that asked the same question as the February poll found that Republicans expressed 48 percent support, 51 percent opposition to a $10.10 wage. And an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll from December 2013 asked, "I'm going to mention a number of different amounts and for each one, please tell me if you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose raising the hourly minimum wage to that amount." When presented with the $10.10 rate, 47 percent of Republicans expressed support. One poll clearly supported Obama’s position. The January Pew Research Center/USA Today poll found 53 percent of Republicans backing a $10.10 minimum wage, with 43 percent opposed. The significance of the $10.10 figure is not academic. According to a March 6 account in the Washington Post, "early last year, White House strategists rejected (the $10.10 figure), worried that it could destroy jobs and anger the business community just as the regulation-heavy Affordable Care Act was about to take effect. Instead, former officials say, the White House settled on a more cautious path, unveiling a $9-an-hour minimum wage proposal — a target even lower than Obama had proposed during the 2008 campaign." However, the Post reported, the lower amount "disappointed advocates for the working poor, as well as congressional Democrats, who were already pushing to set the $7.25 wage closer to $10 an hour. Over the past year, Obama reconsidered, casting off initial concerns in favor of unifying his party ahead of this fall’s midterm elections." In other words, White House officials had long realized there was a difference in the degree of public support for a $10.10 minimum wage and a smaller hike, so it would be misleading for Obama to now imply that majority Republican support for an unspecified minimum-wage hike means that Republicans automatically support the president’s proposal to raise the wage to $10.10. Our ruling Obama said, "When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage ... half of Republicans agree with it." Republicans do support a minimum-wage hike if you don't specify a dollar figure. But once you mention the $10.10 target Obama wants, his case gets shakier. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02160	"Higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/may/01/kelli-stargel/sen-kelli-stargel-claims-higher-beer-production-an/	Though state Sen. Kelli Stargel has watered down her bill regulating craft breweries to allow 64-ounce growlers, she’s made it very clear she still thinks the content is strong. Stargel, R-Lakeland, on April 28 wrote an editorial in the Tallahassee Democrat defending her position on SB 1714, which would allow sales of 64-ounce growlers but require microbreweries to sell through distributors if its sales are high enough. She introduced an amendment to allow breweries to sell up to 20 percent of their product in house. Her editorial pointed out the apparent dangers of allowing brewers to sell their product. "In states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher," she wrote. "Higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand. As a social conservative, this is why I believe we need to keep regulations on alcoholic beverages in place and not have unregulated beer widely available in the marketplace. Social issues greatly impact economic issues, and we must seek a balance on both." We looked at the regulation claim in a separate item, but we also were curious whether higher beer production led to higher consumption. Time for PolitiFact Florida to buy another round. Small batches, big problems? Microbreweries and craft brewing have been growing in popularity in Florida, but still account for about 8 percent of total beer production in the entire country. Read more about the trend here. The biggest criticism of SB 1714 is that it punishes craft breweries by making them adhere to the same rules of distribution large breweries have, specifically limiting how much they can sell directly to consumers. (We discuss the three-tier system of suppliers/wholesalers/retailers in the other check.) The bill passed the Senate, 30-10, on April 28 and was sent to the House, where it was expected to be voted down. Microbrewers argue that the bill will force them to pay costs they can’t afford because they don’t sell enough product. Meanwhile, they counter, large brewing operations sell enough volume to deal with the expense. But the question here is whether making more beer makes people drink more. We first turned to the Brewers Association, a trade group comprised mostly of small brewers and associated workers, including wholesalers, to see whether Stargel’s claim held water. Their economist Bart Watson pointed out 2012 data from the Beer Institute that showed the opposite. The Beer Institute is a D.C.-based lobbying group representing brewers, wholesalers and retailers. California, the highest-producing state by beer shipments, ranked a lowly 44th in per capita consumption (as measured in gallons per resident older than 21). In an ironic flipping of the numbers, North Dakota ranked 44th in total shipments, but was the highest per capita beer consumer. Florida ranked third in total shipments, but ranked only 34th in per capita consumption. Watson said the evidence supporting a link between production and consumption is weak at best, since the correlations the Beer Institute data makes for both craft beer and large-scale brewers are statistically small. But for Stargel to use it as the basis of her argument is suspect, because overall alcohol consumption should be the focus of her line of thinking, not just beer. "As the alcoholic beverage of moderation, increased beer consumption at the expense of higher ABV (alcohol by volume) choices, such as spirits, might be a beneficial if the goal were limiting excessive consumption, as the article suggests," Watson said. PolitiFact Florida asked Stargel’s office to back up her information. Spokesperson Rachel Barnes told us, "Keeping in mind the focus of the bill, Sen. Stargel was using the rule of supply and demand regarding deregulated beer. We know that higher beer production means lower beer prices. Lower beer prices mean higher beer consumption." The Beer Industry of Florida, a distributor lobbying group, cited a 1988 piece in the Journal of Public Health Policy called "Public Action and Awareness to Reduce Alcohol-Related Problems: A Plan of Action" by James Mosher and David Jernigan. The paper proposed alcoholism treatment plans based on a "new theoretical approach … supported by recent research, which has demonstrated a connection between alcohol availability (e.g. price, minimum drinking age, etc.), per capita consumption, and in turn, alcohol-related problems." That definition of availability doesn’t seem like the same thing as production, though. We searched and searched for more thorough evidence and came up empty. Our ruling Stargel said "higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand." An economist with a trade group pointed to stats that said it may actually be the opposite. In terms of craft brewing, there may be a very weak link that is statistically insignificant. In terms of total production, the numbers suggest that the more beer a state produces, the less it drinks in terms of gallons per person over drinking age. We rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-01297	"If Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/30/naral-pro-choice/ad-colorado-senate-race-suggests-cory-gardner-woul/	Even amid a torrent of campaign ads during the waning days of the 2014 midterm election cycle, a new television ad in Colorado’s tight Senate race certainly stands out. It addresses a topic -- abortion and birth control -- that have recurred often in the campaign between incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and Republican Rep. Cory Gardner. But the imagery, and the claim, make the ad unusual. The ad shows footage of a young, partially dressed couple in a bed, with the man reaching for a condom on the night table. "Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!" the narration says. "If Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms." In bold type, the ad offers a visual saying, "Gardner: Ban birth control." The ad’s sponsors -- the abortion-rights groups NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado -- frame the ad as an "edgy" attempt to reach young voters. (The ad also makes claims about climate change, but we won’t address those in this fact-check.) How accurate is the claim about condoms? We have previously addressed claims on Gardner and birth control, but this one is slightly different, so we’ll take a closer look. First, here’s what the Gardner campaign said when we asked about the ad. "Cory does not want to ban condoms," said campaign spokesman Alex Siciliano. "In fact, he believes in increased access to contraceptives. He has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter." So where does the ad get its evidence from? Past claims about Gardner and birth control have stemmed from his support of efforts to support "personhood" measures that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Gardner co-sponsored H.R. 1091, known formally as the Life At Conception Act and informally as a "personhood" bill. The bill was introduced April 8, 2013, by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the bill text, it would "implement equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person" and "declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being." It goes on to say that " 'human person' and 'human being' include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being." Opponents of personhood legislation say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of person could make illegal several FDA-approved contraceptives, such as the pill and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned to get personhood measures on the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. Both times it was rejected by more than 70 percent of voters. As we have noted in the past, we can’t predict how the courts would interpret personhood legislation or their impacts on forms of birth control that are currently legal. Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives. As we’ve noted in past articles about the debate over personhood, some legal scholars and the medical community have cautioned that it could potentially impact access to birth control. Gardner’s critics may have a point that some forms of birth control could be outlawed if personhood measures became law -- but that shouldn’t affect condoms. That’s because condoms prevent sperm from reaching the egg in the first place. No fertilization ever takes place. In a further twist, Gardner made a major about-face during the 2014 campaign, saying he no longer supports the personhood movement, partly because he now thinks it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. "The fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position," Gardner told The Denver Post. "I've learned to listen. I don't get everything right the first time." Gardner has also said that if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed, he wants to allow the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Udall’s campaign said he supports allowing over-the-counter sales of the pill as long as insurance companies are still mandated to cover it without any cost sharing. Finally, Gardner’s campaign notes that in 2007, he was one of five to cosponsor an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specified that "nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug or chemical." This bill, his campaign said, demonstrates that Gardner is not anti-contraceptive. The ad’s sponsors didn’t get back to PolitiFact, but Doug Gordon, a spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, told our friends at FactCheck.org that "we're not saying he is banning condoms. We are saying if Gardner starts limiting other forms of birth control, you better stock up on condoms because there will be so much demand for them — since Gardner wants to ban other forms of birth control." While an affiliated radio ad does make that argument, the television ad doesn’t say that. It seems much more plausible to us that viewers of the TV ad would assume that Gardner wants to ban birth control, period. Our ruling The ad claims that "if Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms." The most obvious interpretation of this statement is that Gardner wants to ban condoms -- something that’s based on an incorrect interpretation of the measures Gardner has supported in the past (and which he has since distanced himself from). Gardner says he doesn’t support banning condoms, and in any case, condoms would not be at issue under the personhood measure he once supported. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-07690	Wisconsin state and local government workers pay "$500, $600 or in some cases, $1,000" per year in union dues.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-government-workers/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has tried to sprinkle sugar on what many government workers see as the bitter pill he’s proposing in his controversial budget-repair bill. Let’s see if what he is sprinkling is as sweet as he says it is. For many state and local government workers, losing collective bargaining power is the bitter pill. The bill also would require most public employees to pay more for pensions and health insurance. The hit would be $5,400 per year for a state employee who earns the average wage -- $50,000 -- and chooses the least-expensive family plan for health insurance, Walker’s administration says. The sugar, at least the way the Republican governor presents it, is in another provision of the bill. It would prohibit union dues from being withheld from public employees’ paychecks. That means state and local government workers would have to pay their unions directly. According to Walker, if workers opt out of the union, they could save a fair amount of money. On Feb. 20, 2011, on the "Fox News Sunday" program, Walker said "for those workers who don't want to be a part of the union, if you don't want that deduction each month out of the paycheck, they should be able to get that $500, $600 or in some cases, $1,000 back that they can apply for their health care and their pension contribution." Walker made a similar statement three days earlier on Fox television’s "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren." And Washington Post columnist George Will wrote that Walker told him that many employees could save $500 or $600 per year in union dues and that teachers could save up to $1,000. Let’s find out if the governor’s figures are correct. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie sent us a document that he said came from the state payroll department. Payroll would know the amount of union dues for state workers, since it withholds them from state workers’ paychecks. The document indicates that annual union dues are as low as $208 for certain legal employees and $300 for apprentice sheet metal workers; dues are as high as $3,180 for plasterers and $3,465 for plumbers. The exact range, however, could be different because dues for some employees are a percentage of their pay, and the document does not spell out those amounts. Moreover, the document does not specify how many employees pay the various dues amounts that are listed, and it does not provide any averages. We asked Werwie for more information, but he had not responded by publication time. So, we contacted some of the major public employee unions to ask what their members pay annually in dues. Our list is not comprehensive, but it does cover tens of thousands of state and local government workers. General employees Most of the 23,000 state workers who are members of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 24 pay $420 per year in union dues, though some pay $492, said Bob Allen, spokesman for AFSCME-Wisconsin. They tend to be "front-line" workers such as correctional officers, administrative support staff, probation and parole officers and custodians, he said. Members of Local 1914 -- one of the units of Council 24 -- pay $470 per year, according to the dues page on that local’s website. Those 300 members are state employees in Eau Claire, Chippewa, Rusk, Clark and Taylor counties, and hold non-academic jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Members of AFT-Wisconsin who earn over $34,000 per year pay about $510 per year in dues, said president Bryan Kennedy. AFT says it represents 17,000 public workers in 500 different classifications. Health care workers Annual dues for the 15,000 members of the Professional Patient Care Unit of Service Employees Union International range from about $192 for home care workers to $864 or more for senior nurses, said president Dian Palmer. Teachers Milwaukee Public Schools teachers paid $995 in dues in 2010, while educational assistants who worked more than 20 hours per week paid $469, according to the figures from the website of the Milwaukee Teachers’ Education Association. That union says it represents more than 8,200 employees, including 6,000 teachers. Green Bay public school teachers pay $834 in dues, said Lori Blakeslee, spokeswoman for the Green Bay Education Association. The typical Wisconsin teacher who belongs to the state’s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, pays $450 per year for the state and national portions of their dues, said WEAC spokeswoman Christina Brey. But the additional amount in local dues paid varies and Brey said she did not know what the range is. Both Milwaukee and Green Bay belong to WEAC. Let’s return to the statement. In pushing his budget-repair bill, Walker said state and local government workers could stop paying union dues and take home $500 to $1,000 more per year in pay. He didn’t say most or many, but his statement suggests that a significant number of public employees pay dues in that range. And we found thousands of public employees who do. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-03-08T09:00:00	2011-02-20	['None']
pomt-04785	Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan "could raise future retirees’ costs more than $6,000."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/23/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-paul-ryans-medicare-plan-coul/	Editor’s note: After we originally published this item, we received several emails questioning our ruling and pointing us to a new study on the Medicare Advantage program. We reviewed that evidence, considered the arguments of those who disagreed with us and reconsidered our original rating of Mostly True. (Read the archived original version.) Here, we’ve incorporated the new evidence into our original story and issued a new rating of Half True. In the latest salvo in a growing battle over Medicare, President Barack Obama’s campaign has released an ad that criticizes the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket over Ryan’s plan for Medicare. The ad, called "Facts," touts support for his own approach to Medicare from the AARP -- the organization representing older Americans -- as well as AARP’s criticism of Ryan’s proposal. (After the ad’s release, AARP issued a statement to clarify that it was not involved in the making of the ad, though the statement didn’t dispute the ad’s use of AARP’s previous written comments.) At one point, the narrator says that "experts say (Ryan’s) voucher plan could raise future retirees’ costs more than $6,000." An on-screen visual adds the text, "Raise seniors’ costs by $6,400 a year. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 4/8/11." Is this accurate? Only partly so. We’ll take a look at why. The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan As we’ve noted, Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only, but critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost. The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and harmful to beneficiaries. Subsequently, Ryan offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. Ryan’s most recent plan is similar to his original one, with two key differences. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market -- the price of the second-cheapest plan. So is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign? It appears to be. In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical." This history is important because of how the Obama campaign frames the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in the ad. The $6,400 question The ad documents its claim of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs by citing a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said: "In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare," center president Bob Greenstein wrote. "CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater. The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400. In an interview, Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that the numbers his group used come from CBO, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, and that the center’s role was just to take the CBO analysis and make it "more understandable." In fact, different groups have made slightly different calculations of the out-of-pocket increase -- the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, tabulated the number to be $6,870 -- but the estimates we’ve seen are all in the same ballpark. But here’s the problem: The CBO analysis, and the other groups’ analyses that were built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase, while still keeping spending lower than current projections. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange. That means while the traditional Medicare offering — if it’s more expensive than the second-least expensive plan — could cost seniors more out-of-pocket, it’s unlikely to cost them as much as estimates for Ryan’s earlier plan. Of course, it’s still not clear what would happen over time if those market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan’s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else? "CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed," CBO wrote earlier this year. The Obama campaign said it would be happy to update its numbers if CBO or the Romney-Ryan campaign provided new data, but neither has. Peter Orszag, Obama’s former Office of Management and Budget director, recently wrote that "if Ryan believes that changes to his plan since (the original plan was released) would result in any different conclusions, he should request that CBO publish an updated analysis." But there is one clue that the number wouldn’t be close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare. That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to less than $800 a year. But the absence of data means that analyzing the impact of the new Ryan plan is speculative. Van de Water told PolitiFact that, in the absence of specifics, "I wouldn’t want to speculate on what a new CBO estimate would show. ... Since Ryan has advanced many different versions of premium support, one should specify which version one is talking about." But despite such concerns, Van de Water did say that the Obama campaign’s decision to use the old numbers was defensible. "It also seems reasonable to cite the most recent available analysis" when Ryan has not provided enough detail to do a new one. Our rating The Obama ad would have been more accurate if it had specified that it was referring to a previous Ryan plan for Medicare rather than the current one. We simply don’t have enough details to know how much extra money seniors might have to pay under the current Ryan plan. Still, the Obama campaign gave itself some wiggle room by saying that the plan "could" raise out-of-pocket costs by more than $6,000. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-11097	"Breaking: Mike Huckabee just fired!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/12/red-state-wave/no-evidence-trump-ally-mike-huckabee-was-fired/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, an ally of President Donald Trump, has been fired, a misleading clickbait headline suggested. "Breaking: Mike Huckabee just fired!" said a June 11 headline on Red State Wave, a conservative website. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. Nothing in the story said Huckabee was fired. Instead the story said he "fired off" at actor Robert De Niro for dropping multiple f-bombs on Trump at the June 10 Tony Awards. "Only thing sadder than De Niro's vile rant is that high-toned elite snobs at the event gave him a standing O. Were U raised by wolves? Your hate and contempt works in H'wood, NY & DC, but in the land of ‘God, Guns, Grits & Gravy’ ppl pray for you to get over your bitterness," Huckabee tweeted June 11. He followed up with a more comical rebuttal of De Niro in a second tweet: "I just called Robert De Niro and told him that he's out of my ‘circle of trust.’ He cried like a 6 year old who didn't get cake at the birthday party and begged to get back in. http://No.Can.DO ." Huckabee linked to a scene in the movie Meet the Parents in which De Niro, a retired CIA officer, tells his future son-in-law, played by Ben Stiller, he is now in the "circle of trust." Huckabee ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 but later endorsed Trump. He is now the host of "Huckabee" on TBN and a Fox News contributor. His daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders is Trump’s press secretary. The Red State Wave article about Huckabee was written by an unnamed "MAGA student," a reference to Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan "Make America Great Again." A disclaimer states that redstatewave.com is a "passive service for storage and dissemination of the works that redstatewave.com members may choose to post and distribute." Red State Wave has used similar clickbait language before when it wrote in a misleading headline that Fox News’ Laura Ingraham was "fired," when she actually fired off at Democrats.

pomt-12859	Says Donald Trump's abortion rule "puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families ... than previous similar policies by Republican presidents."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/01/jeanne-shaheen/yes-trumps-abortion-policy-puts-global-health-mone/	Among the flurry of policies President Donald Trump put in force in his first week was to reimpose a ban on taxpayer dollars going to overseas groups that have anything to do with abortion. The so-called Mexico City policy was born under President Ronald Reagan and since then, with partisan regularity, Republican presidents invoke it and Democratic ones reject it. On the Senate floor, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., warned that Trump’s version was even more extreme than those of his GOP predecessors. "Previously, under President Reagan and the Bush administrations, this policy applied only to family planning funding," Shaheen said. "But under President Trump's order, it applies to every program that falls under global health assistance. This means that it puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families." We compared the policies of all four Republican presidents and found that on paper, Shaheen’s number is largely correct, but there’s uncertainty surrounding Trump’s policy. The first Mexico City policy Reagan administration officials announced a new U.S. family planning policy at the 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City. It required all nongovernmental organizations, foreign and domestic, receiving aid from the United States to agree that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other countries. This applied to U.S. family planning programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development. President George H. W. Bush left the Reagan policy in place. President Bill Clinton rescinded it, and President George W. Bush brought it back with the focus still on family planning through the U.S. Agency for International Development. But in 2003, Bush expanded the reach of the policy, instructing the secretary of state to apply it to "all assistance for voluntary population planning." Even as he did that, Bush excluded a number of groups and programs. "Such organizations do not include multilateral organizations that are associations of governments," Bush wrote. "This policy shall not apply to foreign assistance furnished pursuant to the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003." With those words, Bush exempted some of the largest and highest profile global health programs. Those programs, experts told us, dwarfed any other programs at the State Department that Bush’s order might have affected. Trump’s presidential memorandum to reinstate the Mexico City policy is broader. In addition to the head of USAID, it is addressed to the departments of State and Health and Human Services. "I direct the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent allowable by law, to implement a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated Memorandum to global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies." The operative phrase is "global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies." Trump’s order provides no exceptions. It’s unclear exactly how the Trump administration will interpret those words. We asked the White House press office for details and did not hear back. The experts we reached told us they too were in the dark. Comparing family planning and global health programs The pipeline of family planning and global health programs is more complicated than you might expect. Governments agencies often contract with nonprofits which in turn subcontract out to smaller organizations in countries around the world. Jennifer Kates, director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said this makes it difficult to know the real impact of the order. "Not all of the organizations that directly or indirectly receive U.S. government global health support carry out the activities prohibited by the policy, but figuring that out will take some time," Kates told us. However, Kates said that in theory, Trump’s policy puts a lot more funding on the line. "Whereas family planning assistance represents about $600 million per year, global health funding overall is close to $10 billion," Kates said. Data gathered by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation allows us to tease out exactly which programs Bush exempted from the Mexico City policy, but that Trump has included (see this IHME data graphic). Remember, Bush kept money for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis off the table, as well as U.S. support for programs involving multiple nations, the big ones being the Global Fund and United Nations programs. Add all of those up and you get $9.7 billion. That’s about 15 times as much money as the United States spends on family planning, which was the core program affected across all three previous Republican administrations. Shaheen said millions of women and families might be affected. In spending, the single largest global health program is the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. According to the latest report to Congress, PEPFAR treated 9.5 million people in 2015, at a cost of about $6.8 billion. Trump, along with his Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, has voiced support for PEPFAR. But in theory, since many HIV/AIDS programs include a family planning component, the programs that touch those people might be affected by Trump’s Mexico City policy. If the policy extends to malaria programs, the numbers climb dramatically. In 2015, American dollars protected over 16 million people with indoor spraying and many more through the distribution of nearly 30 million bed nets. Our ruling Shaheen said Trump’s Mexico City policy has a much broader reach compared to past Republican presidents, putting 15 times as much money "at risk," as well as millions of women and families. On paper, the numbers support that comparison. Previous Republican administrations applied the abortion funding policy to family planning programs, which amount today to about $600 million. Trump included all global health spending, which is nearly $10 billion. There is no question Trump’s approach is broader and that millions more people could be affected. The White House has not clarified how it will interpret the policy. Its reach could be much narrower than the full scope of global programs, but Shaheen included the caveat that certain dollars were "at risk," not that they definitely would be affected. It’s also true that organizations facing funding cuts could drop activities related to abortion and the funds would continue to flow. Given what we know so far, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d02c95c8-3f03-49cc-992e-bff8ad2d0a45	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2017-02-01T16:08:37	2017-01-24	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03293	Says Oregon’s political tax credit is something "every state should have and no other state does."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/01/kari-chisholm/oregon-alone-having-political-tax-credit/	One of the more quirky aspects of Oregon Tax Law is a little provision that lets folks donate $50 to a political causes -- $100 per couple -- and get a tax credit back on their next return. An actual credit, too, none of that deduction stuff. The law has been around since 1969, according to a report by the Oregon Secretary of State’s office. The provision, however, was up for expiration at the end of this year and some were calling for the Legislature to let it die as lawmakers looked for savings. The Oregonian’s own editorial board urged lawmakers to kill the credit: "There's nothing wrong with contributing money -- as much as you want -- to political committees and candidates who share your views. Even during the best of times, however, there's no compelling reason for the state to subsidize people's political activities through the use of an income tax credit." As it turned out, though, the provision -- with one change that we’ll get to later -- managed to survive by piggybacking on a larger tax bill. Kari Chisholm, the man behind the left-leaning political blog Blue Oregon, was explaining the tax break’s good luck in an interview on "Carl in the Morning," a progressive internet talk radio show. "Tucked deep into that bill was an extension of the Oregon political tax credit, something I think is an extraordinary expression of our Democracy in Oregon that every state should have and no other state does. "If you give $50 to a political campaign or a political organization of your choice then you get 50 bucks off your taxes the following year." Naturally, the superlative caught our attention. Was Oregon really the only state with such a provision? We called the National Council for State Legislatures first to see if they had any experts on hand. Mandy Rafool, who works with their financial affairs program, got back to us immediately via email. "I think it is unusual for states to offer credits for these contributions, although there are a few that offer them (Ohio and Oregon come to mind)." Rafool then pointed us toward a January 2013 study by the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau that looked at every state’s tax code and teased out the various rates, credits and exemptions in each. We did a quick look through the study and found that three other states, aside from Oregon, offered a political contribution credit: Ohio, Virginia and Arkansas. Now each state’s law varies some, and none of them is quite as expansive as Oregon’s. Arkansas’ law is the closest, but it doesn’t allow the credit for federal offices, where as Oregon’s does so long as the candidate appears on a state ballot. Meanwhile, Ohio limits its credits to donations made toward statewide offices and races for the legislature. Virginia’s is fairly strict as well. That state only gives credits for donations made during an election year and even then it offers half of what the other states do, $25 per person or $50 per couple. Oregon’s law, relatively speaking, is pretty loose. It can be applied to donations made, at any time, to political parties, state political action committees and any candidate -- federal, state or local -- that appears on an Oregon ballot. For as expansive as the credit is, though, it turns out it doesn’t get much use. The credit gets claimed most often during presidential election years, according to the Secretary of State’s office, but even at it’s peak, only about 7.8 percent of filers took advantage. For the 2011-13 biennium, the estimated cost to the Oregon’s bottom line was about $15 million. For the 2013-15 cycle, the state is expected to pay out just less than $7 million. Also worth a note: People making more than $77,000 a year account for 58 percent of those using the credit. That last fact may change moving forward. Remember that tweak to the credit we mentioned in passing? Well, when lawmakers re-approved the measure, they took the perk away for singles with adjusted gross incomes above $100,000 and joint filers above $200,000. All that aside, we asked Chisholm to weigh in on what we’d found. Initially, he was unaware the other three states gave tax credits for political contributions. After some research, he pointed out, as we have, that Oregon’s tax credit is more generous than the other three states. "While it's true that three other states have a political contribution tax credit -- and they are to be hailed for their forward thinking! -- it's also true that Oregon provides donors with the greatest possible choice about where to direct their donations," Chisholm wrote in an email. "And that, truly is ‘an extraordinary expression of our democracy in Oregon that every state should have and no other state does.’" He may be right, but his initial comments were not so specific. He said on the radio show that Oregon was the only state to offer a political tax credit. Had he said specifically that Oregon offered the most expansive political tax credit, or some similar qualifier, we’d be inclined to give him a higher rating. But as it stands, he used a superlative that just doesn’t stand up under scrutiny. We rate this claim False.	None	Kari Chisholm	None	None	None	2013-08-01T16:49:30	2013-07-09	['None']
pomt-03637	Broward County was one of three counties in the nation "pivotal to an Obama victory" in 2012.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/may/03/broward-democratic-executive-committee/was-broward-one-three-counties-pivotal-obama/	Broward County Democrats like to think they are special. And they have some proof to back that up: Broward has more registered Democratic voters than any other county in Florida. Broward is home to Democratic National Committee chair U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And President Barack Obama campaigned in Hollywood the final weekend before Election Day in 2012. We’ll be hearing more about the importance of Broward Democrats as the statewide party aims to take out Republican Gov. Rick Scott next year. In 2010, Broward’s abysmal 41 percent turnout was one factor in Scott’s defeat of Democrat Alex Sink. But exactly how important are those Broward Democrats? The Broward Democratic Executive Committee sent an email to the media April 11 celebrating that his party had achieved a new milestone: more than 600,000 registered voters. The email then continued: "A recent news article indicated that three counties in the nation were pivotal to an Obama victory. Broward was the only location in Florida." Broward Supervisor of Elections records showed that the Dems surpassed 600,000 registered voters in April; however, due to the regular list maintenance, which includes placing some voters in an inactive status, the number later dropped down to about 589,000. (Republicans have about 256,000, and independents have about 300,000.) But the part that caught our eye was the claim about Broward’s national significance. Was Broward one of three counties in the nation pivotal to Obama’s 2012 victory? Article about Broward and Obama’s 2012 win We found the article in the National Journal: "Without his huge margins generated from minority and young voters in just three counties—Broward County, Fla., Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and Philadelphia County, Pa.—Obama would have actually lost those three states and, with them, the Electoral College." (Broward Democratic chairman Mitch Ceasar confirmed that was the article in question.) We contacted the Journal editor who wrote the article, David Wasserman, to ask about Broward’s role in Obama’s victory compared to other Florida counties. He said he meant that Broward was representative of several counties where Obama did well, but not more important than any other. "I'm not arguing Broward over Miami-Dade. I could have pointed to either, as both counties (as well as Palm Beach and Orange) gave Obama a margin greater than his statewide margin," he told PolitiFact in an email. "In fact, I'd argue Obama's efforts to woo non-Cuban Hispanics and younger Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade were probably more impressive than his efforts in Broward, where he didn't improve as much versus his 2008 showing." Broward and Miami-Dade results In 2012, Obama beat Republican nomineed Mitt Romney 67 percent to 32 percent in Broward, where voters delivered about 508,000 votes to Obama, or about 12 percent of his Florida share. Obama narrowly won Florida by less than 1 percent, with about 74,000 more votes than Mitt Romney. So one way to look at the data is that Broward more than supplied enough votes to create that edge for Obama. But we could make the same statement about Miami-Dade. The day after the election, the Tampa Bay Times wrote: "In a race won by razor-thin margins, nowhere mattered more than Miami-Dade, where Obama managed to increase his eye-popping 140,000-vote victory margin in 2008 to an unprecedented 204,000-vote margin this year. Miami-Dade by itself essentially delivered Florida to Obama." (By the time the votes were counted Obama’s margin was around 208,000.) There was no surprising headline out of Broward from the election -- the county voted for Obama by about the same margin as 2008, and the county’s overall turnout was about 67 percent in 2012, placing it the lowest among the state’s largest counties. Only a handful of Florida’s counties had lower turnout. The big surprise to many was that Obama received more of the Cuban vote -- thought of as a loyal base for Republicans in Miami-Dade for decades -- than he did in 2008. (Read the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog about the conflicting analysis of the actual numbers.) Obama went after that vote and opened an office in Little Havana, the heart of Miami-Dade’s Cuban community. We asked a few election experts if they considered Broward’s vote one of three "pivotal" counties for Obama’s victory. None of them declared Broward pivotal to Obama’s victory, but some wrestled with the idea that an individual county could be declared pivotal or questioned what that meant. "In a state where the margin of victory was only .088, it is difficult to point to a single county as THE pivotal county," University of South Florida professor Susan MacManus said. "The biggest change in the margin for Obama was in Miami-Dade, not Broward. But the margin was highest in Broward." George Mason University professor Michael McDonald told PolitiFact in an email: "I’d say that no county is ‘pivotal’ since candidate vote shares across counties within a state tend to move together. If Broward had a few percentage points less vote for Obama, so, too, would other counties. And the campaigns know this, which is why they do not concentrate their resources only in a few counties. The Obama campaign has been widely reported to have targeted voters in Republican areas, finding that some of these voters were more persuadable than those living in Democratic areas." Obama won enough votes in the electoral college without Florida, so the state -- and Broward -- weren’t pivotal, University of Central Florida professor Aubrey Jewett told PolitiFact in an email. "Not sure I would say Broward was the only pivotal county to winning Florida, but certainly one of the important ones," Jewett wrote in an email. "Obama's Florida victory seems to fit the old adage that for a Democrat to win Florida they need to run up big margins in the three big Democratic-leaning southeast Florida counties, run even across Central Florida and minimize their losses in North Florida." University of South Florida Professor Steven Tauber said that he viewed the term "pivotal" as speculative and vague: "Within Florida, there is no doubt that Broward is important, but it is reliably Democratic. Therefore, the key issue for Broward will be turnout and margin of a Democratic victory. I think that Hillsborough is much more important because it is the quintessential swing county. The fact that Hillsborough went for Obama should be more of an issue than the results in Broward." (Hillsborough County includes the city of Tampa.) We told Ceasar that the author of the National Journal article said he could have cited a different Florida County. Ceasar said that Broward’s margin in terms of sheer number of votes for Obama was larger than Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. That’s true -- Broward’s margin was about 264,000 compared to 208,000 in Miami-Dade and 102,000 in Palm Beach. "You win on sheer numbers," he said. He said that all the South Florida counties were important for Obama, however, "if you are going to pick one county, obviously I have to say my county, based on the sheer numbers, was most significant." Our ruling The Broward County Democratic Party said in a press release that Broward County was "pivotal to an Obama victory" in 2012, citing a news article. It’s mathematically possible to point to Obama’s margin in Broward and say that the votes were more than his margin over Romney. But Broward wasn’t really that special. There was never a question that Obama was going to win Broward, and voter-turnout there wasn't particularly high. Miami-Dade, for example, also delivered a big margin for Obama. The author of the news article said he could have just as easily chosen Miami-Dade rather than Broward County for the statement. Election experts we interviewed did not identify Broward as pivotal to Obama’s victory, and a few noted that Obama took more a more surprising win in swing-voting Hillsborough County. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Broward Democratic Executive Committee	None	None	None	2013-05-03T11:14:03	2013-04-11	['Barack_Obama', 'Broward_County,_Florida']
pomt-13854	Says Donald Trump made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs thanks to NAFTA "but never, ever raised his voice against it when Congress was considering it."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/jul/08/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-trump-never-denounced-nafta/	Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, seemed taken aback when ABC This Week host Martha Raddatz juxtaposed the harsh views of U.S. trade deals of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump with Brown’s own critiques over the years. Brown has said that he’d like to renegotiate a better North American Free Trade Agreement, as has Trump. Both men have also expressed concerns that China could enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal "through the back door" (a Trump statement we rated Pants on Fire). "Well done," Brown said after Raddatz played clips of his statements. "Good research." "A couple of things -- first of all," Brown went on, "all I’ve heard with Donald Trump, the guy who made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs to China, to Mexico, to Turkey, to Slovenia, to other countries I’m forgetting right now -- the guy that made a lot of money from that is now against this trade policy, but never, ever raised his voice against it when Congress was considering it." Brown, in office since 2007, has been determinedly critical of U.S. trade policies like NAFTA throughout his career, even authoring the book Myths of Free Trade: Why American Trade Policy Has Failed. Meanwhile, it’s well documented that Trump often says a thing, then denies having said it. So we turned to the public record of Trump on trade. Trump’s trade take-aways In July 2015, defending his "made in China" ties, Trump told CNN straight-up: "It’s very, very hard to have anything in apparel made in this country." Some, but not all, of Trump’s products are made in China, as we’ve previously confirmed. Others are made in Bangladesh and Mexico. The Washington Post reported that in 2004, Trump signed on with Phillips-Van Heusen to put his name on a collection of shirts, eyewear, cuff links and suits. He hired a company to broker the deal. Trump could have insisted on American manufacturing as part of those negotiations, but he didn’t, the Post reported. In the first three years of the licensing deal with Phillips-Van Heusen, Trump made over $3.2 million in royalties. In 2003, 95 percent of Phillips-Van Heusen’s products were manufactured in foreign countries, many of which had free trade agreements with the United States. The benefits of those agreements are spelled out in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission annual filings. "These products are imported and are subject to U.S. customs laws, which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel established by the U.S. government," read one such filing from 2004. "In addition, a portion of our imported products is eligible for certain duty-advantaged programs commonly known as NAFTA, AGOA, CBTPA and CBI." To put the cost advantages in plain speech, we turned to Dean Baker at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. "With a deal like NAFTA, the large purpose of the agreement was to encourage investment in Mexico, so companies set up operations in Mexico at lower cost than if they were producing them domestically," Baker said. "Other agreements, like granting China permanent normal trade relations status, facilitated the same sort of thing with China. The direct effect is getting lower-cost labor." The indirect effect, Baker said, is that domestic workers are pinched even if they keep their jobs. Their bargaining power for better pay or other benefits is decreased under the threat of the company packing up and moving overseas. "There are many instances where companies force concessions from workers, so that if they don’t agree to lower pay, the company will shift production, and they’ll lose their jobs," Baker said. In a 2005 blog posted on his Trump University website, now defunct but archived online, Trump defended outsourcing: "I know that doesn't make it any easier for people whose jobs have been outsourced overseas, but if a company's only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it's a necessary step. The other option might be to close its doors for good." In other words, Brown’s account of Trump outsourcing production of his ventures checks out. But what about his lack of a record opposing those deals? ‘Never, ever raised his voice’? Debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement had reached its zenith in October 1993. The policy passed the Senate the following month, was signed by President Bill Clinton in December, and went into effect Jan. 1, 1994. Trump wasn’t a politician in the early 1990s. At the time, the New York real estate mogul’s name was synonymous with wealth, just a few years after he published 1987’s The Art of the Deal. In that autobiography, Trump catalogued all the ways that he’d expanded his influence beyond the $40 million he inherited from his dad. Trump already had the type of fame that draws cameras for walking out to get the mail, so if the businessman were to weigh in on NAFTA, he’d be quoted. And so he was. Buzzfeed’s Andrew Kaczynski unearthed reports of an October 1993 business conference in Bakersfield, Calif., at which Trump was a speaker. (Other speakers included Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush, comedian Phyllis Diller, weatherman Willard Scott, and businessmen T. Boone Pickens and Lee Iacocca.) Nobody taped Trump’s speech, according to conference representatives contacted by Buzzfeed. But Kaczynski found, and PolitiFact Ohio reviewed, local newspaper reports like one from the Daily News of Los Angeles, which called Trump "one of the few to come out against NAFTA." The Lodi News-Sentinel reported, "Trump apparently ardently spoke against the plan," because, "it would only benefit Mexico." Trump said, "The Mexicans want it, and that doesn’t sound good to me," according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram. That same month, Trump did make his way to Capitol Hill, but not to talk trade deals. He testified before the House Natural Resources Committee, advocating tighter regulation over Native American-owned casinos on tribal lands. Such casinos were stiff competition for his own casino properties in Atlantic City, N.J. Trump complained that prospective casino owners on reservations "don’t look like Indians to me, and they don’t look like Indians to Indians." (The paper reported that Trump had been "on a tear on this subject for months.") Brown spokeswoman Jennifer Donohue told PolitiFact that Brown was trying to draw a contrast between his efforts to discourage outsourcing, and Trump’s capitalization of it. "The point he was making on Sunday is that he’s never known Donald Trump to be an active ally in that fight," Donohue said. Our ruling Brown said Trump made a lot of money from outsourcing jobs thanks to NAFTA "but never, ever raised his voice against it when Congress was considering it." Yes, Trump has benefitted financially from trade deals like NAFTA. Even he acknowledges that. But Brown’s televised comment makes it sound as though Trump changed his mind on trade when it became politically expedient. Rather, Trump was not a fan of NAFTA from the start, and was a rare voice in opposition to it at a Bakersfield, Calif., convention. We rate Brown’s claim Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a077db54-9832-4ebd-a9d4-7029ed3411d9	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2016-07-08T14:07:09	2016-07-03	['United_States_Congress', 'North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement']
pomt-02566	"Every year since Gov. Walker and the Republicans have been in control of the Legislature we’ve created fewer jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/31/brett-hulsey/rep-brett-hulsey-says-wisconsin-has-created-fewer-/	The state of employment in Wisconsin will play a key role in the 2014 race for governor. That’s because Gov. Scott Walker made creating 250,000 private-sector jobs his top campaign pledge in 2010 -- and our tracking shows he’s not on pace to meet the goal. In recent weeks, Democrats have criticized Walker’s record on jobs, highlighting comparisons between Wisconsin and other states, and a lack of growth in manufacturing jobs. A claim from state Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, stood out. He argued the state is actually backsliding on the jobs front. "Every year since Gov. Walker and the Republicans have been in control of the Legislature we’ve created fewer jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics," Hulsey said on "The Devil’s Advocates" radio show, broadcast on 92.1 FM in Madison. That caught our attention, because most signs indicate the economy is slowly recovering, and in tracking the jobs promise on the Walk-O-Meter we have seen the opposite trend, increases each year being a little larger than the previous one. So is Hulsey right? Have the new jobs been going down each year since Walker took office? When we asked Hulsey for his evidence, he cited Bureau of Labor Statistics private-sector job reports. Based on those figures, his office calculated it this way: 2011: 33,700 new jobs 2012: 32,300 new jobs 2013: 30,873 new jobs. The 2013 number is through November, the most recent month available when he made the claim. So, it seems like Hulsey found a downward trend. But there’s a catch -- actually several catches -- that affect the numbers and the trend cited by Hulsey. When it comes to jobs counting, the devil is in the details. How are the numbers calculated? Hulsey uses the monthly Current Employment Statistics, which come from interviews with a tiny sample -- about 3 percent -- of the state’s businesses. Those preliminary figures are estimates and carry a large margin of error. The numbers are made final the following month and often adjusted widely. How did Hulsey come up with his downward trend? Let’s examine each year. 2011: Hulsey says the state added 33,700 private sector jobs. He arrived at that number by taking the January 2012 jobs count of 2,362,100 and subtracting the January 2011 figure of 2,328,400 jobs. There’s one problem: this calculation doesn’t include the 10,100 jobs added in January 2011. That was Walker’s first month in office. So the more accurate starting point would be to use the December 2010, the last month before Walker took office, through December 2011. When you do that, you get an increase of 32,500. In short, Hulsey uses only 11 months of 2011 data for Walker’s first year. We’re off to a bad start. 2012: Hulsey says the state added 32,300 jobs. He got that figure by taking the January 2013 count and subtracting the January 2012 count. That’s 12 months, but that’s not the calendar year. He should have subtracted the December 2011 figure from December 2012. When you do, it comes to 23,800 for 2012. 2013: Hulsey says that through November the state had created 30,873 jobs. Again he was off with the months he used. When you subtract December of 2012 from November of 2013, you get 40,900 new jobs for the 11-month period. So here are the figures: 32,500 jobs, followed by 23,800 and then 40,900. That’s a bit of a mix, but does not match the three consecutive downward years Hulsey claims. We also note that the last full year under Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, the state created 30,700 jobs. Walker’s first full year topped Doyle by 1,800 jobs, according to the CES. But there’s another wrinkle. There is far better data available for 2011 and 2012. That’s the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a BLS survey of about 96 percent of all state businesses. Here’s what those numbers show: 2011: 29,800 new jobs 2012: 33,872 new jobs The final figures for 2013 won’t be available until June, so the next best figures come from the monthly numbers. And as of November, those showed a 40,700 increase. So the trend is exactly the opposite of what Hulsey claimed. Our rating Hulsey says state employers have added fewer jobs every year since Walker and the Republicans took control of state government. His evidence is based on two years of calculations that don’t include the full calendar year, and a projection for the third year that doesn’t track with the figures he cites. Also, for two years, he uses data that’s been superceded by far more accurate data. Either way you cut it, the claim is wrong. We rate Hulsey’s claim False.

pomt-01340	The projected $1.8 billion state budget shortfall for 2015-’17 "actually comes from an assumption based on zero growth. That just doesn’t happen."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-budget-shortfall-prediction-base/	Three summers ago, Gov. Scott Walker boasted to a national cable TV audience that his 2011-’13 state budget ended the practice of pushing fiscal problems into the future. In an June 2011 appearance on CNBC, Walker said his first budget "wiped out" a big shortfall and put in changes to avoid them in the future. Now, weeks before the Nov. 4, 2014 election, the governor is facing questions about his own shortfall projected for the 2015-’17 budget, caused in part by tax cuts he championed. And Walker is arguing the method behind a projected $1.8 billion shortfall is suspect. "That $1.8 billion number you’ve heard out there actually comes from an assumption based on zero growth," Walker said during the Oct. 17, 2014 debate, when challenged on the number by Democratic rival Mary Burke. "That just doesn’t happen." We touched on this exchange when we rated False Walker’s claim that there’s actually a surplus, not a deficit, heading into 2015. We said that flies in the face of the official estimate that uses a long-established method used by members of both parties, and the governor’s budget office. Now let’s examine Walker’s underlying critique -- that the $1.8 billion figure is based on zero growth, a scenario "that just doesn’t happen." It’s his basis for turning to a different, much rosier, set of numbers. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau is the source of the estimated $1.8 billion shortfall. As we have explained, this is an estimate of the challenge budget-makers will face based on past decisions that they will have to pay for in the two years ahead. That number is informally referred to as the "structural deficit." But the figure does not reflect an actual "deficit" at the end of a budget year -- it’s just a benchmark or starting point of what officials will have to account for as they make spending and tax decisions. Walker and lawmakers from both parties long have used the Fiscal Bureau methodology. Let’s start where Walker did in his claim, saying the analysis is based on an assumption of "zero growth" in revenue. In Madison circles, it is well known that the Fiscal Bureau’s method in this exercise is to assume no loss or gain in revenue -- and no changes in spending. In the real world, of course, state tax revenue rises and falls, and lawmakers adjust spending according to those revenues. By sticking to this method, the bureau’s estimate is consistent, allowing budget makers to readily gauge how their actions will affect future budgets. Lawmakers often ask during budget debates how spending increases or tax cuts will affect the "structural deficit" in the next budget. Growth history Now to Walker’s stated problem with the zero-growth approach -- that such a scenario "just doesn’t happen." When we asked for backup, the Walker campaign referred us to the history of state revenue growth. To check that, we went back to the 2001-’03 budget period and examined state revenue growth annually and for each two-year budget since then. We found that zero growth happens. And it’s even been worse than zero at times, owing usually to recessions and their effect on state tax revenue. In the last 13 years, three individual fiscal years have dipped into negative territory. 2002: - 0.4 percent 2009: - 7.1 percent 2014: - 1 percent In addition, the year 2010 saw essentially no growth -- a scant 0.15 percent bump up. (All years reflect state fiscal years ending in July.) The two year budget (2007-’09) slammed by the Great Recession saw revenue plummet $505 million, mostly due to big fall-offs in income tax and sales tax payments. Total revenue didn’t return to 2007 levels until four years later In Walker’s time as governor, revenue growth topped 4 percent in each of his first two years. But in 2013-’14, revenue fell by 1 percent, in part due to tax cuts he and Republican lawmakers enacted. The economic forecasts have not held up as planned either. We won’t know until mid-2015 whether the two-year budget will end with a decline in revenue as did the 2007-’09 budget. Forecasts are for growth in 2014-’15. But no matter what, the next governor and lawmakers by law must ensure it is balanced, through spending cuts or other means as necessary. Our rating Walker said the projected $1.8 billion state budget shortfall for 2015-’17 "actually comes from an assumption based on zero growth. That just doesn’t happen." The calculation is based on zero growth, so there’s an element of truth in Walker’s claim. But his main point was to make the zero-growth assumption seem unrealistic, and on that he misfired. Recent history, including one year under Walker, shows that negative or flat growth is not uncommon. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-04069	Says Texas will be "majority Hispanic in six years."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jan/23/george-p-bush/george-p-bush-says-texas-will-be-majority-hispanic/	Investor George P. Bush, a nephew and grandson to U.S. presidents, elaborated on his intended 2014 run for land commissioner or another statewide office partly by saying it’s important for Republicans to have candidates who understand the Hispanic community. Bush, whose mother, Columba, is from Mexico, also waved at the state’s demographic changes, saying in an Associated Press interview reported Jan. 12, 2013: "We’ll be majority Hispanic in six years." That struck us as too soon, though in July 2010, we rated as True a claim that within five to eight to ten years, there would be more Latinos in Texas than there are Anglos. At the time, the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center said it "is anticipated that the number of Hispanics will exceed the number of Anglos in the state at some point in the coming decade. This benchmark might be achieved a little sooner or a little later if migration is respectively more rapid or more slow than that utilized for this projection." Our story did not speak to when the majority of residents would be Hispanic. Latinos have absolutely gained in prominence. In the 2000 Census, 52 percent of Texans were Anglo, and 32 percent identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino (of any race). In the 2010 U.S. census, Latinos comprised nearly 38 percent of Texas residents with non-Hispanic whites making up about 45 percent of residents and blacks accounting for nearly 12 percent of the population, according to Robert Bernstein, spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau. As of July 2011 estimates, the Census Bureau says, non-Hispanic whites made up 44.8 percent of the population with individuals of Hispanic origin accounting for 38.1 percent; blacks comprised 12.2 percent, Bernstein said by email. Separately, we asked the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, about Bush’s statement. By email, he said the data center’s projections suggest Latinos will outnumber any other ethnic group in Texas by 2017 or 2019, depending on growth patterns. Hispanic residents will make up a majority of the population as of 2036 or 2040, he said. Potter also reminded us that the projections are driven by different possible growth patterns, meaning surprises are always possible. We sought his comment on a Dec. 31, 2012, New York Times news article stating that Hispanic Americans were bearing fewer children than before. Potter saidl: "Our projections factor in trends in changing fertility among all racial and ethnic groups through 2010. In particular, we noted the declining fertility among Hispanic women in the last few years. Of course the caution comes in here, where if fertility among Hispanics declines at a more rapid pace than the trend we used and more rapidly than other racial/ethnic groups, the time it takes for Hispanics become a majority race/ethnic group, or to exceed 50 percent of the population will take longer." After we gathered these figures, Bush adviser Trey Newton of Austin said by email that George P. Bush had consulted Steve Murdock, a Rice University professor who previously served stints as director of the U.S. Census Bureau and as the Texas state demographer. According to Bush’s notes, Newton said, Hispanics will make up a plurality of the state’s population by 2020 and a majority by 2025. By telephone, Murdock agreed his latest projections indicate Hispanics will make up a plurality by 2020. But Murdock said the projections suggest Hispanics will not make up a majority until sometime between 2030 and 2040. Of Bush’s comment to the AP, Murdock said: "There may have been some misunderstanding. I am not always as clear as sky." Our ruling Bush said Texas will be majority Hispanic in six years. We suspect Bush was referring to the time that Hispanics become the biggest subgroup of the population, which is projected to occur by 2017 or 2019, according to the state demographer. However, he said "majority," and Hispanics are not projected to make up the majority of residents until 2036 at the earliest. We rate his quoted claim as Mostly False.	None	George P.

pomt-10694	Huckabee supported "a tuition break to the children of illegals that are here illegally when citizens are having to pay a higher rate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/05/mitt-romney/romney-glosses-over-in-state-tuition-details/	Mitt Romney said a proposed law that Mike Huckabee supported when he was governor of Arkansas would have given "a tuition break to the children of illegals that are here illegally when citizens are having to pay a higher rate." There's no disputing Huckabee's position on the measure, but is that an accurate way to characterize it? Because they aren't citizens, the children of illegal immigrants are not eligible for in-state tuition rates for state schools, which tend to be significantly lower than the rates charged to out-of-state students. The proposed Arkansas law, similar to laws on the books in other states, would have allowed some illegal immigrants who came to this country as children to receive the same tuition as their classmates. Ten states have passed similar laws, which typically include having students sign statements saying they want to resolve their immigration status. At the Republican debate in St. Petersburg, Huckabee articulated a defense to Romney's attacks, saying the bill was intended to give resident students who were not citizens the same chances that their classmates had to attend college. "They didn't get something better; they had to earn it," Huckabee said. (Huckabee also exaggerated some of the regulations for the proposed law in Arkansas; we checked those claims previously here .) Romney is right that Huckabee supported the measure. But Huckabee is right when he said the illegal immigrants in his state wouldn't have gotten a better deal than legal residents. Romney's description of the measure as "a tuition break" would have been true only in comparison to citizens who lived outside the state of Arkansas. For Arkansas students who graduate from Arkansas high schools, the law would have given in-state students, illegal or not, the same tuition rate. Romney may even realize this point but chose to ignore it. When he vetoed the legislation in Massachusetts in 2004, he said, "I hate the idea of in any way making it more difficult for kids, even those who are illegal aliens, to afford college in our state. But equally, perhaps a little more than equally, I do not want to create an incentive to do something which is illegal." That's some distance from his recent comments that the proposal "makes no sense to me at all." We find his shorthand of a "tuition break" for illegal immigrants glosses over a complicated issue to the point where it's somewhat inaccurate. We find that part of his argument Half True.

pomt-14544	"In New England, Rhode Island has the second highest number of police officers being assaulted."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2016/feb/14/tony-capezza/police-union-director-uses-incomplete-data-general/	The state director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers wants to double the penalties for assaulting a police officer, and he’s leaning heavily on some FBI statistics to make his case. "As you know, police work is a hazardous job to start off with, but over the years more and more police officers have been assaulted and killed in the line of duty," Tony Capezza told the House Judiciary Committee on Jan. 26. "In New England, Rhode Island has the second highest number of police officers being assaulted." Citing 2014 numbers from the FBI, Capezza said there were 682 assaults on officers in Connecticut and 324 assaults in Rhode Island. The numbers he gave translate to about 31 assaults per 100,000 Rhode Islanders and about 19 assaults per 100,000 Connecticut residents. Capezza noted the significantly higher per capita rate of assaults in Rhode Island and cited population figures for both states, about 3.5 million for Connecticut and 1 million for Rhode Island. Rep. Edith H. Ajello asked about Massachusetts and Capezza told her "Massachusetts had … 141 assaults based on a 4,150,000 population." "Seems to me the per capita assault on police officers in Rhode Island is way out of line with Connecticut and Massachusetts," said Ajello. "Much higher, which is certainly concerning." We dug into the FBI’s annual report on the subject and found that just 235 of 323 Massachusetts departments filed their assault data. That works out to a compliance rate of 72 percent. The rate was 98 percent in Connecticut and Rhode Island, 97 percent in Maine, 95 percent in New Hampshire and 100 percent in Vermont. A Massachusetts state official who coordinates data for the FBI provided us with a list of communities that contributed statistics, including Boston and Fall River, but not Cambridge, Somerville, Everett, Quincy, Brockton, New Bedford, Springfield and Worcester. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. We told Capezza about the absence of data from 88 police agencies; he stood by his earlier testimony. "By this document, it’s clear Rhode Island has the second-highest amount of assaults," said the Rhode Island state director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. The table in the FBI report referenced by Capezza groups the six New England states and lists the number of assaults reported by participating agencies in each of them. The number of assaults in Rhode Island is the second-highest number in the table. But the same table also provides information about "the number of reporting agencies" and the "population covered" -- indications that the individual assault statistics may not reflect all assault data compiled by all police agencies in each state. The population covered by the statistic that Capezza gave to Ajello was the 4.1 million listed in the table, but the FBI’s total population estimate for Massachusetts, found elsewhere in its Uniform Crime Reports, was about 6.5 million. Also, the report itself does not rank the New England states. Capezza did that on his own. The FBI deliberately avoids rankings like the one that Capezza presents. And the agency warns data users to avoid comparing data from states and other types of jurisdictions "solely on the basis of their population coverage…" and without considering a full range of other factors such as degree of urbanization, strength of law enforcement and poverty levels. "Until data users examine all the variables that affect crime in a town, city, county, state, region, or other jurisdiction, they can make no meaningful comparisons," says the FBI’s warning. Our ruling Capezza said that: "In New England, RI has the second highest number of police officers being assaulted." He cited FBI Uniform Crime Reports as his source and the FBI data from Rhode Island and four other New England states supports his claim. The data from Massachusetts also supports the claim. The problem is that, pending an update, the Massachusetts data is only 72 percent complete. In other words, 28 percent of the data from New England’s most populous state is missing. That’s a substantial gap. Also, Capezza misused the FBI data when he ranked the New England states without addressing all of the variables that can affect such a crime statistic. Such rankings are explicitly discouraged by the agency’s cautionary guidelines. For those two reasons, the ruling is Mostly False.

pomt-06337	"The Confederate battle flag never flew over Texas, but... you might soon see it on our license plates."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/09/progress-texas/progress-texas-says-battle-flag-behind-license-pla/	Talk about opening with a bang: "The Confederate battle flag never flew over Texas," Matt Glazer opens an opinion article posted online Oct. 20, 2011 by the Austin American-Statesman, "but if Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson gets his way, you might soon see it on our license plates." Glazer is executive director of Progress Texas, a liberal education and advocacy group, which has urged the board overseeing the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to reject a request by the Texas division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and sponsored by Patterson, to permit license plates emblazoned with a red, white and blue flag design tracing to the Confederacy (see the proposed design here) including these words: "Sons of Confederate Veterans." The image, sometimes called the rebel flag or Dukes of Hazzard flag, hearkens to the battle flag of the Confederacy’s Army of Northern Virginia, whose general was Robert E. Lee. An article on Texas flags in the Handbook of Texas Online describes the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia as a square having a red ground with a blue saltire, meaning diagonal cross, "bordered with white and emblazoned with white five-pointed stars corresponding in number to that of the Confederate States." The flag’s look also has long been the identifying emblem of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. So, that flag never flew over Texas? To our inquiry, Glazer initially pointed out remarks by Austin lawyer Gary Bledsoe, president of the state NAACP conference, at the motor vehicle board’s Oct. 12, 2011, meeting. A news story in the American-Statesman quoted Bledsoe saying: "This particular flag never flew over Texas." And according to the agency’s video of his appearance, Bledsoe continued: "Let me say that again; this particular flag never flew over Texas." He urged the board not to consider the design, which he said has been adopted by hate groups to intimidate and offend others. Up to three flags of the Confederate States of America may have flown over the Texas Capitol in the war’s four years, experts later told us, and while none of them was the flag of Lee’s army, two incorporated its look. Houston lawyer Charles Spain Jr., author of the Handbook of Texas entry on flags that have flown over Texas, pointed us to a 1997 report by the Texas Historical Commission on the flags that flew over Texas in its unusual history as a republic and as part of Spain, Mexico, France, the Confederacy and the United States. The commission report, which Glazer said he also leaned on for his claim, says the first flag of the Confederate States of America, which was in place for more than two years, included a red field with a white space extending horizontally through the center; the sought license plate design bears no resemblance. The nation’s second flag, which flew from May 1863 to March 4, 1865, had a blank white field. But its "hoist" corner, the one at the top part closest to the flag pole, was the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, the article says. Toward the end of the war, the flag gave way to a third national flag keeping the battle flag imagery in its hoist corner while adding a red vertical bar down the flag’s white fly. Put another way, then, a flag with a corner like the license plate design flew over Texas for about two years. We realized, though, there’s another wrinkle. Battle flags, in themselves, would not have been lofted over government buildings. Battle flags were carried by groups of soldiers. For insight on this aspect, we contacted George Forgie, a University of Texas associate professor of history specializing in the Civil War. Forgie referred us to Jeff Hunt, director of the Texas Military Forces Museum at Austin’s Camp Mabry, who described battle flags as important military tools enabling generals to locate units and track movements on the field. Hunt said, too, that versions of the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia were carried by Texas units during the war. Indeed, Hunt said, a version of the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was carried at the Battle of Palmetto Ranch, the last of the war, which occurred near Brownsville, Texas, on May 12-13, 1865, well after Lee surrendered. Hunt, who has written a book on the battle, said it took place even though both sides knew Lee’s Army had surrendered. Glazer stuck by his published claim, saying it doesn’t make sense to focus on flags that only had the distinctive imagery in a corner which, he noted by email, is not the same as a flag in itself. Glazer also objected to "expanding" the definition of battle flags to include "flags that ever flew ‘in’ Texas, or any altered flags. That would expand the definition of Texas flags to historic flags like the famous ‘Come and Take It’ flag, athletic flags raised by sports teams outside stadiums, fraternity and sorority flags, commercial flags from Fortune 500 companies and thousands of others I can't even think of." Our ruling The group’s statement reflects the unchallenged fact that the battle flag of the Army of Northern Virginia did not fly over the Texas Capitol. However, the image on the requested license plate looks a lot like the most noticeable feature of the second and third national flags of the Confederacy, which did fly over Texas. Also, a version of the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia was carried by Texans in a Texas battle. We rate the statement Half True.

"Clint Eastwood says his doctors have put him on notice to get his affairs in order and prepare for that final trip in one of those limousine station wagons we call a hearse," said the Maga2020.com website. "The famous actor, 89, says he’ll be lucky to see 2019." Eastwood is actually 88, but the part that caught our eye had to do with Eastwood’s parting gift to boost the political fortunes of President Donald Trump: "Eastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump’s 2020 campaign." That would be generous, and illegal. "That certainly would exceed the contribution limits to give something of such value to a campaign," said Brendan Glavin with the Campaign Finance Institute. Robert Maguire with the Center for Responsive Politics echoed the point. "I do not know of any rule that exempts either donors — in this life or the next — from the limits the FEC has placed on direct contributions to campaign committees," Maguire said. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The campaign contribution rests on Eastwood’s imminent demise. That too is false. Not only is there no mention of it in any remotely reliable news source (we checked on the Lexis-Nexis news database), but Eastwood just started a new film that he will both direct and act in called Mule. Shooting begins in the second half of July in Las Cruces, N.M. If Eastwood’s health were precarious, a bolt of cash to the local economy would be at risk. The editors of the Las Cruces Sun News see no clouds on the horizon. "We hope that as many local workers and businesses as possible apply for these jobs and services, allowing us to get the maximum economic impact from the production," they wrote July 13.

pomt-01093	"In 1913, it was legal to mail children."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/13/facebook-posts/think-again-about-mailing-your-noisy-kids/	A viral claim making the rounds on social media conjures up images of babies bouncing around in mail bags and wayward teenagers being stamped and shipped "special delivery" to grandma and grandpa down on the farm. "In 1913, it was legal to mail children," the Facebook post says, among other things. The post includes photographs of a couple of "mailed" children. Still, it’s pretty clear from some readers’ comments that the claim is not universally taken too seriously. "The heck with mailing the kids. I wanna mail myself some place warm," one commenter wrote. "So thankful with today’s technology, we can now fax ’em," wrote another. But is it true? Was it legal in 1913, or at any time, to mail children? PolitiFact Georgia readers who have been bombarded with re-posts of the claim asked us to weigh it on the ol’ AJC Truth-O-Meter. We contacted Nancy Pope, a historian and curator at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum in Washington. She told us there were "a handful" of children, who were "mailed" after the Postal Service created the parcel post service in 1913. These children, for the most part, were sent short distances, not across the country or internationally, Pope said. They also were typically delivered personally to their destination by a rural letter carrier — someone well-known and trusted in the community, considered on par with a member of the local clergy, she said. "The trust in the mail at that point was almost sacrosanct," Pope said. Mailing children — with stamps attached to their clothes — occurred as customers and Postal Service workers were becoming accustomed to the new service, which allowed packages weighing 50 pounds or less to be shipped by freight train at rates often cheaper than a child’s train ticket. But was it ever officially legal to mail a child? No, Pope said. "The law did not specifically address (mailing children) when parcel post began Jan. 1, 1913, because nobody thought anybody would do such a stupid thing," she said. A year later, when a few children had been "mailed" and made the news, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson issued a memo to the nation’s postmasters, advising them that all human beings were barred from being mailed, Pope said. The first child "mailed" in the U.S. was an unnamed boy in Ohio. The kid’s parents paid 15 cents for stamps and insured the child for $50 in January 1913 to have a rural Free Delivery carrier take their boy to his grandmother’s house a mile away, according to the Postal Service. A year later, May Pierstorff was sent by parcel post from her parents’ home in Idaho to her grandparents’ house about 73 miles away for 53 cents worth of stamps. May traveled with a relative who worked on the Railway Mail trains in early 1914, Pope said. (She’s one of the children in pictures on the Facebook post.) A book, "Mailing May," chronicles May’s adventure shortly before her sixth birthday. The longest known trip reportedly cost 15 cents. A 6-year-old from Pensacola, Fla., was mailed through parcel post from her mother’s home in Florida to her father’s home in Virginia, having just made it under the 50-pound limit, according to reports at the time. "Babies were not being put in boxes or dumped in mailboxes," Pope said. "It was just a less expensive way to get the kids to see the grandparents." Pope wasn’t surprised to hear from us. She said reports about the "mailed" children began popping up all over the Internet in 2013, the 100th anniversary of the creation of the parcel post service. A second anniversary — the centennial of May Pierstorff’s delivery to her grandparents in 1914 — has kept the buzz going, she said. The claim attracted the attention of Snopes.com, the website known for debunking urban legends and Internet rumors, which found it was a mixture of truth and falsehood. So where does this leave us? The Facebook post says "In 1913, it was legal to mail children." Postal historians say no more than a handful of children were mailed after the parcel post service was created in 1913. The law at the time didn’t specify that it was illegal to mail children, but officials say no one had envisioned a situation where that had to be spelled out. When there was evidence that children were indeed being mailed, the postmaster general sent a memo in 1914 barring human beings from postal delivery. The Facebook post needs a whole lot of context. It leaves the wrong impression that children were being mailed legally in 1913. A few mailings did occur, but the practice — never legally sanctioned — was quickly abandoned. PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That seems to fit this one like a roll of bubble wrap. We rate the Facebook post Mostly False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2015-01-13T00:00:00	2015-01-12	['None']
pomt-13478	"After 9/11, Jim put us all first by serving for 23 months in Iraq, the war’s longest tour."	mostly false	/iowa/statements/2016/sep/09/jim-mowrer/fact-check-mowrer-ad-misleads-military-record/	Iowa congressional candidate Jim Mowrer has made his military service — both with the Iowa National Guard and as a civilian in the Pentagon — a cornerstone of his campaign. At The Des Moines Register’s Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair in August, Mowrer, a Democrat, stumped on veterans’ issues, saying that serving alongside other young Americans is what gives him "such great hope for the future of our country." Mowrer is seeking to unseat freshman incumbent U.S. Rep. David Young, a Republican in Iowa’s 3rd District, which includes Des Moines and Council Bluffs. And this week, Mowrer is up with his first television ad of the general election, highlighting his military record and history of service. "True service is about putting others before yourself," the ad's narrator says over images of Mowrer in military uniform. "That is something Jim Mowrer has always done. After 9/11, Jim put us all first by serving for 23 months in Iraq, the war’s longest tour." But, according to military records obtained by The Des Moines Register through a Freedom of Information Act request, Mowrer served one year, three months and 18 days of foreign service in Iraq — or about 16 months. His campaign insists the ad is not misleading because his unit was deployed for 23 months, which included more than six months of training in Mississippi before departing to Iraq. "Anybody who's involved in the military or is a veteran doesn’t parse between the time spent here training or in Iraq," said campaign manager Andrew Mulvey. "It’s all one deployment." Col. Greg Hapgood, director of public affairs for the Iowa National Guard, declined to comment about Mowrer or the ad specifically. But he said there is a distinction between a "mobilization" or a "deployment," which includes time when soldiers are called up to active duty but may be training in the United States, and being "in country" with boots on the ground in a foreign combat zone. "I think from a technical sense, if an individual is going to talk about their service and to be honest about that service, you’d need to differentiate between the total mobilization time and the time that was spent whether in training here in the U.S. or actually once you left the U.S. and went overseas into combat theater," he said. "It is somewhat of a technicality, but if someone’s going to be honest about their service, that’s the correct way to characterize it." Mowrer enlisted in the National Guard in 2003 and served for six years. He was part of a unit that was mobilized and deployed in the fall of 2005 to fight terrorism in Iraq. According to a press release issued by the Iowa Army National Guard upon the unit’s return, the Iowans were mobilized in September and October of 2005 and were sent to Camp Shelby in Mississippi. After additional training, they were deployed to Iraq in March and April of 2006. While in Iraq, Mowrer served as an intelligence analyst with the "Ironman Battalion," which was tasked with convoy security on the western region of the Iraqi theater of operations. In January 2007, the U.S. Department of Defense announced an extension of that deployment from 12 months in Iraq to 16 months as part of the military's "surge." The unit, which was in fact the longest-deployed unit of the Iraq War according to a congressional resolution, returned to Iowa in July and August of 2007, and Mowrer ended his service honorably in 2009 without being redeployed. He returned to Iraq as a civilian analyst and adviser to the commander of U.S. forces later that year. According to military records, Mowrer was mobilized from October 2005 through August 2007 — almost 23 months. According to his discharge papers, he served one year, three months and 18 days of foreign service, or about 16 months. Our ruling The ad claims Mowrer served "for 23 months in Iraq, the war’s longest tour." It’s true that Mowrer’s unit was deployed for 23 months, the longest continuous deployment of the Iraq War. But the ad says Mowrer "served in Iraq for 23 months," which is not accurate. Mowrer served in Iraq for about 16 months. Being deployed, which can include training in the United States, is different from being "in country," with boots on the ground of a foreign nation. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08797	Rhode Island is "at the top of the country for alcohol-related fatalities."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/19/steve-archambault/archambault-says-rhode-island-top-country-alcohol-/	Law enforcement was one of the natural topics for Operation Clean Government's televised debate among the three Democratic candidates for attorney general. At one point, one of the three, Stephen Archambault, talked about his four-point plan "to correct the problems dealing with drunk driving," which calls for stiffer penalties for drivers with higher blood-alcohol levels or who are second offenders. The plan also proposes longer license suspensions, including a new type of suspension that would still allow offenders to drive to work. Then Archambault recalled seeing statistics suggesting that 4 out of 10 fatal accidents in Rhode Island involved alcohol. "We shouldn't be at the top of the country for alcohol-related fatalities," he said. But is Rhode Island really the worst in the country for DWI fatalities? We asked the Archambault campaign for the source of its numbers. They referred us to a 2009 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's National Center for Statistics and Analysis. It turns out that Rhode Island is not number one, but we're up there. For 2008, the latest year for which statistics are available, the state ranked 5th out of the 50 states when it came to motor vehicle fatalities in which a driver was at the legal limit of .08 or higher. Thirty-eight percent of our 69 driving fatalities that year involved someone who was drunk. That's very close to the 4 out of 10 cited by Archambault. Only Hawaii (39 percent), Montana (40 percent), Wyoming (42 percent) and North Dakota (46 percent) had a worse record. Apparently our ranking can bounce around. In 2007, Rhode Island was right at the national average of 32 percent, but that doesn't happen often. In 2005 we ranked 11th, and in 2006 we were 10th. But in 2003 and 2004, we were ranked first in the nation in the percentage of fatalities related to alcohol. Archambault isn't completely correct about our ranking, unless you go back several years. Yet it's clear he did give an accurate assessment of the scope of the problem. We'll give him a Mostly True.	None	Stephen Archambault	None	None	None	2010-08-19T00:01:00	2010-08-12	['None']
pomt-07743	"The cost for renovating the headquarters of the U.N. has doubled from the original estimate."	true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/28/cliff-stearns/rep-cliff-stearns-says-un-headquarters-remodeling-/	It's the place where heads of state have made the case for war and peace, and issues like world hunger and global warming have taken center stage. But the nearly 60-year-old United Nations Headquarters is also a place that in recent years has been plagued by structural issues like asbestos, leaky roofs and outdated electrical systems. A $1.9 billion renovation is now under way at the 18-acre site in New York City, financed by member countries, including the United States. But the project's price-tag has caught the ire of one Florida congressman. On Feb. 18, 2011, Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns, who represents portions of Alachua and Marion counties, proposed a budget amendment that would keep the U.S. from contributing money toward the project during the upcoming fiscal year. The cost for the renovations is being divvied up by the U.N.'s member countries -- with each country paying based on the percentage it pays for membership. For the U.S., that amounts to 22 percent, or roughly $377.7 million, according the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Stearns' amendment, which passed 231-191 on a largely party line vote, would eliminate this year's funding for the U.N. project -- $75.5 million. (Starting in 2007, the $377.7 figure was divided into five-year payments.) "The cost for renovating the headquarters of the U.N. has doubled from the original estimate, and my amendment prohibits taxpayer funds from being used in the design, renovation or construction of the headquarters," Stearns wrote in a press release touting the amendment. We decided to take a closer look at Stearns' claim. Have renovation costs on the 50-year-old headquarters doubled? First some background on the buildings and what has led to the current state of disrepair. Construction on the U.N. Headquarters started in 1949, along New York City's East River. By 1952, construction was completed on the four main buildings: the 39-story Secretariat building, the General Assembly, the Conference Building and the Library. However, as years passed, the different buildings started facing problems from sewage backups to leaky roofs. There were also safety concerns because the buildings were not equipped with a fire-sprinkler system. "The United Nations (U.N.) headquarters complex in New York City does not conform to current safety, fire and building codes or meet U.N. technology or security requirements, making it a potentially hazardous environment for visitors, employees and delegates," states an April 2008 report by the GAO. In 2002, the U.N.'s General Assembly approved a complete renovation of the headquarters dubbed the "Capital Master Plan." Under the plan, the historic buildings would be refurbished rather than completely replaced. In February 2003, the preliminary price-tag was set at $953 million, according to a timeline of the project found on the U.N.'s website. This is the base figure that Stearns cites when referring to the cost increase. In March 2004, President George W. Bush approved a $1.2 billion low-interest loan to the U.N. to finance the project, according to a press release from the United Nations. Fast forward to 2011. The cost projection now is $1.87 billion, according to this website for the Capital Master Plan. A variety of factors have been cited for the increase in price, including high turnover among those managing the project. "I have been frustrated by a number of factors, all working together, including the lack of clear support by many major stakeholders and difficulties of working within U.N. practices as it applies to a large building project," former project director Louis Frederick Reuter told the Washington Times in a May 4, 2006, interview. He quit after 10 months at the helm of the project. The project is now being overseen by New York architect Michael Adlerstein, who joined other U.N. officials for a ceremonial ground-breaking on May 5, 2008. Since then, more than 4,700 employees have been shuffled around to temporary offices being leased throughout New York City. The restoration is expected to be completed by 2013, according to the U.N's website. From an original price estimate of $953 million to a project now reaching close to $2 billion, Stearns is correct in noting the costs of the U.N. renovations have doubled. We rate this claim True.

pomt-13468	California’s Prop 55 "prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/sep/13/yes-55/yes-55-school-claim-graded-mostly-false/	Recent radio and TV ads claim California’s K-12 public schools face dire cuts if voters fail to approve Proposition 55, a measure on November’s ballot that would extend an income tax hike on wealthy residents. The ads by the Yes on 55 campaign paint a dark picture. They cite past spending cuts that led to thousands of teacher layoffs, eliminated art and music programs and increased class sizes a few years ago. California, the ads claim, doesn’t have to repeat history. "Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools simply by maintaining the current tax rates on the wealthiest Californians," says the Yes campaign’s "Can’t Go Back" TV ad. The claim about "$4 billion in new cuts to our schools" is made at the 0:17 minute mark in this video. We wondered whether the choice is that stark: Does California really face $4 billion in new school cuts if Prop 55 fails? Our research Before diving in, here’s some background on the temporary tax increase Prop 55 asks voters to extend. In 2012, California voters approved Prop 30, which was promoted as a temporary solution. That measure raised income tax rates on high-income residents and sales tax rates through 2018 to pay for schools. Supporters at the time described it as a way to stave off additional deep education cuts from the state’s financial crisis and Great Recession. Prop 55 asks voters to continue that higher income tax rate for 12 additional years, through 2030, but not the sales tax increase. It would apply to earnings more than $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for couples. If the measure fails, the higher income tax rate would phase out in 2018. Less money for schools? There’s no doubt the failure of Prop 55 would result in less money for public schools. The California Legislative Analyst’s Office projects Prop 55 would raise between $2 billion and $4.5 billion annually for K-12 schools and community colleges, depending on the economy. But even if Prop 55 fails, school funding would continue to increase through 2019-2020, according to Department of Finance figures. That’s in part because revenue from Prop 30 continues through the 2018-2019 fiscal year. It doesn’t run out right away. By 2019-2020, however, school costs would outpace total revenue by $4 billion, based on the end of Prop 30 and expected inflation, according to the state Department of Finance and an interview with Ana Matosantos, the department’s former director. Matosantos supports Prop 55 and spoke in favor of it at a recent public forum. "Costs will rise faster than funding," Matosantos said in the interview. "The big issue is inflation." Competing outlooks There could be even greater pressure on school funding under one financial outlook, Matosantos said. That's because the state projects a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for the 2019-2020 fiscal year. That deficit is cited in the state Department of Finance’s multi-year budget outlook, and would account for the rising costs of everything from prisons to debt payments to health care, she said. Source: California Department of Finance, General Fund Multi-Year Forecast, June 2016 There’s no specific law that would require the state to cut school spending to close these shortfalls. It could take money from other services. But more than likely, Matosantos said, schools would experience cuts. Not everyone sees a bleak financial forecast. The Legislative Analyst’s Office expects California will have a nearly $2 billion operating surplus in 2019-2020, the same year the state Department of Finance forecasts a $4 billion operating shortfall. Source: Legislative Analyst’s Office, Multiyear State Budget Outlook, May 2016 The Yes on 55 campaign "is using the figures that are convenient to them," said David Wolfe, legislative director for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. Wolfe spoke against Prop 55 at a recent forum. Steve Boilard, a Sacramento State University political analyst, expressed skepticism earlier this year over some Yes on 55 statements, including the campaign’s earlier claim in May that the measure’s failure could lead to $5 billion in cuts to schools. "Looking at the numbers, I can see how they come up with dollar amounts that they do," Boilard, who spent years crunching budget numbers for the state’s non-partisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, said in a Capital Public Radio article, at the time. "But I think it’s framed in a way that seems much more dire than it should otherwise be interpreted." A Sacramento Bee fact check recently rated the Yes on 55 claim as "iffy." It found "the ad’s warning of $4 billion in cuts if the measure does not pass relies on an optimistic assumption of how much money the tax will raise, as well as an overly simplistic characterization of school funding estimates. Our ruling The Yes on 55 campaign claimed in recent ads that "Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools." There would certainly be less money for schools if the tax extension fails. But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55’s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate. But they leave the impression that the measure’s failure will lead to deep school cuts much sooner. And that’s not the case. We rate the Yes on 55 claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-13789	"For decades, the state’s gas tax has been among the highest in the nation."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/20/scott-walker/walker-decades-states-gas-tax-has-been-among-highe/	Gov. Scott Walker has been adamant that he does not want to increase taxes to fund highway projects, unless cuts are made elsewhere in the state budget. Revenue from the tax has been stagnant in recent years and many road projects have been delayed due to financial woes.That led the state in November 2015 to approve $350 million in borrowing over two years. In a June 27, 2016, letter to Department of Transportation officials, Walker opposed raising gas taxes to fund infrastructure upgrades. Part of his reasoning was that Wisconsin residents already pay too much in taxes. "For decades, the state’s gas tax has been among the highest in the nation," Walker wrote. Let’s see if Walker is right. About gas taxes Gas taxes in the state help fund highway and roadway projects. Many frame the tax as a pay-for-use fee, meaning those who use the roads are shouldering the bulk of the cost of maintaining them. It’s an excise tax, which means the tax is paid when the purchase is made. The gas tax is included in the posted price at fuel stations. A gas tax was introduced in Wisconsin in 1925. At the time, the highway system was funded through license registrations and property taxes. The initial tax was two-cents per gallon and in 1931 increased to four cents. Beginning in 1985, legislators changed the system so the gas tax would be adjusted annually, based on the Consumer Price Index. The idea was for it to match inflation. At the time, the tax was 16.5 cents per gallon. In 2005, the legislature stopped the annual adjustment and the last increase to the tax was made in 2006. Now, the state taxes 30.9 cents on each gallon of gas. Among the highest in nation? As of the most recent report from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Wisconsin drivers are taxed 51.3 cents per gallon for all gas purchased. Of that, 30.9 cents per gallon goes toward the state and the rest goes to the federal government. In comparison, the national average for state taxes on gasoline sales is 21.9 cents per gallon -- about 9 cents lower than in Wisconsin. That places the state in seventh for highest gas taxes. The state with the highest gas taxes -- California -- tacks on 39.5 cents per gallon to gas prices. So, for the most recent year, Walker’s claim is on target. The state’s gas taxes are "among the highest in the nation." How about "for decades"? Walker’s team pointed us to gas tax numbers from the Federal Highway Administration.The government agency, part of the Transportation Department, compiles and shares information on state gas taxes. They cited six years in particular -- 1980, 1981, 1986, 1999, 2000, 2014. Year Tax rate (cents per gallon) Rank 1980 9 16 1981 13 8 1986 17.5 3 1999 25.4 5 2000 25.8 5 2014 30.9 7 For five of the years, Wisconsin was in the top eight. For three years, it broke into the top five. But we wondered if Walker’s team cherry picked those years, so we checked gas tax rates for all 50 states from 1980 to the present. After ranking 16th in 1980, Wisconsin gas tax rate has consistently been among the top 10 highest in the nation for more than 30 years. The state topped the ranking in 1988. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the state’s taxes ranked among the top five highest, ranking second in 2003 and 2004. Our rating In a letter to transportation officials, Walker wrote "For decades, the state’s gas tax has been among the highest in the nation." He backed up his claims with federal data showing Wisconsin has been among the top 10 states for the highest gas taxes in the nation for more than 30 years, even topping the chart in 1988. We rate the claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c12d85a-f410-4d64-b432-114ef175ba5d	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2016-07-20T05:00:00	2016-06-27	['None']
pomt-15315	The California governor "says yes to poisoning more children with mercury and aluminum" in vaccines.	false	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/17/jim-carrey/jim-carrey-misfires-vaccine-claim/	Georgia has the CDC in its backyard to talk up the importance of childhood immunizations, but the anti-vaccine movement gained some high-profile supporters in California with a new law there that requires all public school children receive vaccinations. Actors Selma Blair and Kirstie Alley blasted the law, which starting next year will no longer allow immunization exemptions based on a religious convictions or "personal belief" that vaccines might be harmful. (Exemptions remain for medical reasons and kids being homeschooled). Actor Jim Carrey was the most prolific of all in his attacks, unleashing a series of Tweets that called the CDC "corrupt" in the vaccine debate and blasted California Gov. Jerry Brown a "corporate fascist" for signing the bill into law. "California Gov says yes to poisoning more children with mercury and aluminum in manditory [sic] vaccines," Carrey posted on Twitter on June 30. Carrey, who dated anti-vaccine crusader and former Playmate and TV host Jenny McCarthy, continued his barrage on social media through Tuesday, several times to insist he was "pro-vaccine" but "anti-neurotoxin." The myth that "mercury" causes autism ranks up with the flat-earth as among the most debunked scientific theories in history. PolitiFact Georgia walked through that false debate earlier this year, ruling it a ridiculous Pants on Fire! But aluminum as a poison? We reached out to Carrey and his representatives several times, but never heard back about his source or explanation. The actor’s Twitter feed cites a book edited by environmental attorney Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that continues to posit the thimerosal-autism link, but it makes no mention of the aluminum claim. So, we brushed off chemical books – well, looked at some scientific encyclopedias online – to see if we could sort that part out. Aluminum in vaccines Aluminum is literally everywhere. It is the third most abundant element on earth and the single most abundant element in the earth’s crust. It sits on the Periodic Table of Elements with "other metals." But unlike boron, needed in trace amounts in humans, and Thallium, a highly toxic element, aluminum has no known biological function nor significant toxicity. As such, its function in vaccines is far different than thimerosal, or ethyl mercury. Thimerosal was added to multi-dose vaccines (but not live shots, such as the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella) to act as a preservative against bacterial infections. It could be removed by simply making vaccines single-vial doses, said Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, a professor of medicine and pediatrics at Emory University and the associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center. Aluminum salts or gels are added to vaccines as "adjuvants," enhancers that boost the immune system response of the shot. A 2011 report by two Canadian researchers raises questions about whether that boost is worth the potential risk. Dr. Lucija Tomljenovic and Dr. Christopher Shaw raise the possibility of overexposure to aluminum as potentially toxic and a cause of autoimmune disorders. "The widespread presence in the human environment may underlie a number of (central nervous system) disorders," their paper concludes. "The continued use of aluminum adjuvants in various vaccines for children, as well as the general public, may be of significant concern." It’s worth noting, though, that the paper is a theory, not a scientific study. Several scientific websites have debunked the conclusions, citing decades of research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Food and Drug Administration that show aluminum is safe, and necessary. "Aluminum is an essential component in boosting the immune responses," Orenstein said. "We have no scientific evidence there is damage. We do have scientific evidence that there are bad diseases that aluminum in vaccines can prevent: cancer with the Human Papillomavirus vaccine, Diphtheria with the DTaP vaccine, and so on." Toxicity? That said, there is such a thing as aluminum toxicity. Medical research shows it tends to occur in patients with significant kidney damage, or limited kidney function, who are also fed intravenously. In other words, there must be a specific spike in aluminum exposure – from the IV feeding – with simultaneous damage to one of the body’s essential trash collectors. That makes aluminum toxicity exceedingly rare – even as immunization rates have increased over time, said Dr. Paul Offit, a professor of pediatrics in the infectious diseases division at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Meanwhile, the CDC reports more than 2,200 alcohol poisoning deaths in the U.S. each year – an average of 6 such deaths every day. And water intoxication – a rare instance of overhydration that throws off the body’s sodium levels – killed a 10-week old Gwinnett County baby earlier this year. The key? To paraphrase the founder of toxicology, Paracelsus, the dose makes the poison. When it comes to aluminum, the FDA has concluded that a year-old baby given vaccines according to the recommended schedule will receive about 4.225 mg of the element over the course of a year. But remember that aluminum is in just about everything on earth, and the body can process it. A breast-fed child will typically ingest about 7 mg of aluminum in its first year, Offit said. For formula fed, it’s 38 mg. Soy formula, 117 milligrams. "It’s the most abundant metal on earth’s crust, so if you live on the earth’s crust, which everyone with the possible exception of Jim Carrey does, you are exposed to aluminum," Offit said. Ouch. But given the miniscule amounts of aluminum in question in vaccines, Offit raises the critical point about what makes something toxic. Our ruling Actor Jim Carrey called aluminum a poison and toxin. Like many other chemicals, it could be, in dosages and scenarios that are rare. There is no scientific evidence suggesting otherwise. In fact, the only debate stems from a theory, not research that contradicts decades of immunizations. Attaching scientific sounding terms like "neurotoxin" can lend a sheen of respectability or fear depending on the usage. Look at the willingness of people to sign a petition banning Dihydrogen Monoxide (you probably call it water). But the fact is, Carrey’s claim has no basis in fact and ignores several studies that contradict it. We rate the claim False.

pomt-00845	The IAEA, or the International Atomic Energy Agency, "last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/22/liz-cheney/liz-cheney-obama-iaea-iran-agreement/	As President Barack Obama’s administration moves forward with negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal, many are questioning if Iran can be trusted to comply. Iran, the United States and five other international powers intend to establish a framework agreement by the end of March for a long-term deal that curbs Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But verifying information about Iran’s nuclear program is a challenge at present, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, conservative pundit Liz Cheney said on Fox News Sunday March 22. "The IAEA last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations," said Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, referring to the question of verification. We weren’t able to get in touch with Cheney. But the IAEA pointed us to a February report regarding Iran’s implementation of the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty safeguards. The agency is in charge of inspecting Iran and other countries’ nuclear programs and answers to the United Nations. The IAEA found, in sum, that it could not affirm that Iran was fully complying with the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty because Iran did not provide enough information for the agency to clarify outstanding questions. "The Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities," the report said. In March 10 remarks to the IAEA Board of Governors, Director General Yukiya Amano elaborated on the report's findings. The IAEA is able to verify that while all of Iran’s declared nuclear material and activities are peaceful and in accordance with their safeguard agreements, they are not able to make the same assurances about undeclared material and activities. "The Agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile," the report said. Iran is expected to comply with the agency’s expectations because it is an IAEA member state, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Because Iran has in some cases stonewalled the IAEA -- preventing them from verifying whether Iran’s past and present nuclear programs are entirely peaceful -- the agency has felt for years that Iran has not "lived up to its obligations," Albright said. Iran has dodged IAEA questions about past work on nuclear weapons for at least three years, according to the New York Times. Specific outstanding issues the IAEA has with Iran include questions about a missile initiator system and neutron calculations. Iran’s IAEA envoy told Iranian media that the agency’s claims were baseless, according to Reuters. In addition, Iran has simply never accepted some of the United Nations resolutions that required them to suspend uranium enrichment and other activities, meaning they haven’t lived up to some of their other obligations, said Matthew Bunn, professor and nuclear weapons expert at Harvard University. A key distinction The IAEA’s February report is not related to the interim nuclear agreement (Joint Plan of Action) between the United States, Iran and the five other world powers reached in 2013. In December, PolitiFact found that the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. (Though Iran did take some actions that certainly cut near the boundaries of the terms of the agreement.) Additionally, PolitiFact found in November that the interim deal curtailed Iran’s ability to advance its nuclear program, for the first time in about a decade. The interim deal is fairly limited in scope and doesn’t as much address the problem of Iran not giving IAEA enough access to sites and information, Albright said. If the countries reach a nuclear deal in the coming weeks, it’s likely that it will involve Iran giving the IAEA unfettered access, he added. While Cheney’s statement is correct in terms of verifying information about undisclosed past activities, it ignores the context that Iran is complying with the latest agreement, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran and energy expert at the Brookings Institution. "By avoiding the specific dimension of the IAEA criticism, Cheney’s statement is somewhat misleading," Maloney said. Bunn agreed that the statement might "carry false implications" because many who hear Cheney’s claim are likely to think she is referring to the interim deal. Our ruling Cheney said, "The IAEA last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations." The IAEA published a report a month ago that said Iran wasn’t giving the agency the level of access and information required to verify that all nuclear activity in Iran is peaceful -- a violation of their obligations as signatories of the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty. That is separate and distinct from the interim Joint Plan of Action deal between the United States and Iran. The IAEA has found Iran is keeping up with its obligations in that regard.

pomt-01344	Says Mark Pryor "votes with Obama 93 percent of the time."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/22/tom-cotton/cotton-pryor-votes-obama-93-percent-time/	Tom Cotton says Mark Pryor votes in lockstep with President Barack Obama, but Pryor says he’s one of the most independent senators. Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton of Arkansas is challenging incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor, in a tight race that could decide which party controls the Senate. Like many other Republicans facing against incumbent Democrats, Cotton often attacks Pryor for voting in line with Obama’s policies more often than not. In the candidates’ first debate Oct. 13, Cotton said, "Sen. Pryor has said that President Obama doesn’t have a lot to offer rural America and states like Arkansas. I agree. I just don’t understand why he votes with him 93 percent of the time." Cotton has made this claim and ones like it a lot throughout the campaign, while Pryor has touted a supposedly independent record. National Journal’s 2013 congressional vote rankings landed Pryor right in the middle of the Senate, at 53rd most-liberal and 47th most-conservative. We decided to check out how often Pryor votes in line with Obama. We reached out to Cotton’s campaign, and they didn’t get back to us. But these statistics typically come from CQ Roll Call, which tracks congressional data. Since 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, CQ has calculated presidential support in congressional votes. In its vote studies, CQ editors select "presidential support votes," based on clear statements the president or his spokespersons make on particular votes. Members’ presidential support scores reflect how often they vote in agreement with the president’s position. Here’s Pryor’s presidential support rate since 2009, when Obama took office. Year Presidential support rate 2009 95 percent 2010 92 percent 2011 95 percent 2012 91 percent 2013 90 percent Pryor's votes have lined up with Obama's stated position on that vote between 90 and 95 percent of the time for the past five years. Cotton’s figure -- 93 percent -- is right smack in the middle. (The average is 92.6 percent.) So it’s pretty accurate. In 2013, Pryor supported the president the least among Senate Democrats, according to CQ. That year, Senate Democrats overall voted with Obama 96 percent of the time in 2013, which was the "highest level of support given to the commander in chief from either party in at least six decades," according to CQ. It’s reasonable to assume that this measurement would also indicate how a member of Congress votes with their party -- given the partisan environment. But this is not strictly the case. Here’s Pryor’s voting record in terms of how often he voted with the Democratic Party since 2009. Year Party support rate 2009 91 percent 2010 85 percent 2011 85 percent 2012 85 percent 2013 80 percent Although he has voted with Obama at least 90 percent of the time, Pryor has voted with the Democratic Party less often, particularly in the past year. For contrast, Cotton -- who has only been in office as a representative for one year -- voted with Obama just 12 percent of the time in 2013. He voted with the Republican Party 97 percent of the time. The CQ number is straight roll call votes, so it doesn’t count other ways a member of Congress might have acted against the president’s agenda, such as sponsoring legislation that never makes it to a vote. Pryor’s campaign pointed to his 2013 co-sponsorship of legislation that would have preserved future Social Security benefits -- Obama called for changes in his budget request. Obama’s proposal was seen as an olive branch to Republicans hoping for austerity measures. The campaign also noted that because CQ doesn’t weigh the votes, it might not reflect that Pryor voted against Obama on key legislation. They noted the Senate’s rejection of a gun control bill involving universal background checks, which Obama supported. Pryor was one of five Democrats to oppose the bill. Our ruling Cotton said Pryor "votes with Obama 93 percent of the time." Since Obama became president, Pryor has voted in line with the president’s positions between 90 and 95 percent of the time, with 92.6 percent -- basically 93 percent -- as the average, according to the best rating system at our disposal. Pryor doesn’t vote with the Democratic Party quite as often, though, and in 2013 his presidential support votes were lower than every other Senate Democrat. Cotton’s number is on target based on the data, but Pryor has also opposed Obama on a few key issues. We rate his claim Mostly True.

Kavanaugh said he drank beer in high school, but denied ever drinking to the point of blacking out. An image making the rounds on social media tries to disprove that point by showing a drunk Kavanaugh passed out from too much drinking. But the photo does not show Kavanaugh. "Never been passed/black out drunk, huh.... #kavanaugh," the caption on a Facebook image reads. The photo on the left shows a young man holding two beer bottles apparently passed out on a couch, with the year 1982 beneath it. The photo on the right shows Kavanaugh now, with 2018 written below it. The photo on the left is not actually Kavanaugh in 1982. It is a stock photo from Getty Images, found in their creative images bank. It is captioned "portrait of a young man asleep on the couch after drinking too much beer." Getty was only founded in 1995, and there is no indication that the photo was taken prior to that date. A search for photos of Kavanaugh in Getty Images yields no results prior to 1996, when Kavanaugh was an aide to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The photo has appeared in multiple health articles warning of the dangers of binge drinking. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-09785	"Under the Baucus bill ... federal funds would subsidize coverage of elective abortions."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/21/national-right-life-committee/national-right-life-committee-claims-under-Baucus-/	In his plan for health care reform, Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., hoped to eliminate abortion as a wedge issue. Good luck with that, senator. With an issue as contentious and complex as abortion, appeasing both sides is almost impossible. "This is a health care bill, not an abortion bill," Baucus said. "The attempt here is to find language that just maintains the status quo." The National Right to Life Committee is having none of it. In a sharply worded news release on Sept. 16, NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson said the Baucus bill "contains an array of proabortion mandates and federal subsidies for elective abortion." Legislators on both sides of the abortion issue are choosing their words carefully as they discuss the health care reform plans. We decided to look at two claims by Johnson that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric. In a separate item, we examine a claim from Johnson that the Baucus bill "contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion." The Baucus plan would, in fact, allow private companies participating in the exchange, as well as the co-op, to offer abortion services. And people in both those plans could see federal subsidies. We looked at this issue in some detail here and ruled the claim True. But in this item we delve into a second claim in Johnson's statement. Contrary to President Barack Obama's pledge before Congress on Sept. 9 that "no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions," Johnson said, under the Baucus bill, "federal funds would subsidize coverage of elective abortions." Some may say this Johnson statement is the same as the other one. If the government subsidizes people who are allowed to get plans that provide abortion coverage, then taxpayers are subsidizing abortion, right? It's not that simple, and we'll explain why. First let's look at some of the particulars of the Baucus plan as it relates to abortion. According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance). The Baucus plan explicitly states that no federal funds — whether through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — could be used to pay for abortions (again, unless the pregnancy is due to rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is in danger). Insurers participating in any state-based exchange that offers coverage for abortion "must segregate from any premium and cost-sharing credits an amount of each enrollee's private premium dollars that is determined to be sufficient to cover the provision of those services." The Health and Human Services secretary would also have to estimate, on an average actuarial basis, the cost of abortion coverage (not less than $1 per month). And any money used for abortions would have to come out of that pot of money. So the dollars would be technically segregated. And lastly, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not. But Johnson said that still "amounts to a surcharge specifically for elective abortions." The wording in the bill isn't entirely clear, but by our reading, the way it would work is that the government would provide health care subsidies of a certain amount whether an insurer covers abortion or not. So if an insurer wants to cover it, that additional cost would be on the insurer, who would presumably pass that cost on to the insured. And the insurers would have to keep a tab on the extra amount paid for abortion coverage and make sure that any money used for abortion comes strictly from premiums paid by its customers, not from federal subsidies. The bottom line is that people who choose plans that cover abortion would have to pay the added cost of such coverage. But according to Johnson, that's little more than a bookkeeping exercise. "Funds spent by federal agencies are, by law, federal funds," Johnson stated. "The claim that under these bills, a federal agency would use 'private funds' to subsidize abortions is absurd on its face — a political hoax." When this issue came up in a House version of the plan, we at PolitiFact ruled that an amendment from Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., seemed like a reasonable effort to segregate funds so that tax dollars would not go to directly fund abortions. We caught a lot of flak from people who argued the public option envisioned in the House plan, because it might include abortion and certainly would pay subsidies to some who bought into it, was tantamount to federal subsidies for abortion. In an article titled, "Does Health Care Cover Abortion or Not? Fact Checking the Fact Checkers," BeliefNet editor in chief Steven Waldman took us to task a bit for our black-and-white finding and concluded, "Some of this does not involve matters of 'fact' or 'truth' or 'lies' but rather subjective judgment calls, a land where ideologues don't function well but legislators must." In an article this week, Waldman wrote that Baucus may have solved the abortion riddle, largely because Baucus' plan does not include a public option, which left open the possibility that it would cover abortions. "There's a more nuanced debate about whether it would subsidize abortion directly, but Baucus short-circuits that debate by eliminating the public option entirely," Waldman wrote. Johnson highlights another part of the Baucus plan to bolster his case. The Baucus plan would provide $6 billion in federal seed money to cover startup costs and meet solvency requirements for the co-ops. Johnson argues there's no telling how co-ops might use this money, that there isn't any language to prohibit it from being used to fund abortions. We think the earlier language — that specifically prohibits federal funds to be used for abortion — covers that. And while we can see an argument that that $6 billion provides a benefit to co-ops that may have abortion coverage, we think it's a stretch to call that subsidizing abortions. "You get into some real gray areas," Waldman told us in a phone interview. In Waldman's estimation, the Baucus bill still allows for some indirect federal funding of abortion. "The only question is, is it indirect enough?" Waldman said. "Is it very indirect or very, very, very indirect subsidizing. And that's a legitimate question." Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: "Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward. "As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion." We agree with Johnson that federal dollars would be going to insurers that may provide abortion coverage — and this is some new territory for the federal government. And we see the argument about the bookkeeping shell game of segregating premiums from government funding so that abortion costs are not pulled from the pot of money kicked in by the government. But if the government isn't paying any more to an insurance company to pay for abortion coverage, it means that insurance companies that offer such coverage are. So essentially that cost will be passed on to the insured people who select plans that cover abortions. Perhaps a federal court would view this differently, but we think the court of common sense says that if someone claims abortion would be subsidized with federal funds, it suggests more federal tax dollars would pour into plans that cover abortion. But they won't. The added cost will be borne by the people who select plans that include abortion coverage. Those premiums will pay for abortions. We found Rep. John Boehner's claim that Democratic plans for health reform would provide federal subsidies for abortion False as it related to the Capps Amendment in a House version of health care reform, and we find it's even more of a stretch in Baucus' plan, which does not even include a public option. And so we rule this claim False.	None	National Right to Life Committee	None	None	None	2009-09-21T16:19:13	2009-09-16	['Max_Baucus']
pomt-14550	If the General Assembly does not address the state's structural deficit, "more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/feb/12/tom-wolf/if-lawmakers-dont-address-pas-deficit-would-23000-/	Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf used his 2016-17 budget proposal address on Feb. 9 to castigate Republican legislative leaders and introduce doomsday scenarios about what he says will happen if lawmakers don’t address a rising structural deficit. During his address, Wolf chided the legislature as an eight-month long impasse from the 2015-16 budget continues, saying that "if the General Assembly does not approve a responsible plan to solve this crisis," Pennsylvanians will begin to feel the consequences, teachers will be laid off and "more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools." We decided to put that statement to the test. If Pennsylvania doesn’t address its deficit in the 2016-17 budget, would 23,000 education professionals across the state really be "immediately" laid off? Wolf’s spokesman Jeff Sheridan said that figure is based on a projection by the Department of Education examining what would happen if $1 billion was cut from public education funding in Pennsylvania. The Wolf administration says that total mandated spending for 2016-17 -- including to pensions, corrections and human services -- is about $32.5 billion. Without raising personal income or sales taxes, advocated by many Republican legislators, total revenue for 2016-17 is estimated at $30.2 billion, leaving the state with a more-than-$2 billion structural deficit. Sheridan said this deficit would lead to a $1 billion cut to education. Department of Education spokeswoman Casey Smith said based on that funding cut, about 599 administrators, 8,749 classroom teachers and 12,988 support staff would be laid off. That adds up to 22,336 positions. These projections were derived from public school staffing changes that took place after federal stimulus dollars under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were not renewed by Congress. When Gov. Tom Corbett’s administration was crafting its 2011-12 budget, it opted not to replace the stimulus dollars with state funds. That left school districts dealing with about $1 billion in funding cuts statewide over the course of the next several years. Those districts addressed the cuts through a combination of staff reductions, cost-cutting measures and property tax increases. James Paul, a policy analyst with the Harrisburg-based Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank, disagreed with the Wolf administration’s assessment. Paul said the Wolf interpretation assumes the education system would bare the brunt of a projected shortfall if Wolf’s budget proposal isn’t adopted by the legislature. "That is something that is inherently difficult to predict," Paul said, "and it’s unwise to make sweeping claims about teacher layoffs. I think any type of projection like that is more of a political comment." Mark Price, an analyst with the progressive Harrisburg-based Keystone Research Center, also said it’s difficult to precisely estimate layoffs or other staff losses that would occur after another round of funding cuts to public education. "It seems highly likely that another round of cuts in state aid would be met with a combination of layoffs, property tax increases and program cuts," Price said in an email. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number employees in educational services in Pennsylvania did decrease by 23,000 under Corbett, but it wasn’t immediate and not all the job loss could be tied specifically to budget cuts. In January 2011, there were 313,300 employees statewide in educational services. By January 2013, that number dropped to 290,300. Though those 23,000 staff cuts made through both layoffs and attrition were made over two years, Sheridan said the administration believes future layoffs would happen "immediately" if large budget cuts occurred today "because districts are still suffering from the 2010-11 cuts." Our ruling During his fiery budget proposal address on Feb. 9, Wolf said Pennsylvania’s ongoing budget problem is based on math, saying that if the Republican-controlled legislature doesn’t address the state’s structural deficit, "more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools." Experts and analysts from organizations leaning toward both sides of the aisle say it’s difficult to precisely estimate how local school districts would address funding cuts. His administration said that’s based on cuts made after funding was slashed under former Gov. Tom Corbett. While the amount of educational service jobs in Pennsylvania did decrease by 23,000 positions by January 2013, those cuts took two years to play out and were not immediate, as Wolf’s administration said would happen this time around if the same cuts were to occur. We rule the claim Mostly False.	None	Tom Wolf	None	None	None	2016-02-12T08:28:47	2016-02-09	['Pennsylvania']
pomt-05818	Says "67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/20/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-claims-more-two-thirds-marriages-end/	Marriage ends in divorce sometimes. In fact, it happens two-thirds of the time, according to Senate President Stephen Sweeney. And if same-sex couples are allowed to wed in New Jersey, they would face the same marital woes heterosexual couples do, Sweeney (D-Gloucester) said in a Feb. 10 interview on WNYC’s "The Brian Lehrer Show." A caller asked Sweeney whether he has considered what would happen to the children of a gay or lesbian couple in a divorce. Sweeney said it’d be no different than when a man and a woman divorce. "You would go through the same process and a court would make a decision. You know, because sometimes courts do rule the father is the better parent than the mother. So, you know, each case is just like any divorce," Sweeney said. "And you know something, divorces will happen, absolutely, just like they happen for heterosexuals and probably, what's it, 67 percent of marriages now wind up in divorce." PolitiFact New Jersey found Sweeney’s claim is off. But as Skip Burzumato, assistant director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, put it: "divorce rates are such slippery statistics," which can vary dramatically depending on age, sex, race and education. Spokesmen for Sweeney did not respond to five e-mails and two phone calls requesting comment. Burzumato, who called the 67 percent figure an "odd number," said if Sweeney’s statistic was true for all marriages, "I think we would feel that and we would all know that. We would not see as many married people as we do." One measure of divorce rates is the number of divorces in a given year per 1,000 people. The United States had a divorce rate of 3.4 by that measure in 2009, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, an arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another approach cited more often is to estimate the likelihood a marriage will end in divorce. Generally, experts we spoke with and studies we consulted agreed that the likelihood of marriages ending in divorce fell somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent. "Estimates of divorce are around 45%. When you throw in a few percent of couples who separate but never get around to divorcing, the figure of 50% is close," Paul Amato, a professor of family sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University, wrote in an e-mail. "The probability of divorce is unlikely to rise further. In anything, it appears to be going down slightly." "I think there is some truth to the fact that half of marriages end in divorce," Casey Copen, an associate service fellow with the National Survey of Family Growth, said. But, she said, "it’s just so dependent on the population you’re looking at." For example, studies show couples with higher levels of education are less likely to divorce. Burzumato put the likelihood of marriages now ending in divorce slightly lower, between 35 percent and 45 percent, but said "it might be in the 50s, it’s hard to tell." "What we have found is that divorce rates are coming down," he said. "Cohabitation is on the rise. So those who do select marriage tend to be more committed." The U.S. Census Bureau reported similar findings. "As marriage rates have decreased and cohabitation has become more common, marriage has become more selective of adults who are better off socioeconomically and have more education, and divorce rates have leveled," a May 2011 report said. Our ruling In a radio interview, Sweeney said that 67 percent of marriages end in divorce. We found no data to support Sweeney’s claim and his office did not return multiple requests for clarification. The chance of a marriage ending in divorce varies depending on a number of factors, including education and race. But overall, experts told us and reports show the overall probability of marriages now ending in divorce falls between 40 percent and 50 percent. We rate the statement False.

pomt-13826	"Today, there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/mike-pence/mike-pence-offers-misleading-statistic-employment-/	At what was widely seen as a vice presidential tryout, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence warmed up a Donald Trump rally in his home state on July 12, 2016. Pence took the opportunity in the national spotlight to tout the health of his state’s economy, saying, "Today, there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana." With Pence potentially on the verge of becoming Trump’s running mate, we decided to take a closer look at what Pence said. We discovered that the statistic, as Pence stated it, is accurate — but close to meaningless. Pence has a point that more people in Indiana are working today than at any time in history -- 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s a chart showing BLS data for Indiana as far back as the database goes online: However, the historical peak Pence cites has more to do with long-term population growth than with the robustness of the economy. The more accurate way to look at a statement like this is to look at the percentage of people working, not the raw number. Otherwise, you could say that President Barack Obama at the depths of the Great Recession was presiding over a healthier job market than Ronald Reagan in his second term, because 25 percent more Americans were working at the nadir of the Great Recession. The difference was that the base U.S. population -- rather than job prospects -- grew substantially in the interim. As a general rule, "focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading," said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. So let’s take a look at what happens if you calculate the percentage of the Indiana population that is working. According to the Census Bureau’s 2015 population estimate — the most recent one available — Indiana has a population of about 6.48 million. So 47.3 percent of Indiana residents were working this year. By contrast, at the previous raw-number peak in Indiana employment -- May 2000 -- there were 3.02 million residents working. That year, the state had 6.08 million residents, so the percentage working was 49.7 percent. In other words, a bigger percentage of Indiana’s population was working in 2000 than in 2016. That throws some cold water on Pence’s assertion. These calculations use all Indiana residents as a baseline, regardless of age, but the same pattern holds if you just look at Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64, the prime working years. Currently, 75.4 percent of Indiana residents in that age range are working. In 2000, the comparable figure was 80.5 percent. So by this measure, too, Pence is wrong about 2016 representing a historical peak. Then there’s the more traditional measure of the health of the job market, the unemployment rate. This statistic uses as its baseline the number of people who are looking for a job, which makes it even more precise and in most cases more useful to economists. Indiana’s current rate of 5 percent is what experts would generally consider good, but it’s hardly a historical low for Indiana. For most of the time between 1993 and 2008, Indiana’s unemployment was right around 5 percent and often even lower. Here’s a chart going back to 1976: Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, noticed another pattern in the numbers. He used federal data to determine that even though the state’s working-age population grew by 311,000 between 2000 and 2015, the number of people actually working in the state increased by far less over that period -- only 45,400. That does not seem like an obvious sign of a strong employment trend. Our ruling Pence said, "Today, there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana." Literally, Pence has a point: More Indiana residents are employed now than at any time in the past. But it’s a data point with very little meaning, since, as any statistician will tell you, it doesn’t take into account the size of the state’s population. Looking instead at the percentage of Hoosiers working shows that the percentage was higher during the previous employment peak in 2000. And the widely used unemployment rate — which is even more precise because it is based on the number of residents who are actively looking for a job — has been lower than its current rate over long stretches of recent history. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/80743e4a-e197-4947-a658-9cf3ee81c876	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-07-14T17:32:44	2016-07-12	['Indiana']
pomt-13684	Says Donald Trump "proposes tax cuts, too -- $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2016/aug/01/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-trump-tax-cut-millionaires-/	Just days after revealing that he’d been through a deep vetting process as a choice for vice president -- but wasn’t picked -- Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown took the stage on the final day of the convention in Philadelphia. Brown, who insisted all along that his gig representing Ohio is satisfying enough, delivered a speech that drew contrasts between nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. "While Trump outsources jobs, Hillary Clinton has a real plan to bring jobs back to America – like a $10 billion ‘Made in America’ plan with tax credits to revitalize manufacturing," Brown said. "Trump proposes tax cuts, too – $3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his. Of course we can’t say for sure how much Trump will take for himself, because he’s refused to share his tax returns with the American People." It’s been widely reported that Trump’s tax plan generously favors the top one-percent of Americans. We asked Brown’s Senate office for his sources of the numbers "$3 trillion" and "$2 trillion." Trillions tend to sound exaggerated -- maybe because that many zeroes make our eyeballs swim. Rachel Petri, from Brown’s senate office, offered a piece from Citizens for Tax Justice to back up the claim about Trump’s planned corporate tax cuts. Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal think tank, plotted a hypothetical analysis of Trump’s proposal, if implemented in 2016. They found that the changes would equal $12 trillion less revenue collected in federal taxes over the next decade. "This includes $9.6 trillion in personal income tax cuts, $2 trillion in corporate income tax cuts, and the $300 billion cost of repealing estate and gift taxes," according to the report (emphasis ours). Petri said that the $3 trillion for millionaires figure comes from data from the Tax Policy Center, which was analyzed by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. That report estimates that the tax cuts going to millionaires would result in a loss of revenue collected by approximately $3.2 trillion over 10 years. Since both groups Brown pulled stats from are liberal-leaning, we looked for a report from a source that skews conservative. One such group, the Tax Foundation, reported a cost of $1.54 trillion for Trump’s corporate tax cuts over 10 years. Though that is off by half a trillion, rounding up would get it to Brown’s $2 trillion quote. The Tax Foundation estimates $10.2 trillion less revenue over a decade due to reduced individual tax rates. The top one-percent of earners would see 27 percent of the cut under the plan, which is about $2.75 trillion. (Correction Aug. 2, 2016: An earlier version of this fact-check had a different calculation.) Again, rounding up gets it to Brown’s $3 trillion under this analysis. Trump is no longer the presumptive Republican candidate, but this is a presumptive tax plan. In May, Trump tapped two all-stars of conservative fiscal policy to help with a revamp. As of yet, Trump Tax 2.0 is still pending. Our ruling Addressing the DNC, Brown said that Trump’s tax plan would cut "$3 trillion for millionaires like himself and $2 trillion for corporations like his."

pomt-13155	The "left" is blatantly attempting to disrupt Georgia’s elections.	false	/georgia/statements/2016/oct/29/brian-kemp/ga-election-official-base-election-interference/	With Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s talk of a rigged election and "large-scale" voter fraud, the rhetoric has trickled down to state offices. On Oct. 19, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the state’s election chief, tweeted, "Stand with me in opposition to the left’s blatant attempts to disrupt Georgia’s elections!" But how rampant is election interference in the state? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Stormy situation Following Hurricane Matthew, the issue of extending voter registration took hold in some Southern states where deadlines in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas loomed as state offices closed to prepare for the storm. In one Georgia lawsuit, the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union sought to extend the state’s deadline. In response to the lawsuit, Kemp, a Republican, tweeted Oct. 18: "The ACLU wants to create chaos in our local elections offices. Stand with me & protect Georgia’s elections." The numbers We reached out to Kemp’s office about the tweets regarding supposed interference from the left and to see how prevalent voter fraud is in Georgia. His spokeswoman, Candice Broce, sent us a spreadsheet with every election incident from July 2014 to September 2016. In it, there are 152 complaints ranging from felons attempting to vote to signatures being rejected. To be clear, voter fraud isn’t a generic term for any election shenanigan. Voter fraud refers to illegal interference in voting. It is rare and includes activities such as voter impersonation, vote buying and ballot stuffing. A recent poll by the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute showed many feel their vote may not be counted, though studies of voter fraud do not back this up. The spreadsheet Kemp’s office sent us includes names but no party affiliations. About one-third of the complaints say "dismissed." For some perspective, there are about 6 million registered voters in the state. About 1 million ballots have been cast so far in early and absentee voting for the 2016 general election. Broce said the office has received about 10 complaints in the past week or so. That equals to about 0.001 percent of votes receiving complaints. Election rolls Kemp’s office has previously been accused of poor practices. Three lawsuits have alleged his methods disenfranchise people. One of the suits claims the majority of the people blocked from the registry are minorities, who tend to vote Democrat. Georgia is traditionally a conservative state, or red state. Recent polls show Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a close race with Trump. A 2012 Pew Center study estimated about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the U.S. are no longer valid or are inaccurate. But no evidence of voter fraud was found — this is about poor record keeping. "Voter fraud is thankfully not widespread in the United States," said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who specializes in African-American politics and political participation. She said the issue comes down to ideologically different ways the two parties see voting. Democrats tend to favor policies such as same-day registration that open up the process. Republicans view it as a responsibility, something the individual should plan for and execute. Georgia requires voters to show a state-issued ID card when voting and additional proof of residence, such as a utility bill, upon registration. "If Kemp wants to say it’s a partisan issue to demand greater access, he must own the ways groups in power have resisted opening up the process," she said. In a recent editorial, Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute said the system’s flaws do not equate to election rigging. Shapiro asserts that "allegations of voter fraud have increased in parallel with our country’s political polarization during the (past) three presidencies." He also says voter-ID laws have little purpose, as most voter fraud is not done in person. Additionally, most secretaries of state are Republican. Issues On Thursday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a voting machine in Bryan County was removed after voters reported it changing votes. Voters who spoke to the AJC said the machine changed their votes from Clinton to Trump. Bryan County Election Supervisor Cindy Reynolds said the machine was removed. Merle King, the executive director of the state’s Center for Election Systems at Kennesaw State University, said the issue was likely related to the machine’s calibration. Kemp’s office is investigating the incident. Our ruling Brian Kemp, Georgia’s chief elections official, said in an Oct. 19 tweet that the "left" is trying to disrupt Georgia’s election process. When contacted, Kemp’s camp was unable to supply much evidence. The left-leaning ACLU did file suit, seeking to extend Georgia’s voter registration deadline due to Hurricane Matthew, but a judge refused a statewide extension. Georgia has a few reported cases of voting problems, but they do not amount to a left-wing conspiracy to disrupt the vote. We rate Kemp’s statement False.

pomt-10903	Says he made "a record investment in schools."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/03/scott-walker/scott-walkers-claim-record-state-spending-schools-/	Near the end of a TV ad that features an elementary school teacher from Racine, Gov. Scott Walker declares: "With a record investment in schools … we’re putting students first." The ad, released June 19, 2018, as part of Walker’s campaign to win a third term, has turned some heads. It’s a claim he essentially repeats on the official governor’s website. In the run-up to the Aug. 14, 2018, primary election, which pits eight candidates seeking the Democratic nomination, Walker’s spending on schools has been an issue. And it’s likely to be debated ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018, general election, as well. A record investment? That’s misleading. What does ‘record’ mean? In one of our latest fact checks, on a claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell, we reported that Walker’s first two-year state budget, for 2011-’13, cut state funding to schools by nearly $800 million. Since then, Walker has gradually put back more than $1 billion. But the initial cut certainly put him in the hole, in terms of achieving "record" school funding. And what does Walker -- who has a history of using different phrasing to claim exceptional funding -- mean by "record," anyway? Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. In the ad, as Walker begins to speak, words on the screen cite a February 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article for support. We found it’s a news article reporting that Walker’s state budget for 2017-’19 proposed $11.5 billion over the two years for schools — a new high, before accounting for inflation, which of course is crucial in comparing dollars over time. Walker’s campaign confirmed to us the $11.5 billion figure is what Walker relies on in making his "record investment" claim. That figure rings a (school) bell. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Prior fact check When Walker introduced his 2017-’19 budget in February 2017, he made a claim very similar to the one in the new TV ad, saying: "We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin." We rated that claim Mostly False. We found that the $11.5 billion is the largest two-year tally in state history -- in raw dollars, but not so when taking into account inflation, based on figures provided to us then by the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. The alliance, which has since merged to become part of the Wisconsin Policy Forum, did calculations for us dating back more than 25 years: State budget Inflation adjusted 2017-’19 (Walker) $11.6 billion 2015-’17 (Walker) $11 billion 2013-’15 (Walker) $10.8 billion 2011-’13 (Walker) $10.6 billion 2009-’11 $12 billion 2007-’09 $12.5 billion 2005-’07 $12.9 billion 2003-’05 $12.7 billion 2001-’03 $12.9 billion 1999-’01 $12.6 billion 1997-’99 $11.8 billion 1995-’97 $9.9 billion 1993-’95 $7.78 billion 1991-’93 $7.08 billion So, adjusting for inflation, the seven state budgets prior to Walker’s taking office spent more on schools than Walker’s current budget does. But, as we found in the earlier fact check, Walker’s statement has only an element of truth, when considering the funding without regard to inflation. His claim of a "record" suggests a new high mark in real terms. But with inflation, his current school funding is well below that of several other budgets. Our rating Walker says he made "a record investment in schools." He refers to the $11.5 billion being spent on kindergarten-through-12th grade schools in his 2017-’19 state budget. In raw dollars, that is a record in Wisconsin. But inflation, of course, is crucial in measuring dollars over time. On that score, seven state budgets spent more on schools than Walker’s current budget does. The governor’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, making it Mostly False.

pomt-10901	Say a "left wing extremist, chases down, rams car over Trump bumper sticker."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/03/blog-posting/was-massachusetts-man-targeted-hit-and-run-because/	A headline attracting clicks on social media said a Massachusetts hit-and-run victim was targeted by a "left wing extremist" because of a campaign bumper sticker for President Donald Trump on his car. "Chloe Wright — left wing extremist, chases down, rams car over Trump bumper sticker," said an Aug. 1 headline from the Pacific Pundit, a conservative blog. This headline was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Another left wing extremist loses their s--- over a Trump bumper sticker," the story said. "Chloe Wright a left wing extremist in Massachusetts got triggered over an SUV with a Trump bumper sticker." "The liberal loon Chloe Wright was so triggered, she chased down and rammed the car with the bumper sticker," the story continued, before quoting directly from a CBS Boston article. But CBS Boston, the Cape Cod Times and other credible local reports wrote their stories without the same type of loaded language. On June 30, a man contacted police in Barnstable, Mass., to report a hit-and-run. According to a police report cited by the Cape Cod Times, the man told responding officers he was stopped for a red light when Wright, the driver of the car behind him, started honking. The man told police that Wright trailed his car as he drove off and continued honking. At the next red light, he said she also started yelling. The man said he stepped into the road to inspect the back of his own vehicle for any problems, at which point Wright began yelling specifically about a campaign bumper sticker for Trump that he had positioned above a spare tire on his car’s rear window. "She said, ‘You voted for Trump?’" the man reportedly wrote in a statement. "I said yes. She called me a racist and several other names." The man began recording the incident, and Wright rolled her car in his direction. He said he retreated toward the opening of his driver’s side door just as Wright drove at him and struck the door with her car. CBS Boston reported that she came inches from hitting the man. Wright then sped off down the street, according to the man’s statement to police as cited in the police report. The man’s girlfriend, seated in the passenger seat throughout the incident, reportedly confirmed the man’s account of events. The man’s recording of the altercation shows Wright's gray Honda Civic collide with the open driver’s-side door. Wright pleaded not guilty July 30 to a charge of assault with a dangerous weapon and will return to court on Aug. 28 for a pretrial hearing. She also faces charges of vandalizing property and leaving the scene of property damage. By the victim’s account, Wright intentionally rammed her car into his at least in part because she was outraged over his bumper sticker. On the other hand, Wright's version of events has not yet been reported or vetted in court. Judging from what has already been reported, we cannot conclude with certainty that Wright is a "left wing extremist" or that she acted out solely because of the victim’s Trump bumper sticker. Until further details emerge in court, a more precise headline is needed to reflect what allegedly occurred. For example, the Cape Cod Times headline read, "Woman accused of hitting car in Hyannis after confrontation over Trump bumper sticker." Our ruling A headline from Pacific Pundit said a "left wing extremist, chases down, rams car over Trump bumper sticker." The details laid out in the story were mostly in line with what has been reported in other credible outlets. Until we hear more from the case, the story and headline should be more precise. We rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-08-03T11:11:29	2018-08-01	['None']
pomt-11397	Says 642,000 crimes were committed against Texans by criminal immigrants in a recent seven-year period.	false	/texas/statements/2018/mar/23/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-642000-crimes-committed-immigrants-il/	Four years ago, then-Gov. Rick Perry misrepresented state-posted numbers and inaccurately claimed that thousands of Texas murders had lately been committed by unauthorized immigrants. More recently, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity drew our attention when he dipped into the same pool of figures on his March 7, 2018 program, saying to a guest: "I went down to the border--I’ll give you facts--because I was on horseback, all-terrain vehicle, I was in helicopters, I was in boats and I sat through a security briefing in Texas with Rick Perry -- 642,000 crimes committed by illegal immigrants against Texans alone. "Here’s my question: Putting all those issues aside," Hannity said, "those that commit crimes in America, including some violent crimes, even murder, those criminal aliens, do you support having them removed from this country?" "Absolutely, I have no problem with that," news broadcaster Jorge Ramos replied. "I’m not here to defend real criminals." Hannity then showed a video clip from a July 2014 Texas presentation on 642,000 "criminal offenses" committed by "criminal immigrants" that Hannity saw alongside Perry during a visit to McAllen on the Texas-Mexico border. Hannity said next to Ramos: "Are you literally saying to me that they’re lying? Because they’re not." Hannity subsequently asked: "You sound like you don’t care about the Americans who are victims of crime. … You’re not answering my question; 642,000 crimes committed against Texans alone in a seven-year period; that’s not your family, Jorge. Where’s your sympathy for those victims of crime and why shouldn’t we take those that are committing crimes and get rid of them tomorrow?" Hannity closed the segment by asking Ramos to come to Texas for a program devoted to the 642,000 crime victims. We decided to fact-check Hannity’s claim that criminal immigrants committed 642,000 crimes against Texans in recent years. Hannity relies on 2014 presentation In the portion of the Texas presentation shown by Hannity, two state officials and Hannity face a slide headlined "Criminal Alien Offenses, October 2008 to July 2014," as an unidentified presenter says that more than 200,000 criminal immigrants are responsible for about 642,000 criminal offenses. Perry then tells Hannity: "That’s the cost of not securing the border." SOURCE: Excerpt from YouTube video showing Sean Hannity interview of Jorge Ramos, Hannity, Fox News Network, March 7, 2018 (3:30 mark) To our inquiry, Carly Shanahan, a Fox News spokeswoman, said by email that Hannity relied on the presentation for his claim. Shanahan provided this transcript of the excerpted presentation: UNIDENTIFIED MALE: "Criminal aliens have been responsible for about 642,000 offenses, criminal offenses. You look up there in the top left, sexual assaults, there's close to 8,000 victims." HANNITY: "Six hundred and forty-two thousand crimes since --" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: "In 2008." HANNITY: "In Texas alone?" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: "Yes." UNIDENTIFIED MALE: "Over 200,000 individuals with a criminal history, they committed over 642,000 crimes." UNIDENTIFIED MALE: "That's the cost of not securing the border." Fact-checking Perry in 2014 In gauging Hannity’s tally, it’s worth revisiting our 2014 fact-check of Perry. Perry, we found, had recapped arrests, not convictions, encompassing the lifetimes of individuals arrested over a recent period. Also, it looked to us like not all the arrested people were necessarily living here illegally. When we inquired into the figures aired by Perry, Tom Vinger of the Texas Department of Public Safety pointed us to an agency web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," that said: "From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults." We didn’t spot any breakout of convictions. Vinger told us generally that the agency didn’t have additional information. Criminologists commented A couple of outside criminologists who reviewed the DPS-posted information at our request told us the presented tally of charges--not convictions--did not support Perry’s attribution of homicides to immigrants. Michael Walker, an adjunct professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, said by phone that the DPS presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203,685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed. "Where did they offend--Texas? Oklahoma? Mississippi?" Walker said, his point being that such information wasn’t on the web page. Walker and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixed together recent charges with those that might have been leveled decades before. Checking afresh in 2018 So, what of Hannity’s statement attributing 642,000 crimes against Texans to immigrants over a recent period? After Hannity spoke, we reached out afresh to the DPS. By email, Vinger pointed us to an updated agency web page stating that some 245,000 "criminal aliens" booked into local Texas jails from June 2011 through February 2018 had together through their "criminal careers" been charged with more than 650,000 offenses. Those charges, the department says, resulted in more than 291,000 convictions "including 566 homicide convictions; 29,164 assault convictions; 9,060 burglary convictions; 38,287 drug convictions; 274 kidnapping convictions; 20,082 theft convictions; 24,451 obstructing police convictions; 2,202 robbery convictions; 3,244 sexual assault convictions; and 4,036 weapon convictions." Also, according to the agency’s post, some 66 percent of the convictions--over 193,000--were associated with individuals identified by their Homeland Security status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their latest arrest. Upshot: The DPS says that some 245,000 "criminal aliens" booked into Texas jails over 81 recent months had in their lifetimes accumulated 291,000-plus convictions with nearly 7 in 10 of the convictions tied to 193,000 individuals identified as living in the country without legal permission at their latest arrest. These tallies, we otherwise noticed, roll in many nonviolent offenses. An accompanying chart shows that 358,996 of the criminal-career charges (66 percent of them) and 159,951 of the convictions (55 percent) were for offenses other than the agency’s specific listed categories of homicide, assault, burglary, kidnapping, drug or weapons violations, sexual assault, robbery, obstructing police or theft. The web page doesn’t say what those other offenses are. Criminologists revisited We also circled back to the criminologists who helped us analyze Perry’s claim. Neither saw substance to Hannity’s claim attributing 642,000 crimes to criminal immigrants over recent years. Walker noted that the Texas chart cited by Hannity tallies "offenses," not "crimes." Offenses, Walker said, refer to misdeeds drawing no more than six months in jail meaning the 642,000 figure aired by Hannity conflates crimes and lesser offenses. A finer sort of the DPS-posted counts might deliver meaningful information, Walker suggested. As it is, he said by phone, the tallied "drug offenses could be for having a joint or trafficking heroin. Weapon offenses" could involve a knife or gun or other weapon. Walker added by email that the category titled "All Other Offenses" on the DPS chart could refer to "such low-level acts as being a runaway, public intoxication and minor drug use charges." Also, the inclusion of many lesser offenses might leave a misimpression, Walker said. "A person could conceivably be a lifetime serial shoplifter," Walker speculated, or repeatedly charged with vagrancy. By email, Martinez similarly advised that it’s hard to discern what the DPS figures mean without specific definitions of each listed crime category. Martinez said: "What is ‘obstructing police?’ ‘Weapons?’" Generally, he wrote, the DPS tallies reflect what’s known about most U.S. crime--a "sea of minor drug and property crimes." Our ruling Hannity told Ramos that 642,000 crimes were committed against Texans by criminal immigrants in a recent seven-year period. This claim misrepresents a 2014 state presentation indicating that more than 200,000 immigrants jailed in the state over a recent 69-month period had accumulated in their lifetimes 642,000 charges--not convictions. Not all the immigrants were living in the state illegally at the time of their latest arrest. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-00656	Due to "over-incarceration … in 1950, two out of three young black men were in the workforce. Today, it's one out of three black men are in the workforce."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/15/thomas-perez/labor-secretary-tom-perez-discusses-incarcerations/	When Baltimore erupted into riots after the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who had been taken into police custody, many politicians addressed deep-seated economic problems affecting some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe on May 7, 2015, co-host Mika Brzezinski asked U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez what could be done to increase economic opportunity and stability in low-income urban areas in Baltimore and the rest of the country. "First of all, the over-incarceration that you've talked about on this show so compellingly, you see it in Baltimore city," Perez said. "In 1950, two out of three young black men were in the workforce. Today, it's one out of three black men are in the workforce. The incarceration challenges -- there are so many people who lack a role model and they lack a bread-earner in their family. And so we spend a lot of time talking about how do we help people who are coming out of prisons to get those skills and jobs to compete." We were struck by the claim that "in 1950, two out of three young black men were in the workforce. Today, it's one out of three black men are in the workforce," and especially by how much had to do with "over-incarceration." When we looked through the data and talked to economists, we found that Perez had a reasonable point to make but that the numbers he cited glossed over some important complicating factors. Looking at Perez’s data When we checked with Perez’s office, a spokesman said his comment referred to data cited by Jason Furman, the chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers in a 2014 speech at the Brookings Institution. In that speech, Furman cited the employment-to-population ratio for black men ages 16-24 for both 1950 and the second quarter of 2014. The employment-to-population ratio, which economists call EPOP for short, is a rough measure of how common it is for a population to be working. In most cases, a higher EPOP is preferable to a lower one, because it indicates that more of the population is engaged in productive economic activity. According to Furman, in 1950, the EPOP for black men from that age group was 65 percent, which is close to the "two out of three" that Perez cited. In the second quarter of 2014, according to Furman, the rate had fallen to 37 percent, a little higher than the "one out of three" that Perez cited. So on the numbers, Perez was close. But we found some caveats that weaken the usefulness of those numbers for making his case. • This calculation ignores a great increase in educational opportunity for young black men. Remember how we said "in most cases" a higher EPOP is better than a lower one? Well, there are certain situations in which that’s not necessarily the case. Back in 1950, a large share of young black men faced Jim Crow policies and poor educational options, leaving them with little alternative but finding a job. This would tend to raise the EPOP for young black men, but for a reason we would consider negative. While educational opportunities for young black men today are far from perfect, they are nonetheless much improved. The data shows that in 1972, the oldest year available, 21 percent of black men were in college; by 2012, that had risen to 34 percent. And black high school dropout rates have fallen over the same period. If you were to start the statistical clock at 1950, the improvement might be even more dramatic. In other words, increased educational opportunity and attainment among young black men -- which is usually a positive development -- almost certainly accounts for part of the decline in EPOP. This "should mitigate our concern about the declining rates of young black men," said Gary Burtless, a Brookings economist. Burtless did emphasize, though, that it’s hard to know how much concern should be mitigated by the expansion in educational opportunity, since other, more negative trends -- such as incarceration -- have also likely contributed to the decline in employment among young black men. Indeed, Perez’s office noted that the decline in EPOP was twice as big among young black men as it was for another group that saw increasing enrollment -- young white men. • All of the data Perez cites actually excludes incarcerated individuals. For various technical reasons, federal labor-force statistics tend to look only at the "civilian, non-institutionalized population." For starters, this means that those employed in the military are excluded from the calculation -- not a trivial factor in this case, since blacks were underrepresented in the military between 1940 and 1973 but overrepresented in more recent years. The more important consequence of this methodology is that individuals who are incarcerated aren’t counted in the statistics Perez cited, even though his comment seemed to link "over-incarceration" with the statistical comparison. Perez’s office did note that the statistics do capture people who were previously incarcerated and are, as a result, put at a disadvantage once they re-enter society and the labor market. That’s correct, but once again, the picture is more nuanced on this point than Perez let on in his interview. Where Perez has a point At the same time, several economists told us that even if Perez used a questionable statistic in making his point, the point he was trying to make had merit. "In general, my impression is that Perez is pointing to a serious social problem, even if his statistics are a bit off or poorly defined," Burtless said. Since the 1950s, "young black men have been less likely to find and hold jobs, and one reason is that they are more likely to have become entangled with the criminal-justice system, making it harder for them to get job offers." In addition, he said, "the neighborhoods of a lot of black youth are often some distance from where there are plentiful job openings. Whatever the reasons, black male youths nowadays have fewer connections to the job market and more to the criminal justice system than was the case in the 1950s and early 1970s." Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, agreed that Perez had a point. "What he was saying was reasonable, even if he did not use the right statistic to back it up" Our ruling Perez said due to "over-incarceration … in 1950, two out of three young black men were in the workforce. Today, it's one out of three black men are in the workforce." Perez has a point that incarceration has made it harder for many young black men to find jobs. Perez’s problem was choosing a statistic that doesn’t precisely support his point. The decline in employment rates for young black men stems at least partially from improved educational opportunities -- which is generally a positive development -- and the data he offers specifically excludes currently incarcerated individuals. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Thomas Perez	None	None	None	2015-05-15T09:09:06	2015-05-07	['None']
pomt-05592	Says "for the duration of this recession not a single person in government middle management has lost (a) job or taken a pay cut."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/30/jeff-kruse/did-states-middle-managers-really-avoid-pay-cuts-a/	Public employee compensation is always a point of contention when it comes to Oregon’s political discourse. Even so, the recession has done a good job of amplifying the complaints of those who say that government workers haven’t suffered quite as much as those in the private sphere. Near the end of the February session, Sen. Jeff Kruse, R-Roseburg, sent out a newsletter to constituents. In it, he said that lawmakers had not done enough to curb costs during difficult economic times. To prove his point, he brought up middle management. "I am just frustrated by the fact the focus continues to be on government and not the people," he wrote. "For the duration of this recession not a single person in government middle management has lost their job or taken a pay cut." Certainly, the state has managed to stave off some pretty disastrous cuts to social services and the like, but we weren’t sure he was right that there were absolutely no middle managers who lost their jobs or took a pay cut. We called the senator to see if he had any proof to back up his claim. He said that when the Legislature looks through staffing figures, each position has a number attached to it. The government, he said, has so far not eliminated any of those numbers, so nobody has been laid off. We weren’t sure that held up, so we called the Department of Administrative Services, which oversees the day-to-day business of the state and its many bureaucracies. Right off the bat, spokeswoman Amy Velez pointed out that Kruse was wrong about pay cuts. "Managers were subject to furloughs -- everyone was subject to furloughs -- even before represented employees were," she said. After some data mining, she came back to us with a more comprehensive look at government cutbacks during the recession. Since March 1, 2009, Velez said, all step increases have been frozen. And from then until the end of June 2013, she added, managers with a salary of more than $3,101 a month will tally up nearly seven weeks worth of unpaid furlough days. All said, furloughs affected more than 5,000 management and executive service employees. That’s one strike for Kruse -- an unpaid furlough is effectively a pay cut. As for the no layoffs part, he appears to be off base there, too. Velez said that the number of executive branch employees has dropped by 714 between January 2011 and today. They weren’t all laid off due to budget cuts, of course -- the number represents retirements as well as voluntary and involuntary separations -- but some were. Velez couldn’t get us the breakdown for the entire state, but she sent us a list of 16 employees laid off at DAS alone since Jan. 1, 2011 -- at least two of whom were managers. The list does not include those who retired to avoid layoff or who bumped down to other state positions. The Department of Administrative Services is about as good as it gets, but we like corroborating sources. So, we turned to Sen. Richard Devlin, a Democrat from Tualatin and one of the co-chairs of the Legislature’s budget writing committee. We asked him whether Kruse was onto something with his explanation about numbered job positions not getting cut. His answer: no. "During the regular, long (2011) session, we eliminated a number of positions," Devlin said. "We took away the position authority and took away the money for them. "There have been some middle managers that were laid off" in addition to others, he said. And more recently, the Legislature has taken steps to reduce management overhead, Devlin said. The most recent step was this year’s House Bill 4131, a law that explicitly "requires layoffs or reclassifications of supervisory employees for the purpose of attaining" an employee-to-manager ratio of 11 to 1. Finally, just to cover all of our bases, we made additional calls to other parts of the government, including the Department of Human Services. There we spoke with Gene Evans. Off the top of his head, he recalled two management positions eliminated in June 2010. Evans also forwarded us a July 2010 e-mail from Bruce Goldberg, the man who oversaw DHS before a reorganization created the Health Authority. In the e-mail, Goldberg writes, "I also want to recognize the management service employees who received the news this week that they are being laid off as part of our workforce reduction." Karynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Health Authority, also confirmed her agency has seen managerial layoffs. We went back to Kruse as we gathered information to see if he had any additional comments. He said the furloughs didn’t count because employees were simultaneously getting benefit and cost-of-living adjustments. (We circled back with Velez on this point. It didn’t stand up to scrutiny. "I have verified with our Human Resource Services Division that 1.5 percent COLA increases were offset by the adoption of 5 percent employee contribution to healthcare premiums," Velez wrote to us in an e-mail.) As for the layoffs that Velez, Evans and Fish mentioned, Kruse didn’t believe them, sticking by his initial statement. Kruse told his constituents that "for the duration of this recession not a single person in government middle management has lost their job or taken a pay cut." That’s blatantly false, and yet he continues to stand by his newsletter. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Jeff Kruse	None	None	None	2012-03-30T16:51:45	2012-02-29	['None']
pomt-03628	"We have never gone a year in Virginia -- ever -- without passing a budget -- ever."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/may/06/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-virginia-legislature-has-never-fai/	Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli recently cited "a real world example" of how Virginia’s General Assembly functions better than Congress. State lawmakers always pass a budget while the U.S. Senate, until recently, went four years without approving a spending plan, he said during an April 18 speech at the Shad Planking in Waverly. "We have never gone a year in Virginia -- ever -- without passing a budget -- ever," Cuccinelli, the GOP nominee for governor, said. "Whatever we all may have disagreed on or agreed on, we passed that budget." We’ve never gone a year in Virginia without passing a budget -- ever? Virginia’s record may be good, but it’s not perfect. The Old Dominion works on a two-year budget cycle. During even years, a biennial spending plan is adopted. During odd years, the plan is adjusted to address changing needs and to conform to the ebb or flow of revenues because state law requires a balanced budget. In 2000, the General Assembly passed a two-year plan that complied with then-Gov. Jim Gilmore’s signature campaign pledge to phase out the personal property tax on cars. That year, 45 percent of the levy was eliminated. But in 2001, the nation was entering recession and the General Assembly split over Gilmore’s insistence that they proceed with the next step of phase out, which would have eliminated 70 percent of the car tax. The House approved the plan; the Senate refused, arguing that the state could not afford the step -- estimated to cost close to $400 million. The General Assembly adjourned late that February without a budget agreement. It held a special session in May and again did not come to accord. The impasse marked "the first time, the legislature couldn’t agree on a budget," according to a May 13, 2001 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The stalemate played into Gilmore’s hands. Under state law, he was allowed to cut spending to keep the two-year budget plan balanced, but he could not appropriate money for new programs. Gilmore, a Republican, sliced $421 million in spending and kept his car tax cut on schedule. Later that year, Democrat Mark Warner was elected governor with a stump speech that criticized the political climate in Richmond for being no better than Washington’s. And in 2002, the General Assembly capped car tax relief at $950 million a year, which was the cost of the 70 percent Gilmore phased out. Now, let’s return to Cuccinelli at the Shad Planking. After the speech, Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist Jeff Schapiro reminded him of the 2001 stalemate. "That was before I was in the (Virginia) senate," said Cuccinelli, who was elected to the General Assembly later that year. Cuccinelli’s campaign declined our invitation for additional comments. Our ruling "We have never gone a year in Virginia -- ever -- without passing a budget -- ever," Cuccinelli said. Never, that is, except in 2001.

pomt-09494	Bill McCollum "cost the rest of us billions" as a member of Congress, including a national debt that "skyrocketed" to $4.7 trillion.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-mccollum-cost-taxpayers-bill/	The 2010 Florida gubernatorial campaign intensified this week, as allies of Republican Bill McCollum and Democrat Alex Sink exchanged television ads designed to highlight aspects of their rival's record that voters might not be happy with. On Feb. 23, 2010, we analyzed an anti-Sink ad placed by the Republican Governors Association. We ruled that the ad -- focusing on her tenure as a highly compensated bank executive during a time of job losses at her company -- was Mostly True. Today we look at an anti-McCollum response ad aired by the Florida Democratic Party. The ad begins with footage of McCollum telling reporters, "I'm proud of my record of having been a congressman." A voice-over continues, "Really? Well, Bill McCollum, you cost the rest of us billions. He voted four times to raise his own pay. $51,000. Our tax money pays his congressional pension. Over $75,000 dollars a year. The national debt skyrocketed. $4.7 trillion. McCollum voted for debt-limit increases five times. Bill McCollum. Just another Washington politician Florida can't afford." We'll address the issues of congressional pay raises and pensions in a separate item. Here we'll tackle the debt questions. Let's start with the details. The ad says that "the national debt skyrocketed" to "$4.7 trillion." Accompanying material provided by the campaign explains that this is the amount that the national debt rose during McCollum's tenure in Congress. We checked historical debt figures from the Treasury Department and confirmed that during McCollum's tenure in Congress -- Jan. 3, 1981 to Jan. 3, 2001 -- the debt did indeed rise by $4.7 trillion. The ad also claims that McCollum voted for debt-limit increases on five occasions. Before we analyze this, let's start with a primer on debt-limit votes. Their purpose is to raise the legal limit on how much debt the federal government can take on. Such votes are taken periodically as debt approaches the old limit, and if such a vote were to fail to pass by the deadline, the federal government would default on some of its obligations, potentially causing a financial panic. But while the votes are important, politicians hate taking such votes because they remind voters of how large the federal debt is. When we looked at the five votes cited in the ad, we confirmed that McCollum voted yes in all cases. But we noticed that while this claim is technically true, three of these votes were taken on the same 1995 bill, and two were votes on the same 1996 bill. In these cases, multiple votes were required because the bill passed through the House in different versions before becoming law. When we raised this discrepancy with the Florida Democratic Party, the party came back with additional documentation of 11 votes -- taken in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1989, in addition to 1995 and 1996 -- in which McCollum voted to increase the debt limit. If all of these citations are accurate -- and we were unable to check them independently because the new votes were all taken before congressional roll call votes were posted on the Internet -- then the Florida Democratic Party's ad actually undercounted by about half the number of occasions in which McCollum voted to raise the debt limit. We asked the McCollum campaign whether it had any quibbles with the additional votes. Staffers said that by their tally, McCollum had indeed voted to the raise the debt limit on 17 occasions, but that he voted against raising the debt limit on 20 occasions. So, according to the McCollum campaign, he voted against debt limit increases more times than he voted for them. Still, as far as the ad's language goes, it appears to be correct that McCollum "voted for debt-limit increases" at least five times, even if he also voted against them on other occasions. What about the overall impression -- that McCollum "cost the rest of us billions"? When we asked the Florida Democratic Party what it meant by that phrase. A spokesman answered that it referred to votes like one footnoted in the ad, in which McCollum voted for a $600 billion debt-limit increase in 1996. But that raises some questions of its own. In that vote, the measure passed, 328-91 -- a broad, bipartisan victory. Even Democrats, then in the minority, voted for the bill by a 2-to-1 ratio -- including then-Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Fla., who now serves as chairwoman of the very same Florida Democratic Party that ran the attack ad against McCollum. Indeed, the McCollum camp notes that in the seven debt limit votes held between 1993 and 2000 -- the period when McCollum and Thurman served together in the House -- Thurman voted to raise the debt limit seven times while McCollum voted to support such bills four times. This leads to a larger point: It's not exactly fair to blame McCollum exclusively for all $4.7 trillion of accumulated debt during his tenure, especially given that he sometimes voted against the debt ceiling hikes. Using such a loose standard, the same blame could be laid at the feet of any House member who served during the same period as McCollum -- Republican or Democrat. All members of Congress vote on bills that "cost the rest of us billions." That is their job. Also, the statement doesn't address ways in which McCollum voted for policies intended to save taxpayer money, such as tax cuts. Ultimately, then, the ad is worded carefully enough to be accurate in its details, but it paints a more sinister picture of McCollum's actions than he probably deserves -- both given his votes against raising the debt limit and relative to the voting patterns by Democratic lawmakers during the same period. So we rate this claim Half True. UPDATE: This item uses updated numbers on the debt limit votes that were provided to us by the McCollumn campaign after this item was published. It does not affect our Truth-O-Meter ruling.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-02-24T19:47:04	2010-02-24	['United_States_Congress', 'Bill_McCollum']
pomt-03582	"Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/may/16/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-says-expanding-medicaid-would-dra/	The Florida House did the nation a solid by refusing to expand subsidized health insurance to 1 million low-income Floridians, argues Speaker Will Weatherford. Weatherford was instrumental in blocking a proposal favored by the Florida Senate and Gov. Rick Scott that would have used $51 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over 10 years to provide private health insurance to people below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2013, that is $15,865 for an individual and $32,499 for a family of four. People arguing in favor of Florida expanding Medicaid, one of the biggest facets of President Barack Obama’s health care law, argued it is paid for by taxes Floridians already sent to Washington. Weatherford tried to diffuse that, saying he could not support widening the program because more federal spending by an unreliable government will escalate the country’s debt woes. "Congress has not passed a budget in four years, and each year the federal government spends over a trillion dollars more than it has, leading to a national debt approaching $17 trillion," he wrote in a May 9 column. "Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit." Does the Medicaid expansion drastically raise the deficit? We wanted to check it out. The deficit is not the same thing as the debt. The deficit is how much the government spends in a year versus what it has on hand to pay what is owes. The debt, at $16.8 trillion and climbing, is the sum of annual deficits. Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy responded to our inquiry with a document that includes a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Christina Corieri, a health care policy analyst at the Goldwater Institute, a free-market research group that opposes the expansion of Medicaid. Her column does not say that expanding Medicaid as outlined in the health care law will drastically increase the deficit. Instead Corieri says the Supreme Court ruling presents fiscally conservative states with a "the unique opportunity to veto hundreds of billions of dollars in new federal spending." She said that the nearly 30 states that have either opted out or are considering it could save the government $609 billion over the next eight years. "The more than $609 billion in total savings from these 30 states would represent over 50 percent of the expected federal spending on the Medicaid expansion," she wrote. "A drop in the bucket? That's more than seven times the $85 billion in 2013 sequester cuts and more than half the projected federal deficit for this fiscal year." We sought our own answers, starting with the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office. CBO has not assessed our specific inquiry about how the Medicaid component of the law influences the deficit, but the office has evaluated the short- and long-term cost of the whole health care law a few times. In short, what CBO determined is the law as a whole reduces the deficit, and repealing the law would increase the deficit. That's because the includes a host of new taxes on high earners and the health care industry. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., requested the CBO perform a new analysis for the cost of repealing the health care law, but the CBO director said they essentially did not have time to do it, as "there are hundreds of provisions in the ACA and those provisions are already in various stages of implementation," CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote May 15. He referred Ryan to a July 2012 analysis completed for Speaker John Boehner for pretty much the same thing. On balance, the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated then that repealing the law would result "in a net increase in budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013–2022 period." "Although CBO and JCT have not updated that estimate to reflect the most recent baseline projections, we anticipate a similar result were we to do so," Elmendorf wrote. So basically what the government will pay out to subsidize health insurance for the uninsured, such as through tax credits to go on health exchanges or Medicaid, is more than offset by new revenues coming from reduced payments to Medicare providers and insurers as well as new taxes on high-income earners and the health care industry, said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. While Park considers the CBO estimate of the health care law key to our research, a couple other experts questioned its relevance and pointed out it relies on a lot of assumptions. Corieri, for instance, said CBO has not factored in how removing some unpopular taxes from the law, such as a tax on medical devices, would affect the law's fiscal impact. She also questioned CBO including time before the law takes effect in 2014 into its analysis. Overall, she agrees with Weatherford's point. "Obviously if they're not spending that money, then the deficit will be smaller," she said. Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, said CBO’s analysis does not factor in which specific states will expand coverage, so it’s impossible to know whether Texas and Florida were included in its post-Supreme Court analysis. The researchers assumed 70 percent of beneficiaries would be in states that opted to expand. "Any decision in isolation to expand or not expand Medicaid could result in higher or lower overall deficits than if the decision went the other way," he wrote by email. "The fact that the bill as a whole reduces the deficit doesn’t change that." "The best we can say is that expanding Medicaid will require borrowing more money than not expanding Medicaid," he said. The deficit, he added, will be modestly higher if a state elects to expand Medicaid. CBO assumes all laws will be enacted exactly as written, included the component that reduces Medicare cuts to physician payments, "which we all know never happens," said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. "What is clear is that some of Florida’s poorest uninsured people could have had Medicaid coverage at no direct cost to Florida for at least the first three years," she said, adding that Weatherford’s logic is "hanging on a theoretical and abstract principle." As for Weatherford’s statement, Goldwein says it’s accurate to say expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money "so long as you qualify that means more money than would otherwise be borrowed." Goldwein said it’s hard to assess the "expanding the deficit" part of Weatherford’s statement. "That really raises the question – compared to what?" Goldwein said. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, took a broader read of Weatherford’s claim, saying the health care law is too complicated to tease out the budgetary impacts of any one policy without noting the impacts elsewhere. "The speaker talked about it as if expanding Medicaid was the only policy change instead of being coupled with many others in a package that had net deficit reduction and wouldn’t require borrowing more money or expanding the deficit," Ellis said. Our ruling Weatherford defended his key role in blocking federal money to help insure more low-income Floridians by pointing to the effect of all that extra health care spending on the country’s national deficit and debt. "Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit," Weatherford said. There’s no doubting the federal Medicaid expansion is a lot of dough, with the government slating about $900 billion over 10 years for each state to expand the program, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Ramping up federal spending for Medicaid, one of the biggest long-term deficit-drivers, will not be cheap. Weatherford’s commentary, however, is vague. He ignores nonpartisan research showing the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage is offset by other parts of the health care law. And yes, states that decide not to expand Medicaid can prevent more federal spending, but it would just further reduce the deficit -- by how much is unknown -- on top of its already slated contraction. Saying Medicaid expansion will "drastically" enhance the deficit is unproven. Weatherford’s claim hits a note about federal spending but omits key information. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07236	The Medicare proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would "allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-ryan-medicare-plan-w/	On the May 29, 2011, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. -- recently named chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee -- criticized the proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to make significant changes to how Medicare works. Currently, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive "premium support" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money. The plans would be sold on an "exchange" -- a virtual marketplace -- and would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners. Medicare payments would rise but not at a rate that is expected to keep pace with the growth in medical costs. The Ryan plan was passed by the House in a near party-line vote, but it has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach. Wasserman Schultz hit this point hard in her Face the Nation interview. "Like I said, the Republicans have a plan to end the Medicare as we know it. …" she said. "They would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, ‘You know what? You’re on your own. Go and find private health insurance in … the health care insurance market. We’re going to throw you to the wolves and allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions. We’re going to give you X amount of dollars, and you figure it out.’ And these are people who have paid for their whole life into the system, are counting on that safety net." However, critics, including the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, argued that the Ryan plan doesn’t -- as Wasserman Schultz said -- "allow insurance companies to deny you coverage and drop you for pre-existing conditions." We decided to take a look. We’ll start by noting that the budget resolution is a non-binding proposal that has already died in the Senate. So any such plan can make promises -- like no barriers from pre-existing conditions -- without ensuring that those promises will be kept. That said, the language in the Ryan plan is clear: In 10 years, when the Ryan plan would kick in, anyone who is eligible for Medicare under today’s rules would be eligible to receive coverage under Ryan’s plan. Here’s the language from the budget that passed the House: "Health plans that chose to participate in the Medicare Exchange would agree to offer insurance to all Medicare beneficiaries — to avoid cherry-picking and ensure that Medicare’s sickest and highest-cost beneficiaries received coverage." The Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- took this promise at face value when it analyzed the plan. In its description of the plan, CBO wrote, "Beneficiaries of the premium support payments would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange. Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age. The premium support payments would go directly from the government to the plans that people selected." So the resolution itself and the CBO are in agreement: Under the Ryan plan, insurers participating in the revamped Medicare program would not be able to deny you insurance for pre-existing conditions. When we contacted Wasserman Schultz’s office, a spokesman, Hari Sevugan, said that Wasserman Schultz stands by what she said. As supporting evidence, he provided a link to a paper by Paul Van de Water, a health policy specialist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The paper analyzes a Medicare proposal put together by Ryan and Alice Rivlin, a Democrat who headed the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton. The proposal, released in November 2010, is similar in many ways to the Ryan budget proposal that passed the House. Van de Water (who did not respond to an inquiry for this story) wrote that under the Ryan-Rivlin proposal, "insurers would surely attempt to shun enrollees in poor health (who cost much more), as private plans do today in the Medicare Advantage program." We initially thought that the provisions outlined in the Ryan-Rivlin plan had been changed before the resolution went to the House floor. However, a look at the Ryan-Rivlin plan itself (a two-page outline) shows that the protections for pre-existing conditions are there, too -- in identical language. "Health plans which choose to participate in the Medicare Exchange must agree to offer insurance to all Medicare beneficiaries, thereby preventing cherry-picking and ensuring that Medicare’s sickest and highest cost beneficiaries receive coverage," the Rivlin-Ryan plan said. So it seems that Ryan has been consistent on the question of pre-existing conditions. Is there still a way to get around those protections? Possibly. "There are always ways for insurers to get around bans on pre-existing conditions -- put your office on the 8th floor of a building with no elevator, have no cancer specialists in your network," said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. But he added that the same criticism would apply to the health care law passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by Obama. "There's nothing uniquely structural to Ryan's proposal that would make it more subject to such evasion," Tanner said. Meanwhile, just because prospective beneficiaries couldn’t be barred due to pre-existing conditions doesn’t mean the Ryan plan would be a walk in the park for them. Linda J. Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the centrist to liberal Urban Institute, said that a plan that shifts a greater share of costs onto patients -- as the Ryan plan would likely do -- could hit patients with pre-existing, chronic conditions the hardest. "Big cost-sharing increases effectively shift more of the costs of providing care to those that use it most," she said. This would increase the pressure for insurers to cut back on expensive treatments, at least within the confines of the federal rules. Wasserman Schultz is free to criticize the Ryan plan on any number of grounds, but in her comment, she went too far. Both the budget plan that passed the House and its predecessor, Ryan-Rivlin, specifically noted that coverage could not be prevented by a pre-existing condition. It may be easier to say you’ll bar "cherry picking" patients than it is to put it into practice, but Ryan has made his intentions consistently clear. We rate her statement False.

pomt-06397	Says for every dollar the state spent on audits last year, it delivered $64 in cost savings.	true	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/29/kate-brown/kate-brown-says-state-getting-huge-return-audit-sp/	It’s always nice to know you’re getting a bang for your tax dollar -- and Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown wants you to know that you’re getting just that with her Audits Division. "In 2008, every dollar you gave in performance auditing, we were able to deliver about $8 in cost savings and efficiencies. With our Department of Revenue audit ... in 2010, for every dollar you gave, we've been able to deliver $64 in cost savings and efficiencies," Brown said during a speech at the Oregon Summit. "Now that’s a real return on your performance auditing investment." It sure is. Naturally, we couldn’t help but wonder if we were really getting such a good deal. As usual, we started by going to the source. The Secretary of State’s office sent us a spreadsheet that broke down the 2010 audits and the cost savings they identified. According to the spreadsheet, the office performed 11 audits last year. In seven of those, the state actually spent more on the audit than it found in potential savings. But the other four helped make up for those. The biggie was an audit of the Department of Revenue. In that audit, the Secretary of State’s office found 66,000 Oregonians who should have filed state income tax returns in 2007 but as of March 2009, had not. In total, they owed the state some $109 million. The office figures that if past collection rates on those who don’t file hold true, the state could get some $54 million. Then the office doubled that number. "We are showing this as one-time impact for the year we reviewed and as an on-going savings, since they would start paying taxes into the future," the office notes in the file. "This number substantially understates potential revenues from earlier tax years which we did not calculate or include which could be collected if (the Department of Revenue)followed our recommendations." Basically, an audit that cost the state less than $500,000 wound up yielding more than $100 million in possible cost savings -- and that’s a low estimate. All this, of course, assumes the Department of Revenue will do what the Secretary of State suggests. Gary Blackmer, the audits director, said he doesn’t have any reason to doubt they will. "We gave them phone numbers and addresses, it's not like they were just a theoretical number," he said. We called the Department of Revenue to see how the audit shook out on their end. Derrick Gasperini, a spokesman for the department, said the audit had prompted changes in the system. "As a result of the findings, we were able to make some changes in our practices," he said. But he said he couldn’t say one way or another whether the savings the Secretary of State’s office had predicted were actually realized. Overall, the Audits Division found some $150 million in savings last year and spent about $2.3 million to find those savings. Divide the former by the latter, and you get nearly $64 in savings for every dollar of auditing. Now, it should be noted that last year was a pretty stand-out year for the Audits Division in terms of returns -- the best, by far, of the past decade. The year before that, the division found $5 in savings for ever dollar spent. "For every dollar we spend on audits we shoot for $8 in savings," Blackmer said. The average for the past decade, however, appears to be closer to $18 in savings for every dollar spent. But back to the ruling statement. Brown said that for every dollar the Secretary of State spent on audits last year, it found $64 in cost savings. Her office has the figures to back this up, and, if anything, it seems like they might be underestimating the total potential savings. We’ll give this one a True.

pomt-11282	"Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian Police State"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/24/blog-posting/no-denzel-washington-didnt-praise-trump-averting-w/	A story on Facebook quotes actor Denzel Washington praising President Donald Trump and saying the United States dodged a bullet when Hillary Clinton lost, but the quotes are made up. "Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian police state," said a Feb. 24 headline on USA Liberty Press, a conservative website. The same claim appeared on Your News Wire, a frequent purveyor of fake news, Feb. 3. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Washington made these statements. The USA Liberty Press article included this alleged quote by Washington: "I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you’ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State." We searched for that quote in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Washington made that statement. The article doesn’t include any alleged quotes by Washington saying Trump avoided war with Russia. USA Liberty Press also repeated a fake quote by Washington praising Trump: "We need more and more jobs. Unemployment is way up here. He’s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world." In November 2016, we fact-checked the claim that Washington said that and found that the story plucked a quote from a March 5 New York Post article where Charles Evers, the brother of late civil rights activist Medgar Evers, discussed his endorsement of Trump. Articles circulating on the Internet have falsely attributed the quote to Washington. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. About a month later, when speaking before a screening of his new film Fences in Washington, D.C., in December 2016, Washington was asked whom he supported in the election. He quipped "Fences" but later said, "none of your business." A headline said that Denzel Washington said, "With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian police state." There is no evidence that the actor made that statement. We rate this headline Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-04-24T15:29:26	2018-02-24	['Russia']
pomt-15217	"If you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/10/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-emergency-room-visits-are-50-pe/	The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, may have been signed in 2010, but it continues to shape the 2016 Republican presidential campaign. Carly Fiorina -- fresh off what many commentators considered a strong debate performance on Aug. 6 -- discussed her opposition to the health care law in an interview with host Jake Tapper on CNN’s State of the Union. Tapper noted that Fiorina is a breast cancer survivor, "and we're all very grateful for that. Didn't your experience show you that the pre-existing condition part of Obamacare is crucial, that there are so many people out there like you, but without your means, who wouldn't be alive if it were not for the part of the law that says, insurance companies have to take on people with pre-existing conditions?" Fiorina responded, "I absolutely endorse that goal. I did at the time. But guess what? None of that has worked. Demonstrably, if you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent." A reader asked us to check whether this is correct, so we took a look. The Fiorina camp didn’t respond to inquiries. A look at a recent survey Reducing the influx of patients in emergency rooms was always a significant goal of the Affordable Care Act. Because hospitals by law cannot refuse emergency care, uninsured patients may be left with no option beyond the E.R. even to treat minor health issues. Yet this is an expensive solution for the health care system, since E.R. care costs much more than routine medical care dispensed by general practitioners. By increasing insurance coverage, the thinking went, patients would be steered toward providers who charge less than emergency rooms, saving money for insurers and, ultimately, for patients and taxpayers. So has it worked? The official statistics on emergency-room visits are published on an annual basis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the most recent report -- released in 2014 -- covers 2011, which was well before most elements of the health care law kicked in. So that data set is not helpful in judging the accuracy of Fiorina’s claim. Failing that, the best data we have comes from a survey conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians in March 2015. The most relevant question in that survey was: "Since January 1, 2014, when the requirement to have health coverage took effect in the Affordable Care Act, the volume of emergency patients in my emergency department has … increased greatly? increased slightly? remained the same? decreased slightly? decreased greatly?" Here’s the breakdown, based on the responses of 2,098 member physicians of the American College of Emergency Physicians: Response Percent of surveyed giving this response Increased greatly 28 percent Increased slightly 47 percent Remained the same 17 percent Decreased slightly 5 percent Decreased greatly 0 percent Not sure 3 percent The finding that only 5 percent of respondents saw any decrease in patients in their emergency room provides some validation for Fiorina’s claim. If this is a valid finding, then the health care law isn’t only failing at one of its main missions, but it’s actually making things quite a bit worse. But Fiorina seems to have garbled her talking point. Fiorina said emergency room visits "are up over 50 percent" -- not that a majority of emergency room doctors say they are seeing more patients come for treatment. In reality, the survey does not offer specifics on how many more visits there have been after implementation of the law. And a plurality of respondents suggest that the increases they’ve seen are "slight," which doesn’t sound like a word most people would use to describe a 50-percent increase. Another concern: The American College of Emergency Physicians, as the sponsor of a survey, is not a neutral party in the same way a media pollster is. Also, the survey is what is known as an "opt-in survey." Unlike a poll in which the survey company reaches out to a random selection of the desired population, the emergency physicians’ poll is one in which individual respondents have chosen whether or not to participate. Still, the point Fiorina raises is a concern among health-care policy specialists. The magazine Health Affairs noted in July that between 1992 and 2012 the number of patient visits to hospital emergency rooms has risen 47 percent -- from 91 million to 133 million -- even as the number of facilities serving them fell by 11 percent, from 5,035 to 4,460. Given this, 39 percent of E.R.s report daily overcrowding. Again, though, this data is from before the law fully went into effect. Such figures suggest a problem many years in the making, but there’s also concern that the Affordable Care Act specifically has made the problem worse. One theory is that insurance rates have increased faster than the number of doctors available to serve the newly insured patients. This may have led some newly insured patients to fall back on old habits and make the E.R. their first option even for non-emergency care. Our ruling Fiorina said, "If you look at the results of Obamacare, what you see is emergency room visits are up over 50 percent." Fiorina has raised a legitimate concern about the health care law, but the eye-popping statistic she cites is not supported either by official federal data or by a recent survey of members of the American College of Emergency Physicians. We rate her claim Mostly False.	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2015-08-10T17:13:35	2015-08-09	['None']
pomt-13734	"Human trafficking is the third-biggest criminal enterprise in the world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/amy-klobuchar/yes-human-trafficking-ranks-3-world-crime/	Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told delegates at the Democratic convention that Hillary Clinton showed compassion to the powerless across the world, especially victims of human trafficking. Klobuchar highlighted the enormous scope of the problem. "Human trafficking is the third-biggest criminal enterprise in the world," she said. We found that comparison intriguing and looked into it. We reached out to Klobuchar’s office and did not hear back. From our research, the claim is plausible, with a significant caveat: It’s always enormously hard to put a dollar figure to illegal activity. However, most estimates suggest that drug trafficking is larger than all other crime. Whether human trafficking falls second or third is a matter of debate, but the consensus view is that it ranks in the top three. Definitions matter when talking about trafficking. The Government Accountability Office wrote that "human trafficking involves the exploitation of a person typically through force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of forced labor, involuntary servitude or commercial sex." This can take a number of forms. Desperate people might go into debt to smugglers who place them in jobs. Their only option is to work off that debt on terms dictated by their employer. They might be sold by their parents and have no money to get back home. Or they might be tricked into prostitution and find themselves living in the shadows of an illicit enterprise. The International Labor Organization, an arm of the United Nations, estimated the profits associated with human trafficking reached about $150 billion in 2012. Of that, about $100 billion was tied to sexual exploitation. How does that compare to money from illegal drugs? The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime tackled that question in 2011. Their rough estimate was that drugs accounted for about a fifth of all criminal proceeds worldwide, or about $420 billion. The research group Global Financial Integrity assessed all forms of transnational crime in 2011. Its report said that "there is little doubt that, of all the illicit markets, the drug market is king." It leaned toward a total value of $320 billion, but gave a nod to another report that put the range between $45 billion and $280 billion. The issue is simply a lack of consistent or comprehensive data. That report also looked at profits from counterfeiting, whether that is fake Rolex watches or fake $100 bills. It cited a crude estimate from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of $250 billion. So where does that put human trafficking in the ranking? Without putting too much credence in the precision of any figure, human trafficking seems to come in third behind the drug trade and counterfeiting. A big red flag The International Labor Organization’s report is full of cautionary notes. "In the case of forced sexual exploitation, information ... is unavailable because of the nature of the work," it said. A key formula in the report’s model is based on data from just seven countries — India, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya and Uganda. It identified three kinds of human trafficking, including forced labor, forced sexual exploitation, and state imposed forced labor. But to apply that breakdown across Asia, Latin America, the industrialized nations, Africa, the Middle East and Central Europe, it wrote "in absence of more detailed information, this report assumes that the distribution of victims across the three forms ... is uniform across the regions." At the end of the day, assumptions fill in missing data right and left. So no one should take these figures to the bank, but Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, a human trafficking researcher at Arizona State University, said that doesn’t mean they have no value. "These are as good of an estimate as we know," Roe-Sepowitz said. "There are so many curves and complexities in estimating the cost of human trafficking globally I don't think we can create a better estimate." The same uncertainties apply to the estimated value of the drug and counterfeiting trade. Our ruling Klobuchar said that human trafficking is the third-biggest criminal enterprise in the world. A U.N. agency estimated the total value of human trafficking at $150 billion. The comparable estimates for the drug trade range from about $280 billion to $420 billion. There is one dicey estimate for counterfeiting of $250 billion. By those measures, human trafficking does rank third. However, all of these numbers hinge on sweeping assumptions and limited data. With that caveat in mind, we rank this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1efa653a-4ed5-4458-970d-b9a46fe7541f	None	Amy Klobuchar	None	None	None	2016-07-26T22:45:27	2016-07-26	['None']
pomt-05438	The average Atlanta resident "spends an extra $924 each year in additional gasoline and wasted time."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/27/citizens-transportation-mobility/how-costly-atlanta-gridlock-nearly-1000-person-gro/	So how much time and money do you lose being stuck in traffic each year? "The average Atlanta resident ... spends an extra $924 each year in additional gasoline and wasted time," Citizens for Transportation Mobility wrote in a flier that began to fill the mailboxes of many residents in mid-April. That’s about enough money to buy a fairly nice flat-screen television or two nights in the Deluxe Room at the St. Regis hotel in Buckhead or season tickets on the Terrace View level for the Atlanta Braves. There’s plenty to do with $924, but does it really cost us that much additional money each year when we’re tapping our brakes trying to get to and from work? PolitiFact Georgia went on the road in search for answers. Citizens for Transportation Mobility is hoping this statistic and other information the group has shared will encourage enough drivers to support a 1 percent sales tax to fund dozens of transportation projects it believes will improve traffic throughout the region. A voter referendum will be on the July 31 ballot. Citizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman Saba Long sent PolitiFact Georgia a report by the Texas Transportation Institute that it used as basis for the claim. Since 1982, the institute has released an annual Urban Mobility Report that examines traffic in hundreds of American cities and metropolitan areas. The 2011 report, which was released in September, showed the $924 estimate that Citizens for Transportation Mobility mentioned in the flier. The report relied on data compiled in 2010. The institute used a detailed formula that examined travel time during peak (rush) hours in Atlanta, how much gas was wasted and the amount of time lost while not at work or being late to the kids’ track meet. It used Consumer Price Index data to estimate the cost of time, $16.30 an hour per person, and $88.12 an hour for commercial motorists. The average number of people in each vehicle during peak period travel is 1.25, the institute calculated. The report on Atlanta said the average gas price in 2010 was $2.60 a gallon, with diesel fuel going for $2.88 a gallon. The estimates seemed reasonable. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed a half-dozen Atlanta Journal-Constitution articles written throughout 2010 that showed the average price for a gallon of regular gas in this area ranged from $2.53 to $2.83. The researchers concluded that the average Atlanta motorist spent 43 excess hours in traffic during those peak hours and wasted an additional 20 gallons of fuel. The report accounted for lighter traffic during holidays and came up with measurements for the average speed on interstate highways and widely traveled roads. The institute’s 2010 Atlanta figure was close to the 2009 total per commuter of $913 and the 2008 number of $938. Interestingly, the 2006 total per Atlanta commuter was $1,578 and fell dramatically to $1,066 in 2007. Institute researcher Tim Lomax said there was an error around that time due to "a redefinition of the urban area and population jumped a lot." The loudest criticism to the research has come from CEOs for Cities, which describes itself as a civic laboratory for today’s urban leaders. Its co-chairmen have included former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and prominent developer Charles Ratner. Economist Joe Cortright reviewed the 2010 Urban Mobility Report for CEOs for Cities and concluded the report used a flawed approach to come up with travel times and inaccurate speed volume models, and that it also has not corrected earlier overestimated traffic congestion and associated economic costs. Cortright’s criticism has been circulated by several transportation and urban research organizations. The institute put together a seven-page reply to the critique. It said it improved some of its methodology before the criticism was made. It said better fuel estimates were used for the 2011 report. It noted that estimates were used for its speed/volume models, but it countered that it is nearly impossible to track every vehicle trip made by a motorist. Some, like University of Connecticut civil and environmental engineering professor Norman Garrick, say the report doesn’t take into account other costs: such as health care and the environment. Garrick and others have created their own transportation index and determined the average Georgia household pays as much as 50 percent more to cover costs than people in states such as Massachusetts and New York. "The difference between Georgia and these more competitive states: less transit, more highways, and more sprawl," Garrick, who was in Switzerland, told us via email. There’s no criticism about the $924 estimate, but there are critiques about how the Texas Transportation Institute reached its conclusion. The TTI research is thorough. But it is based, in part, on estimates. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Citizens for Transportation Mobility	None	None	None	2012-04-27T06:00:00	2012-04-14	['None']
pomt-03117	"We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/19/nan-rich/nan-rich-rankings-education-funding-florida/	As he faces re-election next year, Republican Gov. Rick Scott says he wants to put money back in taxpayers’ pockets. He touts a property tax cut he got in 2011 (in reality, a smidgen), a pay hike for teachers in 2013 and now his proposal to cut $500 million in taxes or fees. Scott hasn’t released specifics on his next tax cuts, but his overall message is clear: He wants voters to see him as the guy in their corner saving them money. Former Democratic state Sen. Nan Rich who is running against Scott, calls his idea a re-election gimmick in light of Florida’s pressing needs -- including education. "We need to be taking a long hard look at funding the critical needs of the state," she said Sept. 11. "We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education." Rich said more funding for education would be a better way to help the middle class. Florida has often gotten a bad rap for education spending -- but just how bottom of the barrel are we? PolitiFact Florida examined the state’s K-12 education funding ranking in 2010, but we wanted to see if the numbers had changed and if Rich had done her homework. K-12 funding There are lots of different ways to compare funding for K-12 or higher education. How Florida ranks depends on many factors such as whether the cost-of-living in various states is taken into account. Some analyses focus on state money while others also factor in local dollars. Not surprisingly, depending on the methodology, we found different numbers for Florida’s ranking. But most were in the bottom of the pack. Rich directed us to the U.S. Census Bureau which shows Florida ranked 42nd in per-pupil funding at $10,031, taking into account federal, state and local sources, or 48th for state funding alone at $3,440 in 2011. Rich had cited that 48th figure. We found many other entities that provide state comparisons on education funding in a variety of ways including the National Education Association, Education Week and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. NCES, for example, shows that Florida spent $9,030 per pupil in 2011, ahead of 13 other states. (This chart combines funding so it’s not a measurement of only state spending.) Why the different ranking between the NCES report and the census report that Rich referenced? NCES includes charter schools, while the census generally doesn’t, said Mark Dixon, project manager for the annual survey of school system finances for the census. Higher education funding Rich didn’t direct us to a source of data for her claim about Florida ranking 50th in higher education. But much like K-12 funding comparisons, we found that different methodologies produced different rankings for Florida. The NEA ranked Florida 50th on per capita state and local government expenditures for higher education for the 2009-10 school year. The amount spent per capita was $485 -- just one buck lower than Nevada and ahead of the District of Columbia. We found more recent data through Grapevine, a longstanding annual report by Illinois State University. About half the states fund higher education in part through local funds, but the Grapevine report only shows state money. That report doesn’t provide rankings but compares the states per capita, which refers to the state’s overall population. That analysis shows Florida at $172.98 per capita. By our count, that placed Florida ahead of eight states in 2013. "I try to avoid rankings," said Jim Palmer, a professor and editor of Grapevine. "You’ve got 50 different state systems ... you have to wonder what the rankings really mean. If one state ranks lower than another does that mean the higher education system is not as good? I can’t make that judgment." We were surprised to find Florida gave more money per capita than Massachusetts and asked Palmer to elaborate. "The history of education in Massachusetts is not as reliant on the public sector as it has been in Florida. The private sector looms large in Massachusetts going back to Harvard. ... Florida devoted itself to developing a strong community college system -- stronger than New England." Palmer directed us to the State Higher Education Executive Officers, a group that publishes a report using Grapevine's state data along with other sources of funds, including local dollars and stimulus money. It also takes into account factors such as cost-of-living. That report showed Florida at $5,130 -- ahead of about 20 states. Our ruling Rich said, "We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education." There are lots of different valid ways to measure education funding. One way is to compare how much money a state provides for education per pupil, and by that measure Florida ranked 48th according to the Census. That’s a valid way to look at the numbers because it was in the context of Rich criticizing the governor who signs the state budget. However, it’s one of several ways to measure school spending. For higher education spending, the National Education Association ranked Florida 50th for state and local expenditures in 2009-10. But other more recent analysis we reviewed showed Florida higher than 50th. One measure showed Florida ahead of about 20 states. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08578	"Politician Reid Ribble wants to phase out Social Security, forcing Wisconsin seniors to fend for themselves."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/27/steve-kagen/us-rep-steve-kagen-says-opponent-reid-ribble-wants/	Like many contested congressional races, the future of Social Security is a key issue in the battle for the 8th District seat now held by two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, D-Wisconsin. In many races, the accusation is that a candidate wants to privatize Social Security. But does anyone want end it all together? Kagen says his opponent, Republican Reid Ribble, does. A new Kagen television ad opens with comical music, black-and-white newsreel-style footage and an announcer saying, "Some things are just bad ideas." The ad soon shifts to Social Security, with these words -- "Politician Reid Ribble hurting Wisconsin seniors" -- next to the requisite image of a white-haired grandmother. It then includes a video snippet of Ribble saying: "Somehow we have to establish a phase-out of the current Social Security system." The conclusion: "Tell Republican Reid Ribble to keep his hands off our Social Security." Social Security is a common election-year theme, and 2010 is no different. President Barack Obama has led Democratic attacks. PolitiFact’s national site rounds up more than two dozen Social Security-related claims, many of which it deemed dubious. In Wisconsin’s 7th U.S. House District, we rated a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee TV ad saying Republican Sean Duffy wanted to privatize Social Security as Pants on Fire. The DCCC also weighed in against Ribble, in part because the district -- covering the Fox Valley -- is a swing seat. In a news release, the DCCC uses language similar to Kagen, saying Ribble would "dismantle Social Security and take away the guaranteed retirement benefits" of seniors. So, what of Steve Kagen’s TV ad? We asked Kagen campaign spokeswoman Allison Jaslow to elaborate on the charge against Ribble, but she did not get back to us. PolitiFact Wisconsin also asked for an interview with Kagen, but he did not respond. That leaves us with the ad itself, which includes no footnotes or backup for the statement other than the video of Ribble himself. The footage of Ribble is from a campaign forum held Nov. 3, 2009 by the Fox Valley Initiative, a tea party group. Ribble did speak the 14 words in question -- and many more than that. The video actually cuts him off mid-sentence. Here is what Ribble actually said, based on a longer video of the same statement posted on YouTube. We’ll highlight where the new words pick up. "Somehow we have to establish a phase-out of the current Social Security system to a new system. And that will have to happen over time. It could happen in a single generation." Ribble goes on to discuss how the life expectancy of Americans has grown since Social Security was established in the 1930s, and its effect on the system. "It has to change," Ribble said of Social Security. "It will bankrupt this country if it doesn’t change." That’s a far cry from getting rid of Social Security. In an interview, Ribble said he favors a system of "personal accounts" that are linked to the individuals. "The government can’t take that money from you and give it to somebody else," he said. Ribble said he has been consistent in his statements about Social Security. "We’ve made promises to our seniors and we have to keep them." Ribble said he is "uncomfortable with privatization" but favors "personalization of the system but within Social Security." He said he did not have any "hard and fast numbers" about how this would be accomplished -- or how it would stabilize Social Security finances. Our search of the Internet could find no public statements by Ribble that contradict this statement. Though he survived a four-way primary, Ribble is a first-time candidate and has run a, well, lean campaign. His pre-primary campaign finance report showed about $71,000 on hand. That brings us to Kagen’s labeling of Ribble as a "politician." Ribble has never run for office before -- not even student council student, he joked. "I’ve been in the construction industry my entire life," said Ribble, who sold his family-owned commercial roofing business to a relative in December. Ribble is on the ballot and running now. But it’s the same situation Kagen -- an allergist by trade -- was in when he ran in 2006 and told voters he was not a politician. So, let’s recap what we know. To make his case that Reid Ribble wants to "phase out" Social Security, Kagen lifts a choice 14 words from a 2009 forum. Snipped out: The fact Ribble immediately goes on to say he is worried about the future of Social Security and believes the current system will need to be replaced or modified. Kagen’s statement splices and dices -- and leaves the truth on the cutting room floor. Strike another match. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-15039	Alabama’s Crimson Tide will be the underdog in Saturday’s game against the Georgia Bulldogs, the first time in 72 consecutive games that Alabama has not been favored by oddsmakers to win.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/01/espn/oddsmakers-barking-about-georgia-bulldogs-over-cri/	ESPN and other news outlets are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide likely will have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. Alabama hasn’t walked on the field as the underdog in 72 consecutive games -- not since the SEC Championship against Florida in 2009, ESPN reported. Even then, as five-point underdogs, the Crimson Tide rolled over the Gators, 32-13. The team went on to win the national championship and has been favored by the oddsmakers to win every game since then --- until now. It is the longest such streak in modern college history, according to ESPN college football insider Phil Steele. That’s quite a claim -- one that caused PolitiFact Georgia to decide to temporarily step out of its comfort zone, truth-squading politicians and newsmakers, and check. So when Nick Saban and the Alabama Crimson Tide roll into Sanford Stadium in Athens on Saturday, will they really be the underdog pick for the first time in 72 games? Or is that just more hype about the Bama-Bulldog rivalry? These two teams first met back in 1895 and have battled it out 66 times over the years, with Alabama coming out on top 37 times. Saturday’s game marks the first time the Crimson Tide has visited Athens since 2008, when Georgia trailed 31-0 at halftime before losing 41-30. Underdog status isn’t a subject to be broached with university officials in Alabama, Georgia, or any state for that matter. That’s because it’s based on whether a team is or isn’t a betting favorite with Vegas oddsmakers, and betting in any form is against NCAA regulations. On Thursday, UGA was a 2.5-point at William Hill’s Nevada sportsbook. David Purdum, who covers the gambling industry as a staff writer for ESPN Chalk, told PolitiFact how he did his calculations. Using one of several online college football preview magazines, Purdum looked at Alabama’s record against the spread since 2010 (36-34-1). The Tide’s streak as predicted game winner started with the national championship game against Texas in 2009, so adding that to the 71 games since 2010 is how Purdum, who also freelances as a high school sports reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, came up with the count of a record 72 games in a row. He also cross-checked the info with ESPN’s Stats & Information Department, he said. For this Saturday’s sellout game Between the Hedges in Athens, OddsShark.com had No. 8 ranked Georgia (4-0, 2-0 SEC) favored by a 2.5-point spread. And underdog status could still turn by kickoff on Saturday, depending on how the final betting goes. A win Saturday against No. 13 rated Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) would be a huge boost for the Bulldogs. A loss could mean another second-tier bowl season for University of Coach Mark Richt’s program. But atAt a press conference Tuesday, Georgia Head Coach Mark Richt wasn’t talking like Alabama is the game’s underdog. "They're as good or better than they've ever been, in my opinion," he said of Alabama. The Crimson Tide rarely finds itself in a must-win situation this early in the season. But a second straight conference loss would be devastating for the team's playoff chances, while a win would put Alabama right back on track with home dates in three of the team's next four games. Our ruling ESPN and others are reporting that the Alabama Crimson Tide will likely have rare underdog status Saturday against the Georgia Bulldogs in one of the most highly anticipated SEC contests of the year. That’s based on the fact that for 72 games in a row Alabama was favored in betting to win. And that wasn’t the case this week as bets started being placed for the game Saturday at Sanford Stadium. But since betting goes on down to the wire, there’s at least a possibility that the underdog status could change up to game time. That’s why they call it gambling. And given the unknown, we have to hedge a bit ourselves at this stage of the game. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-10372	"I've always said it's (offshore drilling) up to the states and I still say that."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/26/john-mccain/mccains-change-in-posture-not-position/	In an interview with the News-Leader in Springfield, Mo., on June 18, 2008, Sen. John McCain was asked about his recent push for offshore oil drilling. "You have changed your thoughts on that, am I correct?" "No," McCain said. "I've always said it's up to the states and I still say that." The interview came a day after McCain's headline-making speech in Houston in which he made a pitch for lifting a federal moratorium on offshore drilling. There are actually two issues in McCain's answer. The first is McCain's denial that he has changed his thoughts about offshore drilling. The second is whether, regardless of his opinion, he has consistently said it's up to the individual states to decide whether to drill off their coasts. Here's the rest of McCain's answer to the question: "But if the states want to drill offshore, and I hope they do. ... Gasoline prices have gone from a buck and a quarter to four dollars and it's even going to go higher, according to some. I think we have to explore all of the options that we have, and review them. "And I think offshore oil exploration and natural gas exploration is a good thing to do. But the states would still make the decision." Opponents have accused McCain of flip-flopping, saying that he was once a proponent of the federal moratorium on offshore drilling. But McCain's record is not so clear. About the closest we could come to finding an inconsistency in McCain's position was two newspaper articles from the presidential race in 1999 — one from the San Francisco Chronicle, the other from the Ventura County (Calif.) Star — in which the reporters paraphrase McCain's position as supporting the moratorium on offshore drilling. In 2000, the Associated Press listed McCain's position on offshore drilling as "Supports state wishes over federal fiat in oil drilling." Here's a sampling of McCain quotes about offshore drilling, starting with ones made when he ran for president in 2000. • "Ronald Reagan believed ... that states should have enormous input into the decisions that directly concern them. This directly concerns the people of California, this decision on offshore oil drilling. Now, off of this coast of Texas, I understand Texans want offshore oil drilling. That's fine with me. Off Florida, they don't. I think that we should allow these decisions, to some degree to be made —significant degree to be made by the people who are directly affected by them." McCain during an interview on ABC News's "This Week," Feb. 27, 2000. • "The leases for offshore oil drilling should never have been granted without allowing Californians a legitimate voice in the decisionmaking process. I believe it is up to the voters of California to determine the fate of these leases, and as president, I will respect the decision they make regarding the leases. The people of California deserve to be heard, without being forced to resort to legal action against their own government. As president, I will see to it that the interests of the people of California rise above the special interests of Washington." McCain to the Associated Press in March 2000. • "I wouldn't drill off the coast of Florida unless the people of Florida wanted to. And I wouldn't drill off the coast of California unless the people of California wanted to. And I wouldn't drill in the Grand Canyon unless the people in Arizona wanted to." McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Dearborn, Mich., Oct. 9, 2007. • "Look, I'm a federalist, and I believe the states should decide to enormous degrees what happens within those states, including off their coasts. The people of California have decided they don't want oil drilling off their coasts. The people of Louisiana have decided that they do." McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley, Ca., on Jan. 30, 2008. Here's what McCain said in Houston on June 17, 2008: "With gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians. We have proven oil reserves of at least 21-billion barrels in the United States. But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production. And I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use. "We can do this in ways that are consistent with sensible standards of environmental protection. And in states that choose to permit exploration, there must be an appropriate sharing of benefits between federal and state governments. But as a matter of fairness to the American people, and a matter of duty for our government, we must deal with the here and now, and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production." We should note one anomaly in McCain's position. Unlike many of his Republican counterparts in the Senate, McCain has long been opposed to drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even though most Alaska residents support it. In Houston, McCain explained why ANWR is a special case. "Quite rightly, I believe, we confer a special status on some areas of our country that are best left undisturbed," McCain said. "When America set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we called it a 'refuge' for a reason." As for McCain's voting record on offshore drilling, it's a bit mixed. In June 2003, McCain was among 10 Republicans who voted for an amendment proposed by Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham that would have called off a survey and inventory of possible offshore oil and natural gas deposits. It failed. In August, 2006, McCain voted in favor a bill that authorized drilling in about 8.3-million acres of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the coasts of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The bill, which passed handily, also established a 125-mile buffer until 2022 for energy development in Gulf waters off the Florida coast, and extended the moratorium on energy exploration and development in the Gulf from 2012 to 2022. As for ANWR, McCain voted yes on a 2006 procedural measure that protected legislation opening up the Arctic refuge; but he voted for an amendment to strike language that would have done the same in the previous year's budget resolution. Nowhere in those previously listed interviews or speeches prior to Houston does McCain actively advocate for states to institute offshore drilling. Nor does he talk about creating incentives to encourage them to do it, as he did in Houston. That's why the speech made for front-page headlines. Yes, McCain has long been in favor of letting states ultimately decide whether to drill, but he's now become a cheerleader for the cause. If it's not a change in position, it's at least a change in posture. But as the quotes also make clear, McCain — as he said — has consistently characterized offshore drilling as an issue that largely ought to be left up to individual states to determine. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-26T00:00:00	2008-06-18	['None']
pomt-14150	"After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country. ... It changed."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/may/02/john-kasich/yes-john-kasich-bragging-about-being-unpopular/	Gov. John Kasich has been repeating an odd talking point lately: He keeps saying how unpopular he was as governor. The Ohio leader and presidential candidate said it in a Republican debate on March 30. On April 24, he repeated it on CBS Face the Nation when host John Dickerson asked if he thought it was possible for a candidate to change negative perceptions about him. "After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country," Kasich said. "It takes a long time to change negatives. People have to see that you're actually being fruitful in your work. What happened with me is when people started getting work, and we started balancing budgets and reaching out to people, it changed." Is he right about being the least beloved state leader across the land after his first year in office? An August 2011 poll by Public Policy Polling said that with a 36 percent approval rating, he was the second or third least popular governor in the country. That was at least a few points better than in March 2011, when the same pollsters found Kasich’s approval ratings in the basement at 30 percent, and in May 2011 at 33 percent. Where was the love? In April 2011, his third month in office, Kasich made boatloads of enemies with a stroke of his pen. Kasich signed a massive union reform bill that prohibited forced union membership for state employees, mandated merit pay, outlawed strikes and limited collective bargaining rights for public employees. Unlike a similar reform bill in Wisconsin, Ohio’s SB 5 included police and firefighters. The political backlash was immediate, and a repeal effort quickly coalesced and reversed Kasich’s attempt at reform. Vying for the title of most unpopular governor in 2011 was Florida’s Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Public Policy Polling found that Kasich edged out Scott for most unfavorable governor in September 2011 with a 53 percent disapproval rating, compared to Scott’s 52 percent. But Kasich said he was (maybe) the country’s most unpopular governor after his first year. If he took office in January 2011, then we’d need to know his approval rating for the first few months of 2012. PolitiFact’s Louis Jacobson looked at the cast of rookie governors in February 2012, one year into their terms, for Governing magazine. Kasich made Jacobson’s list of the seven rookie governors who were struggling the most. Here they are, by approval rating: Jerry Brown (D-CA): 47 percent Rick Scott (R-FL): 43 percent Neil Abercrombie (D-HI): 39 percent Scott Walker (R-WI): 38 percent Nikki Haley (R-SC): 35 percent John Kasich (R-OH): 33 percent Lincoln Chafee (I -RI): 22 percent Based on these numbers, Kasich is the second-most unpopular governor after his first year. But Jacobson’s analysis only counted the 26 governors who took office at the start of 2011. Jacobson notes that approval ratings for governors aren’t exactly the holy grail of polling. He had to consult a handful of different polling groups for his comparison. Peter A. Brown, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, concurred. "Nobody’s done every governor in the country," he said. "There’s no reason to." He said Quinnipiac only polls from nine states. "What you can say is that it’s not possible to determine (whether Kasich was the least popular governor in the country)," Brown said. "But in a general sense, he’s probably right. He was certainly close to the bottom." Rob Nichols, Kasich’s presidential campaign spokesman who was also the spokesman for the governor’s office in 2011, told us, "Well yeah, we had just come from the election with $10 million in negative attack ads against us. So the last thing you saw was all this TV, trashing him." Nichols also gave us this anecdote: In August 2011, his official email inbox was bombarded with form letters that started out, "Dear Gov. Kasich staff member, I wanted Gov. Kasich to know that I voted for him in the Worst Governor Ever contest at www.worstgovernorever.com...." "I got so many that I had to get our IT people to route them to a special mailbox so they wouldn’t destroy my inbox," Nichols said. Ohioans started to warm to Kasich after the turbulent first year. Later in 2012, his rating bumped up to the 40s, and was up to 53 percent approval in 2013. Quinnipiac University had Kasich polling at 62 percent favorability in October 2015. Our ruling Kasich said, "After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country." At its lowest, in March 2011, his favorability among the Ohioans who had just elected him was an abysmal 30 percent. That was bad enough to crown Kasich as the least-popular governor in America for a brief period.

pomt-06545	Says "New Jersey's unemployment is significantly lower than it was when I got here. And we've created 50,000 new private sector jobs in the last 20 months after having lost 117,000 in the year before I got here."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-talks-job-growth-new-jersey/	Even before Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday announced -- once again -- that he would not run for president, his conservative credentials and record in New Jersey had come under attack by members of each party. Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said Christie was too liberal, and Democratic Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley blamed Christie for high unemployment in the Garden State. When the governor announced his decision to stay put in New Jersey, a reporter asked how much the criticism played into his decision. "None. None. Because New Jersey's unemployment is significantly lower than it was when I got here," Christie said in a nationally televised news conference on Tuesday. "And we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs in the last 20 months after having lost 117,000 in the year before I got here." The governor is sticking around New Jersey -- "whether you like it or not," as he said -- so PolitiFact New Jersey decided to see if the man in charge of Trenton has his facts straight. We found that his numbers are accurate, but as in previous cases, he may be taking too much credit. First, let’s review the unemployment changes. When Christie took office in January 2010, New Jersey’s unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent and there were 441,223 unemployed individuals, according to federal labor statistics. As of August 2011, the most recent data available, the state’s unemployment rate was 9.4 percent with 421,676 unemployed people. That means the unemployment rate dropped by 0.4 percent and the number of unemployed individuals fell by 19,547. However, Christie said unemployment was "significantly lower." New Jersey’s unemployment rate is moving in the right direction, but to be considered statistically significant, an over-the-year change in the state’s unemployment rate would have to be 0.9 percent, according to Sandra Mason, chief of the division of Local Area Unemployment Statistics at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey’s unemployment rate is lower, but not statistically significant. Now, let’s talk about that private-sector job growth. From February 2010 to August 2011, the state added 45,300 private-sector jobs. So the governor’s numbers are largely accurate -- but Christie can’t take all the credit for private-sector job growth. In a previous ruling on a Christie statement about private-sector job creation, we spoke to several experts who said growth in that sector is the result of a variety of factors and can’t be attributed specifically to any governor. We rated the statement Half True. Kim Rueben, director of the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said in an Aug. 17 email that "it isn’t clear a specific governor can take a lot of credit for the new jobs. I think governors and state governments can change the climate but in general there has been little research showing specific programs (or economic development credits) have actually led to job creation." Christie also said the job growth in his administration came after New Jersey lost 117,000 private-sector jobs the year before he took office. If you look at labor statistics from December 2008 to December 2009, Christie is dead on: the state lost 117,700 private-sector jobs. From January 2009 to January 2010, 105,000 private-sector jobs were eliminated. Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca told us the three measures cited above -- the reduction in the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons, and the increase in private-sector jobs -- all tell the same story. "The data from both surveys point to improving labor market conditions," Seneca said. "It’s a good start." Our ruling Christie said, "New Jersey's unemployment is significantly lower than it was when I got here. And we've created 50,000 new private-sector jobs in the last 20 months after having lost 117,000 in the year before I got here." His statistics on private-sector job growth are accurate, and the unemployment rate is lower. But the unemployment decline is not statistically significant. And as we’ve said in the past, Christie can’t take all the credit for job growth in the Garden State. We rate his statement Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02454	A YouGov.com poll shows 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for him.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/25/blog-posting/do-71-percent-obama-voters-regret-voting-him-2012-/	For President Barack Obama’s opponents, word of his latest downfall was stunning and welcome. Headlines and tweets all said just about the same eyebrow-raising thing: "Poll: 71% of Obama supporters 'regret' voting for his reelection." (Those all link to different websites.) The purported statistic from a YouGov.com poll was the focus of a Washington Examiner post last week that spread quickly through conservative blogs, social media, radio and online forums. Tweets about the news by big guns like Fox & Friends and various accounts with smaller reach were hard to miss. But the news is wrong. PunditFact will explain why. The origins of the claim YouGov.com did not even mention the news about regretful Obama voters in its Feb. 17 writeup of a new poll. The story that accompanied the poll, headlined "Mitt Romney’s phantom campaign," explored whether Romney is viewed more favorably ahead of the 2016 presidential election given more positive media buzz about a Netflix documentary about him. (The answer, based on their polling data, is not really.) YouGov polled about 1,000 voters over two days in early February, asking voters of Romney and Obama if they would make the same decision today that they did in November 2012. YouGov found 90 percent of Romney voters would vote for Romney again, while 79 percent of Obama voters said they would stick with Obama. Of the remaining 2012 Obama voters, 10 percent said they would not vote for him again, and 11 percent said they were unsure. The 10 percent who would not vote for him again got a follow-up question: Do you regret voting for Obama? Of 35 people in that group, 25 said yes. That's 71 percent. So of the people who voted for Obama, 396, 6 percent said they had regrets. In the eyes of YouGov assistant editor William Jordan, this was not worth mentioning in the original write-up. "We did not think it surprising that the small number of voters who said they would no longer voted for Obama now regretted voting for him," he said. Breaking free from the facts This is where things get messy. The next day, Washington Examiner columnist Paul Bedard published a story (since updated) that picked up on the people who said they regret voting for Obama. Bedard wrote that 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for his re-election. "Over seven in 10 Obama voters, and 55 percent of Democrats, regret voting for President Obama’s reelection in 2012, according to a new Economist/YouGov.com poll," he wrote. (The Economist has collaborated with YouGov in past polls, but not this one.) Those words sprung to life, appearing on news aggregator Drudge Report, spreading across Twitter, and landing on sites like TeaParty.org and World Net Daily. It seeped into partisan radio broadcasts, including on Rush Limbaugh’s show, and even a down-the-middle San Diego morning TV show. Conservative blog Hot Air was the exception. It urged its readers to ignore stories about the 71 percent statistic. Why? YouGov, while correctly reporting its sample sizes and percentages in its tables, left off an important disclaimer in describing who got question. No one realized it until someone asked about it the day after posting the results. The description about the "regrets" question should have said, "Asked of those who reported voting for Barack Obama in 2012 but would not vote for him if the election was held again." Instead it said, "Asked of those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012." That language suggests a sample size of 396 voters, not 35. "The 71 percent who regretted voting for Obama, which was picked up by various media outlets, is of the 3.5 percent (35 of 999 respondents) of the sample who said they voted for Obama in 2012 and would not vote for him today," Jordan said. YouGov fixed its truncated filter. Bedard, at the Examiner, rewrote parts of his story and changed the headline to, "Poll: Only 79% of Obama voters would vote for him again." But there’s no recall button for bad information on the Web. This one spread like a bad chain email. Our ruling Reports on blogs, television, radio and Twitter said a YouGov.com poll showed 71 percent of Obama voters regret voting for him. The number is wildly high, based on incomplete wording in a poll report and a less-than-perfect reading of that report by news organizations. Surveys require a great deal of attention from pollsters and reporters alike, especially ones with political overtones, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. As the sample size shrinks, the margin of error rate expands. Point being, while the overall YouGov poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, the question about regret would have a much higher margin of error. "You’ve got to be really careful when you’re looking at subsamples of subsamples of subsamples," Bowman said. In this case, that didn’t happen. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09592	The Democrats' health care bills would provide "free health care for illegal immigrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-health-care-bills-congress-wou/	It's hard to say when a chain e-mail has reached critical mass. Although we'd seen one from former attorney Michael Connelly floating around for months, we never weighed in on it. The chief claim in the e-mail is that the Democrats' health care plan is unconstitutional, which is a matter of opinion, not fact. Also, we'd dealt with many of the other issues raised in the e-mail. And it's an e-mail that was penned in August. The thing is, we are still getting lots of readers sending it to us, asking us to fact-check it. It's clearly still in high circulation. We've decided that critical mass has been reached. And so we're revisiting several claims in the e-mail. In this item, we will address the claim that HR 3200, "The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009," would provide "free health care for illegal immigrants." It's hardly a new charge. You may recall U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., famously yelling "You lie!" during a joint session of Congress when President Barack Obama said the reforms Democrats were proposing would not apply to those who are in the United States illegally. In an item we wrote then, we noted that, in fact, the House bill specifically stated that "undocumented aliens" would not be eligible for credits to help them buy health insurance, in Section 246 on Page 143. Still, Wilson and Connelly and others argued the bill did not spell out verification procedures strong enough to ensure that illegal immigrants couldn't access the health care plan. "There are no provisions for enforcing it," Connelly told us in an interview on Jan. 20, 2010. "The loophole is too big." Others have made the same criticism. The anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform argued that illegal immigrants would be permitted to purchase insurance on the national health insurance exchange because the bill does not include a mechanism for verifying citizenship. So, the logic goes, illegal immigrants would have the chance to purchase insurance in the public option, a government-run health care plan that would offer basic coverage at a low price. FAIR also argued for more robust verification measures for the affordability credit and making sure that illegal immigrant parents won't be able to receive coverage if their citizen children are eligible. FAIR had a point that illegal immigrants would likely be able to buy insurance on the national health insurance exchange. We didn't see anything in the bills that would hinder that. A Congressional Research Service report issued Aug. 25, 2009, confirmed our observation. The House bill "does not contain any restrictions on noncitizens participating in the Exchange — whether the noncitizens are legally or illegally present, or in the United States temporarily or permanently," the report said. But buying insurance on an exchange is different from getting free health care, as Connelly's e-mail suggested. We're not aware of any particular restrictions that stop illegal immigrants from buying private insurance now. We should note that while Connelly's e-mail references HR 3200, the House version of the bill in play when Connelly wrote his e-mail in August, it's not the bill that the House ultimately passed. According to Connelly, the version ultimately passed by the House (3962) is even worse because it has lower standards than the version in the summer. The version that passed only requires that people be residents of the United States in order to be eligible for the health care exchange. One could simply provide an electric bill to clear that hurdle, he said. We checked the bill and found that Connelly is right about the language that says people have to be residents of the United States to be eligible. But we also found language similar to the older bill. Section 34, titled "No federal payment for undocumented aliens," states unequivocally, "Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States." And Sec. 1786 prohibits Medicaid and CHIP payments to "individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States." We further note that if the tax credits are administered through the Internal Revenue Service, there would be built-in scrutiny. For instance, if a system were set up for taxpayers to declare insurance expenses and then receive a refund or a rebate, illegal immigrants couldn't obtain coverage, "because illegal immigrants do not have legitimate Social Security numbers," Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a group that is generally pro-immigration, told PolitiFact back in September when this issue was hot. "Screening out illegal immigrants through the tax system would prevent them from obtaining health care-related subsidies." In addition, language in the House bill provides clear authority for the new government official who would run the exchange to set up that verification, as the Congressional Research Service report notes. Rosenblum concurs. "The commissioner could enforce these restrictions in one of two ways: through document- and database-based screening requirements as in the Medicaid system, or by reimbursing health care expenses through tax refunds," Rosenblum said. It's one thing to argue that the bill lacks adequate verification procedures (which is certainly debatable). It's another to claim if the those procedures aren't stringent enough, that the bill would provide free health care to illegal immigrants. Especially when the bill specifically states there can be no federal payments to undocumented aliens. That was in 3200 when Connelly wrote his e-mail, and it's in the bill the House ultimately passed. We rate this claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-01-21T17:42:48	2009-08-28	['None']
pomt-04460	Says Tammy Baldwin supports a law "in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/10/tommy-thompson/senate-race-thompson-says-baldwin-backs-government/	In his quest to win a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, and perhaps swing control of the Senate to the GOP, Republican Tommy Thompson has persistently cast Democrat Tammy Baldwin as extreme. On WISN-AM in Milwaukee on Sept. 27, 2012, the former governor's theme was health care. Thompson told conservative talk show Jay Weber that if Baldwin is elected, "she will be pushing for a national health care provision in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals." We’ve previously rated as Mostly True Thompson’s claim that Baldwin wants to go beyond President Barack Obama’s health care reform law to a "Medicare system for all." But Thompson himself goes extreme when he says the Madison congresswoman would have the federal government decide a patient’s private medical matters. 'Takeover' Thompson's language calls to mind PolitiFact National's 2010 Lie of the Year -- the claim that "Obamacare" constituted a "government takeover of health care." As our colleagues observed: "Government takeover" conjures a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the Affordable Care Act, adopted in 2010, relies largely on the free market, with employers continuing to provide health insurance to most Americans through private insurance companies. Indeed, a larger number of people will get private health coverage through the creation of insurance exchanges. But Thompson’s statement wasn’t as sweeping. He charged that legislation backed by Baldwin would have the government "take over your decisions" on medicine, doctors and hospitals. Since it is clear Baldwin has supported going beyond "Obamacare," that raises the question of whether Thompson’s specific point could be accurate. Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe cited two legislative efforts to back Thompson’s statement, correctly pointing out that Baldwin supported Obama’s reform law, even though it didn’t go as far as she wanted, and that she supports a "single-payer" health care system. We’ll note that while Obama’s law has been adopted (although not all features are yet in place), we can only speculate on the details of a single-payer health care system, since a single-payer system has not been adopted. "Obamacare": Boothe argued the reform law "puts the government in between a patient and their doctor in Medicare." But she didn’t elaborate, other than to claim Obama is cutting Medicare funding (which PolitiFact Florida called Half True, given that his reform law reduces the growth of Medicare spending). Boothe also argued the law "leaves an unaccountable board of 15 unelected bureaucrats in charge of rationing care and limiting access to health care." PolitiFact National has reported that while Obama’s plan establishes a board to make recommendations about future savings, it does not outline a dramatic, structural overhaul of the program. Moreover, our colleagues have found, the board doesn’t make decisions for individuals. "Single-payer": Single-payer refers to a health care system in which the government pays for all health care services but is not involved in the delivery of health care. Boothe argued that under single-payer, if, for example, "an area has three different hospitals, the government could come in and dictate which one they will continue to fund." Or, she said, the government could decide not to fund religious-affiliated hospitals, "thus removing you from your doctor and health care provider, and ultimately making decisions on your behalf." But a system in which the government pays for all health care isn’t the same as one in which the government "will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals." And Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus pointed out that a single-payer measure Baldwin introduced in 2009 would have allowed patients "free choice of participating physicians and other clinicians, hospitals, and inpatient care facilities." Health policy experts We contacted three experts: George Washington University health policy professor Brian Biles; Georgetown University health systems administration professor Robert Friedland; and Baruch College health care policy professor Shoshanna Sofaer. None was persuaded by Thompson’s claim. On the health care reform law’s changes to Medicare, Biles said the law will put more people into private insurance plans, through the creation of "exchanges," allowing them to choose from among private plans. Private insurers already limit access to certain doctor and hospital networks, as they did before the health reform law, and that isn’t the government making decisions for a patient, he said. Sofaer said virtually any physician in good standing and any accredited hospital can participate in Medicare, and that Obama’s law does nothing to change that. The law also does not change what medications or medical services are covered by Medicare, she said. And while the Medicare advisory board is to recommend changes, said Friedland, "the notion that this is somehow the government taking over your medical decisions or options is like saying employers are taking over your medical decisions by shopping for a better health insurance plan -- it does affect you; but it is hardly a case of your employer taking over your decisions." With regard to a single-payer health care system, Biles said a single-payer system -- sometimes known as "Medicare for all," a term Baldwin has used -- could increase the number of health care providers available to patients, given that the vast majority of providers accept Medicare patients. Sofaer said that with the federal government paying for all health care, the government theoretically "would have a huge amount of control over, in particular, what services were covered and which were not." But "in our form of government, with power divided in so many ways, I suspect it will be very difficult indeed for a federal program to be so authoritarian with respect to something as personal as medical care," she said. "In practical terms, it would not happen." Our rating Thompson said Baldwin supports a law "in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals."

pomt-04971	Says Michael Cargill was "arrested and incarcerated in Bell County."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/24/Ballesteros/ballesteros-says-cargill-arrested-incarcerated/	A political flier directed to voters in north and northwest Travis County claims to tell "the truth about Michael Cargill, candidate for Travis County Constable" -- and depicts him in an orange jumpsuit. The mailout, which states it was paid for by the Re-Elect Adan Ballesteros campaign, says among other claims that Cargill was "arrested and incarcerated in Bell County," and it lists a case number. We decided to wade again into the tumultuous race for Travis County Precinct 2 constable, in which Ballesteros and Cargill are opponents in a Democratic primary runoff election July 31, 2012. In June, we examined a political action committee’s claim linking incumbent Ballesteros to drug money, but we found conflicting, unresolvable information and left the statement unrated. As we began our look at this claim, we ran a LexisNexis background check of public records and commercially available data sources. The search found no criminal convictions in Cargill's past. Asked for backup, Ballesteros emailed us copies of Bell County records, a black-and-white mug shot and a letter from Lt. Chuck Cox, custodian of records for the Bell sheriff’s office. We confirmed that the documents came from Cox and county clerk Shelley Coston, and we got descriptions of the case from Cox and Kathryn Brock-Jones, manager of the county attorney’s Hot Check Office. We also received screen shots of the remaining records in the 1999 case, which are computerized, from Tina Syme, criminal department supervisor at the county clerk's office. According to the records and our email and phone interviews with Syme, Brock-Jones and Cox, Cargill was arrested May 18, 1999, on a warrant stemming from a 1997 bad check charge. He was taken to the Bell County jail, paid the money he owed on the check and was released from the jail the next day, and the misdemeanor charge was dismissed. There was no conviction and Cargill’s time at the jail was not time "served" as punishment, Cox told us. In fact, Cox said, Cargill was immediately eligible to have it erased from his record. Cox confirmed that the records show that Cargill was physically in the jail overnight. Brock-Jones told us that Cargill was charged with issuance of a bad check, a Class C misdemeanor, rather than the more serious charge of theft by check. That plus the fact that Cargill had no history of bad checks, she said, means that his case likely involved only one check of a small amount, around $20. We wondered, too, about the front of Ballesteros’ flier depicting Cargill in an orange jumpsuit. Cox called the image of Cargill in the orange outfit a "fabrication." Cargill’s real booking photo is a black-and-white Polaroid showing him wearing civilian clothes, Cox told us -- which also was the image Ballesteros emailed us when we asked for his backup documentation. At the time Cargill was detained, Bell County used orange uniforms solely for suspected felons, Cox said. As we gathered these accounts, we also checked in with Cargill, who initially told us he was not arrested or jailed. Cargill told us by phone that the original check, which he said was for $20, bounced from a checking account he had closed before he deployed to Bosnia with the U.S. Army. Overseas, he said, he did not receive the notification that Bell County would have sent him once the hot check was reported. When he returned from Bosnia, he said, he was unaware of the warrant until he was pulled over while driving because "my little Chihuahua who was sitting in the middle of the center console was blocking my view," he said. "They ran my license; that popped up, and I went down, we took care of it. I didn't even know that was there because, like I said, you know, I was deployed. ... Never saw a judge, any of that. Didn’t go to court. Nada." In a follow-up interview, he agreed that his trip to the jail amounted to an arrest, but, despite what officials had told us based on Bell County records, he said he was not in the jail for a day. "I was only there a few hours," he said. "I know I was not there 24 hours. I was not there, you know, a full day, I know that for a fact. One hundred percent." Cargill disputed Ballesteros’ word "incarcerated" as well. "Incarcerated means convicted and spent time," he said. "I was never incarcerated." Cargill told us he would say he was "detained." Merriam-Webster gives two definitions of "incarcerate," the first being "to put in prison" and the second being "to subject to confinement." Our ruling We suspect most people would interpret Ballesteros’ phrase "arrested and incarcerated" to mean Cargill served time as punishment for a crime -- which he did not, as our background check suggested. Nor did Cargill wear the garish jumpsuit shown on the flier. But Cargill was brought to the jail on a warrant for his arrest and held there briefly -- perhaps overnight -- before the charge was dismissed. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04267	"Texas’ population is projected to double in the next 50 years or so, but our basic amount of water will remain about where it is now."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/09/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-states-population-will-double-50-/	Austin’s state senator makes a by-the-numbers’ case for funding the state’s water plan. For an October 2012 voters guide, Democrat Kirk Watson was asked by the League of Women Voters, Austin Area, what programs or solutions he believes necessary to address the state’s current and future water needs. "Texas’ population is projected to double in the next 50 years or so," Watson replied, "but our basic amount of water will remain about where it is now. Texas has an official water plan showing our water needs over a half-century and ideas for meeting those needs. But that plan requires steady funding. Ideas such as bottled water fees and utility surcharges should be considered. But the first priority should be promoting, incentivizing and optimizing conservation." Watson has a point. The plan, which is revised every five years, largely remains unfunded. In April 2012, we rated as Broken a 2010 promise by Gov. Rick Perry to coax the 2011 Legislature to invest in it, though lawmakers had voted to finance approximately $100 million in water-plan projects. Overall, lawmakers and Perry agreed on the state covering 11 percent of the plan’s estimated costs through 2019. For this article, we wondered about Watson’s recent population and water-supply projections. Will the state’s population double in 50 years or so while available water remains about the same? By email, Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal said that within the guide’s answer word-limit, Watson based his claim on statewide and regional projections in the 2012 version of the water plan. The plan, published by the Texas Water Development Board, has figures related to Watson’s questionnaire answer, we found, but it doesn’t project a doubling in population within 50 years or so and its water projections for that year have two facets. Specifically, the plan says that from 2010 to 2060, the state’s population is expected to increase from 25.4 million to 46.3 million. That would amount to an increase of 82 percent, about 4.5 million short of a doubling. By telephone, Dan Hardin, the board’s director of Water Resource Planning, told us the plan’s population forecasts were devised in consultation with the Texas State Data Center, which disseminates state population estimates. The plan says the expected increases are the result of residents coming to Texas continuing to outnumber those who leave as well as in-state births outnumbering deaths. Hardin said, too, that the plan presumes even greater population gains for about a quarter of the state’s 254 counties, particularly counties with fast-growing suburbs. Separately, we reached Lila Valencia of the San Antonio-based State Data Center, who told us by phone the center has not calculated when the state’s population will double and has not issued population projections past 2050. By phone, the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, told us that if one assumed state population growth at the same rate as the past decade, an "aggressive assumption," the population would double by 2050 or so. It could be that the population doubles by 2060 or later, Potter said, though that’s "educated guesswork." Alternatively, we asked, might the 82 percent increase presented in the water plan be likened to doubling? Potter said he would not do so. "It’s not consistent with ‘doubling.’ I personally would avoid using the word ‘doubling’ " in reference to the 82 percent projection, he said, since a doubling would be 100 percent. So, there are no projections of when the population will double. Next, we took up Watson’s suggestion that "our basic amount of water will remain about where it is now." Broadly, Scheibal said by email, the planet always has about the same amount of water, though it moves and changes form, from liquid to gas to solid, dependent on conditions. Hardin put it this way: "In the very biggest picture, the water we have now is the water we will always have. It gets recycled." This is not to say that Texas will be home to the same amount of water even as its population increases. The state water plan essentially says that because less water will remain in underground aquifers, there will be less water available above ground. Still, one section of the plan says that statewide, available surface water will only be slightly decreased by 2060. The surface water available in 2010, pegged in the plan at 13.5 million acre-feet per year, compares to a predicted 13.3 million acre-feet per year by 2060, the plan says. (An acre-foot is the amount of water that would cover an acre at a foot deep, or 325,851 gallons.) That is, available surface water would be down less than 2 percent. Hardin cautioned, however, that "available" water groups water easily accessed with water that is not easily conveyed. To gauge how much water Texas has (or will have) to do what Texas needs to do, he said, the board calculates the more-limited "existing water supply." "Existing water supplies are those supplies that are physically and legally available now," the plan says. "In other words, existing supplies include water that providers have permits or contracts for now and are able to provide to water users with existing infrastructure such as reservoirs, pipelines and well fields. Water availability, on the other hand, refers to how much water would be available if there were no legal or infrastructure limitations," the plan says. As noted in an Oct. 18, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article pointed out by Scheibal, the plan also says, "We do not have enough existing water supplies today to meet the demand for water during times of drought." The plan projects existing water supplies — folding in surface water, groundwater and reused wastewater — to decrease about 10 percent, from about 17 million acre-feet in 2010 to about 15.3 million acre-feet in 2060 as less water is available in the state's aquifers. Meantime, water needed statewide is anticipated to grow 22 percent, the plan says, due to a decline in irrigation water use and a slight decrease in per-person water use in towns and cities, which reflects ongoing shifts to more efficient plumbing, Hardin told us. Upshot: State projections of "available" water and the more conservative "existing" water supply suggest Texas stands to have less water in 50 years. Our ruling The senator said the state’s "population is projected to double in the next 50 years or so, but our basic amount of water will remain about where it is now." In fact, Texas is expected to have at least a tad less water by 2060, the latest state water plan says. Also, the population will not double until an uncertain date, but has been projected to increase 82 percent between 2010 and 2060. Watson’s claim, lacking these clarifications, rates Mostly True. Clarification, 3:33 p.m. Nov. 9, 2012: This article includes revised paragraphs regarding what the state water plan contains. This change did not affect the rating.

pomt-12903	California has "the highest poverty rate in the nation" when considering the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure.	true	/california/statements/2017/jan/20/chad-mayes/true-california-has-nations-highest-poverty-rate-w/	California’s job and economic growth has outpaced much of the nation in recent years. That growth, however, has not eliminated one of the state’s biggest challenges: poverty. This week, State Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes called poverty California’s No. 1 priority during a forum of legislative leaders in Sacramento. Mayes, who represents parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, claimed the state’s poverty rate is higher than any state in the nation when considering factors such as cost-of-living. "If you look at the official poverty measure in California, we’re about average with the rest of the country," Mayes said. "But if you use the supplemental poverty measure, we are in the lead. We have the highest poverty rate in the nation -- higher than New Mexico, higher than any of the southern states, Louisiana, Alabama, higher than Idaho." Assemblyman Chad Mayes makes his statement about poverty in California at about the 10:50 minute mark in the video above. We decided to fact-check whether the report Mayes cited really shows that California has the highest poverty rate in the nation. Our research From 2013 to 2015, California had America’s 17th-highest poverty rate, 15 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Official Poverty Measure. That measure uses income levels to determine poverty, but does not consider differences in cost-of-living among states. It lists the official poverty threshold for a two-adult, two-child family at $24,036 in 2015. During the same period, California had the highest poverty rate, 20.6 percent, according to the census’ Supplemental Poverty Measure. That study does account for cost-of-living, including taxes, housing and medical costs, and is considered by researchers a more accurate reflection of poverty. For a two-adult, two-child family in California, the poverty threshold was an average of $30,000, depending on the region in the state, according to a 2014 analysis by Public Policy Institute of California. Looking at state poverty rates, the second highest is Florida’s 19 percent, followed by New York’s and Louisiana’s shared 17.9 percent rate. The national average is 15.1 percent using the supplemental measure. "I think Assemblymember Mayes’ comments are accurate," said Chris Hoene, executive director of the left-leaning California Budget Policy Center, which has closely studied poverty in the state. Hoene said the high poverty rate in the supplemental report is driven by California’s stratospheric housing costs. He added that use of the supplemental measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers. "I think in most quarters, that’s not disputed," he said. Marybeth Mattingly, a researcher at the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality added by email: "Basically, yes, this statement is (sadly) accurate." Caroline Danielson, who studies poverty at the Public Policy Institute of California, noted that when considering the margin of error in the supplemental poverty report, California and Florida are closer than one might assume. California’s estimate has a margin of error of ± 0.8 percent while Florida’s had a margin of ± 1.1 percent. "California’s rate is essentially the same as Florida’s," she said. "California, we might say, is in the top two." Several researchers noted that California’s poverty rate has declined in recent years: "But they haven’t moved as much as you would hope," Hoene said. Our ruling State Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes said recently that California has "the highest poverty rate in the nation" when considering the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure. Data from that report, and researchers who study poverty, support Mayes’ statement. The state’s 20.6 percent poverty rate is higher than any other, though Florida’s 19 percent rate is close, especially when considering the margin of error. The supplemental report is considered by experts the best state-by-state measure of poverty, because it takes into account geographic differences in cost-of-living, not just income levels. In his statement, Mayes cited the specific report that backs his claim, and added the context that another report, one that doesn’t account for cost-of-living, shows California’s poverty closer to the national average. Given this clarity and context, we rate Mayes' statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-13198	"With her solution, terrorists can still today — and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it — buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/24/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-isis-advertises-lax-us-gun-laws/	As gun policy takes a central role in New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate race, Democrat Maggie Hassan is warning that terrorists are trying to exploit federal laws to obtain firearms. Hassan brought up the point in the first televised debate against Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. "With her solution, terrorists can still today — and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it — buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America," Hassan said on the debate stage at New England College. Is it really a point terrorists are spreading? Let’s look. PolitiFact has already looked into Hassan’s claim that Ayotte voted against a proposal to expand background checks and found it Mostly True. Here we are going to look at what ISIS says about buying guns in America. Hassan’s camp pointed us to a series of news articles in which members of various terrorist groups talk about the ease of getting guns in the U.S. A former Islamic State recruit told the New York Times in August that the terrorist group tries to draw its recruits from within the U.S. because they can buy guns without a middleman. "For America and Canada, it’s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb — they have open gun policies," Harry Sarfo told the Times from a German prison, when explaining attitudes within the terror group. "They say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don’t need to have a contact man who has to provide guns for them." Hassan’s camp also directed us to a 2011 video featuring American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn in which he talked about lax gun laws in the U.S. and urged followers to take advantage of them. "America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms," Gadahn said, according to CNN. "You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?" Gadahn was with al-Qaeda, not ISIS. Still, he urged terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. Those two examples are enough to show that terrorists have advertised the U.S. gun laws, and "it is something they think about internally," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Still, it’s difficult to determine if these are part of a widespread advertising campaign, or just isolated examples. A lof of ISIS communication is never circulated on the internet, Gartenstein-Ross cautioned. On other occasions, PolitiFact has examined whether people can buy guns without background checks. Currently federal law requires prospective gun buyers undergo background checks when they buy guns from federally licensed dealers -- but there are notable exceptions. Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms "with the principal motive of making a profit" has to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. So if an individual buys a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet, or at a gun show, he or she would not be subject to a background check. It’s worth noting that private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person. Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers "can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions," Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, has previously told PolitiFact. Additionally, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically. Congressional efforts to expand background checks for purchases made at gun shows or online have failed. A recent review by the New York Times found the majority of guns used in 16 recent mass shootings were obtained legally, including the attack in Orlando that left nearly 50 people dead. The shooter in that incident, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before he gunned down patrons at the Pulse nightclub. Our ruling Hassan said the Islamic State knows its followers can buy firearms "online and at gun shows" and is "advertising it." An interview in the New York Times with a former Islamic State recruit shows group members acknowledge American recruits can buy guns, so long as they don’t have a record. And a 2011 video from an al Qaeda spokesman urges terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. There is little evidence to suggest a widespread advertising campaign, but it’s hard to tell, because not all ISIS communication is on the Internet, either. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-03804	"Under my predecessor, they cut funding for education, but they didn't give them anything in return to make up for that," leading to "less money" for school districts	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/25/scott-walker/walker-says-doyle-cut-education-funding-without-gi/	In his March 16, 2013 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Gov. Scott Walker criticized the way Wisconsin cut education funding before he took office. In blaming union rules and former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle for the layoff of an award-winning young English teacher in Milwaukee Public Schools, Walker explained: "You see, under my predecessor, they cut funding for education, but they didn't give them anything in return to make up for that. So what happened? When you have less money in those situations, even though she was named one of the best teachers in the state in her profession, what happened to her?" Walker answered his own question: "She was one of the first to be laid off. Why? Because under the old system of collective bargaining, one of the last hires is the first fired." We wondered about Walker’s claim that under Doyle, Democrats cut school funding but didn’t give districts "anything in return to make up for that," resulting in "less money" for local districts such as MPS. Some background first. It may not have been well known to Walker’s audience, but as PolitiFact Wisconsin found, Walker and legislative Republicans enacted the biggest cuts to education in state history in his first budget. But Walker’s 2011-’13 budget also allowed many, but not all, school districts to at least partially offset the impact of those cuts by taking advantage of the union limits in his budget. Specifically, they could impose -- rather than attempt to negotiate -- greater cost-sharing from school employees for health insurance and pension benefits. The collective-bargaining curbs also ended protection for seniority, which partly explains the MPS layoff story Walker related. That freedom to cut costs is the something "in return" that Walker’s speech said Doyle did not provide. So let’s look at both the cost and revenue side of the equation as we judge Walker’s claim that Doyle cut school funding and did it in a way that didn’t give local school districts any way to make up for the lost aid. Reductions in state aid Let’s take the easy part first. It’s less well known, but still a fact, that Doyle -- facing a budget shortfall during the Great Recession -- cut state aid to schools in his final budget (2009-’11). The cut was about 3 percent in the first year of that Doyle plan, while in the second year school aids were basically flat. For the record, Walker’s cut was deeper, about 8 percent in year one of his 2011-’13 budget, followed by a 1 percent increase in year two. But state aid is just one of the big revenue streams for schools. The other is local property taxes. The state regulates how much state aid and property tax school districts can raise, in combination, by limiting the annual increase in the "revenue limit" for each district. That brings us to the guts of Walker’s claim. Doyle, while cutting state school aid, let the "revenue limit" rise. "Districts were allowed to replace the lost aid with additional property taxes," noted Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. So Doyle, contrary to Walker’s claim, did offer something "in return" to districts -- though not every district might have been able or willing to levy enough new taxes to cover the difference. To be sure, Walker doesn’t think much of that approach. Walker took the opposite tack. He not only declined to raise the revenue limits, he actually reduced the amount districts could take in between taxes and state aid combined. The effect was property tax relief -- there was a small decline statewide in property taxes levied for schools in Walker’s first two years, compared with annual increases of 6 percent and 3 percent in Doyle’s last two years, state figures show. Less money for districts? The second major element of Walker’s claim was his suggestion that Doyle’s approach resulted in "less money" for districts, thereby forcing teacher layoffs. That’s off base on the revenue side, because while districts got less state money under Doyle, they could raise more local funds. Some even increased their spending because Doyle allowed them to raise more in property taxes. But there’s some truth to Walker’s phrasing if you look at the cost side of the money equation. Doyle’s last budget actually throttled back how large a property tax increase local districts could approve. So the effect was that districts could not raise taxes as much as they may have planned. And lacking the freedom that Walker would later give them, districts couldn’t cut benefits unilaterally to cover the difference because labor contracts were still in place. In some districts, MPS being one of them, they had to turn to staff cuts in the final year of the Doyle budget. The revenue cap, as well as growing costs and declining enrollment, contributed to the need for layoffs, MPS spokesman Tony Tagliavia said. We should note that Walker’s approach also led to staff reductions, including layoffs, and the cumulative reductions statewide were steeper in Walker’s first year than in Doyle’s last. Our rating Walker contended that under his Democratic predecessor, school funding was cut but the state didn’t give school districts "anything in return to make up for that." That, he said, resulted in "less money" for local districts. This is a mixed bag. Aid was cut by Doyle, and Doyle’s slowing of overall revenue growth by districts did squeeze some and force layoffs. But it’s not true that Doyle gave districts no way to address shortfalls; unlike Walker he allowed local property taxes to rise. On balance, we rate Walker’s statement Half True.

pomt-14103	Water rates in Manila, Philippines, "were raised up to 845 percent" when a subsidiary of the World Bank became a partial owner.	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/12/gwen-moore/arm-world-bank-tied-8-fold-rise-water-rates-manila/	If a city can’t provide safe drinking water, should it turn the whole operation over to a private company? No, we’re not talking about Flint, Mich. This concerns the southeast Asian city of Manila, the capital and biggest city in the Philippines. In 1997, officials in the Pacific island nation set up not one but two private companies to deliver water to homes and businesses. One of those companies has been a financial success. So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation’s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. "In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent," Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore’s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging. The soundest data we could find was in a 2013 report from local regulators, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate (pesos/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a typical bill Typical household bill (1997 pesos) 121 295 537 As you’ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila’s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city’s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization "was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s." The IFC’s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, "If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period." Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. "While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market," Jones said. "Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter." Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. "If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it’s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else," Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before. Our ruling Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore’s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family’s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before. Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFC’s equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start.

pomt-05766	"The national unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for a record 36 months."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/29/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-unemployment-has-been-above-8-/	When President Barack Obama touched down Feb. 15, 2012, in Milwaukee to tout homegrown manufacturing jobs, Republican Gov. Scott Walker greeted him amiably and praised the trip. Meanwhile, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, former head of the Wisconsin GOP, aired a long list of grievances timed to the visit. Unemployment was near the top of the list. "In February 2009, Obama promised that if he didn't have the economy fixed in three years, then his presidency was ‘going to be a one-term proposition,’ " Priebus wrote in an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "It's been three years, and few Americans would say the economy is healthy." He added: "In fact, the national unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for a record 36 months -- even though Obama promised it would be different. He promised his $825 billion stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent. But instead of creating jobs, it just created debt." PolitiFact Florida has rated Mostly False the claim that Obama promised the stimulus bill would cap unemployment at 8 percent. But what about Priebus’ claim that unemployment has topped 8 percent for a record 36 months? Asked to back up Priebus’ statement, the RNC pointed to a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. "The rate of unemployment in the United States has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009, making the past three years the longest stretch of high unemployment in this country since the Great Depression," says the CBO study. We double-checked it with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the gold standard for unemployment statistics. During that time, monthly unemployment has ranged between 8.3 and 10.0 percent. But the CBO study added an important qualifier that Priebus left out -- "since the Great Depression." The Great Depression-era unemployment rates topped 15 percent annually for six straight years, from 1931 to 1936, and never fell below 8.7 percent over 12 years, according to estimates adopted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In four consecutive years unemployment exceeded 20 percent a year. Those figures were cited by by PolitiFact National when it found False a 2011 Priebus claim that "We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression." "Any way you cut it, peak unemployment since the start of the most recent recession, as bad as it has been, remains well under half of the peak it reached during the Great Depression," that PolitiFact item concluded. There’s a qualifier, though, on the Depression-era data, as the PolitiFact item highlighted -- and this is where Priebus hangs his hat. There are some dissimilarities between the pre-war unemployment data and the current data. The earlier method counted those age 14 and up, not 16 and up (the standard that began in 1948). In addition, monthly unemployment statistics -- the measure cited by Priebus before Obama’s visit -- were not kept until 1948 as well. Thus, all the statistics during the Great Depression were on an annual basis. RNC spokesman Ryan Mahoney noted: "In (the current system) this is a record. BLS is the standard for the modern era. There were no definitive records like it during the Great Depression." Still, PolitiFact National concluded the old and new methods are similar, and the economists it interviewed said comparisons between the two are appropriate as long as the differences are disclosed. And it’s noteworthy that the government itself has adopted the pre-war unemployment estimates -- the ones that show unemployment rates higher than 15 percent for six years running -- as its own. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has declared those estimates official. We also talked to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. He said while the agency did not collect "official" estimates of the unemployment rate before 1940, the estimates from that earlier time, when combined with "official" figures for 1940 and 1941, suggest "the unemployment rate exceeded 8 percent for a total span of 12 years, 1930-1941." Even with the data differences, "it is silly to imply that unemployment between 1930 and 1939 was likely to be lower than 8 percent in any of those 10 years," Burtless stated. Our conclusion Priebus accurately cites monthly unemployment statistics proving a three-year run of unemployment topping 8 percent under Obama. But it’s a "record" only in the strict sense, because monthly statistics didn’t exist in the 1930s. His claim ignores the critical fact that Great Depression unemployment rates -- while not kept monthly -- annually were well above the current rates and for a much longer period. There’s an element of truth in Priebus’ statement because he cited "monthly" statistics, but overall this is misleading. That is our definition for Mostly False.

pomt-15054	Obamacare doesn’t require members of Congress "to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-obamacare-doesnt-require-members-cong/	When he was a presidential candidate, Gov. Scott Walker was the first top-tier Republican contender to release a plan to replace Obamacare and has chastised GOP members of Congress who ran on repealing the Affordable Care Act only to delay a vote this year. His comments included areas that are still relevant to the debate. For example, in a Sept. 1, 2015 interview, CNBC Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood pressed Walker on what he would do as president if he couldn’t garner enough votes to repeal Obamacare. "What are you going to say when you’re president of the United States and you can’t get 60 votes in the Senate to repeal Obamacare and it’s too hard and your people say ‘Hey, Scott Walker you said you were gonna get rid of Obamacare’?" "We are going to do it," Walker replied. Then he followed up with a claim worthy of the Truth-O-Meter: "Day One, I’m going to sign an executive order that gets rid of the special carve out that President Obama gave to the Congress that doesn’t require them to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do in terms of Obamacare." (Walker made a similar pledge in the Sept. 16 presidential debate, days before he dropped out of the race.) So, are member of Congress playing by different rules? Congress and Obamacare U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, suggested back in 2009 that members of Congress experience the effects of the Affordable Care Act and be put in the same position as other Americans. He proposed an amendment, which was accepted by the Senate Finance Committee, that required members of Congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance through the exchanges established by the legislation. Here’s what the law said: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law … the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are -- (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)." So, in a way, Congress does play by different rules -- but not in the way Walker suggests. They are required to use the Obamacare marketplaces while no one else is. Members of Congress and their staffs were previously insured through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which offers a range of plans with similar subsidies for premiums that nearly all large employers in the United States provide. That is, employees and their employers share in the cost. The switch to using the Affordable Care Act exchanges was scheduled for 2014. But vague language in the law left confusion about government (as the employer) contributions to health care plans. If members of Congress, along with their staffs, used the exchanges, they would no longer receive any assistance in paying for health care. What’s more, the salaries of staffers were too high to receive any level of the subsidies available to people in the insurance exchanges. So, congressional staffers would have paid full health care premiums out of pocket -- and Obamacare did not say employees were mandated to lose such benefits. What came next The health care reforms also established a marketplace for small businesses to sponsor health care coverage for their employees. In order to maintain the employer-sponsored coverage for Congress members and staffers, it was determined that the exchanges for small businesses would be a better fit. This led to some asserting that Congress was exempt from Obamacare. In August 2013, PolitiFact National rated False a claim by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that "President Obama just granted all of Congress an exception" to Obamacare. The claim was included in PolitiFact’s list of the Top 16 myths about the health care law. Walker used similar logic in his claim that Obamacare doesn’t require members of Congress "to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do." Walker’s team called the move to allow members of Congress and Congressional staffers to get care through the small business exchange "legal gymnastics." But Congressional offices do act like small businesses in many respects. Mark Peterson, a professor of public policy at UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs, said the parallel between small businesses and congressional offices became the foundation for allowing Congress and staffers to use the small business exchanges. "Yes, those employed by them are federal employees," Peterson said. "But unlike non-congressional employees, they are hired and fired by their sole boss -- the senator or representative -- not the government per se." The law says businesses with fewer than 100 employees are eligible to use the exchange. Beginning in 2017, states can also allow large businesses to also use those marketplaces. Our rating Walker said Obamacare doesn’t require members of Congress "to abide by the same rules that all of the other Americans do." Members of Congress and their staffs use the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act just like their constituents would. We rate the claim False.

The term refers to a murky group of people in the Washington bureaucracy and military who secretly pull the levers of power. The website World Politics Now carried the headline "Trump Orders 13 Obama Deep State Operatives Arrested For Treason," Aug. 6. The article reads: "According to white House sources, a baker’s dozen of Obama operatives will be spending the foreseeable future looking at four gray walls." The article cites the work of the conspiracy-minded website Breitbart (the site’s former chief Steve Bannon is now an adviser to Trump). "Among those arrested were three of Barack Obama’s cabinet members, multiple FBI officials, and numerous others across at least four agencies," the article continued. "White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the news organization (Breitbart) that "this goes all the way to the top." It’s safe to say that arrests of this sort would dominate the news cycle around the world, if they had taken place. They didn’t, of course, and there are no such headlines. There is no article on Breitbart. Sanders, the White House press secretary, didn’t say those words.

pomt-03558	"The IRS doesn't have to prove something against you ... you've got the burden of proof."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/22/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-taxpayer-has-burden-proof-when-f/	The Internal Revenue Service has been on the defensive since the news broke that the agency has been giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Among the lawmakers expressing concern about the IRS was Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va. In a May 17, 2013, interview, Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson asked Forbes, "What's your No. 1 concern about the IRS being in charge of Obamacare?" (Carlson was wrong about the agency's role. It is not "in charge," as we addressed with our recent fact-check of Michele Bachmann.) Forbes responded, "Well, Gretchen, first of all, it is the power that the IRS has that's different than any other agency, any other department. … The IRS doesn't have to prove something against you. They can walk in and you've got the burden of proof." The idea that the "burden of proof" rests on the accuser is a bedrock principle of justice around the world. While neither of the terms "burden of proof" or "presumption of innocence" appears in the U.S Constitution, an accuser’s burden of proving that someone has committed a criminal act goes back to ancient times. In 1895, when the Supreme Court issued a resounding defense of the concept in the case Coffin vs. United States, it cited sources as varied as the Bible, Sparta, Athens and Rome. "The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law," the court wrote. So we wondered whether it’s really the case that the IRS "doesn't have to prove something against you. … You've got the burden of proof." The ways in which Forbes is correct Saving receipts and canceled checks in case the IRS calls is all too familiar to many taxpayers. And generally speaking -- beyond some exceptions that we’ll outline below -- the burden of supplying information is indeed on the taxpayer when he or she is told by the IRS that they underpaid their taxes or when they face an IRS audit. This is a "traditional rule, going back a long way," said David Weisbach, a University of Chicago law professor who worked earlier in his career as an attorney-advisor in the Department of Treasury’s Office of the Tax Legislative Counsel. The IRS lays out the specifics on a Web page titled "Burden of Proof." "The responsibility to prove entries, deductions, and statements made on your tax returns is known as the burden of proof," it says. "You must be able to prove … certain elements of expenses to deduct them. Generally, taxpayers meet their burden of proof by having the information and receipts … for the expenses. You should keep adequate records to prove your expenses or have sufficient evidence that will support your own statement. You generally must have documentary evidence, such as receipts, canceled checks, or bills, to support your expenses." In other words, the IRS is presumed to be correct unless the taxpayer "produces ‘credible evidence’" to counter the agency’s finding, said Timothy Jacobs, a partner specializing in tax law at the firm Hunton & Williams. It’s worth noting that as frustrating as this burden may be, the alternative is even worse, said Neil H. Buchanan, a law professor at George Washington University. "If the IRS had the burden to produce evidence, it would have to be given access to individuals' private files, in order to find that evidence," he said. "Is that what we really want the IRS to be doing?" So, for the most common interactions with the IRS, the burden of proof is indeed on the taxpayer. The exceptions to the rule There are a few exceptions to this rule. The most notable, since the penalties are so severe, are for tax-related criminal cases and civil fraud cases. In these types of cases, the burden of proof is essentially the same as it is for any other criminal case: The government, not the taxpayer, has to prove their case. "If the government wants to convict you of murder, it has to show that you intentionally killed someone," said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And if the IRS takes you to court, he said, "it has to show that you owe a certain amount of taxes and didn’t pay it." Technically, Forbes was referring to the "burden of production," which is the burden of providing supporting evidence, rather than the "burden of proof," which typically refers to the burden of proving a case in court, Buchanan said. Still, the IRS uses the term "burden of proof" on the Web page that spells out what people have to provide to justify their deductions. So how common are the exceptions? Tax experts said criminal and civil-fraud cases are rare today when compared to ordinary tax-liability cases. "Essentially all tax cases are normal, non-fraudulent adjustments," Weisbach said. This ratio of cases suggests that Forbes’ claim is largely accurate. "Nothing the congressman said on the burden of proof would strike me as outside of the norm or the general rule if I or any other tax litigator heard it in everyday conversation," Jacobs said. Our ruling Forbes said "the IRS doesn't have to prove something against you. They can walk in and you've got the burden of proof." He’s correct for most tax disputes. As long as no criminal or fraud charges are being tried, and as long as the case is taken up administratively rather than in court, the burden of justifying a taxpayer’s calculations falls upon the taxpayer. But in the relatively small number of criminal or civil fraud cases, the burden is on the government, just as it is in other types of prosecutions. On balance, we rate Forbes’ claim Mostly True.

pomt-01533	"It is true that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez (Mexico)"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/17/trent-franks/isis-mexico-and-planning-cross-border/	With the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria growing in the Middle East, nearly half of Americans think the country is less safe than it was before Sept. 11, 2001, according to a recent poll. Some Republicans have expressed concern that the southern border is so porous, members of the extremist group could slip into the United States from Mexico. And a few have said such a plot is already in the works -- but federal agencies don’t agree. Rep. Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona, said his state faces an imminent threat in a recent phone conference with conservative nonprofit Staying True to America’s National Destiny. BuzzFeed picked up Franks’ comment, and it made its way around the Internet. "It is true, that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez or they were within the last few weeks," Franks said. "So there’s no question that they have designs on trying to come into Arizona. The comment that I’ve made is that if unaccompanied minors can cross the border then certainly trained terrorists probably can, too. It is something that is real." Several other politicians have made similar claims, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. And the claims are spreading around conservative online media, like the Daily Caller, Breitbart News and pundit Sean Hannity at Fox News. This clashes with the federal government’s assertion that there is currently no credible threat that ISIS is planning an attack on United States soil. With Franks and so many others claiming that the threat is certain and looming, we decided to see whether or not their evidence is credible. Based on our talks with experts and statements from law enforcement officials, the possibility of ISIS attacking the U.S. by crossing the southern border seems unlikely. The certainty that Franks suggests about what we "know" is wrong. The origins In a statement to PolitiFact, Franks said he got the information from a report circulating around the Internet. Franks has since learned that Homeland Security believes the report was "overstated," and his subsequent comments reflect that -- though he remains concerned about the possibility of terrorists crossing the border. The report is from Judicial Watch, a conservative media website, and it claims that "Islamic terrorist groups are operating in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez and planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle borne improvised explosive devices," citing several anonymous "high-level federal law enforcement, intelligence and other sources." We couldn’t find any other media outlets that independently verified the story, and no federal officials would corroborate its claims, either. Without knowing anything about Judicial Watch’s sources -- such as rank or agency -- it’s hard for us to assess the article’s credibility. In an interview with PolitiFact, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton would not go into any further detail. The article says the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to their multiple requests. We asked Homeland Security about the threat in Juarez, and they said, "There is no credible intelligence to suggest that there is an active plot by (ISIS) to attempt to cross the southern border." The topic came up a few times in recent congressional hearings, and administrators reiterated the lacking evidence of an imminent threat. In a Sept. 10 hearing before the House Homeland Security Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., said, "We know that terrorist networks have been using our porous southern border and a broken immigration system to enter the United States." DHS Deputy Under Secretary for Analysis Jennifer Lasley responded. "To date, we have not had credible reporting that either Hezbollah or any other terrorist group has been taking advantage of our borders to move individuals in and out," Lasley said. "It's something we are always looking for, but to date, we have not seen credible evidence of that." Later in the same hearing, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, discussed his conversations with DHS, when administrators told him that there has never been evidence of terrorists entering the United States via the southern border. He posed the same question to DHS administrators present at the hearing. In response, John Wagner, acting assistant commissioner for Custom and Border Patrol’s Office of Field Operations, said it is much more likely that ISIS and other Islamic extremists would come to the United States by commercial plane. Wagner said the number of people suspected in terrorist activity caught on the southern border is in the tens, while those on commercial jets is in the thousands. Both Rep. Franks and Fitton of Judicial Watch mentioned to us that the government has intercepted ISIS social media posts that indicated a potential attack carried out by crossing the border. This came up in a Sept. 10 Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., asked Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis Francis Taylor about recent reports of Twitter and Facebook exchanges in which ISIS "urged infiltration" across the U.S.-Mexico border. "Yes, sir, there have been Twitter, social media exchanges among ISIL adherents across the globe speaking about that as a possibility," Taylor said, adding: "I'm satisfied that we have the intelligence and the capability at our border that would prevent that activity." This admission energized the discussions in the conservative media. But social media threats should be taken with a grain of salt, said Colin Clarke, an expert on international security at the Rand Corporation, a think tank. "ISIS could say ‘we would never consider (crossing the border),’ and would we take that seriously?" Clarke said. "It’s really just one small sliver of evidence." It’s possible, but unlikely We talked to several national security experts, and each one said they haven’t seen credible evidence that ISIS is staging a plot that involves crossing the southern border. They also said that scenario is highly unlikely. "There is big difference between a theoretical risk or a risk that is worth worrying about," said David Schanzer, director of Duke University’s Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security. The general sentiment among experts was: It’s possible that ISIS could sneak through the border -- illegal immigrants do it every day. But why would they? Schanzer noted that ISIS members who have U.S. passports or visas could enter the country legally via plane. (The 9/11 hijackers had U.S. visas.) Whereas if they crossed the border illegally, they would run the risk of getting caught. Another possibility is that someone living in the United States could become radicalized over the Internet and then stage an attack, like the men who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings last year, Clarke said, adding that this was his biggest concern. Additionally, ISIS is "overwhelmingly focused" on Iraq and Syria, said Daniel Benjamin, former ambassador at large and coordinator for counterterrorism at the State Department. The group likely does not have the wherewithal to stage an attack on American soil at this point. In order to cross the border and stage an attack, ISIS would need a broad network in place in the United States that could provide them with intelligence, weapons, money, sanctuary, training and more, Clarke added. And this is not a new claim. In 2011, then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney (and several other Republican candidates) said the Islamic militant group Hezbollah was working in Mexico, and we rated that claim Mostly False. (We found some evidence of Hezbollah sympathizers working in South and Central America,but little evidence for the group "working" in Mexico.) In 2010, Judicial Watch published a story with the headline: "Feds Warn Of Terrorists Sneaking Into U.S. Through Mexico." O’Rourke, the Texas representative, has said that he came across an El Paso newspaper story from 1981 about Libyan terrorists in Juarez, though evidence of such a group was never found. Despite years of these claims, Schanzer said he is not aware of a "single person arrested for a terrorism-related offense after crossing the border illegally." We should note that in 2011, an Iranian plotted to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, and his plan involved Mexican drug traffickers, according to the Washington Post. The man, who had previously lived in Texas, thought his contact in Mexico was a drug smuggler, when it was actually a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informant. The man was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he flew from Mexico. Our ruling Franks said, "It is true that we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez." We found that it is highly unlikely that ISIS would operate in Mexico and stage an attack that involves crossing the border. The claims originated in an article with unnamed sources, published by a right-wing outlet. We could not find one law enforcement official or another media outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claims. It’s a far stretch to say "we know" with certainty that ISIS is in Juarez, so we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06625	"An amazing 5,400 jobs were lost in the first 12 months of the (smoking) ban’s implementation in Ohio’s hospitality industry alone."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/19/chris-mccalla/tobacco-group-claims-ohio-smoking-ban-led-major-jo/	Debate over proposed government-enforced smoking bans generally follow a prescribed path. Public health advocates tout the health benefits of reduced smoking while bar and restaurant owners complain about potential lost business. Often the debate ranks high on the rhetorical scale but is limited in hard facts. So it got our attention when the International Premium Cigar & Pipe Retailers Association, based in Coumbus, Ga., released a statement last month by its legislative director, Chris McCalla, in opposition to an expansion of the DeKalb County smoking ban. McCalla claimed a similar ban in Ohio cost 5,400 jobs in one year to that state’s hospitality industry. It turns out the claim of Ohio job losses is popular among opponents of smoking bans. We found the claim repeated in letters to the editor in Alabama, on numerous pro-smoking blogs and in news aggregators like Yahoo! News that picked up the association’s news release. But where did that number come from? Naturally, the first place we looked was Ohio. The figure of 5,400 jobs lost appears on the website of Opponents of Ohio Bans, a group opposed to the Ohio law approved by voters in 2006. Pam Parker, co-founder of the group, pointed back to the Georgia-based group as a possible source for the statistic. "I believe that's a number that IPCPR has reported," Parker said in an email. Parker also provided a link to a news release on unemployment figures from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services showing 5,900 hospitality jobs lost in the state over the past year as a possible source. But that report -- part of a larger report on all nonfarm employment -- was from November 2009. The Ohio smoking ban began in May 2007, so the time periods do not match up. The association referred all questions back to McCalla, but he did not return messages seeking clarification of his statement. A representative from the public relations firm that sent out the news release for the association also did not return calls. So is there any evidence that McCalla’s statement is correct? The employment sector he claims coughed up so many jobs because of the smoking ban represents a wide-ranging group of industries that includes bars and restaurants but also takes in sports stadiums, hotels, museums and golf courses to name a few. Benjamin Johnson, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, said the sector lost 2,200 jobs during the first year of the state’s smoking ban, less than half the claimed amount and a pretty small 0.4 percent decrease in overall employment. By way of comparison, all nonfarm employment in the state declined by 39,400 during the same period, a decrease of about 0.7 percent, so it makes it tough to see the ban’s direct impact on employment. Ohio State University public health professor Elizabeth Klein said the research on the economic impact of smoking bans is not even something researchers argue about because of the "high degree of consistency" in numerous academic studies. The bans just do not do measurable economic harm. The only downside is that it is hard to get new research published, she said. "From the academic perspective, most of us are over this. It’s been well established," she said. Despite the academic consensus, this month Klein and her Ohio State colleague Nancy Hood published a study of bars and restaurants in Ohio that found the smoking ban did not have an effect on sales. Klein said the findings mirror her earlier study on the economic impact of a similar ban in Michigan. Taking a longer look, hospitality employment in Ohio has dropped 2.7 percent, but Klein said that is hardly surprising, given the recession. "Ohio has had difficulty with employment in a number of areas," she said. In fact, the hospitality industry has fared better than the overall economy in Ohio. Total nonfarm employment has dropped 6.3. percent since 2007, according to federal data. Back in Georgia, the point is almost entirely academic. In a meeting last week, amid warnings of economic consequences from opponents, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners voted 4-2 against expanding the county’s indoor smoking ban. When the smoke cleared, we rated this lost-jobs claim as False.	None	Chris McCalla	None	None	None	2011-09-19T06:00:00	2011-08-01	['Ohio']
pomt-09478	Gov. Rick Perry "spent over a million dollars on D.C. lobbyists asking for more federal money and lives in a luxury house that costs taxpayers $10,000 a month."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/01/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-1-million-spent-lobbying-perry-home/	The competition to be the most conservative Republican candidate for governor has played out on the stump, the Internet and on the airwaves. In a radio ad that we heard Feb. 24, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison portrays Gov. Rick Perry as a hypocrite, guilty of betraying bedrock conservative principles. Hutchison's ad makes claims about Perry on spending and taxes that we have already investigated. It was another statement that caught our eye: Perry "spent over a million dollars on D.C. lobbyists asking for more federal money and lives in a luxury house that costs taxpayers $10,000 a month." "People who live in $10,000-a-month houses shouldn't throw stones," the ads says. Has Perry spent that much on lobbying and his suburban digs? We decided to check, starting with the lobbying claim. Hutchison's campaign pointed us to newspaper articles about state contracts with two Washington lobby firms that Perry canceled in 2007 after Democratic members of the Texas congressional delegation and others questioned the deals. The contracts were procured by the state's Office of State-Federal Relations, which is overseen by the governor, lieutenant governor and Texas House speaker. Allison Castle, a spokeswoman for Perry, said the Washington firms were hired to help the Office of State-Federal Relations after its staff was cut almost 60 percent in 2003. The governor's office estimates that terminating the lobbying contracts saved taxpayers $173,000. But how many state dollars actually went to the firms? The governor's office told us how long the firms worked for the state and estimated how much they were paid. The Federalist Group, which was first hired by the state in 2003, received about $585,000. Cassidy & Associates, which got its contract in 2005, was paid about $350,000. Together, that's still shy of $1 million. But Castle said a third D.C. firm, Piper-Rudnick, had a contract with the Office of State-Federal Relations for about six months starting in October 2003. The governor's office estimated that it was paid about $142,000, which brings our running total spent on Washington lobbying by private firms above $1 million. And that doesn't include the money spent by the Texas Department of Transportation, whose governing commission is appointed by Perry. Chris Lippincott, a TxDOT spokesman, said that starting in 2005, the agency had two contracts that included Washington lobbying services. All told, Lippincott said, the amount of taxpayer money spent for TxDOT lobbying was $891,500. So, Hutchison's statement about past spending on Washington lobbying is on the money. But what about that luxury house for the governor? In fall 2007, Perry and his wife moved out of the Governor's Mansion and into a 4,600-square-foot house in the Barton Creek neighborhood that had been on the market for $1.8 million. The state rented the home for Perry so the mansion could be renovated. The lease for the house at 8113 Hickory Creek Drive, which is valued by Travis County at $1.1 million, was initially for one year; the rent was $9,900. The Hutchison campaign based its statement on television news stories that quoted that figure and aired soon after the governor's relocation was announced. Less than a year after the Perrys moved into the rental home, the Governor's Mansion was heavily damaged by arson. What had been expected to be an 18-month renovation became a vast reconstruction project, which is still under way. Castle said the lease on the house now runs through October 2011. The monthly rent was lowered to $9,000 in November 2008. We know there are additional costs to taxpayers related to Perry's stay in the rental house, which also accommodates the governor's security detail. Despite our inquiries, we haven't found out exactly what they are. John Sneed, executive director of the State Preservation Board, said the agency has been paying the utility bills for the governor's home away from home since Sept. 1, but he did not provide details. According to Austin Energy spokesman Ed Clark, the utility doesn't release how much electricity any customer uses. But the average electric bill for a home of similar square footage would run about $250 a month, assuming the home is heated by gas. The bottom line: Hutchison is correct that state offices controlled by Perry or his appointees spent more than $1 million on Washington lobbyists. As for the rental house that is currently Perry's home, Hutchison's claim that taxpayers are paying $10,000 a month is so close that she gets the cigar. Based on available information, we rate Hutchison's statement as Mostly True.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2010-03-01T14:39:59	2010-02-24	['Washington,_D.C.', 'Rick_Perry']
pomt-11673	"Trump: police officers and firefighters make too much money…hits them with tax penalty."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/05/bluedot-daily/headline-misleads-about-president-trump-and-tax-de/	The new tax bill signed by President Donald Trump delivers some pain to police officers and firefighters, a viral story said. "Trump: Police officers and firefighters make too much money ... hits them with tax penalty," said a Dec. 26 headline on Bluedot Daily, a website that is critical of Republicans. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Trump declared first responders make too much money. However, the tax bill signed by Trump in December did make changes in tax deductions that will affect many types of workers, not just police officers. Most of the Bluedot Daily article lifts from an article in Salon that said in 2018, police officers or fire responders who buy uniforms, guns or ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs. While Bluedot Daily made it appear that Trump targeted police officers and firefighters, Salon cited several types of workers who have taken the deduction in the past and will no longer be able to do so under the new tax law. Salon said that nearly one in five taxpayers will no longer be able to use miscellaneous deductions, writing, "Why are Trump and Congressional Republicans dinging first responders, teachers, nurses, traveling salespeople and even those who pay someone to prepare their income tax returns? So the rich can get bigger tax breaks, of course." Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact that the tax bill eliminated all employee deductions, including uniforms and union dues, for income tax purposes. "Most employees did not itemize their employee expenses, so they did not deduct uniforms, etc.," he said. "But some may have." The Bluedot Daily article said that under the new tax bill "a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform." That’s comparing apples and oranges, Rosenthal said. The tax bill eliminated employee deductions for income tax purposes, while the reference to corporate jets pertains to exempt amounts paid for private aircraft from an excise tax. Rosenthal pointed to an analysis by the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker that explained that the provision provided clarity on a tax that was never successfully imposed on private jet management companies. Our ruling Bluedot Daily said, "Trump: police officers and firefighters make too much money ... hits them with tax penalty." The tax bill eliminated employee deductions for expenses such as uniforms, but that will affect many types of employees -- not just police officers and firefighters. And we found no evidence that Trump stated that police and firefighters make too much money. We rate this statement False.

pomt-13451	Says Patrick "Murphy embellished, according to reports, his University of Miami academic achievement."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/15/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-ad-says-patrick-murphy-embellished-un/	Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says that U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy "has trouble with the truth." In a TV ad, Rubio said that his Democratic opponent misled voters about his work experience and educational background. The ad includes a clip of a WPTV news anchor Michael Williams on May 23 saying: "Murphy embellished, according to reports, his University of Miami academic achievement." Rubio’s ad -- the first during the general election -- makes several other claims about Murphy’s resume and record in Congress which we have previously fact-checked -- and we will explain those in more details later. Here we will focus on whether Murphy embellished his college record. Murphy’s college degree The ad is largely based on findings by the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times on May 23 about how Murphy had characterized his educational background. The Herald/Times reported that Murphy's congressional office and Senate campaign websites claimed he graduated with "degrees in accounting and finance" from the University of Miami. But in reality, he had a single degree based on two areas of study. In 2006, Murphy graduated with a bachelor’s in business administration, with his major areas of study being accounting and finance. Murphy’s campaign spokeswoman, Galia Slayen, told the Herald/Times in May that the embellishments were unintentional. After the Herald/Times pointed it out to the Murphy campaign, it changed the language to reflect a single degree on both websites. But this wasn’t the first time he had claimed dual degrees, the Herald/Times found. On his campaign website during his first U.S. House race in 2012, Murphy claimed "earning dual bachelor’s degrees." In January 2013 as he started his first term, Murphy told Port St. Lucie local access TV, "I got a dual degree, actually, in finance and accounting." After he won his Treasure Coast seat, Murphy’s House and re-election campaign biographies cited a single bachelor’s degree. Then the claims about "dual degrees" surfaced when he announced his U.S. Senate campaign in 2015. For example, on March 24, 2015, his House website stated: "He earned his B.S. in business administration from the University of Miami, graduating with dual degrees in accounting and finance." A University of Miami spokeswoman, Megan M. Ondrizek, told PolitiFact Florida that Murphy earned a bachelor of business administration in 2006. "He had double majors—one in Finance and one in Accounting," she said. "It is a single degree with a double major. A double major completes the requirements for one degree but two majors." Alexandra Bassil told the Herald/Times in May that although the university offers separate degrees in accounting and finance, students "are not permitted to pursue dual degrees in those two subjects." "Often, students who double-major make the mistake of saying they have two degrees," Bassil said. Murphy’s campaign spokesman Joshua Karp told PolitiFact Florida that the website language was "an innocent mistake." "Previous versions of the biography were accurate," Karp said. "Of course Patrick has a dual major in finance and accounting. The ad doesn’t provide the context: this was fixed and we owned up to it." Other claims in Rubio’s ad Rubio’s ad also includes clips from a CBS4 Miami report that "Murphy has never been a licensed CPA in Florida" and that "Murphy was not a small business owner." That is similar to attacks made in a TV ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee that Murphy "never worked as a CPA" and was "never a small business owner." Although Murphy has oversold his resume, it’s an exaggeration to say he "never" worked in those capacities so we rated that claim Mostly False. But Rubio’s wording about Murphy’s CPA record is slightly different because he refers to where he got his license. Murphy obtained his CPA license from Colorado while working at Deloitte and Touche in Florida. That means Murphy could still work on audits but couldn’t sign them since he didn’t have a Florida license. Rubio’s ad also says, "No wonder a non-partisan study ranked Murphy one of the least effective members of Congress." An American Future Fund ad said that "Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen," which we rated Mostly False, because it was based on a much-criticized analysis. (The ad cites a Tampa Bay Times blog about a ranking by InsideGov in 2015.) Our ruling Rubio’s TV ad says, "Murphy embellished, according to reports, his University of Miami academic achievement." Murphy has described his University of Miami record in conflicting ways in recent years. On his congressional office and U.S. Senate campaign websites he said he had "dual degrees" when in fact he had a single degree with a double major in two areas of study: accounting and finance. When the Herald/Times pointed out the inaccuracy, his campaign said it was an error and fixed it. Murphy had also referred to "dual degree" at times in the past while other times his websites reflected a single degree. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d0797764-7676-42ec-8e8d-7111ad7ee711	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-09-15T12:03:43	2016-09-13	['University_of_Miami']
pomt-12289	"Actually, on some procedures, you're more likely to die if you're on Medicaid than if you're uninsured."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jun/28/michael-needham/are-medicaid-patients-more-likely-die-uninsured-he/	In his defense of the Republican Senate health care proposal, Heritage Action for America CEO Michael Needham argued that some patients on Medicaid are more likely to die than those without insurance. Needham, who heads up the conservative organization, questioned the effectiveness of Medicaid in an interview on Fox News Sunday June 25. "If the Democratic Party wants to become the party of Medicaid, I don't think it's going to have a lot of success in the 21st century. Medicaid was a program designed in the middle of the last century where health outcomes between people on Medicaid and the completely uninsured are exactly the same. Actually, on some procedures, you're more likely to die if you're on Medicaid than if you're uninsured," Needham said. Legislation in both the House and Senate would slow the rate of Medicaid spending and result in enrollment declines, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A spokesman for Needham said his statement about deaths for those on Medicaid compared with the uninsured came from a 2011 Wall Street Journal op-ed by Scott Gottlieb, who was recently confirmed as FDA commissioner. Gottlieb was also a clinical assistant professor at the New York University School of Medicine and a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Gottlieb wrote that for Medicaid patients, "in some cases, they’d do just as well without health insurance." He cited four studies about the outcomes of patients on Medicaid for certain types of procedures. We were able to reach the authors of three of those studies, and they disputed Gottlieb’s conclusions. University of Virginia study was only about people who underwent surgery The largest study, done by the University of Virginia and published in 2010, followed the patient outcomes of almost 900,000 major surgeries across the country. The study kept track of whether those patients had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or no insurance at all. The results showed Medicaid patients were more likely to die following a procedure than the uninsured, but the deaths result from the fact that Medicaid patients tend to begin treatment in poorer health. That's a critical distinction, said one of the key researchers for the study, Dr. Irving Kron, a University of Virginia School of Medicine professor and cardiovascular surgeon. Kron told PolitiFact that Needham’s conclusion is incorrect. Kron has said that his study doesn’t mean Medicaid is to blame for higher odds of patient deaths. While the study adjusts for socioeconomic factors, it notes that if you’re on Medicaid, you’re probably suffering from a long list of risk factors other patients don’t have. Medicaid recipients are the poorest, least educated and sickest of all patients. Those patients have the highest incidence of AIDS, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders, psychoses and metastatic cancer, according to the study. "The reality is it’s apples and oranges," Kron previously told PolitiFact. "The problem with Medicaid is there’s more emergencies, because they’re sicker than most people. … They wait for care and unfortunately, emergent patients don’t do as well as elective patients." Some other studies were narrow in scope Gottlieb’s op-ed also cited studies examining outcomes for Medicaid patients who had cancer of the throat, coronary angioplasty or lung transplants. We tracked down authors of two of the studies; they rejected Gottlieb’s conclusions. Gottlieb cited a 2010 study of 1,231 patients with cancer of the throat, published in the medical journal Cancer. The study found that Medicaid patients and people lacking any health insurance were both 50 percent more likely to die when compared with privately insured patients—even after adjusting for factors that influence cancer outcomes, Gottlieb wrote. However, the authors of that report told PolitiFact that Gottlieb’s conclusion was wrong. One of the caveats of the insurance records used for this study was that no distinction was made between patients who were covered by Medicaid at the time of diagnosis and those who were uninsured at diagnosis but were then enrolled in Medicaid, said Scott M. Langevin, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Since researchers were unable to consider the Medicaid and uninsured groups separately, it’s an "errant interpretation" to conclude that health outcomes for people on Medicaid and those completely uninsured are exactly the same, Langevin said. Gottlieb also cited a study about outcomes for patients who underwent coronary angioplasty (a procedure to open clogged heart arteries). Dr. Michael Gaglia, associate professor of medicine at the University of New Mexico and an author of the 2011 study in the American Journal of Cardiology, said that Gottlieb ignores the full findings of his study and the broader picture about Medicaid. For those younger than 65, the Medicaid patients fared a little better than those who were uninsured, he said. He said that such arguments that having Medicaid is worse than not having insurance is "absurd." "This implication that somehow you get worse care with an insurance plan -- Medicaid -- than you would by not having an insurance plan at all -- no coverage, just going to the ER for emergencies -- for most reasonable people that doesn’t make any sense," he said. PolitiFact has previously found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. In general, these papers present a stronger consensus that having insurance saves lives. Harvard researchers recently wrote a piece summarizing the evidence on the effect of Medicaid or other insurance on mortality. Their review of the evidence concludes that insurance like Medicaid significantly reduces mortality relative to being uninsured, said Katherine Baicker, one of the authors. The researchers found that "coverage expansions significantly increase patients’ access to care and use of preventive care, primary care, chronic illness treatment, medications, and surgery. These increases appear to produce significant, multifaceted, and nuanced benefits to health." Our ruling Needham said, "Actually, on some procedures, you're more likely to die if you're on Medicaid than if you're uninsured." Needham points to a 2011 op-ed that cited studies about the outcomes of patients on Medicaid for certain types of procedures. We were able to reach the authors of three of those studies who disputed Gottlieb’s conclusions. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14320	"After taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, (Debbie Wasserman Schultz) has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/30/tim-canova/debbie-wasserman-schultz-attacked-bank-donations-a/	A law professor running against U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida says she is in the pocket of big banks and isn’t looking out for consumers who get crushed by debt from payday loans. "My opponent, after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFTP) from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans," said Tim Canova on his website. Canova, a first-time candidate and professor at Nova Southeastern University, is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the August Democratic primary in a Broward/Miami-Dade district. The race has drawn national attention because Wasserman Schultz is the Democratic National Committee chair. Did Canova accurately describe her donations from banks and her votes related to payday loans and car loans? There is some truth to his attack, but each one requires explanation. Donations from Wall Street banks Canova’s campaign pointed to donations from banks, securities/investment firms and finance/credit companies to Wasserman Schultz’s campaign committee and her political action committee, or PAC. At PolitiFact Florida’s request, the Center for Responsive Politics compiled the large individual donations (more than $200) and donations to her PAC starting with her 2006 election. The center found she received $309,020 from commercial banks, which represented about 2 percent of the total; $408,450 from securities/investment firms, and $325,850 from finance/credit companies. Her leadership PAC, Democrats Win Seats, received donations from the Goldman Sachs PAC: $5,000 in 2016 and $10,000 in 2014. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett pointed to donations only to her campaign and plucked out what he said were the "big bank" donations. That totaled $15,400, including $4,000 from Goldman Sachs. But the Center for Responsive Politics shows a longer list of bank donations even if we only examine her campaign committee. It shows $171,303 for "commercial bank" industry donations. Payday loan bill Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. It is a controversial industry that targets the poor and is disproportionately located in minority communities. For years, payday loans were unregulated by the federal government, although some states had their own laws. President Barack Obama took a step toward regulating the industry when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans have targeted the bureau for years. Enter some Democrats into the fray -- including Wasserman Schultz, who has gotten about $68,000 from payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wasserman Schultz is among Florida lawmakers who have defended Florida’s payday law despite the fact that some consumer advocates have bashed it and say it traps the poor in a debt cycle. Wasserman Schultz’s position is to give precedence to the state law, her spokesman said. On the federal level, the bureau released an outline of payday loan rules in March 2015 and is expected to announce a more complete proposal within the next several months. Congress doesn’t have to approve it but can introduce legislation to kill it. All but one member of Florida’s congressional delegation (Tom Rooney) signed a letter in April 2015 pushing back against the proposed rules. Instead, they want the bureau to look at Florida’s law as a model. That led U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican, to file the "Consumer Protection and Choice Act," H.R. 4018 in November. Half of the 24 cosponsors are from Florida, including Wasserman Schultz, and nine of the cosponsors are Democrats. Canova’s website said Wasserman Schultz "voted" on the bill, but it was only referred to a committee without a vote. (After we pointed that out to Canova senior adviser Richard Bell, the campaign changed the website to say "co-sponsored" instead of "voted.") The bill states that if the bureau determines that a state’s law meets the federal requirements, then only state law will apply. It would also delay federal regulations for two years, which would allow states to come up with their own laws. More than 200 consumer or civil rights groups -- including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, Southern Poverty Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America -- wrote a letter to Congress urging them to defeat the bill. They argued that the bill favors an "industry-backed Florida law" and would hurt consumers. Florida’s 2001 payday loan law was a compromise and included protections that were intended to help the poor avoid an endless cycle of debt. But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the Center for Responsible Lending’s March report. In the past year, the average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent. Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, disputed Ross’ description of Florida’s law as the "gold standard" during a congressional hearing on March 16. In Florida, "these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times," Cordray said. Bartlett argued that Wasserman Schultz has fought against "abusive payday lending practices" and pointed to her vote on a separate bill in 2015. She voted against HR 766, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, which opponents argued would have prevented the Justice Department from going after the financial industry. Racial discrimination in car loans Canova also said Wasserman Schultz prevented action to stop racial discrimination for car loans. This part of Canova’s attack relates to a 2013 bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommended steps for auto lenders to avoid discrimination. The bulletin was intended to provide clarity about existing law. But the House of Representatives pushed back against the bureau by passing a bill to nullify the bulletin. The bill passed the House 332-96 in November 2015 and hasn’t had a vote in the Senate. Wasserman Schultz was one of 88 Democrats who voted in favor of it, while 96 Democrats opposed it. Proponents of the bill -- including auto dealers -- said the bureau’s efforts would increase costs for consumers. Groups that represented minorities wanted the new guidelines. "This legislation in no way prevented the CFPB from addressing racial discrimination in car loans, and the congresswoman does not support that as a policy position," her spokesman said. The bill hasn’t been acted on, and discrimination investigations can continue. A few months after the House vote, Toyota agreed to a $21.9 million settlement to black and Asian buyers. Our ruling Canova says Wasserman Schultz "after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans." Her campaign committee and PAC have taken $309,020 from commercial banks since her re-election campaign in 2006 -- about 2 percent of the total. That includes $15,000 in donations from Goldman Sachs to her leadership PAC. The payday loan bill hasn’t had a vote in the House yet, although Wasserman Schultz is a co-sponsor. The bill would not prevent the bureau from regulating payday loans entirely, but it would cede power to the states, including Florida, which has its own payday law that some advocates have criticized as weak. She voted for a bill that squashed bureau guidelines that were intended to provide clarity about the law on racial discrimination related to car loans. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1e77c505-145b-41ad-b15e-2f1da0a221da	None	Tim Canova	None	None	None	2016-03-30T12:36:30	2016-03-24	['Goldman_Sachs', 'Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz', 'Wall_Street']
pomt-07008	"Let’s say (Republicans) take away half of our delegates. They’re worth more than Iowa’s, New Hampshire’s and almost South Carolina’s combined."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/07/will-weatherford/rep-will-weatherford-says-penalized-florida-delega/	Florida lawmakers, seeking to boost the state's presidential primary influence, want to jump ahead in line. Why let just Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada set the agenda as early primary states? A legislative commission will decide by Oct. 1, 2011, when to hold the 2012 Florida presidential primary. (At the moment, it's legally set for Jan. 31, fifth in line and before a raft of other states that vote on Super Tuesday.) But any date before the first Tuesday in March would draw the ire of the Republican National Committee, which says it will slash Florida's delegation by half. Still, some Florida Republicans argue it could be worth it for Florida voters once again to throw critical early weight behind a candidate. (It braved party penalties to support John McCain in January 2008, and lived to tell about it: While half of Florida's delegates didn't get official convention votes, they did get to attend. And McCain went on to win the nomination.) State Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, chatting with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board in a wide-ranging hourlong interview July 5, 2011, said lawmakers were working on a deal for an earlier primary that wouldn't draw penalties. But he wanted to make the point that even if the state got penalized, it would still have influence. "I think the goal is to be as close as we possibly can, hopefully like the fifth slot or something like that, without penalty," he said. "So we’re negotiating with the RNC as to how we get that done. There may be a penalty anyway, no matter what we do. ... The way they've got it structured is that anybody who goes before Super Tuesday gets penalized. But playing devil’s advocate, as Florida, if we were to go into it and say, 'Okay, we’ll take the penalty, we’re going to go the Thursday before Super Tuesday, and Florida's election is going to really matter and help catapult that person to Super Tuesday.' Let’s say they take away half of our delegates. They’re worth more than Iowa’s, New Hampshire’s and almost South Carolina’s combined. We have a lot of delegates. We're a large state. We're a diverse state. We reflect what I think is the demographics of the country, and we should be a player. And so I think we will be a player. It'll just come down to what the specific date is, but we're talking about that." He said, "Let’s say they take away half of our delegates. They’re worth more than Iowa’s, New Hampshire’s and almost South Carolina’s combined." We were curious: Does Weatherford's convention math make the grade? The Republican National Committee hasn't said how many delegates each state will have at the 2012 convention. So we asked Weatherford how he made his calculation. He pointed to a CNN count that showed delegates from 2008: Iowa: 37 New Hampshire: 12 South Carolina: 24 Florida: 57 (half of its original 114) So, if things are similar next year, Florida's half-delegation would be the same size as Iowa's plus New Hampshire's and a third of South Carolina's, according to 2008 numbers. He mentioned a second source, the Green Papers, a favorite site among political junkies for its fastidious attention to political details. And that's where Weatherford's 2008 comparison started to break down. The site lists how state delegates voted at the Republican National Convention. It notes that Florida lost half its delegates for violating party rules. Interestingly, it also lists four other states that lost half their delegates — including New Hampshire and South Carolina. That's right — two states in Weatherford's comparison also sported atypically small delegations in 2008. And those states won't be penalized in 2012. New rules allow four states to lead the pack: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Not Florida. Which means if states are awarded delegates in relatively similar numbers to 2008, as Weatherford assumed (something also predicted by the Green Papers for Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina) — New Hampshire and South Carolina will actually have twice as many as were allowed back then. Since the RNC hasn't released its official totals, we can only offer thoughtful estimates, but according to two methods, Iowa and New Hampshire alone would have more delegates than a halved Florida delegation. (First method: Assume 2008-sized delegations, but double New Hampshire and South Carolina. Second method: Rely on the Green Papers estimates.) Wouldn't a normal person think Weatherford meant that Florida's delegates would still outnumber Iowa's, New Hampshire's and at least a chunk of South Carolina's when he said "They’re worth more than Iowa’s, New Hampshire’s and almost South Carolina’s combined"? Weatherford would prefer you not parse his words so carefully: "We were having a free-flowing conversation," he said. "... I was trying to give an illustration that we're still meaningful." So we ran his main idea by some experts in Florida politics, who backed him up. Christopher Mann, a political scientist at the University of Miami with elections expertise, noted that the biggest argument supporting Weatherford's claim is one the future House speaker didn't make: The Florida 2008 primary was "winner take all." McCain won, and so was was awarded every at-large delegate, plus three delegates for every congressional district he took. But in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, delegates were divided among candidates in proportion with the votes they earned. "Thus, Florida's 2012 primary is a bigger prize to win and a more painful to lose," Mann said. "In theory, someone could get zero delegates in the prior three states and still have the most delegates after winning Florida because the delegates in the first three states are likely to be split among several candidates. More likely, a congested field after three proportional primaries will suddenly have a clear front-runner in the delegate count after Florida." Experts from the University of Central Florida and University of South Florida agreed. "Weatherford does have a valid point that by moving up the Florida primary, Florida will have a greater role in selecting the Republican nominee," said Darryl Paulson, professor emeritus of government at University of South Florida. "The 2008 election found that McCain's victory in the Florida primary essentially ended the contest for the presidential nomination." So where does this leave us? Weatherford was on safer ground when he based his claim on 2008 delegate counts. But the 2012 numbers will be different, first because they've yet to be set, and second because delegations for New Hampshire and South Carolina will return to full strength. Meanwhile, Weatherford's underlying point, that Florida's delegate count will add heft to the winning candidate even if it's penalized, is true — and for more reasons than he gave. While we would have preferred he had gotten his delegate math right — and mentioned the "winner take all" nature of Florida's primary — we still rate his statement Half True.

pomt-04854	Says library district would come "at no direct cost to the city budget."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/10/multnomah-county-library-foundation/would-library-taxing-district-reduce-portlands-bud/	Multnomah County leaders decided last week to put a library taxing district on the November ballot -- but even before then it had been a topic of much discussion. A Willamette Week article in mid-July looked at a report from the city of Portland noting that a district would come at a cost to the city’s budget. The weekly called the report a shot across "Multnomah County’s bow." About a week later, the Library Foundation, which helps secure private support for the Multnomah County Library, shot back in a newsletter to supporters. "The City of Portland benefits greatly from our strong library system. That's why it's hard to understand why city leaders would consider opposing an effort that would so clearly help thousands of children, families, seniors and job-seekers, at no direct cost to the city budget." Basically, the foundation said the exact opposite of what Portland’s Office of Management and Finance had said. A few days later -- three business days to be exact -- the foundation attempted a clarification: "In our communication last week, we mentioned the effects of a library district on the City of Portland. For clarification, a library district would increase the city's property tax compression by $7 million. City and county finances, and our tax structure, are complex and the actions of each jurisdiction often impact the other." Now, sometimes a correction is enough to prompt PolitiFact Oregon to drop a subject, but we thought that even with the clarification from the foundation, the issue was confusing enough to warrant a ruling. Since most reporters in The Oregonian newsroom don’t know what tax compression means, we’d imagine the folks receiving the newsletter were similarly confused. With that in mind, we went back to the first statement -- that the district would come at " no direct cost to the city budget." In order to understand the issue of tax compression we called Caryn Brooks, Portland Mayor Sam Adams’ spokeswoman. Tax compression, she said, is about as confusing as it gets. She offered us two things: A report that looked into how the district would affect compression and the number of Josh Harwood, the city economist who wrote it. We gave the report a quick read through, but try as we might, we found it pretty hard to understand. So, we gave up and called Harwood. The first thing we needed -- and no doubt you’ll need, too -- is some background. Thanks to Measure 5, a certain percentage of properties in Oregon have a limit on how much they can be taxed. Now, because of that limit, certain taxes take priority over others. Permanent levies -- those going to the city, county and Port of Portland, for example -- get their take first. If there is still money left to pay out before the cap, then it gets directed to local option levies, which is what the library gets now. As it happens, some properties don’t pay anything to the libraries because they’re tapped out before the library system can get its share. However, if the library district levy goes through, that all changes. The library will be able to grab its slice of the tax pie at the same time as the other permanent levies, essentially chipping away at what certain properties pay out to the county and the city. According to Harwood’s report, which bases its numbers on figures from the county, that’ll mean the city collects about $9.5 million less in property taxes. That reduction, in turn, means about a $7 million reduction in the city’s general fund for the 2013-14 budget period. The city’s budget isn’t the only area that would see cuts, however. The Portland Children’s Levy, which goes toward a number of services for the city’s children, would also see a $1 million reduction. The county would also see a hit, but as Harwood points out in his analysis, the county is already putting cash into the library system. If the library district were to pass, the county could feasibly redirect those funds to other budgetary areas, essentially coming out ahead. We spoke with Merris Sumrall, the Library Foundation’s CEO, as well as Liz Kaufman, who is helping advise on the possible push for a district. Both said that the initial e-mail was sent out in good faith and corrected soon after. The reference to "tax compression" in the follow-up was simply an effort to use the language that the budget officer had used. Moreover, Sumrall noted that she had sent a letter to Mayor Adams and the city commissioners the following day to apologize for the possible confusion and promised a clarification, which she then followed through with. As Sumrall noted -- both when we spoke to her and in the corrected newsletter -- city and county leaders are discussing possible solutions. Still, there doesn’t seem to be any debate that, with things as they are now, the city will ultimately have less money to work with should a library district pass. In the original e-mail, the Library Foundation asserted that the district would come at "no direct cost" to the city budget. It’s true, the city would not have to pay for the library directly, but a district would mean the city has $7 million less to work with. The comment was clarified, but it still left many with the wrong impression. We find this statement False.

pomt-08402	Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/22/bruce-starr/bruce-starr-claims-be-only-state-senator-vote-stro/	One of the nastiest local races this year is in Washington County, where state Sen. Bruce Starr is fending off an aggressive challenge from Rep. Chuck Riley. Starr is a Republican finishing his second term in the Senate, District 15; Riley is a Democrat completing his third term in the House, District 29. Riley has made a big to-do over Starr’s ethics, highlighting the fact that he accepted a free trip to Maui to attend a beer and wine distributors’ conference in 2002. Riley’s campaign also filed a complaint with the Oregon secretary of state’s office, which is still under review, alleging that Starr had claimed too much in mileage reimbursement. For his part, Starr released an ad featuring retired Navy Capt. Greg Wooldridge attesting to the senator’s high ethical standards. But what caught our attention in the TV spot was this claim, spoken by the announcer: "Bruce Starr was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws and greater accountability." A copy of Senate Bill 30 from the 2009 legislative session appears onscreen, implying that was the bill Starr voted for. The only senator? Was Starr the only yes vote on SB 30? And if the bill was so ethically swell, why didn’t the other senators vote yes, too? But wait: Starr didn’t vote for Senate Bill 30 at all. He voted against it. PolitiFact Oregon is as confused as you are. Let’s back up. In late 2006 The Oregonian wrote about a number of legislators who failed to report free trips to Hawaii courtesy of the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association. In response, lawmakers in 2007 approved Senate Bill 10, prohibiting public officials from accepting out-of-state trips, entertainment and fancy meals from lobbyists. The bill expanded which public officials had to report their finances and increased how often they and lobbyists had to file -- from once a year to four times a year. It became law. Then the complaints started. Rural volunteer commissioners quit en masse, calling the disclosure forms onerous and invasive. The disclosure forms also asked for the names of all family members. And nobody liked reporting four times a year when they had nothing new to report. The 2009 Legislature hustled to tweak the law. In the end, Senate Bill 30 allowed limited entertainment and kept a cap on gifts and entertainment to $50 from a single source in a year. Disclosure reports were cut back to every year. More public officials were required to report. It passed. Starr’s was the only no vote in the Senate, as well as in the House, on final passage. He offered no explanation at the time and says now he can’t remember if he offered one anywhere else. In an interview this week, he said he voted against SB 30 because he wanted to maintain the more frequent reporting requirements of Senate Bill 10 for legislators. "The issue I was most concerned about was rolling back the fact that legislators didn’t have to report quarterly," he said. " ... If they had separated the issues, I likely would have voted for SB 30." Starr is correct on that one, narrow issue. More often is better when it comes to disclosure. But to say he was the only senator to vote for stronger ethics laws is wrong. Both Senate bills 10 and 30 sharply curtailed entertainment, meals and trips offered by lobbyists and strengthened Oregon’s ethics laws, and many senators voted in favor of the stricter rules. We rate this False. Comment on this item.	None	Bruce Starr	None	None	None	2010-10-22T06:00:00	2010-10-22	['Bruce_Starr']
pomt-09050	On the use of presidentially appointed commissions.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/01/barack-obama/obama-flip-flops-use-presidential-commissions/	During a campaign appearance in Grand Junction, Colo., on Sept. 17, 2008, Barack Obama made light of his rival, John McCain, for suggesting that a commission study the Wall Street meltdown that had just taken place. "John McCain's big solution to the crisis we're facing is -- get ready for this -- a commission," Obama told the crowd. "A commission. That's Washington-speak for we'll get -- we'll get back to you later." Obama continued, "You know, folks, we don't need a commission to figure out what happened. We know what happened: Too many in Washington and on Wall Street weren't minding the store. CEOs got greedy. Lobbyists got their way. Politicians sat on their hands until it was too late. We don't need a commission to tell us how we got into this mess, we need a president who will lead us out of this mess, and that's the kind of president I intend to be." So what kind of president did Obama become? A president who has established at least four commissions. First, some background. Commissions are typically headed jointly by a Republican and a Democrat. Members may be appointed by the president, Congressional leaders or a mix of the two. The commissions -- sometimes known as blue-ribbon panels -- are charged with studying a thorny topic and making recommendations. Usually the recommendations are not binding, but they can serve as blueprints for future Congressional and presidential action. Sometimes commissions make an impact, such as the bipartisan panel that investigated the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Its recommendations, after some delay, were made into law. Other times, commissions produce reports that get put on a shelf and are quickly forgotten. Some in Washington, such as candidate Obama, dismiss commissions as a way to make it look like you’re making progress in attacking a difficult problem without actually doing the heavy lifting of trying to pass a bill. Experts say that critics of commissions have a point. How useful a commission is "varies widely with the quality of leadership, the amount of funding and the commitment of the staff," said Paul Light, a New York University professor who is currently studying commissions for the Governance Institute. "Some are serious, and some are designed to distract the public and move an issue out of the headlines." Whatever their value, Light added, the number of commissions has climbed over the years. "I suspect (Obama) will end up with 16 to 20 of them if he wins a second term," he said. Obama's commissions aren't on trivial subjects. Here are the ones we were able to locate: • The BP oil spill. On May 22, 2010, Obama signed an order establishing the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. The panel is "tasked with providing recommendations on how we can prevent – and mitigate the impact of – any future spills that result from offshore drilling," according to the White House. Obama named former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly to co-chair the commission. • The national debt. On Feb. 18, 2010, Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission’s co-chairs – former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Senate Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming – were asked to "bring Republicans and Democrats together" to tackle the nation's "looming fiscal challenges." • Nuclear energy policy. On Jan. 29, 2010, Obama asked Energy Secretary Steven Chu to form a "Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future." The panel would "conduct a comprehensive review of policies for managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, including all alternatives for the storage, processing and disposal of civilian and defense used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste." • Bioethics. On Nov. 24, 2009, Obama established a new Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, chaired by University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and vice-chaired by Emory University president James W. Wagner. The commission will "advise the president on bioethical issues that may emerge from advances in biomedicine and related areas of science and technology." The White House declined to comment for this story. To be fair, establishing a commission does not necessarily mean that the administration has taken a pass on these issues. Obviously, the White House is deeply involved on many fronts in tackling the oil spill, from directing the cleanup to pushing legislation through Congress. And on the deficit, the administration has implemented a three-year, non-defense, discretionary spending freeze in this year’s budget, as well as signed a deficit-neutral, pay-as-you-go budget bill. (Not everyone is convinced that these measures will reduce the deficit significantly, however.) Still, we think it’s worth pointing out Obama’s change in stance, since his initial comment was a calculated, pointed barb at McCain and because he’s turned to the commission model as president to address more than just minor issues. Ultimately, on the use of presidentially appointed commissions, Obama merits a Full Flop.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-07-01T16:55:39	2008-09-17	['None']
pomt-03447	The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court "is transparent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-foreign-intelligence-surveillanc/	President Barack Obama has taken a lot of criticism from both friend and foe in the wake of recent disclosures about how the U.S. government monitors telephone and Internet traffic. He defended himself recently in an interview with Charlie Rose on June 17, 2013, making several claims in defense of government surveillance. The full discussion is available here, but one exchange in particular struck us as noteworthy. It involves the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a special court that hears government requests for warrants related to national security investigations. Rose: "So I hear you saying I have no problem with what NSA has been doing." Obama: "Well, let me finish, because I don’t. … (The FBI has) to go to the FISA court with probable cause and ask for a warrant." Rose: "But has FISA court turned down any request?" Obama: "First of all, Charlie, the number of requests are surprisingly small, number one. Number two -- folks don’t go with a query unless they’ve got a pretty good suspicion." Rose: "Should this be transparent in some way?" Obama: "It is transparent, that’s why we set up the FISA court. The whole point of my concern before I was president -- because some people say well, Obama was this raving liberal before, now he’s Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney sometimes says, 'Yes, you know, he took it all, lock stock and barrel.' My concern has always been not that we shouldn’t do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances?" We wondered whether Obama has justification for saying that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court "is transparent." So we decided to investigate. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was established in 1978 to provide oversight of a system that many observers believed had been widely abused by prior administrations. National Security Agency requests for warrants must have certification from Justice Department officials that the target of surveillance is either a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power. These applications are heard by federal judges who serve on the court on a rotating basis. All hearings and decisions are conducted in secret. The public disclosure of the court’s activities is sharply limited, consisting of two sets of statistics sent annually in a letter sent to Congress -- applications for surveillance or physical searches, and applications for business records. According to the most recent letter, about 98 percent of the 1,856 applications for surveillance and searches in 2012 were approved outright, with one withdrawn and 40 others modified. In addition, the government made 212 application for business records. The government modified 200 of these applications, but none was denied. The letter doesn’t offer any details about what was contained in any of these applications, only the raw numbers. The White House argues that the statutes governing the court, combined with Congress’ oversight role, provide checks and balances that come as close to transparency as national security needs permit. And experts say there are good reasons for this secrecy. "If we required that the public be permitted to take a peek at these classified proceedings, we'd be giving that information to foreign powers and terrorists as well, which would be lunacy," said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who once worked for the Justice Department representing the United States before the surveillance court. Instead, Shadel said, "we require transparency in the form of giving other parts of the government -- the judicial and legislative branches, who have different interests and different perspectives from the executive branch -- the power to peek at those classified proceedings." Still, is Obama justified in calling the kind of disclosure the court makes "transparency"? We asked a range of experts on secrecy and public access, and most agreed that Obama is wrong to take credit for any reasonable degree of "transparency" in the court’s operations. While Congress has a degree of oversight over the court, that doesn’t mean there’s transparency -- a word that we think the ordinary person assumes to mean a non-trivial amount of disclosure to the public and the press. "We typically don’t see the court’s opinions interpreting the Constitution or FISA, or its orders directing the government to do or refrain from doing particular things," said Nathan Sales, a law professor at George Mason University. "On occasion, parts of the court’s opinions will be declassified and released to the public, but this is the exception to the rule. The FISA court certainly serves as an important check on the executive branch, but -- usually -- it’s not accurate to call the court ‘transparent.’ " Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. For one of his projects, Harper has assembled a list of four tenets of transparency. The court, he said, doesn’t even meet the first and most important one of these -- providing authoritative sourcing for information. "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s raison d'être is to prevent any information about surveillance from being made available – much less authoritative ones," Harper said. "I don’t know of any plausible meaning of ‘transparent’ that encompasses the ‘oversight behind closed doors’ concept." Freedom of Information advocates seconded this view. "Checks and balances may be related, but they are not the same thing as ‘transparency,’" said Kenneth F. Bunting, executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition. "A court system that has proceedings that are secret and makes secret rulings that are often based on secret interpretations of law cannot fit my definition of the word ‘transparent.’ " We should note that Obama himself has signed a "memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies" about "transparency and open government." While this memorandum was intended to apply to non-classified government information, the court doesn’t come anywhere close to upholding the principles for transparency outlined in it. "My administration," Obama wrote, "is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government. … Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their government is doing. ... My administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use." Our ruling Obama said that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court "is transparent." We don’t doubt that there are good reasons for secrecy at the court, but if you’re going to operate a mostly secret court, you also don’t get to crow about how "transparent" it is. The president can’t have his cake and eat it, too. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-06-21T09:40:36	2013-06-17	['None']
pomt-13138	"The FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton ... and discovered another 650,000 emails."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/01/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trump-fbi-probe-clinton-email/	Donald Trump sounded off a scary Halloween message about Hillary Clinton and the latest developments in her email controversy, which he dubbed "the biggest scandal since Watergate." "As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and discovered — you heard this yesterday, it’s hard to believe — and discovered another 650,000 emails. Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails – just one more lie out of so many," Trump said at a Oct. 31 campaign stop in Michigan. Trump is referring to FBI Director James Comey’s Oct. 28 letter informing Congress that the bureau is looking to examine new evidence potentially relevant to Clinton’s case. But his description is slightly misleading, and the letter did not say anything about the amount of emails involved. First, the FBI didn’t exactly "reopen" the investigation, as it wasn’t formally closed. We can certainly say the FBI is looking into a case that had previously been inactive. Trump is less accurate when he suggests the FBI has discovered hundreds of thousands of new emails relevant to the Clinton case. The number, given to the Wall Street Journal by unnamed sources, refers to the total number of emails found in a separate investigation. It’s unclear how many actually pertain to Clinton and how many are actually new. The 650,000 emails As PolitiFact has reported, unnamed FBI officials told journalists that the new focus began when the FBI found emails on a laptop seized from former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit messages with a 15-year-old girl. Weiner is separated from Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Clinton. Investigators found a total of 650,000 emails on Weiner’s laptop, anonymous sources told the Wall Street Journal. But it remains to be seen how many of those emails involve Clinton, how many are work-related, how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the FBI and whether they contain classified information. The Journal goes on to say that "thousands" could have been sent to or from Clinton’s email server. The Washington Post reported that there are more than 1,000 from the server (though it’s unclear if that refers to the number of threads or individual emails). Other news reports indicate the majority of the 650,000 emails are not related to the Clinton case and the FBI will be examining a small portion of them. A reopened case? Trump, and other Republicans, have said the FBI has "reopened" the investigation into Clinton, while the Clinton camp and others reject that characterization, pointing out neither Comey’s three-paragraph letter to Congress nor a memo he sent to FBI employees uses the word. On one level, this is a bit of semantic quibbling. Former FBI officials told us "reopening" is an imprecise word choice, but it gets at the gist of the latest development. It is likely that the FBI had not administratively closed the Clinton case, though it was no longer an active investigation. On another level, experts told the word "reopens" could imply that officials have found a smoking gun, but that conclusion is premature. FBI cases are "opened," per management assessment, when there is sufficient information for an investigation. They are "closed," also per a management decision, when there is no more investigative or administrative work to be done. "Opening and closing a case is really a matter of preparing an internal communication setting forth the reasons for doing so and having the supervisory chain of command agree with that decision," said Nancy Savage, who served in the FBI for 35 years as a special agent and as a management official. Clearly, the Clinton email investigation (as well as the Weiner case) was officially opened. But while Comey shared the results of the Clinton email investigation in July 2016, "Comey had not indicated that the Clinton email case was ever formally closed," said Mark Pollitt, a former FBI special agent and director who now teaches at Syracuse University. "Given the size and scope of the case, I would be surprised it all the paperwork was done yet," Pollitt said. He pointed out that the Clinton investigation had to be active in order for the FBI to obtain a warrant to search Weiner’s emails for Clinton-related exchanges. So essentially, the case was "reopened" in the sense that the FBI "moved from the administrative wind-up stage back into the active investigative stage," Savage said. Finally, experts cautioned against reading too much into this new development. "There is nothing unusual about this investigation being pursued. It is standard operating procedure," Savage said, adding that Comey simply notified Congress that there was new information that required further investigation. "The FBI more than likely did not know and still does not know what all the information means on this computer, which should have (been) turned over much earlier by Abedin." "The act of reopening a case does not point to any conclusions and is an administrative action within the scope of the earlier review of emails," said Ellen Glasser, a former FBI special agent and supervisor. "Any suggestion that there is a smoking gun, based solely on reopening the case, would be incorrect." Our ruling Trump said, "The FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton ... and discovered another 650,000 emails." Trump has a point that the FBI had stopped actively investigating Clinton emails until the latest development. But experts told us it’s unlikely it was ever formally closed, so "reopen" is an imprecise word. The bigger factual issue is his number. The 650,000 emails were discovered in a separate investigation, and it is not clear just how many are related to Clinton and how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the FBI. Reports indicate that the bureau is examining just a small portion of the 650,000 emails.

pomt-08131	The U.S. "had the opportunity with Israel coming and talking to us about improving our security screening procedures, and we turned them down."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/08/allen-west/west-says-us-failed-learn-israel-after-sept-11/	Allen West, a retied Army lieutenant colonel who won a South Florida Congressional race Nov. 2, 2010, is outspoken on security measures. West was one of a handful of guests on NBC's Meet the Press Nov. 21, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. In the interviews that occurred just days before the big Thanksgiving holiday travel weekend, terrorism and security was one of the main topics, including the controversy about pat-downs of passengers at airports. David Gregory, the show's moderator, asked West a question about airport pat-downs. Here was the full response from West, who represents Congressional District 22 in Broward and Palm Beach counties, according to the MSNBC transcript: "I think it may end up becoming an issue, especially when we come out of this holiday season and we see how that affects us -- the travel and the, and the economy. But I think, once again, it comes back to marketing. I mean, we should have put out some type of feelers and talked to the American people about this before we go and implement this type of plan. And also, when you go back, you look at after September 11, we had the opportunity with Israel coming and talking to us about improving our security screening procedures, and we turned them down. I traveled to Israel, and I tell you what, they have very good procedures, and you don't have to go through all of these very draconian practices." For this Truth-O-Meter, the part of West's claim that we were interested is about Israel. After the terrorist attacks in the skies on Sept. 11, 2001, did the U.S. turn down an opportunity to talk to Israel about airport security screening procedures? We contacted West's spokesperson Angela Sachitano on the afternoon of Dec. 3 and asked her to provide documentation that the U.S. passed up an opportunity to talk to Israel about security screening procedures after Sept. 11. We also asked Sachitano to explain what West meant by "we" had the opportunity to meet with "Israel." Did West mean then-President George Bush? The Pentagon? Congress? And by "Israel" did he mean the airline El Al or some government official or entity in Israel? On Monday morning, Sachitano replied by e-mail: "The Congressman has declined this request." So we proceeded on our own. We interpreted West's claim to mean that some U.S. officials had the opportunity to meet with Israeli officials to discuss how the U.S. could improve airport security screening and the U.S. turned down that opportunity to meet. We did a newspaper clip search about Israel in the month after Sept. 11. We found several articles stating that while Congress was debating a bill to tighten airport security, members of Congress met with representatives from El Al, Israel's state-run airline, behind closed doors. An Oct. 5, 2001, article in the Jerusalem Post stated that Israel was helping the U.S. by providing intelligence assistance and security advice after the terrorist attacks. The Jerusalem Post article stated that "participants in the meeting said the committees would take the advice of the El Al representatives into consideration" when drafting aviation security bills. The Washington Post also wrote about the meeting in an Oct. 5, 2001, article, describing the "four top security experts from El Al" who met with the committee. We also interviewed Greg Soule, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, which was formed after Sept. 11. "TSA has worked with many international partners including Israel since the agency’s inception in November 2001," he wrote. "TSA officials have met with Israeli officials multiple times to discuss transportation security, as well as share best practices and other pertinent information." So clearly U.S. officials -- the TSA and members of Congress -- met with Israeli and El Al officials in the aftermath of Sept. 11. In the late afternoon Dec. 6, we e-mailed our findings to Sachitano to give West one more chance to respond. Sachitano responded by e-mail: "Clearly the Congressman meant that yes, although leaders from the United States did in fact meet with officials from El Al post 911, the U.S. turned down their recommendations. Without a major airline attack since the 1970's, Israel is obviously doing many things right and the Congressman believes the U.S. has a lot to learn from the Israeli's approach to airline security." We asked Sachitano if she could be specific about which recommendations and whether West meant that the U.S. rejected Israel's recommendations or rejected a meeting. She wrote: "The U.S. met with El Al and reviewed its best practices in order to prevent against terrorist attacks to their airplanes However, the U.S. turned down the opportunity to incorporate some of those best practices into U.S. airline security where the screening focus (is) on individuals and the specific threats." We ran that explanation by Rafi Ron, former director of security at Tel Aviv Ben-Gurion International airport and now CEO of New Age Security Solutions in northern Virginia. Ron said that Sachitano's explanation was "more precise." We asked him to explain the difference between the two countries' airport security screening. "The main focus of the Israeli solution is based on the idea that you need to identify the level of risk of each individual passenger and adjust the level of search to the level of risk," Ron said. "Over here there is no such process that identifies the level of risk of every single passenger at all -- the only thing that is done is checking names against the no fly list and watch list. .... The American model can be described as one size fits all while the Israeli solution can be described as a tailored security process based on identifying the level of risk of each passenger. That is a substantial difference." We were not sure if Sachitano was trying to change West's claim after reading our findings that U.S. officials clearly met with Israelis or if from the outset he meant that the U.S. rejected an opportunity to adopt Israeli security screening procedures. We sent West's initial claim to a few other journalists at the Miami Herald and St. Petersburg Times to ask them how they would interpret it -- without telling them what we initially thought. But there was no consensus. So the only thing that was clear about West's claim was that it was not entirely clear what he meant. If he had meant to convey that the U.S. did meet with Israel about airport security screening but rejected suggestions from the Israelis, would that be true? Soule of the TSA also told us that the TSA's behavior detection model is based on the Israeli model -- though Ron said the U.S. lacks Israel's thorough process of interviewing passengers. So that means that the U.S. did not totally reject Israel's procedures but it's clear the two systems are quite different. Though scores of news reports immediately after Sept. 11 highlighted El Al as a model of airport security, several news stories also stated that adopting El Al's model is not so simple. El Al has far fewer flights than major American airlines, spends more on security and uses racial profiling. On Oct. 1, 2001, USA Today wrote: "Still, it is not clear that El Al's security can be duplicated. El Al's flight load -- about 40 flights a day to about 51 destinations -- is minuscule compared with any major American airline. The largest U.S. carrier, American Airlines, by comparison, had about 2,400 daily flights before Sept. 11. And until now, Americans would have resisted the lengthy time involved in the screening process, which can even result in flight delays until the questioning is complete." The article raised concerns about "El Al-style ethnic profiling," noting that passengers are divided into low-risk (Israeli or foreign Jews), medium-risk (non-Jewish foreigners) and extremely high-risk travelers (anyone with an Arabic name). "Single women," it said, "also are considered high-risk, for fear they might be used by Palestinian lovers to carry bombs." An article in the Los Angeles Times Oct. 5, 2001, stated: "Israel's El Al Airlines spends 8% of its revenue on security, 75% of which is subsidized by the government, according to (airport security expert Peter) Walsh. American airliners, by contrast, pay 0.2% or 0.3% of their revenue toward security." Let's review West's words: "And also, when you go back, you look at after September 11, we had the opportunity with Israel coming and talking to us about improving our security screening procedures, and we turned them down." It's possible for those who read or heard West's claim to interpret that to mean the U.S. rejected the opportunity to meet with Israel to talk about improving airport security screening procedures. On that front, he would clearly get a False rating since TSA officials met with Israelis and members of Congress met with El Al. At PolitiFact Florida, we evaluate politicians' actual words. In this case West's words weren't clear and he initially declined to explain himself. Only after we sent West our findings showing that the U.S. did meet with the Israelis did he offer an alternative explanation -- that the U.S. met with Israeli officials but rejected their model for improving our airport security screening -- and we find some truth in that. So we rate this claim Half True.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2010-12-08T16:07:00	2010-11-21	['United_States', 'Israel']
pomt-14310	Emory University students were provided counseling after someone wrote "Trump 2016" in chalk on campus.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2016/mar/31/viral-media-reports/media-base-claims-about-emory-counseling-after-tru/	Oh, the horrors of the academic life. The long walks to class, the agony of trying to decide between a skinny latte or an iced espresso caramel macchiato at Starbucks. Now comes the possibility that someone might actually write a leading presidential contender’s name in chalk in a public place at a highly regarded institution of higher learning. That happened on a recent Sunday night(or early Monday morning) at Emory University when someone wrote GOP front-runner Donald Trump’s name in chalk across the campus. The "chalking" incident ignited a campus protest where some students expressed "pain" and rabid paranoia in wake of the serial pro-Trump scribblings. The protesters were immediately pilloried from the right and left as a bunch of coddled whiners. One part of the news stories and viral social media posts caught PolitiFact’s attention. Many of the reports said the offended students were provided counseling to ease their PTSD — Post Trump Scribbling Disorder. Say it ain’t so. Well, PolitiFact Georgia discovered it mostly ain’t. The trouble began when a yet-to-be-identified person(s) wrote pro-Trump slogans in chalk on sidewalks, steps and railings on the campus. Horrified students awoke to the madness and quickly noted Trump’s penchant for the politically controversial. Trump has advocated deporting all illegal immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the U.S. The student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, reported that about 40 students soon staged a campus protest, at one point shouting to the school’s administration: "You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!" Then students moved into the administration building calling out: "It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains." Critics saw the incident as political correctness run amok at an institution that is supposed to promote free speech and a diversity of ideas. The pundits pounced. The story was carried across the globe. Left-leaning comedian Bill Maher said this: "I so badly want to dropkick these kids into a place where there is actual pain and suffering." Larry Wilmore fired off a brutal Comedy Central segment, complete with a fake Emory student (Justice Davenport) who opined: "I had no idea I went to school with people who had different opinions from me. It’s terrifying." Newspapers, network television and social media joined the beat-down, many asserting that counseling was being offered to soothe the bruised psyches of the offended students. But that part of the story is off base, Emory spokeswoman Elaine Justice said. "Emory University did not offer counseling to students as a result of the incident and subsequent controversy," Justice said in an email. Part of the counseling confusion comes from a March 22 email sent to students. The email refers to "emergency funds" offered "for student groups seeking to respond to the incident." But those funds were not for counseling, Justice said. Snopes.com ruled as "false" one report that Emory provided "emergency counseling." "Likewise, the (Student Government Association) and College Council offered ‘open office hours’ to their fellow students, not counseling," Justice said. But Justice also added this: "As is the case at every university, counseling is routinely available to all students in whatever circumstances they are experiencing." Did any Emory student seek that routinely available counseling as a result of the chalkings? Justice said she did not know. Our ruling Various media outlets reported that counseling was specifically offered to Emory students upset over the fact that someone chalked pro-Trump messages on campus. But no funds were provided for any kind of emergency counseling due to the incident. Counseling is routinely provided to Emory students upon request. But there was no organized effort to counsel students due to this specific incident. The university cannot confirm whether any individual students sought routine counseling as a result of the chalkings. And that does create a bit of uncertainty in the dust-up over the Trump chalkings and their aftermath. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-10109	Between 40 and 50 percent of tax filers do not owe any income tax.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/20/john-mccain/closer-to-40-percent-than-50-percent/	In an interview with Fox News, John McCain was asked about Barack Obama's claim that 95 percent of Americans will not see their taxes go up under Obama's proposals. "You spent a lot of time in your debate dealing with that. Is that honest? Is that truthful?" commentator Sean Hannity asked in the Oct. 12, 2008, interview. "Well, first of all, it's not truthful in the respect that 50 percent or 40 percent of the American people — of taxpayers — American citizens don't pay taxes, federal income taxes," McCain said. McCain's statement is phrased a little awkwardly, but the context of the conversation makes it clear that he's talking about the number of tax filers who don't owe any income tax thanks to credits and deductions. In their conversation, Hannity and McCain also say that Obama has promised a tax cut for 95 percent of "Americans," which would be all tax filers. But Obama's policies do not provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans — it's actually about 81 percent of all American tax filers. Sometimes, though, Obama is more careful in his statements and claims that his tax put will give 95 percent of "working families" a tax cut. This percentage for workers holds up pretty well even if you do not consider people who don't owe taxes. For more on why that is, read our story here . For this ruling, however, we wanted to focus on how many people don't pay federal taxes because they qualify for enough credits or deductions that they don't owe any taxes. Common credits include the earned income tax credit for low-wage workers, the child tax credit, education credits, and credits for child care expenses. Common deductions include medical and dental expenses, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, educational expenses and business expenses. Many credits are refundable, which means the government sends a check if the taxes owed are less than zero. Deductions generally reduce taxes owed to zero, with no check sent if the tax bill is less than zero. We consulted the nonpartisan experts at the Tax Policy Center. They said that the percent of taxpayers with zero or negative individual income tax liability will be 38 percent in 2009. That's pretty close to 40 percent, the low end of the range McCain said. If McCain had said it was 40 percent, we would have ruled that his statement was True, because he would only be two points off. But he also said it could be around 50 percent, and that seems like pushing the envelope a tad too far. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-15295	"Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said" about John McCain’s military record.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/22/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-al-franken-said-almost-exactly-what-/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s denunciation of Arizona Sen. John McCain’s military record may have stunned the political world, but some pundits played down Trump’s diss by resurrecting a similarly worded quote about McCain from a Democrat 15 years ago. Pundits from Rush Limbaugh to The Weekly Standard’s John McCormack to MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough have pointed to McCain’s current colleague Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., as another man who questioned the valor of McCain’s POW experience. Limbaugh in particular said on his July 20 radio show that the lack of uproar around Franken’s comments proves the bias of "leftists" and the media. "Al Franken, back in 2002 before he was running for anything, Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said," Limbaugh said. "There hasn’t been any outrage at any of this that has been said about McCain by leftists. Proving my point -- when leftists attack McCain, they are perfectly warranted because they are nice people and they are compassionate people and they’re politically correct people." Limbaugh contrasted this to Trump’s portrayal of McCain. "He’s not a war hero," Trump said July 18 at the Family Leadership Summit, a presidential forum in Ames, Iowa. "He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured." We wanted to find out if Limbaugh was comparing apples to apples. Did Franken really insult McCain like Trump? Remembering Franken’s comedic past Relevant to this fact-check is Franken’s former day job. Before he joined the U.S. Senate in 2009, Franken worked as a comedy writer and actor. He was on staff of Saturday Night Live in its first few seasons and again from 1985 to 1995. After that, he wrote several books that parodied conservative politics, including 1999’s Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations. In his 2004 book Lies: And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them, Franken describes a 1999 speech he gave to the White House News Photographers Association in which he rattles off essentially the same lines. According to his book, the riff went like this (italics are Franken’s): "Hey, I like John McCain. And I really think he’s courageous. I mean, his stance on campaign finance reform and tobacco. Wow. That takes guts. But this whole ‘war hero’ thing — I don’t get it. I mean, as far as I’m concerned, he sat out the war. I mean, anyone can get captured! Am I wrong, but isn’t the idea to capture the other guy?" The line was skewered in the conservative Washington Times as "landing with a thud." Franken, though, described it as getting "big laughs" with the news photographers and said the Times had put his remarks through the "de-irony-izer" to make him look unpatriotic. (We could not find more coverage of the speech.) In the book, Franken framed the joke in the context of admiring McCain, with whom he shared a mutual friend in a Vietnam War protester. Most pundits comparing Franken's comments to Trump's aren't using this speech as their example. Instead they highlight a 2000 Salon.com article that featured a few paragraphs from Franken and other newsmakers about the 2000 presidential election. McCain vied for the GOP nomination that year but withdrew from the race in March 2000 as George W. Bush pulled ahead. "I doubt I could cross the line and vote Republican. I have tremendous respect for McCain but I don’t buy the war hero thing. Anybody can be captured. I thought the idea was to capture them. As far as I’m concerned he sat out the war." Limbaugh was quick to point out the similarities between the two statements, crying foul at the perceived double standard for conservatives and liberals. But Limbaugh appears to have missed Franken’s intent, even if it was not obvious According to Franken press secretary Michael Dale-Stein, the remark "was a joke." (Michael Alvear, the author of the Salon piece, no longer works for the publication and couldn’t be reached for comment.) More than taking Dale-Stein’s word for it, we looked for more evidence. The Salon piece wasn’t the last time Franken used the bit about McCain’s war record. In 2004, Franken had McCain as a guest on his Air America radio show, The O’Franken Factor, where he retooled the bit for a third time. Franken jokingly suggested that only McCain’s political courage should be rewarded, and not his military service in Vietnam. Franken’s Senate office provided only the following excerpt from the interview. We tried to locate a copy or transcript of the show but could not find one. "Because, I mean, I consider you a hero, tremendous political courage," Franken tells McCain, according to a transcript provided by Franken’s office, "not, you know, the thing about five years, or five and a half years at the Hanoi Hilton; as far as I'm concerned you just sat out the war. I don't consider that real heroism. Anybody can get captured, right?" Some news accounts at the time suggested that Franken "took considerable heat" for talking about McCain’s imprisonment so lightly. MSNBC’s Scarborough recently said on Morning Joe that Trump was repeating Franken's "despicable joke." Spokespersons for Limbaugh and McCain could not be reached for comment. Our rating Limbaugh claimed, "Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said" about John McCain’s war-hero credentials. Franken has literally used similar words as Trump in describing McCain’s military record — but it’s misleading to look at the comments without context. A closer look at Franken’s books and coverage of the 1999 event where he used this bit — before the Salon article came out — shows Franken meant the insult sarcastically. It may be a despicable joke to some, but it’s a joke nonetheless. Trump, however, has not insisted that his comment was meant as satire. Limbaugh’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02534	On abortion	half flip	/florida/statements/2014/feb/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-has-called-himself-pro-life-and-pro-/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist has done a slew of national television interviews recently promoting his new book, The Party's Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat. So it’s only natural that he’s been quizzed on his political evolution. On Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor on Feb. 4, Bill O’Reilly asked Crist about his changing stance on abortion. "On abortion, you wanted in the State of Florida to outlaw it, except in rape and incest," O’Reilly said. "But, now, you morphed into, ‘Hey it's a woman's body. She can do what she wants.’ It's a pretty big change." In response, Crist portrayed himself as being consistent on the topic. "When I was a young state senator from Tampa Bay -- back in the early ‘90s is when I got elected -- one of the first votes I had as a state senator was on a health care committee. And the bill said you have to have a 24-hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion if she is making that decision. As a Republican, back in the ‘90s, I voted against the bill. As a result of my ‘no’ vote it died on a tie vote. So I’ve always been pro-life personally. But in terms of wanting to change the law, what I said in 2006 was ‘I’d rather change hearts than laws’ and that’s still how I feel." We decided to put Crist’s stances on abortion on our Flip-O-Meter. We’re not passing judgment on whether a change of position is right or wrong; we’re merely documenting whether there actually has been a change of position or not. We went to the archives to review our earlier fact-checks about Crist’s views on abortion. Overall, we’ve found it hard to label Crist at any point as an abortion rights supporter or an opponent, because he’s been all over the map on the issue. Let’s review the evidence. Crist as a state legislator In 1992 when he ran for the state Legislature, Crist said he was "pro-choice" but opposed to state-funded abortion, the Miami Herald reported. Crist won that race. In 1995, Crist was a Republican state senator from St. Petersburg serving on a Senate health care committee. As he told O’Reilly, Crist joined Democrats in voting against a bill that would have required a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion. The 3-3 vote meant that the bill failed. The Tampa Bay Times reported then that Crist was a supporter of abortion rights: "I generally don't like the government telling people what to do," Crist said. "I believe in individual rights and freedom. That's why I'm a Republican." But the next year, the health care committee approved a waiting period bill 5-3, after an amendment offered by Crist to restrict the bill to women younger than 18. News reports at the time said Crist favored abortion rights but wanted minors to be adequately counseled. The bill failed in the House. In March 1998, then-Sen. Crist voted to override Gov. Lawton Chiles’ veto of a bill banning what opponents call a "partial birth" abortion, a late-term procedure. The House and Senate successfully overrode the veto and that summer the Supreme Court upheld the ban. When he was running for the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Times: "I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government." When debating his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Bob Graham, Crist was asked if he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortion. "No, I would not," Crist said. "I think this is a very personal decision. And I think it is a decision that a woman should make and have the right to make after consulting with her family, her physician and her clergy but not her government." The 2006 governor’s race In 2006 when he was running for governor, the Times wrote that "On abortion, Crist’s position is a moving target," noting that Crist called himself pro-life. But he didn’t support repealing the U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade, and he opposed a 24-hour waiting period for abortion. "I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession," said Crist, whose father is a doctor. Also during the 2006 race, he told a priest in Pensacola that he would sign a bill outlawing abortions except when the mother’s life was at stake. But then he told an AP reporter that he would only sign such a bill if it included exceptions for rape and incest. As Crist and then CFO Tom Gallagher competed for votes in a Republican primary, Crist launched an attack ad calling Gallagher "pro-choice" and referring to himself as "pro-life." Later, in the general election debate against Democrat Jim Davis, Crist said: "I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,"' Crist said. "I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law. . . . I'm pro-life and I'm proud of it, but I don't think that I should impose my will on other people as a result of it." The 2010 Senate race In January 2010, Crist’s Republican U.S. Senate campaign released a statement saying he would "fight for pro-life legislative efforts." In April, as he lagged in a primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the Republican Party to become a "no party affiliation" candidate. Weeks later, he vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure "punitive" and that the measure was "almost mean-spirited." Crist lost the Senate race in 2010 and left the governor’s office in January 2011. Post 2010 In 2012, Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Times and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women’s issues. "Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims," Crist wrote. Crist was exaggerating here. The platform clearly opposed most abortions but was vague on the details. It does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims. Also, there is no official Akin amendment referring to then-Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri who made the "legitimate rape" comment. We rated Crist’s statement Half True. A few months later, Crist officially signed papers to become a Democrat at a Christmas reception at the White House. We sent a sample of Crist’s past stances on abortion to his campaign. "He is pro-life. He’s just not anti-choice," replied Kevin Cate, a paid Crist adviser. "They aren’t mutually exclusive." Cate argued that Crist has been consistent in that he is "personally pro-life" but believes the government should not interfere with decisions between a woman and her doctor. In an interview with Watermark, a Central Florida publication that covers the gay community, Crist was asked about his stance on abortion in December: "It’s confusing because I’m ‘pro-life,’ but by my definition. I’m for life. But I don’t believe the government should tell women what they can and can’t do with their bodies. That may sound inconsistent… I don’t care. I think we’re all for life, and I don’t like the fact that one side of this issue has taken that term and made it theirs. Because when they say they’re pro-life, what are they saying about those of us who believe in choice… that we’re pro-death?! We’re all pro-life. So I’m pro-life, and I’m pro-choice. I’m pro-life because I’m for life, but I will not impose my will on others." Our Flip-O-Meter rating If we look at Crist’s comments and actions on abortion in sum over his career, this much is clear: He has been conflicted about abortion. In fact, we struggled to find a consistent position he's ever held on the matter. Crist has used the "pro-life" and "pro-choice" labels to describe himself at different points in his career, and he now says he is both. There is a kernel of consistency in that he often -- but not always -- talked about being personally "pro-life" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors. What is more telling is his stances on particular abortion laws. He has backed restrictions such as a waiting period for minors and a ban on partial birth abortion. But he's also rejected a waiting period for adults and has said he doesn’t want to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Overall, Crist seems to have partially changed position several times, without having any one inflexible position along the way. For this reason, we rate his position on abortion a Half Flip.

pomt-08568	"The Wisconsin Legislature raised taxes more than $5 billion in 2009."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/28/rebecca-kleefisch/republican-lieutenant-governor-candidate-rebecca-k/	Rebecca Kleefisch knows that some voters who might back the 2010 Republican ticket for governor distrust the media as a bunch of liberals. So the former TV anchor, and new GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, stresses she is a conservative committed to cutting taxes. Perhaps to fire up the faithful, Kleefisch declared on her campaign website: "The Wisconsin Legislature raised taxes more than $5 billion in 2009." That’s a lot of dough. And with Assembly Majority Leader Tom Nelson winning the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor, it may be that much easier to tie the tax hike to the party’s candidate for governor, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. When we called and e-mailed the Kleefisch campaign, we were promised a response on where the $5 billion figure came from. We tried again the next day, but again got no reply. Finally, Kleefisch campaign spokeswoman Jeanne Tarantino referred us to the campaign of Scott Walker, the Republican nominee for governor. Walker and Kleefisch are running as a ticket, she explained. OK. But something didn’t smell right. We rechecked the Kleefisch website and found that the Issues page -- which contained her claim about the $5 billion in tax increases -- had been taken down. Now, when you click on that section of Kleefisch’s home page, you’re redirected to the Issues section of Walker’s campaign site. That’s the only place on RebeccaForReal.com where you’re jettisoned to ScottWalker.org. The switch was made, said Walker campaign spokeswoman Jill Bader, because Walker and Kleefisch "have a shared platform." That gave us a sense, as we reached for the calculator, of where Kleefisch’s claim was heading. Incidentally, Kleefisch gave the same quote about the $5 billion in new taxes to a website called ConservativeFeatures.com, according to a transcript of an interview. The transcript is still on that website. So, on to the numbers. Don’t worry, it’s simple math. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the nonpartisan numbers cruncher of the state Legislature, said the Legislature raised taxes and fees twice in 2009. Kleefisch’s statement mentioned only taxes, but for simplicity we will include fees here. The hikes were done in a budget-adjustment bill approved in February and in the 2009-’11 state budget, adopted in June. The total increases in taxes and fees break down like this: Budget-adjustment bill: $1.22 billion. That included $290.4 million in tax increases, primarily through corporate income and franchise tax "combined reporting," plus $925.2 million from a new assessment on hospital patient revenues. Budget bill: $1.92 billion. That included boosts of hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on cigarettes, high-income earners and capital gains investments. That tallies up to $3.14 billion. A hefty sum, to be sure. But roughly a couple billion shy of Kleefisch’s claim. The Walker campaign’s policy director, Ryan Murray, defended Kleefisch’s statement. He agreed that the two major actions taken by the Legislature in 2009 raised taxes and fees by $3.14 billion. But, to get past the $5 billion threshold, Murray added a $1.5 billion boost in net property taxes and $130.4 million more from "enhanced collection measures." Let’s take those one at a time. Property taxes: Those levies are set by local taxing bodies, such as the city and the county, not the Legislature. Murray conceded that fact. However, he said property taxes should be added toward the $5 billion total because action by the Legislature, such as cutting aid to schools, affects what happens to property taxes. The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonprofit research organization, said the 2009-’11 state budget would put pressure on school property tax levies because, compared with 2008-’09, state aid would be 2.7 percent lower in the first year of the budget and 2.5 percent lower in the second. But state legislative action is only one of many factors that bear on property taxes; and it’s still the case that local officials, not the Legislature, ultimately decide how high to set the levy. Enhanced collection measures: These steps include hiring 30 more state Department of Revenue employees for "enhanced enforcement of current tax laws." Said Murray: "This is just the government hassling people to pay more taxes." It is true that the measures, if successful, will bring more dollars into state coffers. But there’s no tax increase levied on residents. If anything, the action would lighten the load on those who are already paying up. Where does that leave us? In emphasizing that taxes are too high, Kleefish overstated by nearly $2 billion how much taxes were raised in 2009 by the Legislature and Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s no rounding error. The Walker-Kleefisch campaign, in an attempt to get past the $5 billion threshold Kleefisch set, adds in property taxes, which are ultimately set at the local level, and then throws in redoubled efforts to collect existing taxes.

The city it had in mind is Atlanta. If you haven’t heard of the great unrest on Peachtree Street or any other spot in Atlanta, that’s because there isn’t any. "There is nothing happening at any of our polling places today that requires a police response," Carlos Campos, public affairs director for the Atlanta Police Department. "We are not responding to the New Black Panthers or anyone. It’s smooth sailing." As anyone reading further in the article will see, the headline is a dressed up take on a demonstration that happened over the weekend. The Atlanta chapter of the New Black Panther Party –– not to be confused with the original Black Panther Party, members of which have disavowed the new group –– held what it called an "armed rally against voter suppression" on Saturday, Nov. 3. A handful of members bearing semi-automatic style weapons walked around Atlanta’s West End neighborhood. A photo posted on the New Black Panther Party’s Facebook page, Nov. 3, 2018 In some photos, they hold signs for Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor. (If she wins, she would be the country’s first African-American woman governor.) The New Black Panther Party posted over 20 photos on its Facebook page, along with the disclaimer that, "we are not working for and we did not plan this event with either campaign, and we have members with different political views both here in Atlanta as well as nationwide and even right here in this post." Under Georgia law, it is legal to carry long guns, including semi-automatic rifles, in public. Brian Kemp, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, tweeted a photo from the rally Nov. 4, saying "How radical is my opponent? Look at who is backing her. The New Black Panther Party is ‘a racist...antisemitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews, and law enforcement.’" Abrams campaign spokeswoman Abigail Collazo responded to the rally and the photos Monday. "Brian Kemp is the only candidate in this race who has posed for pictures with supporters wearing racist, hate-filled T-shirts and refused to denounce them, while Abrams continues to condemn any racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise discriminatory words and actions," Collazo said. All that said, there is no war on the streets of Atlanta on Election Day. Just ordinary, peaceful voting.

pomt-09378	Rubio's tax swap proposal "would have been a massive tax increase."	false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/28/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-calls-marco-rubios-2007-tax-swap-pro/	Gov. Charlie Crist launched what amounts to a nuclear attack in Republican politics during his FOX News Sunday showdown with Marco Rubio. Crist labeled Rubio, the former House speaker, a tax raiser. In a back and forth about each other's record on tax issues, Crist singled out Rubio's failed 2007 plan that would have eliminated property taxes for many Floridians in exchange for an increase to the state sales tax. The tax swap "would have been a massive tax increase," Crist said during the March 28, 2010, U.S. Senate debate. "In all due respect to the speaker, you've just got to tell the truth to people. And that's really what this is all about." Rubio contends that the tax swap would have been a huge, net tax cut. And that the plan was supported by former Gov. Jeb Bush. Would it have been a tax cut? Or a tax hike? Let's take a look. In his first months as speaker in early 2007, Rubio proposed a fundamental change in Florida's tax structure. The proposal would scratch property taxes on all primary residences. In its place, the state sales tax would be increased by 2.5 cents per dollar -- subject to voter approval. A House analysis originally said the swap would save taxpayers a total of $5.8 billion in the first year, which certainly is contrary to Crist's claim. But whether you saved money or spent more money at the end of the year likely depended on your individual circumstances. Back in 2007, the St. Petersburg Times ran calculations under Rubio's proposal for both homeowners and renters. The homeowners A family of four with an annual income of $64,280. Home value: $241,100 CURRENT Property tax bill in Tampa: $5,061.06 Sales taxes paid: $951 PROPOSED Property tax bill in Tampa: $0 Sales taxes paid: $1,290 Under Rubio's plan, these homeowners would have paid $4,722 less in state taxes, the Times found. Contrast that with renters: The renters A family of two with an annual income of $46,914 CURRENT Rent: $851 Sales taxes paid: $691 PROPOSED Rent: $851 Sales taxes paid: $937 Under Rubio's plan, these renters would pay an additional $246 a year in taxes. The rental property owners also would still have to pay property taxes, meaning rent wouldn't be affected. "He talked about it being a swap, and it would be a swap because those who owned their home wouldn't have to pay a tax anymore," Crist said during the debate. "Forty percent of my fellow Floridians are renters. It would not have applied to them at all. All they would have enjoyed is his tax increase." Rubio responded: "The renters would have had an opportunity to buy now because the exorbitant taxes that we pay on property in Florida would not have gone up." Conversely Rubio pointed out that the increased sales tax would bring more revenue into the state from non-resident visitors. If tourists contribute more, he said, Floridians contribute less. Rubio's proposal got the seal of approval from Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a Rubio supporter. In 2007, he wrote legislators saying Rubio's tax swap proposal amounted to a net tax cut. "Speaker Rubio’s proposal is a net tax cut, thus a vote for the proposal would not constitute a violation of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge," Norquist wrote. "All taxpayers of Florida would reap the benefits of a lower tax burden and significant spending restraint on the state as well as on the local level." A later House study said the sales tax increase would generate $9.3 billion in exchange for eliminating $15.8 billion in property taxes. (Here's a House analysis of the swap, which was combined with other tax initiatives). "Only in Tallahassee could a bunch of politicians declare that a $7 billion net tax savings is a tax increase," Rep. Adam Hasner, R-Delray Beach, told the Palm Beach Post. Yet some did vote against the proposal saying it was a tax increase. The swap ultimately was killed by the state Senate. Crist spokeswoman Andrea Saul noted that Rubio himself said the tax swap was a tax increase during the March 28, 2010, debate. According to transcripts, Rubio said: "Well, let me tell you about that supposed program to raise taxes that he keeps talking about. It was probably the largest tax increase in Florida's history. It would have eliminated property taxes for all sorts of people. And it was supported by (none other) than Jeb Bush." A Rubio spokesman, Alberto Martinez, said Rubio mispoke. "Not shocking they would try to distort that," Martinez said. Based on the statements that surround Rubio's "largest tax increase" line, it seems reasonable to us that he meant to say decrease. Back to Crist. He said Rubio's tax swap proposal "would have been a massive tax increase." At its most basic level, Rubio's proposal was a tax increase and a tax decrease. The state sales tax would go up, and the property taxes would go down. On the micro level, some people would pay more and others would pay less. At the macro level, two different studies said Floridians would have paid less -- between $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion. While generally we are leery about tax impact projections, there is no suggestion Rubio's plan would have resulted in a tax increase statewide and certainly not a "massive" one as Crist suggests. As such, we rate Crist's claim False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-03-28T17:45:34	2010-03-28	['None']
pomt-06268	"Since Obama took office, a net of 540,000 additional black Americans – Obama’s strongest supporters – have lost their jobs."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/27/new-jersey-tea-party/new-jersey-tea-party-blames-barack-obama-unemploym/	Black and recently unemployed? Blame President Barack Obama, says the New Jersey Tea Party. "Since Obama took office, a net of 540,000 additional black Americans – Obama’s strongest supporters – have lost their jobs," the Tea Party retweeted to its followers on Sept. 2. The original tweet came from Ken Gardner, a junior fellow for The Right Sphere, a conservative website, and was retweeted by Jeff M. Weingarten, president of Morristown Tea Party Organization. Pinning a race’s employment status solely on the president of the United States seemed rather strong so PolitiFact New Jersey checked the statement. Turns out the unemployment statistic in the tweet is accurate, but blaming the president is less clear. First, let’s break down the different elements of the statement. The number of employed blacks dropped by 540,000 people from January 2009 through August 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, DC. The number of employed whites for the same time frame dropped by 2.15 million. But that doesn’t matter, Weingarten said in a phone interview, because the percentage of unemployed blacks is disproportionately higher than that of whites, which has a larger population. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People acknowledges the high rate of unemployment for blacks, but doesn’t blame Obama, said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy. Both Shelton and the U.S. Department of Labor noted that initiatives such as education and more training and employment services could help blacks get more jobs. But Weingarten said other issues need to be addressed. He said Obama "is squarely to blame" for the employment decrease among blacks because of programs such as "Obamacare" and unwillingness by corporations to spend money in a still-shaky economy. "When you are the commander in chief and leader of the country, you are the one that promulgates and sees to it that policies are enacted or not," Weingarten said. Issues critical to the black community, including jobs, has always been on Obama’s radar, according to a recent Associated Press article. Appearing at a daylong White House summit of black business, community and political leaders on Nov. 9, Obama said the current 15.1 percent unemployment rate among blacks is "way too high," and that other problems that plagued black communities before he took office, such as housing and education, have worsened. The White House also disputed arguments that Obama has not targeted problems faced by blacks, according to the article. "Since day one, the president has fought for the policies that matter to the African-American community," White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said. Shelton said Obama has attempted to address unemployment for all races but a number of bills have stalled or failed in Congress, or couldn’t get committee hearings. Given that, blaming the president seems disingenuous, Shelton said. "It’s almost like someone deciding to knock you down and then blame you for falling," he said. But blame can be placed on Obama, said Mychal Massie, chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives. "Does Obama represent the government of the United States? If he represents the government of the United States then the answer is yes, unequivocally so, disgracefully and shamefully so, but not because he’s black," Massie said. "He is a poor example of leadership, and his profound ignorance of what it takes to rally an economy and his even more vacuous understanding of free-market enterprise and how it contributes to the creation of jobs." Our ruling The Tea Party blames Obama for an additional half million blacks being unemployed since he took office. The group’s number of 540,000 unemployed is correct, and the NAACP concurs that blacks are among Obama’s biggest supporters. We heard varying opinions on whether the president is to blame for that job loss and it’s clear there are a variety of factors at work -- some under the president’s jurisdiction, some not. Partially accurate claims that leave out important details fits the definition of our ruling: Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11187	"BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/17/true-american/ohio-opioid-crisis-real-headline-misleading/	An alarming headline stated there was a sudden massive death wave in Ohio, but the facts show there was no one-day wipeout. "BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio," said the May 13 headline on True American, a website with a lot of clickbait headlines. The story is a ripoff of the same misleading stories that appeared in June 2017 on multiple websites. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline could lead viewers to believe there was a sudden one-day death toll in Ohio, but the story actually refers to ongoing deaths from opioids in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located. "The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can’t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in," the story stated. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But later in the story, it said that the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner confirmed that 60 people died in February "from the same alarming cause." The story quoted a news report by FOX - 8 WJW (Cleveland, Ohio) about the overdose deaths. While the True American story has a May 2018 dateline, the TV report was from March 2017 and refers to February 2017 data released by the medical examiner. The TV station reported that "at least 60 died from heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two, bringing this year's total to 109." The report said that the number could rise as toxicology results were received in additional cases, but the 60 deaths outpaced the previous one-month record of 57 drug fatalities in September 2016. The data came from information released by the medical examiner to the media. Christopher Harris, a spokesman for the medical examiner, told PolitiFact that the final number for February 2017 for opioid-related deaths was 65. For all of 2017, there were 727 total drug deaths; 553 opioid related. In 2018 so far, there have been at least 137 suspected opioid related deaths: Ohio is one of the hardest hit states in the nation by the opioid epidemic. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the increase in homicides in Ohio. Our ruling A headline said, "BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio." The scare-tactic headline creates a false impression that something catastrophic happened to cause 60 people to suddenly drop dead. In reality, the Cuyahoga Medical Examiner initially found that 60 died from overdoses in February 2017, and later reported the final number was 65. So the number is also incomplete and outdated.

pomt-13869	"The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/06/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-average-holding-time-stocks-has-f/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner joined the ranks of Wall Street critics during a recent radio interview, by complaining that investors increasingly are focused on reaping quick profits from companies at the expense of long-term value. "The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months," he said during an interview on "Cat’s Roundtable," a New York City radio talk show hosted by John Catsimatidis, a billionaire businessman. We wondered whether Warner, D-Va., is right about the plunge in share-holding time. Warner’s office sent us a variety of articles by academics, investment strategists, newspapers and magazines that contained similar statistics to the ones cited by the senator. The source of the historic data is the New York Stock Exchange which, for most of the 20th century, was the dominant U.S. stock-trading venue. Here’s the NYSE’s average holding period for stocks at the start of each new decade, beginning at Warner’s mark in 1960: •1960, eight years, four months; •1970, five years, three months; •1980, two years, nine months; •1990, two years, two months; and •2000, one year, two months. But many new trading venues have opened and expanded in recent decades - E*Trade and NASDAQ, for example - and the New York Stock Exchange’s dominance has diminished. About 25 percent of all U.S. trading now occurs on the NYSE, which has high financial requirements for the companies it lists and generally deals with large, stable stocks. In 2004, the NYSE changed its formula for calculating average share-holding periods to focus on its own listings. Credit Suisse that year began computing share-holding data that reflect the broader U.S. stock market. Credit Suisse figures show that in 2008 and 2009, when the nation was mired in the Great Recession, shares turned over an average almost five times a year. That’s slowed to about three times a year since 2013 or, as Warner put it, once every four months. The World Bank offers more conservative figures, saying U.S. shares, on average, turned over four times a year during the Great Recession and that slowed to 1.65 times a year in 2015 - or about once every eight months. Stock market analysts and academics note a variety of reasons for the quickening turnover of shares. Many say the days of small ma-and-pa investors have given way to an era of mutual funds and hedge funds that exert strong pressure of companies to produce short-term profits. The growth of e-trading also is cited; so are federal laws passed in 1993 that tied the bonuses of executives to their achievement of measurable performance goals in order for the bonuses to be tax-deductible for their companies. Warner said the consequence of "activist investors" is that corporations pay less attention to training workers and to research and development. He said Congress should explore offering tax incentives to companies that embrace those long-range goals. Many activist investors, to the contrary, say their actions have been beneficial and note that the stock market has continued to rise over the decades. Our ruling Warner said, "The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months." The gist of Warner’s statement is undeniable: The average holding period for stocks has eroded greatly during the past 56 years. The specifics of Warner’s statement, however, need a little elaboration. Estimates by Credit Suisse jibe with Warner’s claim that shares, on average, now are held for four months. The World Bank estimates the holding period now is about eight months. So we rate Warner’s statement Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2825f4d2-7663-4da5-8b09-70db1503d5e3	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2016-07-06T00:00:00	2016-06-19	['None']
pomt-09860	Seniors and the disabled "will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/10/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-barack-obama-death-panel/	Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, urged her supporters to oppose Democratic plans for health care reform on her Facebook page. "As more Americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through Congress, our collective jaw is dropping, and we’re saying not just no, but hell no!" wrote Palin in a note posted Aug. 7, 2009. She said that the Democrats plan to reduce health care costs by simply refusing to pay for care. "And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil." We agree with Palin that such a system would be evil. But it's definitely not what President Barack Obama or any other Democrat has proposed. We have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's "level of productivity in society" to determine whether they are "worthy" of health care. Palin's claim sounds a little like another statement making the rounds, which says that health care reform would mandate counseling for seniors on how to end their lives sooner. We rated this claim Pants on Fire ! The truth is that the health bill allows Medicare, for the first time, to pay for doctors' appointments for patients to discuss living wills and other end-of-life issues with their physicians. These types of appointments are completely optional, and AARP supports the measure. Palin also may have also jumped to conclusions about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for "worthiness." Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others. The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall "conduct, support, and synthesize research" that looks at "outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically." The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research. Obama has said he believes a comparative effectiveness commission should advise health care workers, not require them to follow certain treatments. "I actually think that most doctors want to do right by their patients. And if they’ve got good information, I think they will act on that good information," Obama said during an interview with the New York Times on April 28, 2009. He also specifically addressed end-of-life care for seniors, discussing the last week of his grandmother's life in 2008, and how her family and doctors decided on treatment for her. "It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels," Obama said. "And that's part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It's not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance. And that's part of what I suspect you'll see emerging out of the various health care conversations that are taking place on the Hill right now." And in fact, the House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission, "Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer." In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select. Palin's statement seems extreme, but other Republicans, like Newt Gingrich, are backing her up. "You're asking us to trust turning power over to the government, when there clearly are people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards," Gingrich said in an interview on This Week with George Stephanopolous on Aug. 9, 2009. We've looked at the inflammatory claims that the health care bill encourages euthanasia. It doesn't. There's certainly no "death board" that determines the worthiness of individuals to receive care. Conservatives might make a case that Palin is justified in fearing that the current reform could one day morph into such a board. But that's not what Palin said. She said that the Democratic plan will ration care and "my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." Palin's statement sounds more like a science fiction movie ( Soylent Green , anyone?) than part of an actual bill before Congress. We rate her statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-07647	In fighting collective bargaining changes, Democrats are trying to "protect a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/15/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-unionized-government-workers-a/	Republicans fighting the opinion battle over their push to weaken government unions often have sought to contrast the compensation of public-sector workers with that of America’s private workforce. Now they are spotlighting public vs. public. As in unionized government workers vs. non-union ones. In a $750,000 national cable TV ad blitz, Crossroads GPS, a conservative issues advocacy group affiliated with Republican strategist Karl Rove, portrays government unions as self-serving bullies collecting mandatory dues to influence liberals such as President Barack Obama. Against a backdrop of newspaper headlines on the Wisconsin fight over union rights, the 60-second ad asks why Democrats are "shutting down state capitols" with protests. The ad’s answer: "to protect a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers." That’s an eye-popping number. As the intense protests continue over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s successful push to limit collective bargaining in the public sector, we decided to check it out. For support for the number, Crossroads GPS spokesman Jonathan Collegio cited a Cato Institute bulletin from March 2010. The bulletin from Cato, a libertarian think tank, explicitly calls on states to ban collective bargaining in the public sector. "Collective bargaining is a misguided labor policy because it violates civil liberties and gives unions excessive power to block needed reforms," Chris Edwards, the institute’s director of tax policy studies, wrote in the bulletin. That quote leaves no doubt about where Edwards is coming from. Let’s turn to some of his numbers. He presents 2009 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and concludes that "unionized public sector workers have much higher average wages and benefits than non-unionized public sector workers." Specifically, Edwards wrote that union members have a 31 percent advantage in wages and a 68 percent advantage in benefits. An accompanying table of statistics combines the wage and benefits advantage into one number: total compensation. Total compensation is 42 percent higher for the union workers, Edwards concluded. The same figure -- 42 percent -- is cited in the Crossroads ad. Case closed? Not exactly. As Collegio, the spokesman for the group, notes, the ad pulls a hard number directly from the study. But there are some problems. First, the ad says the system "pays" union workers a 42 percent premium. It makes no mention of benefits, even though the Cato report combines the two to get the 42 percent gap. That confuses the comparison right from the start. That point -- "pay" vs. "total compensation" -- didn’t bother Edwards. But the use of the 42 percent number did. It troubles us, too. Edwards says the number is taken out of context and the more accurate total compensation gap is lower, perhaps by a considerable amount. Let’s home in on part of the equation, wages. The study showed a 31 percent gap favoring union members by that measure. But that number, based on raw government data, has not been adjusted to make the comparison across states more valid. Edwards noted the study concludes that part of the union-nonunion gap stems from general labor market variations across states. "States with generally higher wages tend to be more unionized," the study says. "Analyses that hold constant such cross-state differences find that public-sector unions increase average pay levels by roughly 10 percent." That’s a far cry from 31 percent. And the 31 percent was critical in arriving at the 42 percent. How far off is the 42 percent figure? Edwards said it’s impossible to say. While wages have been studied effectively, he said, studies on benefits are rare, partly because benefits vary so much from place to place. We found another study by a libertarian think tank that supports Edwards’ contention that a much lower wage number is more accurate. The Freedom Foundation, based in Washington state, published a study in 2010 that put the gap at 11 percent to 12 percent for state and local government workers, union vs. non-union. Freedom Foundation, which supports Walker’s union move in a petition drive on its website, compared comparable employees, and controlled for state effects, demographics, experience, education, marital status and occupation. Meanwhile, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers found an even smaller wage gap of about 5 percent. Economists Keith Bender and John Heywood collaborated on an April 2010 study on compensation. Bender, a public sector labor expert, told us that a large body of research has put the figure around 5 percent. So, whatever the true figure, it would substantially reduce the 42 percent used in the ad. Let’s take a final look at a related point. Edwards also took issue with wording in the ad that might lead some viewers to think that the ad is comparing government workers to private employees -- not public union workers with public non-union workers. Let’s take a look back at the ad’s language (italics added): "a system that pays unionized government workers 42 percent more than non-union workers." Would some readers or listeners think Edwards is comparing public to private because the ad fails to modify that second "workers" with the prefix "government?" We suppose they could -- and critics have said it could be a tactic to pit private workers against government workers. But the entire context of the ad is public sector. Let’s review. Crossroads GPS, a conservative group seeking to illustrate the cost of public sector unions says unionized government workers are paid 42 percent more than non-union workers. The study it cites for backup does contain that figure, but the number is misleading because it is not adjusted for important differences between states. Even the author of the study makes this point. There is a gap of some size. So, the ad contains an element of truth in highlighting a pay gap, but uses an inflated number. That rates a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

John Kitzhaber has been considering whether he’ll call the Oregon Legislature back for a special session to look at further cuts to government pensions, some lawmakers are making their opinions known. Rep. Sal Esquivel, a Medford Republican, thinks a special session is a bad idea and wrote an opinion piece about it, which appeared in The Mail Tribune, a paper in southern Oregon. "This sounds like a good idea and an admirable goal on the surface, but it also raises any number of questions," he wrote. "The most important is obvious — why wasn’t this done during the five-month legislative session that we just adjourned?" Esquivel lists a number of arguments, but one caught our attention straight away: "Every day of a legislative session costs Oregon taxpayers $40,000. That includes paying staff, as well as per diem for legislators. And given the governor’s historically poor track record when it comes to special sessions, that is probably not the best use of our limited resources." We vaguely remembered the last special session, when lawmakers convened to give Nike a tax break, but we didn’t remember the bill being so high, so we decided to check it out. First we looked through some of The Oregonian’s articles about the late 2012 special session to see what we’d reported as the cost as then. According to politics reporter Christian Gaston, the per-day cost (and it only lasted a day) of that session was $13,000. That’s a long way from what Esquivel quoted. We shot Esquivel a quick email to see if he could point us toward his sources. The price, he said through a staffer, had come from the "Legislative Finance Office." We checked in with Sandra Rierson, the manager of the Financial Services department, who explained that the price depends on the kind of session you’re talking about. The cost per day of the longer regular sessions comes in at $34,901 a day but a special session is considerably less expensive at $13,000. Both numbers do not include the basic costs of keeping the Capitol running, which would get spent with or without lawmakers in the building. So why the difference? Given the short time frame of a special session, there aren’t nearly as many hires. "We try to use existing staff as much as possible," Rierson said. We called Esquivel to get his response. He said he based the statement on numbers he’d been given years ago. "I was told in the past by LFO that it was $36,000 per day and that was (six) years ago. I am assuming that that number did in fact go up so I concluded $40,000." The figure we received, however, was the most recent average-per-day cost available from the finance department so we’re sticking with it. In an opinion piece arguing against a possible special legislative session, Esquivel said a legislative session costs $40,000 a day. In fact, it’s closer to $35,000, and that’s for regular legislative sessions. Esquivel, however, was making the argument against a special session. The cost per day for that comes in at a much lower $13,000. Because his opinion piece addresses special sessions in particular, there is no truth to his statement -- not to mention the fact that he didn’t use current numbers for regular sessions. We rate this claim False.	None	Sal Esquivel	None	None	None	2013-09-05T16:28:02	2013-08-11	['None']
pomt-03617	Employees in "workplace freedom" states make more money	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2013/may/07/ron-maag/state-rep-ron-maag-says-employees-earn-more-money-/	Only hours after two Statehouse Republicans unveiled legislation to make Ohio a "right-to-work" state, GOP leadership shot it downas a distraction lacking support. "We have an ambitious agenda focused on job creation and economic recovery," Senate President Keith Faber said in a statement, "and right-to-work legislation is not on that list." But the legislation's co-sponsors, Rep. Kristina Roegner of Hudson and Rep. Ron Maag of Lebanon, depicted their proposals as a matter of "workplace freedom" that would attract jobs. And contrary to a frequent argument of opponents, Maag asserted that workersin so-called right-to-work states make more money. PolitiFact Ohio wondered how that claim is backed up. Maag's staff pointed us to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a "free market" think tank based in Midland, Mich., that strongly supports right-to-work laws. Its "Michigan Worker Freedom" website says: "Workers in right-to-work states make more. When adjusting for cost of living, workers in right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than workers in non-right-to-work states." The source for that is a posting by James M. Hohman, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center. He writes that he calculated the adjusted per-capita personal income using a state-by-state cost of living index, and converted personal income figures for all 50 states to the value of Michigan dollars. "Right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than non-right-to-work states," Hohman says. That conclusion is not widely held, however, even though the evidence is at best mixed on the effect that right-to-work laws have on paychecks and local economies. Noting that it is difficult to isolate the impact of a single policy, two economists for the generally pro-union Economic Policy Institute conducted an analysisof right-to-work laws using a regression model that controlled for more than 40 factors in addition to the cost of living in different states. Their analysis found that wages in right-to-work states are 3.2 percent lower than those elsewhere -- for everyone, not just union members. They concluded that the average full-time, full-year worker in a right-to-work state makes about $1,500 less per year than a similar worker elsewhere. In states with a right-to-work law, the Wall Street Journal reportedlast December, "wages tend to be lower, but job growth stronger, than states that don't have the law. But gauging how much of this divergence in paychecks and employment is a result of the laws is difficult to do." The Journal said that employees in right-to-work states earned 9.8 percent less than workers in states without such laws, according to an analysis of Labor Department data that did not include health-care and other benefits -- "but proving cause and effect on wages is difficult, since many factors influence what workers are paid in a given locale, such as whether the mix of businesses are concentrated in higher-paying industries." The meticulously nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a studylast December examining right-to-work laws. Using data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, it found that wages in what it called "union security states" were 16.6 percent higher than in right-to-work states. Among CRS's conclusions: "Wages are lower in right-to-work states than union security states" -- and that "historical research has suggested that right-to-work laws have little influence on these differences." Where does that leave Maag’s statement? Some economists who support right-to-work laws say wages are comparable or higher in right-to-work states when cost-of-living differences are taken into account. And Maag correctly cited that research. But federal data from a nonpartisan government research arm shows that employees in right-to-work states earn less. So does another analysis that tries to hold other things equal. None of it shows a definitive relationship between right-to-work laws and economic outcomes, even though (as the Wall Street Journal noted) the laws were first adopted in the South as part of a larger drive to lure factory jobs from the heavily unionized and better paying North. Maag’s statement, like others we have seen surrounding the highly charged right-to-work issue, suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that is not supported by any evidence. We rate the statement as Mostly False.	None	Ron Maag	None	None	None	2013-05-07T18:47:38	2013-05-01	['None']
pomt-07963	"New England already has access to ample supplies of natural gas."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/23/jack-reed/senator-reed-says-new-england-has-ample-supplies-n/	For years, Weaver’s Cove Energy, the company that wants to develop a liquefied natural gas terminal in Fall River, has battled critics in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, who have fought the project on several fronts. Opponents say the terminal -- and massive tankers making regular trips through Narragansett Bay -- would pose a serious safety risk to communities on Mount Hope Bay and cause widespread environmental damage. They also say the region already has enough natural gas and doesn’t need a new terminal. The four U.S. senators from the two states, who all oppose the terminal, cited the supply argument in a letter they sent in November to a key Senate appropriations committee, urging it to prohibit the Federal Regulatory Commission from using federal money to approve the terminal. With temperatures plummeting –– and the Weaver’s Cove project far from resolved –– we thought this was a good time to delve into the issue, focusing on the senators’ claim that New England has ample supplies of natural gas, and therefore doesn’t need the new terminal. We chose Sen. Jack Reed as the speaker for this item because he issued a news release about the letter. The senators cited an analysis by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) that was summarized in a Nov. 16, 2009 letter the department sent to federal regulators: "DOER asserts that it is unclear to what extent, if any, Weaver Cove’s LNG supply is needed to meet the region’s gas supply needs. . ." In the letter, the Massachusetts energy office staff reported that within the past year, two new or expanded LNG facilities were completed in the Northeast, adding to the "large excess supply already in the natural gas market." They also cited other increased supplies and a drop in demand for natural gas. Those were among many changes in the region’s electricity and natural gas marketplace that occurred since the Weaver’s Cove project was first initiated in 2002, they said. As a result, they said, "it is unclear why there would be demand for additional LNG infrastructure." We then found Damien Gaul, an analyst for the Energy Information Administration, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. Gaul referred us to a recent administration projection showing natural gas demand nationally increasing from 23 trillion cubic feet in 2008 to 26.4 trillion cubic feet in 2035, a growth rate of .6 percent annually. "We don’t believe the U.S. has a need for more LNG deliveries," said Gaul, who emphasized his agency does not issue opinions on specific LNG proposals. "We currently have the capacity to handle five times the demand we have now. Does the U.S. need more LNG? Probably not. Does the Northeast need more? Probably not." The natural gas supply issue also arose at a hearing for electric utility National Grid before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission on Oct. 20, 2010. Elizabeth D. Arangio, U.S. director of gas supply planning for National Grid, said several new sources of gas have been created in the Northeast, with more to come soon. She concluded: "So at this point, the market doesn’t technically need more supply in this area in addition to those projects ..." At the same hearing, Bruce Oliver, a consultant hired by the PUC, said the recession has reduced the demand for LNG. "That is, the overall demand in the region has declined due to the economy and other factors, energy-efficiency activity, etc. That activity negates a lot of the factors that were driving the need for a Weaver’s Cove type of supply." So why would Weaver’s Cove spend millions of dollars fighting to develop a project to deliver a product to a market that doesn’t need it? We asked Gordon Shearer, president of Hess LNG LLC, who has spearheaded the Weaver’s Cove project. He responded with a question: If New England has enough gas, he asked, why are prices for natural gas here much higher than in the rest of the country? (Gas prices vary widely across the country; the EIA finds prices in New England are generally several dollars higher per thousand cubic feet than the national average.) The high prices, Shearer said, show the region needs more gas. He also said the Massachusetts Energy Office used faulty arithmetic in its study and failed to note that existing pipelines don’t have enough capacity to handle much of the new LNG supplies. He also dismissed the federal reports, saying commercial forecasters tend to see a need for more imports. But documents Shearer provided told a mixed story. For instance, a report from Spectra Energy described the company’s efforts to pipe more gas to the Northeast, but it said nothing about the need for more gas from other sources. Another report, the 2010 Statistical Guide by the Northeast Gas Association, reports that "an era of abundant supplies appears to have arrived" and that is having a positive impact on natural gas prices. The rapid development of shale gas supplies in New York and Pennsylvania are expected to produce substantially more gas for the U.S. market, the report said. It noted that some proposed LNG projects, including one offshore of New Jersey, have been withdrawn recently because of the changing market conditions. To summarize: The Massachusetts and federal energy offices say there is an ample supply of natural gas. So does National Grid, the largest local utility. Weaver’s Cove contention -- that the region’s relatively high gas prices prove there’s not enough supply -- may make theoretical sense. But it hasn’t convinced the regulators so far. Nor us. We find the claim by Reed and the other senators to be True. Update: The original version of this item incorrectly reported that National Grid, a major supplier of electricity and natural gas, burns natural gas to produce electricity. National Grid buys and sells electricity but does not generate it.	None	Jack Reed	None	None	None	2011-01-23T00:01:00	2010-11-04	['None']
pomt-09135	Ninety percent of the people in Arkansas still love Bill Clinton.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/15/donna-brazile/brazile-says-clinton-loved-90-percent-arkansans/	Sen. Blanche Lincoln's narrow victory in the Arkansas Democratic primary was a big topic on ABC's This Week on Sunday, June 13, 2010. Organized labor poured $10 million into the campaign of her opponent, Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, while Bill Clinton, who served as Arkansas governor before becoming president, came out in strong support for Lincoln. This Week host Jake Tapper began the conversation by showing a clip of White House spokesman Robert Gibbs criticizing the unions for not using that money to help in the general election. Tapper asked Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, "Is the White House risking alienating labor with that kind of talk?" Brazile responded that the White House should be careful about alienating labor because unions provide key grass-roots support. Brazile said that "Blanche Lincoln ran a great campaign. She ran against Washington. Labor, the money did make her the outsider. She was able to reconnect with her base, and she pulled her base out. She still has trouble in the general election, but she ran a very smart, strategic campaign." Brazile added, "And Bill Clinton helped her. He is popular. Ninety percent of the people in the state still love him. And he was able to pull out the stops to get her elected." We were curious about the claim that 90 percent of the people in Arkansas still love Bill Clinton. That number seemed high, so we e-mailed Brazile to ask her source. She replied that she was referring to the "base of the Democratic party" and not ALL people. It was a Democratic run-off and I did not set it up right (in the comment on the show) because we had so many races to cover." Brazile said she was sorry about not providing the context and that she thought it was clear she was talking about Democratic primary voters. But we watched the clip and thought many people might think she meant Clinton was popular with 90 percent of all people in Arkansas. His nationwide numbers are significantly lower. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll dated from October 2009, 64 percent of those polled said that they had a favorable opinion of Clinton. We would expect him to be more popular in his home state, but we doubt his popularity would be 26 points higher. Brazile acknowledged that would be highly unlikely "in this highly charged partisan environment." But for Democratic primary voters, Brazile is on solid ground. She sent us a poll from Lake Research Partners of likely Democratic primary voters in Arkansas that found 86 percent had a favorable approval rating of Clinton. So Brazile was very close with her number, but she left out an important detail -- that it applied only to Democratic primary voters. Still, it was made in the context of a discussion about the Democratic primary. So we find her claim Half True.

pomt-12133	"Virginia police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/puppetstringnewscom/post-wrongly-says-charlottesville-police-arrested-/	Police in Charlottesville, Va., arrested an Ohio man in connection with the hit-and-run death of a woman protesting a white supremacist rally, but an online post alleged authorities were covering up for the real culprit. An Aug. 12, 2017, post on PuppetStringNews.com carried the headline, "Virginia police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of efforts to combat fake news. Police arrested James Alex Fields, Jr., of Maumee, Ohio, after a 2010 Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of protesters demonstrating against white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville for a "Unite the Right" rally on Aug. 12. A 32-year-old woman named Heather Heyer was killed and 19 others were injured before Fields was arrested. PuppetStringNews.com and other websites said police had the wrong man. The post said the Challenger actually belonged to a Michigan man named Jerome Vangheluwe (pronounced "vangelloway," with a hard g), who had a son named Joel Vangheluwe, who was "a known Antifa supporter." Antifa is shorthand for antifascist demonstrators that organize on the local level to protest far-right causes, often resorting to violence. "This James Alex Fields subject is simply being used to make it look like a Right Wing attack, when he has no ties to the Dodge Challenger that was used...Unlike the Vangheluwe family who owns the car," the post read. But the post, which appears to get its roots from an imageboard site that has spawned countless memes and conspiracy theories, is based on inaccurate information. Here’s what we know. A statement from the city of Charlottesville said the Challenger rear-ended a sedan, which in turn hit a minivan, pushing the minivan into an intersection filled with pedestrians. "The Dodge Challenger fled the scene, but was located and stopped a short time later by Charlottesville Police," the statement read. Fields was identified by police as the driver and was charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. He was denied bail at a hearing on Aug. 14. Fields was photographed at the Charlottesville rally, and news reports said he had told his mother in Ohio that he was going there. A former high school teacher also noted Fields had shown an unusual interest in Nazi history. But what about the car supposedly belonging to the Vangheluwes? We checked vehicle records and found that it did once belong to Jerome Vangheluwe, who bought it in 2009. Joel Vangheluwe had posted a photo of the Challenger on Oct. 16, 2011, with the caption "My car when I turn 16." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But Jerome Vangheluwe sold the car in 2012. It then went to another owner for almost three years. It was sold again on May 13, 2016, and registered under its current Ohio license plate, GVF 1111, which has been shown in photos from Charlottesville. News reports concur the car is registered to Fields. After the posts blaming Joel Vangheluwe started appearing, he posted Facebook status updates on Aug. 12 denying he was the driver. "im not the one, im from fucking michigan you idiots," he first posted. His Facebook profile listed Detroit as his home. Vangheluwe followed that with, "i drive a 2009 chevy impala, not a challenger, fuck the internet" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The Vangheluwes have hired an anti-defamation lawyer, Dallas-based Andrew Sommerman, who told us the family planned to file lawsuits against websites making accusations against Joel Vangheluwe. Our ruling PuppetStringNews.com said, "Virginia Police arrest wrong person to cover for Antifa member who ran over protesters." The website alleged that the Vangheluwe family owned the 2010 Dodge Challenger used in the Charlottesville tragedy. While they did own it years ago, records show it is currently registered in Ohio, where Fields lives. There’s no evidence to indicate police arrested the wrong person, or that they were covering for Vangheluwe, who lived in Michigan. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-12492	"For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hes-only-modern-president-fill-s/	President Donald Trump told National Rifle Association members that 100 days in, he’s already fulfilled a major promise he made to them on the campaign trail: nominating a conservative justice to the Supreme Court to replace Antonin Scalia. In fact, he said he’s the first president since 1881 to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in his first 100 days. "I kept my promise, and now with your help, our brand new justice — and he is really something very special — Neil Gorsuch sits on the bench of the United States Supreme Court," Trump said at the group’s annual meeting April 28. "For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days. The last time that happened was 136 years ago, in 1881. Now, we won't get any credit for this, but don't worry about it." Trump has his history right. He is indeed the first modern president to fill an open Supreme Court seat within the first 100 days. The last president to do so was Chester A. Arthur, who took office Sept. 19, 1881, and nominated Horace Gray to the bench the following December. But this isn’t as big of an achievement as it might seem. The reality is that very few presidents are presented with the opportunity to appoint and confirm a new Supreme Court justice within their first 100 days. Other than Trump, just four presidents since 1900 have had that chance: Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Harry Truman and Warren Harding. And Trump is the only one of the group who entered office with a vacant Supreme Court seat from the start — meaning he had a full 100 days to nominate and confirm his pick. For both Harding in 1921 and Truman in 1945, the Supreme Court seat opened up about 11 weeks into their respective presidencies. For Clinton, it opened up about eight weeks in. (One hundred days is about 14 weeks.) None of them nominated and confirmed a replacement until after the 100 days were up. Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968, before Nixon took office the following January. But Warren said he would stay on the bench until his replacement was confirmed, so there was no actual vacancy. Nixon didn’t get a replacement confirmed until June 1969. For a good overview of Supreme Court nomination timelines going back to 1900, see this report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Our ruling Trump said, "For the first time in the modern political era, we have confirmed a new justice in the first 100 days." Before Trump, the last time a president nominated and confirmed a Supreme Court nominee within his first 100 days was Arthur in 1881. However, Trump’s statement leaves out the important fact that it’s rare for a president to have the opportunity to nominate a justice in those first 100 days. Trump and Nixon are the only presidents since 1900 to have entered office knowing they have a seat to fill imminently. Three others learned of an opening near the end of the 100-day benchmark. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-04-28T18:48:17	2017-04-28	['None']
pomt-12135	"Half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/aug/14/david-perdue/sen-david-perdue-half-immigrant-households-benefit/	One argument supporters make for limiting legal immigration is that a significant share end up on social welfare programs. "The majority come here on family-based visas, without regard to their skills or our needs. As a result, half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system," wrote Sen. David Perdue in an Aug. 8 op-ed in USA Today, co-bylined with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. Perdue and Cotton sponsored the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy Act, or RAISE Act, which President Donald Trump has endorsed. Currently, the country accepts about 1 million new immigrants a year. Research has found that about 50 percent of households headed by an immigrant (living here legally or illegally) do benefit from government assistance programs. In many of those households, it’s a U.S.-born child who is eligible for a program. Research on social welfare programs Perdue’s and Cotton’s offices told us their claim relied on a September 2015 study from Steven Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low-immigration levels. Using data from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, the study found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here legally or illegally) reported having used at least one welfare program during the year, compared with 30 percent of native-born households. The study factored in the following programs: Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); Women, Infants, and Children food program (WIC); free or subsidized school lunches; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as the Food Stamp program); Medicaid, and public housing and rent subsidies. The report said a household was using welfare if any member used a program during 2012. An immigrant household included foreign-born individuals (such as naturalized U.S. citizens, green card holders and unauthorized immigrants) as well as U.S.-born children who were eligible for a welfare program. Some immigrant households also had members who were native-born adults. Though there is a 1996 law restricting immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a "qualified alien" (the classification includes lawful permanent residents), the majority of authorized immigrants have been here for more than five years, the study said. As a result, that law "has only a modest impact on the share of immigrant households receiving one or more welfare programs," Camarota wrote. Compared with native-born individuals, immigrants have higher levels of poverty primarily because they are relatively less likely to be employed and on average earn lower wages, and it takes time for the newly arrived "to move up the job ladder and for the poor among them to lift themselves and their children out of poverty," said a 2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Leighton Ku, a health policy professor and director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, criticized the report from the Center for Immigration Studies for using an overly broad definition of benefits that most people probably would not think as welfare. All school lunches, for example, get some federal subsidy, whether full price or not, Ku said. "Does this mean that all school children are getting welfare?" he asked. Ku in 2013 co-authored a paper concluding that low-income immigrants use public benefits at a lower rate than low-income native-born citizens. Ku’s and Camarota’s methodology differed. For instance, Ku’s analysis focused on individuals by immigration status, not on households headed by immigrants. Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told us that the school lunch program isn’t like other programs traditionally considered welfare. It’s a nutrition program, and does not have the same work, citizenship or other requirements that actual welfare programs do. And it’s not always means-tested, as for example some schools in low-income areas provide free or reduced lunches to all students," she said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But excluding school lunch recipients doesn’t change the numbers that much. Camarota in his study said that if subsidized school lunch was excluded from the equation, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent (compared with 28 percent for native households). That’s only slightly lower than Perdue’s claim that about "half" of immigrant households receive welfare benefits. The National Academies report found similar numbers of about 45 percent when looking at various public benefits. It examined benefits used by immigrant and U.S.-born households, both with children. The report found that "cash assistance" such as SSI and TANF was low for both sets of households, around 6 percent. "Cash assistance is what we generally think of as ‘welfare’ for households with children in which the adults cannot work or have difficulty finding jobs," Mittelstadt said. But food assistance and Medicaid participation was much higher for immigrant households than for U.S.-born households, she said. About 45 percent of immigrant households had food assistance and 46 percent Medicaid, according to the report. Our ruling Perdue said, "Half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system." Cash assistance for immigrants is very low, about 6 percent, but there are other programs from which immigrants benefit, and Perdue cited benefits broadly. Research from the Center for Immigration Studies found that in 2012, 51 percent of immigrant-headed households (living here legally or illegally) reported to have used at least one welfare program during the year. That percentage includes a broad definition of welfare, including school lunch. Excluding subsidized school lunches, welfare use for immigrant households would be 46 percent, according to the study. The study included as welfare beneficiaries immigrant households in which a U.S.-born child is benefitting from a welfare program. Another report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that 45 percent of immigrant households had food assistance and 46 percent had Medicaid. Perdue’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05225	"There is no record of congresswoman Betty Sutton ... ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/07/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-has-never-held-town-/	Since becoming a member of Congress last year, Rep. Jim Renacci has held numerous "town hall" style public meetings, even though he recognizes that hostile political entities are videotaping all his remarks in hopes that he’ll make a gaffe they can exploit. A redistricting plan that eliminated two of Ohio’s congressional seats put Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, into the same congressional district as Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democratic from Copley Township, prompting a November face-off. The upcoming contest has made both Renacci and Sutton top political targets. In a news release announcing Renacci will hold a town hall meeting for Rocky River on June 14, Renacci’s re-election campaign chided Sutton for not holding such meetings herself, and claimed it was part of a "disappearing act." "In a stunning and stark contrast, there is no record of Congresswoman Betty Sutton, who has been in office for the better part of a decade, ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public - and she certainly has never done so while running to represent the 16th District," the news release said. Has Sutton really never held open meetings with constituents? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim, particularly since it has seen news releases about town hall meetings that Sutton had scheduled during her three terms in office. For example, a 2007 release that’s still available online announced events in Akron and Elyria. "Sutton will open the event with brief remarks, introduce her district staff, and spend the majority of the event responding to questions," the news release said. " Those interested in attending and/or submitting a question for the Q & A period should RSVP to the email address below or contact either of Sutton's district offices in Lorain or Summit County." The Plain Dealer also published at least one article that mentioned Sutton conducting a town hall meeting. That meeting occurred in July 2009. At that time of the August 2009 article - when opponents of proposed health care reform legislation were disrupting congressional meetings around the country - Sutton told The Plain Dealer that many of her constituents said they didn’t want to attend such a meeting because "they would fear for their safety." Afterwards, she announced that she’d hold a constituent meeting on the subject by teleconference, and invited callers to dial-in. In light of that evidence, PolitiFact Ohio asked Renacci’s campaign for the basis of its claim that there’s no record of Sutton ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public. Spokesman James Slepian responded that the campaign is certain that Sutton has not conducted such a town hall meeting since she announced her run against Renacci last year. He said Sutton had announced she’d hold a semi-public June 3 event in Renacci’s hometown - Wadsworth - but canceled it. An email to The Plain Dealer about the Wadsworth event indicated it was not a town hall meeting, but a fundraiser that a local Democratic party group had scheduled at a restaurant near Renacci’s campaign headquarters. The fundraiser was cancelled because of a scheduling conflict. Slepian said the campaign was "unable to find a clear record of her holding such an event at any other time during her career in Congress. And by clear record, I mean some record detailing when and where the town hall occurred, was it open to the public, did Sutton field questions from the audience (all the same information that is readily available about the town halls that Mr. Renacci holds regularly)." Slepian accused Sutton of repeatedly announcing town hall meetings and then cancelling them, citing as evidence August 2009 posts from conservative and Tea Party websites that expressed disappointment that Sutton opted to hold a teleconference phone call with constituents about the health care bill instead of in-person meetings. Slepian said the news release that announced the Sutton’s 2007 event did not constitute "proof" that it occurred, and he could find "no record" that the July 2009 town hall meeting referenced in the August 2009 The Plain Dealer article had actually happened. "In addition to the clear differences in their respective voting records, another glaring difference between Jim Renacci and Betty Sutton is that while Jim Renacci believes he owes it to the voters to answer them regularly and in person as their voice in Washington, Betty Sutton feels no such obligation to the people of Northeast Ohio," Slepian said in an email. Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo said Sutton has recently conducted seniors listening tour events, which are open to the public, and where constituents can ask Sutton questions and offer comments. "That’s what a ‘town hall’ is," DeAngelo said. An article on the North Royalton Post website chronicled much of what Sutton said at an April 2 "listening tour" event that Sutton held at the North Royalton branch of the Cuyahoga County Public Library. The article, accompanied by photos from the event, said it was attended by "less than a handful of seniors." To Renacci’s credit, he has held regular town hall meetings with constituents even as hostile videographers have doggedly recorded them. And his staff could have argued that they think he meets with constituents more often or that Sutton does not hold town hall meetings often enough. But his claim that "there is no record" of Sutton "ever holding a single in-person town hall meeting open to the general public" does not stand up to scrutiny. News releases that have announced such events and newspaper articles about those events provide sufficient evidence that they occurred. On the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci’s claim rates False.

pomt-12742	Says "people who come to" their dissent actions "get a ‘cease and desist’ letter" from Ron Johnson's office.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/02/citizen-action-wisconsin/group-falsely-claims-gop-sen-ron-johnson-sends-cea/	A website posting on Feb. 28, 2017 spurred a bashing the next day of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, with charges that the Wisconsin Republican was cracking down on free speech. Tweets such as these: Sen Ron Johnson sends constituents a "cease and desist" letter so as to not hear their concerns! Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) has sent "cease and desist" letters to constituents trying to meet with him. Sen Ron Johnson orders citizens to "Cease and Desist" pleading for #ACA! What we found is that the posting by Citizen Action of Wisconsin -- which claimed that "people who come to" the group’s actions "get a ‘cease and desist’ letter" from Johnson's office -- is overly broad and misleading. The claim Milwaukee-based Citizen Action describes itself as an "issue-focused coalition of individuals and organizations committed to achieving social, economic and environmental justice." The posting it put on its website said: Dissent is patriotic, that's what we believe. That's why for months we've been showing up to Congressional offices, calling every day, writing letters/emails/postcards & more. And it's why our members took part in town halls and rallies across the state last week during the Congressional Recess, including a 500+ person rally in Greenfield and 150+ in Wausau. Complete with empty chairs for, and a large cardboard cutout of, Senator Ron Johnson. And what do the people who come to our actions get? A "cease and desist" letter (click for full letter) from the Senator's office (signed "staff"). Senator Johnson is trying his best not to hear our concerns about the future of healthcare, about the future of our country and the fate our of families. The post ends with a reference to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the chance to sign an online petition saying "we will not cease and desist." By the morning of March 2, 2017, the count was more than 2,800 signatures. Citizen Action included with its post a link to a photograph of a Feb. 27, 2017 letter on Johnson’s official Senate stationery. The name of the recipient of the letter is blacked out, but we confirmed that the letter was sent to Earl Good, a 72-year-old Milwaukee retiree. The letter The Johnson letter to Good, which is signed by "Staff," says: This Cease and Desist letter is to inform you that any further communication from you to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson’s office can only be done in writing. This means that you are not to call or visit any of Senator Johnson’s staff or any of his offices at any time. Our office has done all that we can to assist you with your concerns. This letter acts as a written notice of our expectation for you to discontinue your unwanted telephone calls and office visits. If you fail to comply with this notice, then we will have no other alternative but to contact the United States Capitol Police and report your noncompliance. Perspectives Good told the Journal Sentinel that since the November 2016 elections, he has been calling Johnson's office on various issues and has joined others who visit Johnson's Milwaukee office to raise concerns about issues such as health care. He said that in mid-February, he called Johnson's office 40 times on one day and 83 times another day. He said he kept calling until someone answered the phone rather than letting his call go to voicemail. He said he is persistent but has always been polite when interacting with Johnson's staff on the phone or in person. Kevin Kane, the organizing director for Citizen Action, told us Good has been involved in recent months in the group’s initiatives, including visits to Johnson’s office in an effort to preserve the Affordable Care Act. Kane said he has observed Good as being persistent but respectful. But Kane said he was not familiar with all of Good’s interactions with Johnson’s staff and that Good is the only person involved with Citizen Action that is known to have received a cease-and-desist letter from Johnson. Finally, here’s what Johnson staff members Patrick McIlheran and Ben Voelkel told us (they would not identify Good as the recipient of the letter, but confirmed the letter is legitimate): The letter was sent to Good because of repeated behavior over the previous two months, in person, that was harassing and threatening to Johnson's staff, not because of any dissent voiced by the resident about politics or policy. They would not provide more details. Johnson's staff believed the man was acting on his own and the staff was not aware of whether he was involved with Citizen Action or any other group. The behavior led Johnson's office to contact the Capitol Police, which suggested that the letter be sent. Johnson's office has sent four or five cease-and-desist letters since Johnson took office in January 2011, and this was the first since the November 2016 elections. Our rating Citizen Action says "people who come to" their dissent actions "get a ‘cease and desist’ letter" from Johnson's office. Despite the broadness of the claim, the group produced a cease-and-desist letter written to only one person who it says has been involved in Citizen Action initiatives such as preserving the Affordable Care Act. The letter demands that the man stop visiting or calling any of Johnson’s staff or offices, but says written communications will be received. And Johnson’s staff says it issued the letter, on the advice of the U.S. Capitol Police, because the man had been harassing and threatening to staff, not because he protested any of Johnson’s actions. We rate the statement False. Editor's note: Four days after this fact check was published, Citizen Action posted an apology about its claim against Johnson.

pomt-00757	Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, "nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/15/jeb-bush/which-state-most-gun-permits/	Facing a long list of GOP presidential contenders at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush touted his own pro-gun rights record. Bush took a friendly jab at another potential presidential contender in the room: "Today there are well over 1.3 million law-abiding Floridians with a valid concealed weapons permit, 1.3 million. That’s the most in the nation -- nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas. Sorry, Gov. Perry." Yep, Florida does have 1,384,756 million concealed weapon permit holders as of March 2015. It’s not surprising that Florida would be among the top states for the number of gun permits since it is now the third most populous state in the country. But does Florida lead the nation in gun permits and is that nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas? We were fired up to find the facts. Comparing state permit figures A spokesman for Bush’s PAC referred us to an August 2014 article in the Washington Times, which stated Florida led the nation with 1.3 million in concealed carry permits while Texas came in second with just over 708,000. We sought to independently find current statistics. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, last studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state in 2012 based on data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases. It found Florida was No. 1 with 887,000 permits at the time, followed by Pennsylvania 786,000, Georgia 600,000 permits and Texas with 519,000 permits. Looking for more current numbers, we found Florida had nearly 1.4 million permit holders as of March 2015, while Texas has 825,957 as of December 2014, according to each state's official count. Florida’s number is about 1.7 times higher than Texas, which is close to Bush’s words of "nearly double." To determine if Texas is No. 2, we tried to find a more current number for gun permits in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Those two states don’t make such data as readily and publicly available as Florida and Texas. Pennsylvania has 1,064,360 active carry permits, State Trooper Adam Reed, a spokesman for the state police, told PolitiFact. So Pennsylvania, not Texas, is No. 2. In Georgia, 159 probate judges report the number of applications for weapons licenses to the Administrative Office of the Courts; however, some judges fail to report the number of applicants, resulting in no firm number. PolitiFact Georgia found that the state’s compiled number was in the ballpark of 500,000 in 2012, but the numbers have been increasing. Other estimates we have seen are higher, but none exceeded the total in Texas. (The courts sent us the total number of applications in 2013 which was about 169,000.) Some caveats about conceal carry laws and Bush’s claim While Bush’s claim is based on the sheer number of permits, another valid way to measure access to gun permits is to look at the rate in each state. The 2012 GAO report, using 2010 Census data for the adult population, shows Florida’s rate at 6.2 -- equal to Connecticut but less than Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The rules about conceal carry and each state vary, so it’s worth mentioning some caveats we have noted before. Several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. As of March, about 192,000 out-of-state residents have Florida permits, representing about 13 percent of the total. Two populous states are notably absent from the top of the list: California and New York. Those states are considered a "may issue" states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That means it is harder to get a permit there than in a state such as Florida which is a "shall issue" state. We interviewed John R. Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center which compiles data on gun permits in states. Lott, an academic and Fox News columnist, published the book More Guns, Less Crime through the University of Chicago in 2010. He said there are four factors that influence the number of gun permits in a state: the amount of fees, hours of required training, how many places people can or can’t carry their firearms and how many years the rules have been in effect. For example, Pennsylvania has one of the lower fees, while Florida has higher fees but close to average in terms of training requirements. Our ruling Bush said Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, "nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas." There are three parts to this claim. On the first one, Bush is correct that Florida leads the nation in the sheer number of gun permits -- the most current figure is nearly 1.4 million. However, eight states have a higher per-capita rate of gun permits than Florida. When he says that Florida has "nearly double" the number of permits as Texas he is in the ballpark -- Texas has about 826,000. So Florida has about 1.7 times as many permit holders. Where Bush misses the mark is when he says that Texas is the second state in terms of gun permits. Current data from the Pennsylvania state patrol showed slightly more than one million permits -- so more than Texas. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This report has been changed to clarify that probate judges report the number of applications for weapons licenses, not completed licenses. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f425cb8a-e580-4991-b7b0-a9dba110f4bc	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-04-15T15:46:52	2015-04-10	['Texas']
pomt-08379	Says Julie Parrish is "one of Sarah Palin’s mama grizzlies."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/25/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/oregon-house-democrats-try-tie-julie-parrish-sarah/	Oregon seems to have missed most of the tea party fever sweeping the country these days. There aren’t any serious political contenders in Oregon who fit the bill, anyway. But that hasn’t stopped the Oregon House Democrats from trying to tie one local candidate to Sarah Palin and her "rogue" ways. In a recent Democratic mailer, Future PAC proudly proclaims that "Oregon isn’t grizzly country." On the reverse it says that Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate for House District 37, is "one of Sarah Palin’s mama grizzlies." "Recently," it goes on, "Julie Parrish received national attention after she was singled out by Fox News as one of Sarah Palin’s ‘Mama Grizzlies.’ "We don’t really want one of Sarah Palin’s Mama Grizzlies making decisions for us, do we? "Don’t think so. Support a Grizzly-Free West Linn and Tualatin." Well, PolitiFact Oregon decided we ought to vet all of the above charges, and set to work. First up: Is Oregon "grizzly country"? That all depends. If House Democrats are talking about the actual bear (we imagine they might be, as there is a fancy, cut-out image of a bear on the mailer), then they’re right. No grizzlies have been spotted in Oregon since the early 1900s. If, however, they’re talking about "Grizzly Bear," the popular indie band, they’re way off. The band played in Portland last October, and we have faith the group will return to serenade us yet again. (We recommend a quick listen to "The Knife," our favorite song of theirs.) Seriously, we might have to leave the whole "grizzly country" designation alone and move on to the more substantive side of the mailer. Is Parrish really one of Palin’s mama grizzlies? To get to the bottom of this pressing political issue, we went to a video of Parrish on Fox News and gave it a quick look. The anchor frames the TV spot as follows: "Well, Sarah Palin says they're like mama grizzlies, a trend of fed-up, conservative moms getting involved in politics. Many for the very first time." There’s then some Sarah Palin voiceover and inspiring images. At one point, Palin says "It's kind of a mom awakening in the last year and a half." Then we’re back to the anchor, who says, "And joining us are three first-time candidates and mama grizzlies." We got in touch with Parrish, who said she was a bit surprised about the way the TV spot unfolded. "The focus was supposed to be moms and politics," she said. "I was surprised, quite frankly, in how they intro-ed that." Still, you can find the video on her website, and she didn’t object on the air. But is this video really enough to link her to Sarah Palin? We still, for all of our sleuthing, weren’t sure. So we did a little more research and found that Parrish has not received any monetary help from Palin or the out-of-state tea party groups with which the ex-vice presidential candidate is sometimes linked. Neither has Palin come to town to stump for Parrish. Heck, she hasn’t even endorsed her, as far we can tell. So where does that leave us? The claim suggests that there is a formal connection to Palin or at the minimum some show of support. There’s no evidence of that. So we are left with simply one Fox newscaster calling Parrish a "mama grizzly" in that she’s a conservative mother in politics for the first time. But her connections to Sarah Palin appear to be non-existent. We rate this claim Bearly -- oops! -- Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03095	Mental health provisions related to mass shootings "got over 90 votes in the Senate."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/sep/24/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-says-mental-health-amendment-gun-bill/	U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is again backing programs aimed at identifying mentally ill people who pose a risk for mass killings. Ayotte, saying she has strong bipartisan support, has co-sponsored a bill geared toward education, awareness and intervention relating to mental illness since the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012. Ayotte introduced the Mental Health First Aid Act in January 2013, which never made it past a congressional committee. However, elements of that bill went into the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act that was part of the gun control legislation the Senate voted down in April. Two days after a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in September 2013, Ayotte and Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, issued a joint statement to Senate leadership advocating programs to educate teachers in recognizing symptoms of mental health illness and how they could defuse potentially dangerous situations. Soon after, she appeared on CNN’s The Lead With Jake Tapper. She said a bill that addresses mental health issues would pass the Senate easily. Ayotte said the mental health amendment that was attached to last April’s gun-control legislation passed easily. However, it was not enacted because the gun bill itself lost. "I actually think it can be taken up separately and easily passed because of the mental health provisions. It got over 90 votes in the Senate and very little gets 90 votes around here," Ayotte said. We wondered whether the mental health amendment really got such overwhelming support. We looked at the official roll call vote on the amendment and found that it had indeed passed by a 95-2 vote on April 18. Despite voting for the mental health amendment she co-sponsored, Ayotte later became one of 41 Republicans who voted against the gun control proposal sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have expanded background checks. Five Democrats also voted against it. The mixed messages these votes sent drew sharp criticism from critics. Ayotte responded with a statement that said: "I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales." Our ruling Ayotte said that mental health provisions related to mass shootings "got over 90 votes in the Senate." While an early version of the bill never made it out of committee, the Senate did eventually vote, 95-2, for a mental-health amendment to a gun control bill. The full bill lacked enough votes to pass and was pulled from the floor, but she is correct that the amendment did get 90 votes. We rate her statement True.

Hobby Airport, but it’s neither. The image is a fake. While it does show an airport — New York’s LaGuardia Airport in Queens — it’s actually a digitally manipulated photo that was used to show the effects of sea-level rise. A 2013 article on ClimateCentral.org credited the image to an artist named Nickolay Lamm, saying it was made to illustrate what a 25-foot increase in sea level would look like at LaGuardia. (There are other images showing the change at 5 feet and 12 feet.) Both of Houston’s major airports were shut down by the storm, canceling thousands of flights over several days. Bush and Hobby airports were both expected to resume flights by Aug. 29. An Aug. 27 tweet from Houston’s ABC affiliate said, ".@HobbyAirport says about 500 people are trapped.

Barack Obama criticized John McCain's talk of earmarks, saying that cutting earmarks would not significantly affect the federal deficit. "Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget," Obama said. Fiscal conservatives concerned about the national debt — which is now more than $9-trillion in total — often mention earmarks as something that needs fixing. But earmarks are only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $18-billion for the 2008 budget, or roughly 10 percent of the deficit for that year. Another report found that appropriations bills in fiscal year 2008 included $16.5 billion for earmarks. Those numbers are lower than previous years because earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year’s deficit of $318-billion. The numbers show Obama gets his earmark number correct. We rate his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-07T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['John_McCain']
pomt-13385	Says Hillary Clinton’s energy agenda "will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-clinton-energy-plan/	Donald Trump attacked Hillary Clinton on energy issues at a campaign stop in Virginia just two days before the two were set to go head-to-head at the first presidential debate. "Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work," he said. "Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion." Trump’s claim about Clinton wanting to shut down natural gas production is not accurate, but what about his claim on the cost of her energy agenda? The claim is misleading as $5 trillion refers to the cost of implementation, not the cost to the economy. What’s more, the researcher who produced the figure told us the investment will actually help the economy. The $5 trillion figure The Trump campaign referred us to a 2016 working paper by Columbia Business School professor Geoffrey Heal entitled "What Would it Take to Reduce US Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80% by 2050?" Heal, who is in favor of climate change action, estimated a cost of $42 billion to $176 billion per year in required investment in production capacity, energy storage, energy transmission and battery-powered vehicles. On the low end, that comes out to $1.3 trillion over three decades and, on the high end, $5.3 trillion over three decades. This, however, does not refer to a loss in GDP, but rather the amount needed to update the U.S. energy system and technology infrastructure. "It’s not a GDP loss at all," Heal told PolitiFact. "This is infrastructure investment." He pointed out that Trump and Clinton have both called for long-term infrastructure investment. Spending the $5 trillion on cutting emissions is a "relatively inexpensive way with a good rate of return," Heal said, and the $5 trillion will have a "multiplier" effect that will help the economy become cleaner and more productive. Heal also told us to take his estimate with a grain of salt because there a lot of uncertainties, such as the price of technology. Overall, he actually supports Clinton’s "sensible" energy and climate change policies. "She’s pushing for the right things," he said. "I certainly don’t think they’ll bankrupt the country." What’s more, it’s not entirely accurate to say 80 percent by 2050 is Clinton’s "regulatory agenda." Clinton has proposed various energy policies to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels. She said her plan will "put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050," a goal established by President Barack Obama and found in this year’s Democratic Party Platform. In other words, the analysis offered by Heal doesn’t apply to her actual policies but an aspiration the Democrats share. A 2014 paper by the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, which brings together energy researchers from around the world, found a similar result: an investment cost equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP. But the researchers note that this price tag is "incremental" and has a great level of uncertainty "because they depend on assumptions about consumption levels, technology costs, and fossil fuel prices nearly 40 years into the future." They also stipulate that the cost assumes little to no technological change nor does the estimate include benefits like avoided health and infrastructure costs. Economic cost of energy policies If we look at specific policies rather than a 30-year goal, the economic cost of Clinton’s energy agenda is dramatically less expensive. In a speech to the Shale Insight conference in Pennsylvania, Trump specified that the $5 trillion refers to the President Barack Obama’s Climate Action Plan and Clean Power Plan. Obama’s Climate Action Plan proposes new regulations, investments in renewable energy and international cooperation to cut carbon emissions. That plan includes the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan of 2015 (which requires power plants to reduce their 2005 emission levels by 32 percent within 25 years) and the Paris agreement (in which the Obama administration pledged to cut national 2005 emission levels by 28 percent within 20 years). Those plans are currently in limbo. The Supreme Court ruled in February 2016 to halt the Clean Power Plan’s implementation while the Paris agreement has yet to go into effect. Clinton has vowed to defend and implement Obama’s climate change policies, including the Clean Power Plan and the Paris climate agreement. Critics of these policies — namely the oil and gas industry, business groups and free market oriented think tanks — say they’ll impose costs on businesses and consumers alike. But these estimates do not come close to $5 trillion. According to a 2015 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation — which opposes the plan — the Clean Power Plan will lead to a loss of $2.5 trillion in GDP by 2030. Here’s table breaking down the estimates we found, all from groups that are opposed to the plans or that have concerns about them: Group Policy Estimated cost Year of analysis Heritage Foundation Clean Power Plan $2.5 trillion in GDP by 2030 2015 Heritage Foundation Climate Action Plan $1.47 trillion in national income by 2030 2013 Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation Clean Power Plan $660 billion in GDP loss by 230 2016 American Action Forum, a center-right advocacy group Paris agreement and existing climate change-oriented regulations $562 billion by 2030* 2015 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Clean Power Plan $510 billion in GDP loss by 2030 2014 *American Action Forum estimated that altogether, existing climate change-geared regulations cost $28 billion annually while the Paris agreement, which kicks in 2020, would raise that number to $45 billion annually. Estimated benefits of climate change policies On the flip side, the Environmental Protection Agency and others argue the Clean Power Plan actually leads to economic gains when health and environmental benefits are included in the analysis. Curbing carbon emissions would reduce health hazards, such as asthma and heart attacks, associated with particle pollution, saving the public $34 to $54 billion per year by 2030, according to the EPA. Factoring in the EPA’s own projected costs of $8 billion per year, that’s an annual net gain of $26 billion to $46 billion. A 2016 cost-benefit analysis by Harvard researchers resulted in a figure in the same ballpark: a net $38 billion per year in net benefits by 2020. Meanwhile, the National Resources Defense Council had even rosier projections. The environmental group estimated that the Clean Power Plan would deliver benefits worth $55 billion to $93 billion, outweighing the costs of $7.3 billion to $8.8 billion. " The Clinton campaign also pointed us to several papers on the cost of not reducing emissions. For examples, researchers estimated a 23 percent reduction in global incomes by 2100 if climate change is unmitigated. "Climate change is a serious issue for the economy. It could inflict damages that will add up," Heal said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton’s energy agenda "will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion." The Trump campaign said Trump was referring to one study that looked at how much it would cost to reach Clinton’s climate goal; it referred to a high-end, 30-year estimate of implementation costs. The study did not actually measure the effects on the economy. Critics of the plan say it will reduce GDP by as much as $2.5 trillion. Supporters say it actually will have a net-positive effect. Trump’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c2dc492c-a93b-46ae-b501-e94b7cac3f06	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-27T11:54:31	2016-09-24	['United_States']
pomt-11920	"The cost-sharing reductions (were) a gift (that) they gave the insurance companies."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/18/donald-trump/trump-mislabels-obamacare-subsidy-gift-insurers/	The current sword hanging over the Obamacare health insurance markets is the future of one of the subsidies in the system. It’s called cost-sharing reduction and it cushions lower-income people from out-of-pocket costs when they see a doctor. This makes up a small slice of the total insurance picture, but President Donald Trump brought the matter to a head Oct. 12 when he canceled all payments. They are worth an estimated $10 billion next year and the move sent a jolt through the individual and small business market. Premium hikes of 20 percent were suddenly a real possibility for policy holders. Trump touted his decision at a cabinet meeting on Monday. "I knocked out the CSRs (cost-sharing reductions)," Trump said Oct. 16. "That was a subsidy to the insurance companies. That was a gift that was, frankly, what they gave the insurance companies." The very next day, two key Republican and Democratic senators announced a deal to keep the payments flowing. At first, Trump seemed at ease with the compromise. "It is a short-term solution so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period -- including a dangerous period for insurance companies by the way," Trump said Oct. 17. "For a period of one to two years, we will have a very good solution." Then, about eight hours later, at a Heritage Foundation dinner, Trump raised doubts about where he stands. He praised the bipartisan effort, but then returned to his theme about insurance companies. "I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies," Trump said. Amidst these head-snapping shifts, we asked, are those cost-sharing reduction payments a bailout, a "gift" to the insurance companies? We couldn’t find an economist who thought they are. In fact, while Washington would be sending insurers those checks, Trump’s statement missed the point that the money doesn’t end up in the companies’ pockets. Here’s why. This piece of Obamacare was designed to protect lower-income families from hefty out-of-pocket costs. The policies they bought on the Obamacare exchanges came with deductibles and co-pays, but instead of paying those themselves, the insurance companies do. Who gets the money? The doctors, hospitals and labs that provide the services. At the end of the day, the federal payment covers the insurer for footing the bill. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines for insurers spells this out pretty clearly. It defines cost-sharing reductions "as expenses on behalf of an enrollee for essential health benefits, including deductibles, copays, and coinsurance." The actual process of figuring out how much to pay each insurance company has a few bumps and turns. Washington pays companies an estimated amount up front, and then trues-up the books every quarter. Companies "must report the amount they paid for each eligible medical claim, the amount enrollees paid for the claims, and the amount of cost sharing that would have been paid for the same services under the corresponding standard plan," the guidelines say. Martin Gaynor at Carnegie Mellon University said in no way does this amount to a subsidy for insurance companies. "It’s not like we were just handing them a pile of money for an expense they didn't incur," Gaynor said. "It’s supposed to keep things neutral. You paid this out on behalf of the enrollee, and now here’s money from Uncle Sam that’s intended to keep you whole." We asked economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California San Diego, and finance professor Scott Harrington at the Wharton School. They both agreed -- the cost-sharing reduction is no gift because if you look at the full picture, the insurance companies are no better off at the end then they were at the start. The only wrinkle that Harrington saw was legal. Due to a court ruling, Trump had the right to cancel the payments. So long as he didn’t do that, that was good news for the insurers. But all that said, the cost-sharing reductions make insurance more affordable to people at or near the poverty line and that increases the number of policies insurance companies can sell. The value of the cost sharing is about one sixth the size of the premium tax credits, which do the heavy lifting to keep insurance affordable, but still, the impact is there. We asked the White House about this and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump called the cost-sharing reductions payments a gift to insurance companies. In reality, the money pays the insurers for payments they make to health care providers. It is a pass-through. Every health care economist we reached said if the companies don’t gain any cash from the transaction, then there is no gift, no bailout or whatever term one might use. The one grain of truth is that anything that makes insurance more affordable increases sales, even if by a small amount. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11609	Says President Barack Obama advocated "fathers in the home" as the solution to gun violence.	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jan/26/jeanne-ives/illinois-rep-says-she-shares-obamas-view-gun-viole/	On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Republican governor candidate Jeanne Ives was asked a question about reducing gun violence. "The problem is the gun violence in this city of Chicago, predominantly," Ives told a public forum for candidates. "And you know how you’re going to solve it? Fathers in the home." After reportedly being booed at the event, Ives, an Illinois state representative from Wheaton, repeated "fathers in the home," according to the Chicago Tribune. The Ives campaign later doubled down on the comment, explaining in a statement released to media that "many have advocated the same idea, including President Obama." The Ives statement quoted from a 2008 Father’s Day speech in which then-candidate Obama, himself raised mostly by a single mother and her parents, called on fathers to own up to their family responsibilities. So is Ives seeking to further an idea that was earlier championed by Obama? Did Obama say fathers actively raising their children will solve the epidemic of gun violence in Chicago? We decided to check. What Obama said Obama’s Father’s Day speech received a lot of attention, analysis and scrutiny at the time. PolitiFact rated one of the dramatic claims in the speech as True: "More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children." Neither Ives in her Martin Luther King Jr. Day comments nor her campaign in its follow-up explanation explicitly mentioned race in connection with the responsibilities of fathers. In fact, the campaign statement sought to draw a link between her assertions and those of Obama by directly quoting from his 2008 Father’s Day speech, yet omitted passages that specifically discussed African-American families. One Obama quote cited by the Ives campaign expressed concern about the absence of too many fathers from homes and families: "We know the statistics — that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison." What Obama didn’t say Peniel Joseph, founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the University of Texas, said Ives was off the mark in trying to link Obama’s sentiments to her take on solving gun violence. Joseph, also a professor at Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs, said he knows Obama’s Father’s Day speech well and the soon-to-be-president "never connected that (speech) specifically to ending gun violence. It was more of an observation on black families." Obama did cite crime as one of the outcomes of broken homes, but Joseph said gun violence can be linked to a broad range of factors. "It’s connected to the drug trade, unemployment, segregated schools," he added. Joseph said he could not recall a time when Obama, in that speech or others, said fathers staying home with their families will reduce gun violence. During his presidency, Obama made several major speeches about gun violence. In a 2013 report, released weeks after a school massacre that killed 20 youngsters in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama proposed a multi-pronged approach to addressing the issue — including improved background checks and other ways to strengthen restrictions on criminals buying guns. Not listed among Obama’s solutions was an emphasis on more two-parent families. April Zeoli, a gun violence expert at Michigan State University, disputed Ives’ prescription for curbing gun violence. "I haven’t seen this as a real, viable intervention for gun violence in Chicago," said Zeoli, an associate professor of criminal justice. In the Ives campaign statement, the candidate also stressed that Obama was just one of "many" others who had drawn a link between absentee fathers and gun violence. She did not name other names than Obama’s, however. When we asked her campaign to elaborate, it provided a list of advocacy organizations such as The National Fatherhood Initiative, The National Center for Fathering and The Fatherhood Project. Also on the list provided by the Ives campaign was disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, who is facing retrial in Pennsylvania on charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted a woman. Our ruling Ives claims she was echoing comments from former President Obama as she declared recently that the solution to curbing rampant gun violence would depend on more fathers taking responsibility for their families. In his 2008 speech, Obama drew a link between children from fatherless homes and those who stray into crime. But Ives took it a lot further than Obama ever did. Her sweeping claim is not supported by the passages from Obama’s speech that her campaign pointed to as evidence. A reading of the full speech doesn’t support Ives either. As president, Obama made several speeches about the proliferation of guns and violence, and also laid out an array of proposals to deal with the problems. In his public pronouncements, however, Obama did not make statements linking the problem of absent fathers with gun violence. Ives is taking the message from Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech out of context. We rate her statement False.	None	Jeanne Ives	None	None	None	2018-01-26T07:00:00	2018-01-15	['None']
pomt-10369	Says Obama opposes innovation, the electric car and "clean, safe, nuclear energy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/27/john-mccain/this-007-claim-is-out-of-ammo/	A new Web video from Sen. John McCain's campaign portrays Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of electric cars, nuclear power and energy "innovation." With music that sounds like the 007 theme, the ad opens with Obama in silhouette and the words "Barack Obama Is Dr. No." The words change to "No To Drilling Offshore Oil" while Obama is heard saying, "Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today." The screen says, "No To A Gas Tax Holiday" while Obama says, "I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea." "No To Innovation. No To The Electric Car" then appears, while Obama says "In this campaign, John McCain is offering the same old gimmicks." The screen says "No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy" while Obama says "I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent." The ad ends with the message: "Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security." The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. The ad has a kind of split personality. While the drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we explain in this item, the other claims were strikingly wrong. In this item, we'll examine the claims about electric cars, nuclear power and innovation. Let's take electric cars first. To back this up, the McCain campaign cites Obama's statement that McCain's $300-million prize for improving car batteries was "a gimmick." But that doesn't prove Obama said "no" to electric cars. (As our friends at FactCheck.org have pointed out, the McCain campaign ignored an Obama remark in which he was criticizing McCain for not doing more than the battery prize.) In fact, Obama has said his energy plan will lead to more electric cars. In a speech on June 16, Obama said his proposal to invest $150-billion in energy programs would lead to new jobs "that will be created when plug-in hybrids or electric cars start rolling off the assembly line here in Michigan." In a speech on May 14, he praised Chrysler for "working to develop a system that integrates electric motors with a fixed-gear transmission." That doesn't sound like "no" to us. Against innovation? To back that up, the McCain campaign cites the same line that McCain's battery plan was a gimmick. But Obama last October proposed a decade-long, $150-billion energy program that would increase research and create new jobs developing "climate-friendly energy supplies that will move us toward energy independence." An 11-page account of his plan, titled Barack Obama's Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader, includes incentives for communities to invest in biofuels refineries, more emphasis on clean coal and "safe and secure nuclear energy." That sounds to us like a pretty significant attempt at innovation. Which brings us to the McCain ad's last point, that Obama said "No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy." To the contrary, it's right there on page 4 of Obama's energy plan: "Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy." It's not a blanket endorsement — Obama says it's important to protect the security of nuclear fuel and waste and determine how to store the waste — but it's still a part of his plan. So McCain is way, way off with these charges. It's not that he's just missing nuances or exaggerating; he has completely distorted Obama's positions, falsely claiming that Obama opposes research and innovation on the most significant political issue of the summer. He portrays Obama as a impediment to energy research when the Democratic candidate has been at least as assertive on the issue as McCain has — and has been touting his energy plan since last October. It's so wrong we have to set the meter ablaze: Pants on Fire.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-27T00:00:00	2008-06-25	['None']
pomt-10420	A gas tax holiday is a gimmick that "every economist says will just go into the pockets of the oil companies."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/21/barack-obama/obama-goes-too-far-to-make-his-point/	Speaking to garment workers in Missouri on May 13, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama said he would fight for real economic improvements "instead of gimmicks like a tax – a gas tax holiday – that every economist says will just go into the pockets of the oil companies." He was referring to proposals by Sens. John McCain and Hillary Clinton to suspend the 18.4 cent-a-gallon federal gas tax for the summer travel season. It's true that economists have found oil companies don't pass the full benefit of gas tax holidays on to consumers. For that and other reasons, the vast majority of economists who have opined on the issue – in fact, every single one that we could find – oppose the holiday (aside from one outlier who liked it because it would benefit the oil industry). In fact, 308 economists have signed a letter opposing the holiday. But to say every economist believes the break would just go to the oil companies is an exaggeration. Even harsh critics of a gas tax holiday said consumers would see some benefit. Obama takes a fact in his favor – that the nation's economists have come down on his side in the gas tax debate – and stretches it a bit too far. Obama made his comments in a freewheeling question-and-answer session in Cape Girardeau, Mo., but his campaign has issued similarly unequivocal claims in television ads. "Experts say it'll just boost oil industry profits," a narrator intoned in one ad early this month. A 2006 study of a state gas tax holiday in Illinois in 2000 found that three-fifths of the benefit went to consumers. In the case of a federal gas tax break, drivers would reap a smaller share, but would still probably see more than half the benefit, said Joseph Doyle Jr., co-author of the study and an associate professor of economics at MIT. "My best guess is if you got rid of the 19-cent tax the price would go down by 10 cents," Doyle said. Other studies suggest a similar result. In a 2007 paper in the B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy (published by the Berkeley Electronic Press), economists Hayley Chouinard and Jeffery Perloff found that consumers and oil companies share the burden of the federal gasoline tax – that is, consumers end up paying 9 to 12 cents of the 18.4 cent tax and oil companies pay the rest. That suggests that if the tax were lifted, consumers might see a price reduction in that range over time. In an interview, Perloff said they had studied a 20-year time frame, and cautioned that his findings might not provide an accurate picture of what would happen during a temporary, three-month gas holiday. William Polley, an assistant professor of economics at Western Illinois University who reviewed much of the relevant economic scholarship on his blog , wrote that "it is safe to say that we (economists) stand firm in agreement that this (gas tax holiday) is a bad, bad idea." But he also said: "The benefit to the consumer would probably not be literally zero." While Obama's statement accurately expresses the dominant view of the low worth of this gas tax proposal, he rhetorically overstates his point. For that, we rule Half True.

pomt-02518	"Social Security was advocated … in the 1930s as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/11/george-will/george-will-says-social-security-was-created-1930s/	The issue of Americans’ choices about whether to work attracted wide attention last week when the Congressional Budget Office released a report predicting that President Barack Obama’s health care law would lead to people deciding to work less. The CBO projection was spun -- largely incorrectly, in our estimation -- into claims that the health care law would kill more than 2 million jobs. But as commentators of all ideological stripes grappled with the complexities of this headline-grabbing statistic, discussion branched out into the question of whether a worker’s individual decision to work less was something positive, negative or a mixture of the two for the economy as a whole. Obama supporters suggested that the opportunity to buy health insurance outside a job was a boon to workers who hated their job or who wanted to work less so they could spend more time taking care of children or aging relatives. The president’s critics saw it as an example of the government essentially using tax dollars to encourage people not to work. This topic came up during a roundtable on the Feb. 9, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday. During the segment, syndicated columnist George Will told host Chris Wallace, "People forget Social Security was advocated ... in the 1930s, as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country." We’d always believed Social Security stemmed from a desire help keep the elderly out of poverty, so we decided to take a look. (Will’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) We checked with eight historians who have written about the 1930s, including several who have studied the Social Security legislation that President Franklin D. Roosevelt shepherded into law in 1935. They told us there’s little evidence that Roosevelt or his administration sold Social Security as a way to get people to quit working, thus opening up jobs for younger, unemployed workers. However, several historians pointed to a different pension proposal that was popular in the United States at the time. This proposal, known as the Townsend Plan, did make that argument, more or less -- and its popularity was strong enough that it’s credited with prodding Roosevelt into advancing the more modest, compromise proposal that would ultimately become Social Security. The Townsend Plan In 1933, during the depths of the Depression, a doctor from Long Beach, Calif., named Francis E. Townsend came up with a plan to support the elderly. Under the proposal, the government would provide a $200-a-month pension to citizens age 60 or older, funded by a 2 percent national tax on transactions. To receive the benefits, a citizen would have to be retired and not a "habitual" criminal. And they would need to spend all of the money within 30 days. This appears to be the source of the notion that Social Security stemmed from efforts to get older Americans to retire. The Townsend Plan "was explicitly supposed to free up jobs, as well as stimulate the economy through spending," said Edwin Amenta, a University of California-Irvine sociologist who wrote the 2006 book, When Movements Matter: The Townsend Plan and the Rise of Social Security. "It was meant to end the Depression and bring permanent prosperity." The plan became wildly popular. "Dr. Townsend published his plan in a local Long Beach newspaper in early 1933, and within about two years, there were 7,000 Townsend Clubs around the country with more than 2.2 million members actively working to make the Townsend Plan the nation's old-age pension system," according to the Social Security Administration’s historical office. Public opinion surveys in 1935 found that 56 percent of Americans favored adoption of the Townsend Plan. This is not to say that the plan made much sense economically (Townsend was not a trained economist.) More plausible projections suggested that the tax rate would have needed to be between 6 percent and 14 percent -- not 2 percent -- to cover the cost of $200-a-month pensions. And there was no guarantee that the money spent by beneficiaries would exceed the amount that would have been spent by the taxpayers from whom it was taken -- a problem if you are trying to increase the amount of overall economic activity in the economy. And those $200-a-month pensions? They were double the typical monthly pay of ordinary workers. "It may well have been the most generous retirement pension promise of all time," according to the Social Security Administration’s historian. Roosevelt’s Social Security The Townsend Plan may have been economic pie in the sky -- but it had serious political influence. The strength of the grassroots movement that supported it is credited with pushing Roosevelt to fast-track an alternative. Roosevelt’s Labor secretary, Frances Perkins, wrote in her memoir The Roosevelt I Knew that the president said Congress "can't stand the pressure of the Townsend plan unless we are studying social security, a solid plan which will give some assurance to old people of systematic assistance upon retirement." Roosevelt’s more cautious plan was based on Americans being taxed on their earnings from work, then qualifying for old-age benefits based on how much they had paid into the system. By contrast, under Townsend’s plan, workers did not have to pay into the system, and the benefits they received were identical, regardless of how wealthy or poor they were. "The administration contrasted its proposal with the utopian and fantastic schemes of the Townsend Plan, and there was no suggestion that these pensions would end the Depression or significantly solve unemployment problems" of the ongoing depression, Amenta said. Indeed, Social Security was not designed to pay out benefits until 1942 -- seven years after passage. While that was eventually moved up to 1939, the delay in offering benefits undercuts the notion that the government wanted to force people to retire quickly and en masse. "Restoring the financial condition of the elderly in a way that did not bankrupt the country was a primary motivation for the program," said Edward Berkowitz, a historian at George Washington University and the author of several books about the history of Social Security. "Getting Americans to quit was only an indirect motivation." Indeed, in its public rhetoric, the administration played up the program’s ability to help the elderly, not on its larger macroeconomic impact. That seemed to mesh with public expectations. "The idea of creating a public pension system for the general population had been around since the 1920s or even earlier on the political left, but they faced three successive Republican presidents who were uninterested," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "So, nothing happened until there was a Democratic president with a large congressional majority backing him up." When Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, he said, "Today, a hope of many years' standing is in large part fulfilled. … We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age." Where the evidence supports Will’s claim While Will’s statement is largely unsupported, several historians said he has a partial point. Other pieces of Roosevelt’s agenda, including establishment of the National Recovery Administration from 1933 and 1935 and his reemployment agreements in 1933 "had goals of reducing weekly hours while maintaining or increasing employment" -- a mission not all that different from Will’s scenario, said Price Fishback, a University of Arizona economist. "Those fears were still there in 1935." Some scholars have also argued that the creation of Social Security actually helped crystallize the previously unfamiliar concept of "retirement." In an influential if somewhat controversial 1980 book, A History of Retirement: The Meaning and Function of an American Institution, 1885-1978, historian William Graebner wrote that Social Security grew out of a broader movement in industry toward the notion of retirement as a life stage, "one of whose functions was to move older people out of the workforce, partly for reasons of job availability and partly for reasons of efficiency," wrote Kathleen W. Jones, a Virginia Tech historian. Graebner, she wrote, saw Social Security as a way to reduce unemployment among the young. On balance, though, scholars say it’s important not to overplay the idea that Roosevelt intended -- or "advocated," to use Will’s word -- for Social Security to be a tool for transitioning the elderly out of the work force. What Will pointed to "is part of the story, although not the whole story by any means, because the crisis of the elderly was so severe," said Michael Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. "All major institutions and policies have multiple, not always consistent purposes." Our ruling Will said, "Social Security was advocated … in the 1930s as a way of getting people to quit working, because they thought we were confined to a permanent scarcity of jobs in this country." The idea that old-age pensions would transition older Americans out of the labor market and usher in younger, unemployed workers was a goal of the Townsend Plan (and of some other Roosevelt policies). But judging both by its design and by the rhetoric used to sell it, Roosevelt’s Social Security Act was targeted more at alleviating poverty among the elderly than at shaping the demographics of the labor market. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. *** EDITOR’S NOTE, Feb. 12, 2014: After we published this fact-check, a reader pointed us to an April 28, 1935, "fireside chat" by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that seemed to provide clearer support for George Will’s claim. Roosevelt said, "The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government. … It proposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age." When we showed this statement to a couple of the historians we had originally interviewed, they acknowledged that it was an unusually clear statement on Roosevelt’s part, but they added that it is an exception within the documentary record. "Promoting retirement was a minor goal at best of the old-age parts of the legislation," said University of California-Irvine sociologist Edwin Amenta. Historian Jeff Shesol cited "the near-absence of this argument, not only in Roosevelt’s many remarks over the years but also in the internal deliberations, as recounted by multiple participants, over the Social Security framework." Since our original analysis had already acknowledged that transitioning older workers out of the labor force was "part of the story" of Social Security -- just not the main part -- we are sticking to our ruling of Mostly False.

pomt-06666	"Mike Trainor...still owes $250,000 to the state."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/11/vincent-buddy-cianci/cianci-says-chafee-staffer-michael-trainor-still-o/	Talk-radio host and former Providence Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. recently referred to a member of Governor Chafee’s staff as "the guy who still owes $250,000 to the state." Cianci’s jab at Michael F. Trainor, aired on Sept. 1, 2011 on WPRO’s "The Buddy Cianci Show." Because it wasn’t the first time that Cianci had made the comment -- and because a bankruptcy judge had "discharged" most of Trainor’s debt nearly a year ago -- we thought it was worth looking into. Trainor has built a career in public relations representing some of the state’s high-profile politicians and corporate players. He was an advisor and spokesman for Lincoln Chafee during Chafee’s successful 2010 run for governor. But Trainor has had his own public relations problems ever since it became known late last year that he and a business partner from Connecticut defaulted on a $250,000 federal small business loan granted through the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation. According to the EDC and bankruptcy court documents, here’s what happened: The duo and two of their partners started a Rhode Island company, called Genesis Distribution & Marketing, in 2006 to distribute and market retractable window screens and hurricane shutters. Trainor and his partners had already bought a company in Connecticut that distributed and installed hurricane shutters. And they planned to buy three more in the South that made the shutters. In January 2007, the EDC loaned the business $250,000 through the federally funded Small Business Loan Fund to buy inventory, furniture, fixtures and equipment and hire three employees. But the business was short-lived. Just two months after receiving the EDC loan, the partners fell behind on their payments. In 2008, the company folded. Trainor and his partner from Connecticut, who had pledged their homes as collateral for the loan, talked with representatives from the EDC about a settlement. But the talks broke off in August 2009, when Trainor notified the agency that he was filing for bankruptcy. By then, the housing market had tanked along with the value of Trainor’s house. The partners had repaid $36,326 of the loan; with interest and late fees, the debt on the loan at the time totaled $250,723. In September 2010, a bankruptcy judge granted Trainor’s petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. An explanation of the ruling in the bankruptcy court documents states: "The chapter 7 discharge order eliminates a debtor's legal obligation to pay a debt that is discharged.’’ The EDC loan was written off on Nov. 30, 2010. The agency concluded that it couldn’t recover any money from its lien on Trainor’s home because the mortgage balance exceeded the property’s value. In December, 2010, Trainor, who was being considered for a job in the Chafee administration, told The Providence Journal that he had not walked away from his obligations, saying he’d like to negotiate a settlement with the EDC. Governor Chafee discussed Trainor’s situation on Channel 12 "Newsmakers" in December 2010, saying that there would be an effort made to repay the EDC. "[We’ll] make sure Mike does that,’’ he said. So it certainly sounded then as though Chafee and even Trainor himself believed that Trainor still owed the EDC the money. Chafee hired Trainor as spokesman when he took office in January, a job that paid $129,235. That month, Trainor also repaid the state $20,788.75 in taxes -- which were not dischargeable in the bankruptcy -- owed on his failed business. In return, the state Division of Taxation removed the lien on his property. Six months later, in July, the bank sold his house at a foreclosure auction. Trainor served seven months as Chafee’s spokesman before he was transferred, in August, to the Department of Higher Education. His salary has dropped to $88,177. So, does he still owe the $250,000, as Cianci claims? "That debt was discharged,’’ Andrew S. Richardson, a lawyer and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Trustee in the Trainor case, said. "(He) can no longer be forced to pay the obligation -- nor can the creditor take any steps to try and collect it.’’ In other words, Richardson said, there’s no legal obligation that Trainor repay the loan. But other lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy see it differently. "Most people understand (bankruptcy) as destroying the debt … but technically the discharge in bankruptcy doesn’t destroy the debt at all,’’ Jason Kilborn, a lawyer, law professor and resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Virginia said. "It does not destroy the obligation from a moral or even a legal obligation. It just prevents the creditors from collecting on that debt.’’ The American Bankruptcy Institute was founded in 1982 to provide Congress and the public with unbiased analysis of bankruptcy issues. In other words, the debt remains, even though the creditors are forced to write it off as uncollectable. So if the debt remains but Trainor isn’t obligated to repay it, does he really "owe" the state money? We called Cianci and challenged him on his use of the term "owes." Trainor’s bankruptcy discharge, he maintained, doesn’t change the fact that Trainor still owes the EDC the $250,000. "Maybe it was discharged,’’ he said, "but in the mind of the taxpayer who fronted the 250 grand? Yeah, he still owes it." Said Richardson, the trustee: "I think it depends on whose point of view you’re looking at, the creditor or the debtor.’’ We agree. Practically speaking, the bankruptcy ruling and the fact that the mortgage on the Trainor’s home exceeded its value made it impossible for the EDC to recoup its money. But even after the debt was discharged in bankruptcy Trainor and Chafee both said they’d make an effort made to repay the EDC. After all, a debt can be owed even if it’s never collected. For that reason, we rule Cianci’s statement Mostly True.	None	Vincent "Buddy" Cianci	None	None	None	2011-09-11T00:01:00	2011-09-01	['None']
pomt-09117	"Oil companies showered regulators (at the Minerals Management Service) with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/17/barack-obama/obama-blames-mms-being-captive-oil-industry/	In his June 15, 2010, Oval Office address responding to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama touched on the dysfunctional record of the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office responsible for both collecting revenues from resource extraction on federal property and regulating drilling companies on those lands. "One place we’ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service," Obama said. "Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves. At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight. Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations." We decided to focus on Obama's claim that "oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations." To analyze this statement, we decided to break it down into three parts. • Did oil companies offer "gifts and favors" to regulators? There's ample evidence that they did, at least in one Gulf coast office that was investigated. The most recent report of the Interior Department's Inspector General, released on May 25, 2010, found that employees of oil companies regulated by MMS footed the bill for a wide range of perks for employees of MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office. These included hunting and fishing trips; football games; and lunches. In a number of cases, the IG report named specific employees who acknowledged receiving gifts. This year's report followed a series of other IG reports that found a pattern of ethical violations -- including MMS employees' acceptance of free travel, sports tickets and ski outings -- in the agency's royalty-in-kind office. That office oversaw the collection of royalties from oil companies but did not do the kind of industry safety and environmental regulation that Obama was referring to in his Oval Office speech. Either way, this claim by the president seems to be based on solid evidence. • Were oil companies "essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections"? There's also evidence that this happened, from testimony before a joint hearing conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard and the MMS after the spill began. In an account of the hearings, the Washington Post reported that the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that caught fire and sunk "was registered in the Marshall Islands, a Pacific archipelago that like many jurisdictions, authorizes private organizations such as ... Det Norske Veritas to inspect vessels that operate under its flag. The owners of the oil rigs decide which of those organizations to hire, and they pay for the services." The Post reported that when Thomas F. Heinan, deputy commissioner of maritime affairs for the Marshall Islands, was asked whether that arrangement presented a conflict of interest, he answered, "In some persons' minds it might, but it's been a long-standing facility that's been in place for years." The Post also reported that Coast Guard Capt. Verne B. Gifford testified that while the U.S. Coast Guard inspects oil rigs, "it relies on the private inspectors to do the bulk of the work" when those rigs are foreign-flagged. For those platforms, Gifford testified, the Coast Guard "goes onboard the vessel just to verify," a process that "usually takes maybe four to eight hours," the Post reported. This addresses inspections overseen by the Coast Guard, but there's also evidence -- somewhat less solid -- that something similar may have been happening with MMS, which was the main target of the president's comments. The IG report on MMS' Lake Charles, La., district office said that a confidential source "told investigators that some MMS inspectors had allowed oil and gas production company personnel located on the platform to fill out inspection forms. The forms would then be completed or signed by the inspector and turned in for review. According to the source, operating company personnel completed the inspection forms using pencils, and MMS inspectors would write on top of the pencil in ink and turn in the completed form." But while the confidential source's allegation was credible enough to include in the report, the IG's office stopped short of confirming the allegation, saying that their investigation of the original forms failed to assure them that the over-writing they found stemmed from fraudulent actions. • Were oil companies allowed to write their own regulations? This one is the murkiest of the three. In a May 10, 2010, article for McClatchy Newspapers, reporters Les Blumenthal and Erika Bolstad wrote that nearly 100 standards put together by the American Petroleum Institute -- the oil industry's trade group -- have made their way into federal offshore operating regulations. When we asked Blumenthal and Bolstad for their original source, they pointed us to a Jan 11, 2010, issue of the Federal Register. The Register -- the official daily listing of notices from federal agencies -- reported that the MMS "is incorporating by reference the Eleventh Edition of the American Petroleum Institute's Specification for Subsurface Safety Valve Equipment (API Spec 14A) into its regulations." It went on to explain that "we currently incorporate by reference 97 private sector consensus standards into the offshore operating regulations." We asked experts in federal regulation whether this sort of industry-agency collaboration was unusual, and whether it supported the president's assertion that the petroleum industry was writing its own regulations. James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that this sort of technical standards-writing "happens all the time." "It is quite common for regulatory agencies to adopt standards drafted, or already in use, in the private sector," he said. "It is especially common in very technical areas where specific expertise in the technologies involved is needed. Agencies, of course, should be wary of self-serving or anti-competitive provisions in such standards, and should use their own judgment in adopting them. But that doesn’t make the use of such standards generally inappropriate." Cynthia R. Farina, a Cornell University law professor and the principal investigator for the Cornell eRulemaking Initiative, agreed, saying, "It's not unheard of for agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards for the content of federal regulation." It's also worth noting that the API's standards weren't slipped into federal rules at midnight in some smoke-filled room. The proposed rule was published on June 12, 2008, and for the next two months, the public had an opportunity to comment. Farina added that the regulation in question was put into place using a process that requires the Interior Department to consult with a variety of other government entities. As it turns out, only two entities did offer comments on this rule -- Baker Oil Tools and the Offshore Operators Committee. Farina calls this "a huge problem with rulemaking in general. Certainly the absence of comments from environmentalists and neutral researchers in the area would exacerbate concerns about industry 'writing its own regulations.'" Still, MMS can't be blamed for poor response to its call for comments. That's why we think that while Obama was on solid ground with his accusations that MMS regulators were "showered ... with gifts and favors" and that oil companies "were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections," the notion that industry wrote its own regulations is not a slam-dunk. While Obama is technically correct that the oil industry did in several dozen cases "write their own regulations," our experts agreed that industry/regulator collaboration is common across federal agencies, at least for technical matters, and that it was done in an open way that included the opportunity for public comment. As a whole, then, we rate the president's comment Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-06-17T18:44:23	2010-06-15	['None']
pomt-03647	"Every Florida teacher gets a pay raise."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/may/01/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-every-florida-teacher-gets-pay-rai/	Update: We updated this story to reflect updated budget proviso language that leaders agreed to May 1. These changes include removing the requirement that raises be delayed until June 2014 and giving boards the option to come up with their own merit-pay plans. Gov. Rick Scott declared "victory" after legislative leaders announced they included $480 million in the 2013-14 budget for teacher pay raises. Scott, who made a $2,500 pay raise for every teacher one of just two priorities this legislative session, announced the news on his Facebook page April 29: "Our teachers are some of the best in the nation and they deserve to be rewarded for their great work. Today I am proud to announce that every Florida teacher gets a pay raise." He included a photo of a male teacher with can’t-miss-it, all-caps text that reads "EVERY FLORIDA TEACHER GETS A PAY RAISE! IT’S WORKING." He’s over-simplifying it. The truth is, the Legislature’s offering of $480 million for raises may be in the amount Scott wanted, but he’s glossing over the fine print for how they want it spent. Earlier in the session, House and Senate leaders weren’t keen on Scott’s idea because it does not align with 2011 legislation they pitched and Scott signed implementing a merit pay system for teachers. But with a week left in session, leaders found a way to please both sides. Here are three details not included in Scott’s Facebook post, which last we checked had more than 2,400 likes: The raises would not be limited to just teachers. They are not immediate. And they are not a guarantee. You can find the conditions the Legislature placed in its bill implementing next year’s budget (page 21). House and Senate leadership agreed to allow for salary increases not only for school district and charter school classroom teachers, but for guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists, librarians, principals and assistant principals. The throng of education workers would not see an immediate raise. Initially, the budget was written so they would have to wait until June 2014 before getting a lump-sum payment for the 2013-14 school year. Hearing negative feedback on this provision, House and Senate changed this language so that school boards can distribute salary increases anytime before June 2014 "as negotiated with collective bargaining units and educators." But that’s if they qualify. The raises are based on merit. Lawmakers suggested school professionals be judged based on 2013-14 performance evaluations to be determined by school districts and approved by the state Department of Education. For education personnel deemed "effective," lawmakers recommended salary increases of at least $2,500. Those rated "highly effective" are eligible for up to $3,500. New language that lawmakers added May 1 gives districts the options to come up with their own merit-pay plans, a move the FEA applauded. But there is still no mandate that every teacher get a raise. Factors that districts could use in their evaluations may include results on Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate assessments, as well as SAT, ACT, FCAT and end-of-course exam results. For those who don’t teach courses with standardized tests, districts will develop separate evaluation criteria. The Legislature took a different approach for state workers, awarding them $1,000 or $1,400 pay hikes (plus a chance for $600 more for some based on merit) depending on their income starting in October. Law enforcement officers would get their raise this summer. The caveats for teachers disappointed the Florida Education Association, which praised Scott for his efforts but dinged the Legislature for the strings attached, as well as Miami-Dade and Broward county superintendents Alberto Carvalho and Robert Runcie. The superintendents said they could not afford to give every teacher $2,500 on top of paying the "unfunded mandate" of raises for principals and staff. (Carvalho said the updated language is a positive move.) The South Florida superintendents said even though the Legislature will increase per-pupil funding by $1 billion statewide ($134 million for Miami-Dade and $93 million for Broward), there would still not be enough money to pay for raises, other benefits and healthcare, and other earmarks from the state, according to the Miami Herald. "The math simply does not add up," Runcie said. Based on the 2011-12 evaluations, just about every teacher would qualify for a raise. Of the teachers who were evaluated, 22.6 percent of teachers were highly effective and 74.6 percent were effective, leaving just under 3 percent of teachers with ratings of needs improvement or unsatisfactory. Ten percent of the state’s teachers were not evaluated. The numbers were similar for non-classroom personnel measured by merit pay, though 27.2 percent were not evaluated, according to Department of Education data. Even with the merit requirements, Scott spokeswoman Melissa Sellers said it’s not realistic to think unions and districts won’t try to get money to all teachers. The budget language is written flexibly enough so that districts are not precluded from using money from the state to award every teacher a raise, even if they do not qualify for merit pay or are rated below effective. Miami Rep. Erik Fresen, who is in charge of House education appropriations, told the Miami Herald "we provided $480 million for districts to provide much-deserved salary increases to whom they determine meet their criteria of effective." His Senate counterpart, Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, told us while the raises are not guaranteed to every teacher, "At the end of the day, there should be something for everybody." But it’s not up to Scott, or the Legislature for that matter. Florida law says the state cannot dictate teacher salaries. Teacher salaries are negotiated between the school districts and teachers union. So even though legislators approved a half-billion dollar pot of money for teacher raises, there is no guarantee that every teacher will get a raise. School districts in talks with unions will ultimately decide who gets raises, who doesn’t and how much. All the state and Scott can do is strongly suggest how school districts dish out the extra money they’re getting. "However, it must be kept in mind that other funding increases are being provided to school districts," said FEA spokesman Mark Pudlow. "Presumably, that money could be bargained for increased salaries, so technically, every Florida teacher ‘may get a pay raise.’" Our ruling Rick Scott said "every Florida teacher gets a pay raise." Will every Florida teacher get a pay raise? It seems likely, with the influx of money poured into education this year. But Scott can’t decree it, and the budget is written so that it applies to high-performing educators. Plus, some superintendents have said the inclusion of non-instructional personnel will make it harder if not impossible to award every teacher a raise. We rate Scott’s statement Half True.

pomt-03404	If it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is "going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/01/bill-maher/bill-maher-said-immigration-bill-will-make-border-/	On a recent episode of his HBO talk show, comedian Bill Maher said it was outrageous how much the Border Patrol is poised to expand due to an amendment to the Senate immigration bill. Maher was referring to an amendment sponsored by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee that would add "19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border." The amendment was widely seen as as a way of garnering votes from undecided Republicans. (The amendment, and eventually the bill itself, passed the Senate easily with bipartisan support, though the measure now faces an uncertain fate in the House.) If the bill is enacted as is, Maher said during a roundtable segment of his June 21, 2013, show, it is "going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet. There'll be over 40,000 agents. It's four times more than any of the Republicans were asking for in their wildest dreams. It's like, to get Republican senators to vote for something now, you have to get to crazy." A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. The bill is "going to make the Border Patrol bigger than the FBI" The amendment promises 19,200 additional trained, full-time, active duty U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border. In most media accounts, this has been shorthanded to be roughly a doubling of the size of the southwest border agent ranks to 40,000. The most recent published statistics we found reported that in 2012, there were 18,516 Border Patrol agents on the southwest border. That would make the new total 37,716 once the newcomers are all sworn in and wearing uniforms. That’s not quite 40,000, but even at 37,716, it’s still enough to beat the FBI, because in 2012, the FBI had 35,629 employees. Want an even more striking comparison? Match up the number of agents in each of the two agencies. The FBI has 13,766 special agents. This means that once the amendment’s plan is carried out, the Border Patrol will have more than two and a half times as many agents on the southwestern border alone as the FBI does to investigate crimes anywhere in the world. (And the Border Patrol is even bigger than that. It assigned an additional 2,430 agents in 2012 to the northern border and coastal regions, and its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has nearly 39,000 additional employees in the U.S. and around the world.) So, however you slice it, Maher’s correct that the Border Patrol will be bigger than the FBI if the Senate bill is enacted. "You could put one (Border Patrol) agent every 250 feet" According to the International Water and Boundary Commission -- a bi-national body that oversees governance issues on the U.S.-Mexico border -- the border between the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is is 1,954 miles long. That works out to 10.32 million feet. Doing the math, you could space out 37,716 agents one every 274 feet (or, using the widely published 40,000 figure, you could put them every 258 feet). Either way, Maher’s calculation strikes us as very close to accurate. Needless to say, the Border Patrol wouldn’t deploy their personnel in this fashion. Not only do patrols work on shifts, but some agents are flying helicopters, some are escorting or guarding detainees and a good number are shoulder-to-shoulder at the major border cross points screening cars, searching for drugs. But Maher’s rhetorical point is well-taken: The agency literally, if it wished, could place agents every 274 feet. Our ruling Maher said that if it is enacted, the Senate immigration bill is "going to make the border patrol bigger than the FBI -- you could put one agent every 250 feet." He’s right on the first claim and on target with the second. In all, we rate his statement True.

pomt-14809	For NATO exercises, "we don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/25/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-united-states-lacks-military-equipme/	Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush called for using ground troops against the Islamic State and beefing up our military the week after the Paris terrorist attacks. Bush criticized President Barack Obama and Congress for weakening the military through "careless, chronic neglect," summing up the lack of sufficient personnel and equipment with a single anecdote. "To conduct training exercises under our NATO obligations in Europe, American forces have been borrowing helicopters and other vehicles from our allies. Really," Bush said in a speech at The Citadel on Nov. 18. "We don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers. That’s just not unsafe — that’s embarrassing for the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Whatever challenges we face in Europe or elsewhere, we’re not going to meet them with borrowed equipment." China, however, has been spending heavily on new military equipment, Bush said. We wanted to know if the U.S. military is so hard up that it’s borrowing choppers from the Brits. Borrowed equipment Military experts told PolitiFact that the decline in equipment and personnel dates back to the end of the Cold War, so it’s not entirely the fault of Obama and Republicans in Congress. However, the cuts have been stepped up over recent years as part of sequestration, the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect in 2013 after Congress failed to reach a budget agreement. A spokesman for the Bush campaign sent us two October 2015 news articles quoting Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the Army’s commanding general in Europe, talking about his equipment shortages. As the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe has dropped 35 percent since 2012, the Army has reduced some equipment or relocated it, the New York Times reported. It’s possible for the Army to bring equipment to Europe from bases in the United States, but that is expensive and time consuming. "I don’t have bridges, I don’t have the trucks that can carry tanks, we don’t have enough helicopters to do what we need to do," Hodges told the New York Times. "Practicing with British helicopters here is an essential part of it. Using British and German bridges, using Hungarian air defense is part of it." A spokesman for the Army, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said Hodges has consistently said that his forces lack sufficient airplanes. "Whether this is 'embarrassing' or simply a reality of Army force structure relative to global conditions is a matter of opinion," Buccino said. He confirmed that the Army has been sharing equipment — as it did during a multinational exercise in Europe in August. "This is not a new development," Buccino said. "Our forces often train with partnered militaries using host-nation equipment. In fact, training with NATO allies across platforms and equipment allows us to develop interoperability across the alliance, which would be crucial if we have to fight in the European theater." The United States started scaling back in Europe about 25 years ago, a strategy "predicated on the notion of benign or at least non-hostile Russia," said Mark Cancian, a retired colonel with the Marines Reserve and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "What’s happened in the last two years has upset those assumptions, and everybody recognizes that." Obama "gets a little credit" for trying to beef up the military in Europe, Cancian said. The Obama administration put together the European Reassurance Initiative, which includes $985 million for 2015 and requested $789 million in 2016. Steve Saideman, a professor at Carleton University in Canada who recently wrote a book about NATO, said the whole idea of NATO exercises is to improve working together, so it makes sense that it would include riding in another nation’s airplanes. Plus, it can be cheaper than sending them in from overseas. "I really don’t see the problem with this," Saideman told PolitiFact. "It is a way to grandstand on the issue, but it has no real substance. The larger issue facing the military is the unpredictability produced by sequestration, and Bush’s party represents half or more of the sequestration problem." Lisa Samp, a Center for Strategic and International Studies fellow, says that Bush’s statement sounds like a bit of semantics. "If in a multinational training exercise we put U.S. soldiers on another nations’ troop transport vehicles or aircraft, are we ‘borrowing’ their equipment or simply conducting joint training?" said Samp, who served as director for NATO and European Strategic Affairs at the National Security Council from 2014-15. Samp said that there is a disconnect between our stated commitment in Europe and the forces we have there. "The good news in Europe is that we have allies to help fill gaps; this is not so much a sign of weakness (as Bush suggests) but of a working alliance," she said. The decline of American forces in Europe is an outgrowth of the planned pivot to Asia, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. And as PolitiFact Florida has previously noted, the military is in the process of buying and upgrading all sorts of military equipment, including the largest aircraft procurement ever: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. One final note on China, which Bush said is increasing its military capability. The United States spent as much on the military in 2013 as the next eight countries combined, including China. "Jeb Bush claims the United States military risks sliding to inferiority. Inferior to who exactly?" said Matthew Fay, a defense expert at the libertarian Niskanen Center. "By the best available estimates, the United States spent over $300 billion more than China and Russia combined in 2014." Our ruling Bush said, for NATO exercises "we don’t have enough of our own hardware and equipment even for training purposes. So the Brits are spotting us choppers." The U.S. Army in Europe has used military equipment of allies as part of NATO obligations. However, Bush omits that the U.S. military has been cutting back in Europe since the Cold War, so cuts over eight years are nothing new. Experts say the equipment sharing isn’t as problematic as Bush makes it seem because the military is working with allies as part of NATO. With those caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09121	Says the Republican “state convention is actually larger than the Republican National Convention.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/17/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-believe-it-or-not-republican-state-c/	Warming up for last week’s Republican State Convention in Dallas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst made a Texas-sized boast in a video posted on his campaign Web site Wednesday. “It may be hard to believe, “ Dewhurst said, “but our (Republican) state convention is actually larger than the Republican National Convention.” Getouttahere! Dewhurst’s campaign spokesman, Mike Walz, said in an e-mail that Dewhurst’s calculation was based on comparing the number of delegates and alternates to this June’s state confab and the number of delegates and alternates chosen to attend the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minnesota. First, Walz pointed to About.com and CNN Web posts, both stating there were 2,380 delegates to the party’s national convention. Next, he noted a recent Dallas Morning News article stating 12,000 GOP activists went to the state convention and a Fort Worth Star-Telegram article stating more than 10,000 delegates and alternates were expected. We also asked the Republican Party of Texas about its count of 2010 convention attendees. Spokesman Bryan Preston replied that “we have just under 12,000 delegates & alternates. Add the guests and VIPs and we’ll hit” 15,000 to 16,000 participants. Why so many people? For decades, state party rules have provided one delegate for every 300 votes cast for the Republican nominee in the latest governor’s race, which explains why the biennial gatherings are held in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio; other cities don’t have halls big enough to cram such crowds into one space. Driven by the ratio, the party’s potential turnout of delegates and alternates surged from nearly 10,000 in 1984 to more than 17,000 in 2004, according to research by Clint Moore of Houston, a longtime member of the party’s Rules Committee. The number of permitted delegates and alternates dipped to 11,500 in 2008 because Gov. Rick Perry saw a drop in his vote haul in 2006 while fending off three major challengers. Does that mean the total delegate count could keep rising election after election, mostly because of population growth? Nope. Delegates voted at last week’s convention to cap delegates at 9,000 starting with the 2012 state convention. The decision ensures that Fort Worth, intended site of the next two conventions, can comfortably serve as host city. The local convention center has a fixed-seat capacity of about 10,500, according to Eric Opiela, a former party executive director just elected to the executive committee. Nevertheless, the Texas delegate count this year far surpasses the 2008 national convention’s count. We wondered if there’s another way to compare the sizes of the state and national gatherings. Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, guided us to a study of the economic impact of the 2008 convention on the host cities, Minneapolis-St. Paul. The study, by the Minneapolis-St. Paul 2008 Host Committee, states that 45,000 “guests” came to the Twin Cities for the four-day gathering, driving more than $150 million in spending. Separately, the Dallas Convention & Visitors Bureau told us the recent state convention delivered a local economic impact of more than $6.3 million. Riggs also noted a news article published in May by the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times stating that 50,000 delegates, protesters and reporters are expected to attend the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. So how does Dewhurst’s statement shake out? This month’s GOP state convention drew more delegates than the 2008 national convention, but economic and other indicators suggest the national convention ultimately draws more people.

pomt-00170	"For perspective, Special Session costs you $50k, every single day. That’s roughly the average teacher’s salary in NC."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/23/chaz-beasley/dems-claim-session-costs-much-teacher/	It’s been a hectic few months for North Carolina lawmakers, starting with debate in a special session over six constitutional amendments Republicans had placed on the ballot. A panel of judges then ruled the ballot language for two of these amendments unconstitutional. So another special session of the North Carolina General Assembly was held to rewrite the amendments before elections, over the objections of Democrats. Those weren’t the only special sessions. Gov. Roy Cooper called for another session after Hurricane Florence devastated much of Eastern North Carolina. Taxpayer money is financing these special sessions. And during the second session, some Democrats expressed their displeasure by sharing the daily cost of their work in Raleigh. Rep. Chaz Beasley, a Democrat from Charlotte, tweeted: "Special Session costs you $50k, every single day. That’s roughly the average teacher’s salary in NC." Beasley is not the only one putting this number into the Twitterverse. Another tweet by Lisa Mathis, a Democratic candidate from Sanford, said: "Raleigh politician John Sauls is helping to flush another 50k down the drain w/ the #specialsession." Beasley told PolitiFact he got his information from a WRAL report from 2014. The report says $50,000 is an estimate from Financial Services staff since the General Assembly does not provide what the exact costs are. The actual cost is closer to $42,000, according to figures provided by Paul Coble, the legislative services officer at the General Assembly. Coble sent PolitiFact the cost of operations for the General Assembly from 2005 to 2015. "An average daily cost of a session is approximately $42,000. This number would be the same for a regularly scheduled day of session, or an ‘extra session,’" Coble wrote in a letter to PolitiFact. That’s the amount that the state spends in addition to the money it would normally spend when lawmakers aren’t in session. More recent years have been even more expensive. The average daily cost of sessions in the 2014-2015 fiscal year was about $46,000, closer to the number Beasley is using. The information Coble provided does not go beyond June 2015. Politicians have been using the average salary of teachers as a benchmark to compare the daily cost of special sessions. Beasley used the $50,000 number to make the point that it’s about the same as the average North Carolina teacher’s salary in 2018. The average teacher salary is $51,144, according to a report in February 2018 by the state Department of Public Instruction detailing the state education budget. What if we want to compare the cost of session in 2014-2015 to the average teacher salary in the 2014-15 school year? According to the National Education Association, teachers in North Carolina were making about $48,000 at the time. That’s extremely close to cost of session per day. The daily cost of a session goes towards numerous things, such as fiscal research, building maintenance, food services and much more. And as reported by The News and Observer, legislators were being paid $104 for every day they were in session to cover the costs of lodging and food. With the exception of the House and Senate leaders, who are paid $38,151 annually, legislators are paid $13,951 annually. Our ruling The daily cost of operations for the General Assembly, using the most recent numbers available, is about $46,000 if the legislature is in session. That is close to the number Beasley and other Democrats have been using. However, their statements refer to information from almost three years ago, and we have been unable to attain data for this year’s session. And it’s not far off from the average teacher salary. We give this statement a Mostly True rating.

pomt-01390	Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour "will destroy between half a million and one million jobs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/14/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-minimum-wage-hike-would-destr/	In the first and only debate of Kentucky’s U.S. Senate race, Sen. Mitch McConnell was peppered with questions about his opposition to a proposed minimum wage hike. In response, McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, said raising the minimum wage in already difficult economic times would hurt employment. He cited a Congressional Budget Office study that he claimed said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would "destroy half a million to 1 million jobs." "That’s not the way to grow our economy," he added. His Democratic challenger, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, countered that the report also noted a minimum wage hike would lift, "over a million Americans out of poverty." (In a separate fact-check, we rated that Mostly True.) We’re taking a look at McConnell’s claim in this fact-check. The report in question from the Congressional Budget Office, the chief fiscal scorekeeper for Congress, came out in February 2014. It took a look at President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 in 2016. The report found most low-wage workers "would received higher pay that would increase their family’s income." But the report said there’s a downside as well. Some people could lose their jobs. Why? An increase in wages would increase companies’ costs. That causes companies to raise their prices, which means fewer people want their goods or services, leading to less production and fewer workers needed to get the job done. Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers also encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing more productive higher-wage workers. For example, it might be cheaper to pay more for new machines that can replace workers, than to pay higher minimum wages. The net impact of this? The CBO estimates a total reduction in the workforce of about 0.3 percent, or 500,000 workers. How, then, did McConnell get between "half a million and 1 million jobs" would be destroyed? The CBO is very careful to note that 500,000 is a rough estimate and the midpoint of the range of likely outcomes. The report said, "There is about a two-thirds chance that the effect would be in the range between a very slight reduction in employment and a reduction in employment of 1 million workers." Instead of quoting the halfway point or — most accurately — offering the full-range of estimates, McConnell presents the top half of likely outcomes as though it’s fact. It’s just as likely that there are somewhere between very few and 499,999 jobs lost, but you would not get that impression from McConnell’s statement. Our ruling McConnell claimed that a Congressional Budget Office report said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour "will destroy between half a million and one million jobs." The report said "roughly" 500,000 workers could lose their jobs if the minimum wage went up. But the CBO added that most likely the range was between very few to 1 million. McConnell focuses on the high-end of the spectrum on a range of potential outcomes. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2014-10-14T17:35:14	2014-10-13	['None']
pomt-12054	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand "no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/sep/08/american-israel-public-affairs-committee/gillibrand-still-opposes-boycott-israel-despite-fl/	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand no longer supports a bill she originally co-sponsored that would punish people for boycotting Israel. "I am going to urge the authors of the bill to change the bill, and I will not support it in its current form," Gillibrand said at a town hall meeting in Queens. The bill targets individuals and companies who participate in the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, a Palestinian-led effort to remove international support for Israel by asking global leaders and businesses to cut ties with the country. Offenders could face heavy fines and even jail time under the bill. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee sent an email to its supporters about Gillibrand’s flip a few days after the event. "New York’s junior Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, has withdrawn her co-sponsorship of the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.720), sending a powerful message to her constituents that she no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel," the email said. AIPAC is one of the most influential lobbying groups for pro-Israel interests in the U.S. Each major party candidate for president spoke at its conference last year. Gillibrand has taken a lot of flack since the email blast, including from Jewish leaders and online publications. A letter to the editor published in the New York Daily News claims Gillibrand now supports the BDS movement. Pro-Palestinian groups have even thanked Gillibrand for opposing the bill. Does her new stance on the bill mean she supports the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement? Gillibrand in context Gillibrand said she changed her position after meeting with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the bill. "We went through their reading of the bill and why they believe it says — it chills free speech, which means the bill is ambiguous," Gillibrand said at the town hall. The bill would fine individuals or companies anywhere from $250,000 to $1 million for engaging in any activity that supports the BDS movement, according to the ACLU. Violators could also face up to 20 years in prison. Gillibrand changed her position because, in her view, individuals should not face that kind of punishment for expressing their opinion. "I’m against BDS but I think anybody who’s in favor should feel very comfortable speaking on any stage, anywhere in America, saying exactly why," Gillibrand said. "That is what free speech is about, and I fully support it." Gillibrand said she does support penalizing companies that participate in BDS. Gillibrand responded to her critics more than a week later in an opinion piece on Forward, a Jewish news website. "Some have suggested that I suddenly began supporting the BDS movement when I took my name off the bill. This accusation has popped up on the Internet in recent days – both from Israel’s supporters and from Israel’s detractors. This is just plain false," Gillibrand wrote. "I cannot state this more clearly: I vehemently oppose the BDS movement." Our ruling AIPAC told its supporters Gillibrand "no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel." AIPAC did not respond to a request to clarify its statement. Gillibrand has made it clear, both during the town hall and after, that she still opposes the BDS movement. She does not support the Israel Anti-Boycott Act in its current form because she believes it violates individual liberties. The claim misleads readers who may now believe Gillibrand supports the BDS movement. We rate it False.

pomt-07111	"President Obama and liberal former DNC Chairman Tim Kaine’s $787 billion stimulus failed to create jobs."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/20/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-senate-group-says-tim-kaines-stimulus-failed-c/	As Democrat Tim Kaine campaigns for the Senate, Republicans are hoping to link him with the stimulus bill passed by Congress in 2009. Kaine was governor of Virginia and had just become chairman of the Democratic National Committee when President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Feb. 17, 2009. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the Senate, is saying the stimulus failed to put Americans back to work. "President Obama and liberal former DNC Chairman Tim Kaine’s $787 billion stimulus failed to create jobs," the NRSC said in a June 3 press release. Did the stimulus really fail to create jobs? Lots of Republicans are saying that, and we thought we’d take a look. Chris Bond, a spokesman for the NRSC, said the statement is based on Kaine’s assurances in February 2009 that the stimulus would save or create 3 million jobs. Bond also noted that the unemployment rate is at 9.1 percent and has been above 8 percent for 28 months in a row. But the NRSC press release says nothing about 3 million jobs. The statement simply charges that the stimulus "failed to create jobs." This is an old Republicans charge. Earlier this month we gave House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, a False rating when he said the stimulus "failed to get people back to work." Let’s review some of the evidence we found then. The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Between February 17, 2009 and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans, which account for one-third of the cost of the stimulus. Virginia had a reported 11,446 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans. White House data shows the bulk of the Virginia jobs -- 7,203 full-time equivalent positions -- were in downtown Richmond where the state government relied on stimulus funds to balance budgets from 2009 to 2011. That number may paint an exaggerated picture, however, because the state parceled much of the stimulus money to localities to help support schools. Charles Pyle, a spokesman for the state’s department of education, said that as of January 2011, Virginia school divisions reported they had saved 5,692 jobs and created another 926 jobs using stimulus money. A March report by the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010. Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: *CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. *IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created. *Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created. *Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created. A side note: We also found it a stretch that the NRSC is giving Obama and Kaine equal ownership of the stimulus. Kaine was governor in 2009 and never voted on the bill nor participated in its drafting. Later, he did emerge as a key spokesman for stimulus as Obama’s hand-picked DNC chairman. Let’s review. The NRSC says the stimulus "failed to create jobs." The stimulus may not have created as many jobs as Republicans and Democrats hoped. But there’s no doubt it put many people back to work and preserved the jobs of many more. We rate the NRSC statement False.

pomt-05591	If Rhode Island raises the meal and beverage tax to 10 percent, it would be the "fourth-highest in the nation."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/01/john-elkhay/providence-restaurateur-john-elkhay-says-if-rhode-/	At a recent rally in Providence against a proposal to raise Rhode Island’s meal and beverage tax, restaurant owners and staff gathered with dozens of other protesters on the State House lawn and marched to Waterplace Park, where they "dumped" 30 pounds of tea into the Woonasquatucket River. This was no Boston Tea Party -- the tea was sealed in a plastic bag and attached to a rope so it was easily retrieved from the river -- but the protesters at the March 21 rally shouted their message for all to hear: Governor Chafee’s plan to hike the tax from 8 percent to 10 percent would discourage people from eating out and harm the state’s hospitality industry. Providence restaurateur John Elkhay, of the Chow Fun Food Group, was at the head of the march, leading the crowd in chants against the tax increase. At one point, he yelled out that a 10 percent meal and beverage tax in Rhode Island would be the "fourth-highest in the nation." The Ocean State has developed a reputation for high taxes. We’ve already written about the property tax burden in the state, specifically Providence’s dubious distinction of having the second-highest commercial property tax burden in the country. But we hadn’t heard claims about the state meal tax before. We left a message for Elkhay, whose restaurants include XO Cafe, Rick’s Roadhouse and Luxe Burger Bar. Then we did our own research. Meal taxes are also sometimes known as "restaurant taxes" or "prepared-food taxes" and are generally levied on top of sales taxes. Meal taxes do not refer to taxing groceries, or "non-prepared food." In fact, groceries are completely or partly exempt from sales taxes in nearly all states, including Rhode Island. The General Assembly created Rhode Island’s meal and beverage tax in 2003 as a way to tamp down local property tax increases. The 1-percent tax is imposed on top of the state’s 7-percent sales tax. Revenue from the 1-percent tax goes to cities and towns while revenue from the 7-percent tax goes to the state. Add the taxes together and diners pay an 8-percent tax when eating out in Rhode Island. Chafee’s plan is to raise the meal tax to 3 percent for a total tax of 10 percent. Most other states allow a similar tax but it’s more commonly levied by individual municipalities. For example, at the height of the recession in 2009 the state legislature in Massachusetts passed a bill allowing cities and towns to impose a 0.75 percent meal tax on top of the state’s 6.25 percent sales tax. By the following year, more than 70 communities had adopted the meal tax to supplement their budgets. Elsewhere in New England, New Hampshire and Vermont both have a statewide meal tax of 9 percent. Maine’s is 7 percent. Connecticut, where the sales tax is 6.35 percent, has no special meal tax. Because meal taxes are generally levied on the municipal level, the studies we found compared rates in cities rather than states. The most recent study was released earlier this month by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C. It examined the tax in the 50 most populous cities in the nation (35 of which don’t have a special meal tax, just a sales tax). At the top of the list was Minneapolis, which imposes a 3 percent meal tax on top of the city’s 7.775 sales tax for a total tax of 10.775 percent. Chicago was second with a 1.25 percent meal tax on top of a 9.5 percent sales tax for a total tax of 10.75 percent. And Virginia Beach was third with a whopping 5.5 percent meal tax on top of a 5 percent sales tax for a total tax of 10.5 percent. Washington, D.C., and Seattle were tied for fourth with a total tax on restaurant meals of 10 percent -- the same rate Rhode Island would have under Chafee’s proposal. We asked the Tax Foundation if it could break out the states that impose a meal tax statewide so we could make an apples-to-apples comparison with Rhode Island’s rate, but the foundation did not have that information. The Washington, D.C.-based National Restaurant Association gave us a different national study on meal taxes, this one done by researchers at the University of Denver in 2007. Although its ranking was similar to the one done by the Tax Foundation, parts of it were outdated. So for this item, we’ve chosen to rely on the Tax Foundation study. It’s important to note that Rhode Island’s high ranking for its meal tax is driven by the state’s high sales tax. At 7 percent, Rhode Island has the second-highest statewide sales tax in the country, behind only California. Slap on another 1 percent -- or 3 percent with Chafee’s latest proposal -- and you’re in double digits when it comes to meals. Other states do assess higher taxes for meals. In Virginia, localities are allowed a meal tax of up to 6.5 percent on top of a 5-percent sales tax. In Richmond, which isn’t large enough to have made the lists from the Tax Foundation or the University of Denver, the total tax is 11 percent. Eight other small municipalities in that state levy the full 11.5 percent tax. When a spokeswoman for Elkhay got back to us, she said that he got the information on meal taxes in other states from the same sources we found -- the recent Tax Foundation study and the older report from the University of Denver. Our ruling Restaurateur John Elkhay says Governor Chafee’s proposed 10-percent meal and beverage tax would be the "fourth-highest in the nation." Most meal taxes in other states are applied by cities and towns, so a comparison should take in those localized rates. And according to the most recent study from the Tax Foundation, a 10 percent rate in Rhode Island would be tied for fourth-highest in the nation. But shoehorning Rhode Island into the list is imperfect, because it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. And there’s another issue, too. The Tax Foundation list considered only the 50 most populous cities in the nation, so it didn’t take into account every meal tax imposed in every locality. In Virginia alone, we found nine smaller communities that would make it to the top of the Tax Foundation list. Elkhay’s statement is partially accurate -- increasing Rhode Island’s meal tax would make it one of the highest rates in the country. But we can’t say definitively that it would be fourth-highest. Because the claim "leaves out important details or takes things out of context," we rate it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13275	Says Pete Gallego "went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress."	false	/texas/statements/2016/oct/12/national-republican-congressional-committee/republican-group-says-fired-pete-gallego-turned-ar/	Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader, wants Pete Gallego of Alpine back in the U.S. House, according to a TV ad from a Republican group backing the incumbent in the seat representing the 23rd Congressional District sprawling south and west from San Antonio. And why, the ad’s narrator says? He says: "Because Gallego is the insider’s insider. Career politician. Went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress." Fair enough on the politician part; Gallego, a lawyer, was a Texas House member for more than 20 years before winning election to Congress in 2012. Two years later, though, he lost re-election to Republican Will Hurd of Helotes, who’s now trying to win his second term. The National Republican Congressional Committee ad shows Gallego smiling as he strolls what looks like a major Washington, D.C. avenue. Text simultaneously flashes: "Career politician," then "Gallego lobbied" with these words in smaller type at the bottom of the screen: "City of Austin, 2015." https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/505c2984-7393-475b-aac6-534c66d2f87d SOURCE: Screen grab, TV advertisement, "She’s a Fan," National Republican Congressional Committee, YouTube, Oct. 4, 2016 Gallego might be in legal trouble if he went to lobby right away on Washington’s infamous K Street where lobbying firms marshal forces. A 2007 law bars former House members from lobbying Congress for a year after leaving the body. Then again, news reports including a July 2016 Politico story suggest that despite the "cooling off" mandate, former senators and House members continue to enjoy lucrative careers trying to influence lawmakers. As of October 2016, too, the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that 49 percent of the former members of the 113th Congress, which was in session through 2014, had already gone to work for lobbying firms. Its list, though, didn’t link Gallego to any firm. And asked to share the basis of the lobbyist claim, NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter, who confirmed the ad video showed Gallego strolling in Washington, pointed out Gallego’s August 2015 federal personal financial disclosure indicating he was paid $55,000 that year to work for Austin’s city government. Hunter also emailed us 10 documents that appeared to come from Gallego’s city employee personnel file. City officials: Gallego didn't lobby We confirmed the authenticity of the city-connected documents by asking a city spokesman, David Green, for the public portions of Gallego’s employee personnel file. Those documents indicate Gallego was employed in "government relations" for 40 hours a week from March 2, 2015, through Aug. 21, 2015, at an hourly rate of $56.26. At our inquiry, Green also shared the financial calculations that bear out the city ultimately paying Gallego $55,359. For part of that time, through June 1, 2015, the Texas Legislature was in session. So, might it be that Gallego proved helpful to the city by lobbying legislators? To the contrary, Green and a former Gallego superviser each told us Gallego had been hired not to lobby legislators but to advise the city on legislative and legal matters. Gallego, Green said by email, "advised the government relations officer on policy and legislation and assisted in document preparation and strategy." Green told us John Hrncir, then the government relations officer, was one of Gallego’s supervisors. When we called Hrncir, who retired in May 2015, he said he’d recommended that the city consider adding Gallego to its government relations team after Hugh Brady left city government to work in President Barack Obama’s administration. According to Brady’s entry on LinkedIn.com, he was a special assistant city attorney and legislative counsel to the city until March 2014 when he became general counsel in the executive office of the president. In his city role, Brady’s entry says, he advised city officials and drafted "state and federal legislative instruments involving taxes, land use, water, government finance, regulatory authority, redistricting, collective bargaining, pensions and telecommunications." By email, Hrncir wrote that "in a typical legislative session the city is potentially impacted by 25% or more of the bills considered. The city usually has to pay attention to the 1,200 to 2,000 bills impacting it the most of the five to seven thousand filed. Deciding which legislative provisions to amend, pass, or defeat, and the time and effort to spend on each action, is a constant process, and decisions are revised, sometimes hourly, until the final gavel at sine die. "Pete Gallego is an experienced former (legislator) who had demonstrated exceptional ability at solving problems by finding solutions palatable to multiple factions of legislators--both parties; rural and urban reps; business and environmental advocates; etc. The constant triage for bills and amendments is critical to the city's success and I was confident that Gallego's advice to the team would be invaluable in maximizing the city's resources." Gallego responds In gauging this claim, we also queried Gallego’s campaign. By email, spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez said the implication that Gallego was a Washington lobbyist doesn’t hold up. Gallego, Rodriguez said, was a temporary in-house employee of the City of Austin for approximately a six-month period of time" and not among the city’s outside paid lobbyists, she wrote, noting that he also didn’t register as a lobbyist with the Texas Ethics Commission, which we confirmed from records listing outside lobbyists paid by the city to lobby in 2015. Gallego, Rodriguez wrote, "reported directly to the city attorney and provided the city attorney with opinions on legislative language and process. Pete also reviewed legislation, during and after session, to determine its impact on the city." Following up, we asked if Gallego in 2015 testified before a legislative committee or perhaps registered a position on behalf of the city; those are the kinds of duties often fulfilled by a lobbyist. "He did not," Rodriguez replied. We also reached Brian Yarbrough, among outside lobbyists paid by the city, who told us by phone he wasn't aware of Gallego directly lobbying for the city that year and didn't recall even seeing him in the Texas Capitol. Our ruling The pro-Hurd Republican group says Gallego "went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress." For half of 2015 including three months of the legislative session, Gallego worked in government relations for Austin’s city government. But the NRCC didn’t provide nor did we find evidence he was working as a lobbyist--either in Austin or Washington, which the ad arguably implies. We rate this claim False.
