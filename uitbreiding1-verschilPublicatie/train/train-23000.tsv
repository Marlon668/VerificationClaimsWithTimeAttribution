pomt-13084	"Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them ... I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/07/donald-trump/closing-argument-donald-trump-wrongly-says-he-outd/	It's been a long campaign season. At PolitiFact, we've fact-checked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton a combined 509 times since they announced their campaigns for president. If you add in the other presidential candidates -- from Lincoln Chafee to Ben Carson to Jill Stein -- the number shoots to 889. That's a lot of words, about a lot of policy and a lot of political attacks. So please allow this last fact-check of the 2016 campaign to be a little different. As Trump made his closing argument in Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 7, he decided to spend a few seconds telling voters that he's a bigger draw than Beyonce and Jay-Z. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them," Trump told the crowd. "And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds." It’s not true. For the sake of argument, let’s take Trump at his word on the size of his crowds. (We do this full-well knowing Trump is guilty of exaggerating the size of his crowds.) "We go to Oklahoma, we have 25,000 people," Trump said in August. "We had 21,000 people in Dallas, we had 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. We get these massive crowds. Look, if (Clinton) had 500 people I would be surprised." Here’s a photo from that Mobile rally: Anyway, if you take Trump as his word, that’s an average of 27,000 for those three big rallies. That’s a good draw. But it’s not Jay Z/Beyonce level. Jay Z last toured in 2014 with Beyonce to promote her self-titled album and his Magna Carta Holy Grail. The couple played 16 shows across North America, and one in Paris, raking in over $100 million in ticket sales. All were sold out and averaged a crowd size of 45,700 per night, according to data assembled by Billboard. The biggest one-night performance drew a crowd of nearly 53,000 while their two-night Paris show topped 147,000. Here’s a photo from their Seattle show, via Wikimedia Commons Beyonce, who wrapped up her $210 million Formation tour in October, performed 49 sold-out shows across North America and Europe. She drew an average crowd of 45,423 per night and a record one-night crowd of 75,106 in Paris this July. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Beyonce and Jay Z campaigned with Clinton Friday in Cleveland at an event that drew about 10,000 people, according to estimates. That's comparable to the size of many Trump crowds but certainly smaller than some of Trump's bigger crowds. To fully vet this bizarre claim, it’s worth noting that Trump’s rallies are free. Tickets to Beyonce in the swing state of Florida cost $40-$275 this year. Based on the latest Billboard numbers, Trump draws crowds similar to Phish. Our ruling Trump said, "Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them. And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds." There is no question Trump is fixated on the size of his crowds. And there is no question, this claim -- as it relates to Beyonce and Jay Z -- is incorrect. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7060d01f-ad3c-4c4d-b7d0-3caedef0775c	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-07T17:36:54	2016-11-07	['Jay-Z']
pomt-08050	Proposed federal regulations would affect every street sign in the country	true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/01/william-howell/speaker-bill-howell-says-proposed-federal-regulati/	The federal government wants to seize control of the street sign on your corner, warns William Howell, speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates. "The Federal Highway Administration has a proposed new regulation that would unify every street sign in the country," Howell, R-Stafford, said during a Dec. 21 speech to Tertium Quids, a conservative Virginia group advocating small government. "Every street sign -- Main Street, Elm Street -- would have to be the same size," Howell said. "The initial letter could be capital, but all the others would have to be in lower case. The city of Milwaukee said, `To comply will cost us $2 million to put in new street signs.’" In other words, all those signs that say "BROAD STREET" would have to be replaced with ones that say "Broad Street." Howell brought up the signs to promote his pet cause: Passage of a U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation approved by the U.S. Congress. Under the proposed amendment, which Howell will ask the Virginia General Assembly to endorse this winter, a federal act would be nullified if two-thirds of the states passed resolutions demanding so. "What business is it of the federal government what Milwaukee or Richmond...how they want to design their street signs?" Howell said. We wondered if the speaker had his facts right. Howell, who has been trying to build national support for the repeal amendment, said he learned about the regulations from acquaintances. We went to the Internet and found tons of information. The Federal Highway Administration, in an effort that began during George W. Bush’s presidency, proposed new rules for street sign lettering in 2009. They were included in an 864-page volume of proposed and existing regulations for road signs, markings and traffic lights called the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. In addition to retiring signs posted in all caps, the regulations in 2012 would increase the mandated size of sign letters -- from the current four inches to six inches -- on roads with speed limits over 25 miles an hour. In 2018, new standards would require signs to be more reflective to enhance their night visibility. The goal, according to the highway administration, is to improve traffic safety. Studies show it is harder to read all-cap signs, and those extra micro-seconds spent looking away from the road increase the odds of accidents, especially for older drivers. Controversy over the regulations began this fall. The New York Post reported it will cost the Big Apple $27.6 million to replace signs. ABC News aired a national report saying it will cost Milwaukee $2 million to change its signs -- the same figure cited by Howell. The Virginia Department of Transportation is studying the impact of proposed regulations and plans to issue a mid-year report. In late November, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood opened a new round of public comment on the proposals and distanced himself from them. "I believe that this regulation makes no sense," he said. "It does not properly take into account the high costs that local governments would have to bear. States, cities and towns should not be required to spend money that they don’t have to replace perfectly good street signs." Let’s review. Howell says proposed federal regulations would require all street signs to be the same size and use capital and lower-case letters. He’s right about the letters, which is the seed of a growing controversy. He’s a bit wrong about the size. The regulations would not require all street signs to be the same size, although they do offer guidelines. But that doesn’t detract from his main point, that Washington is considering regulations affecting every street sign. We find Howell’s statement True.

pomt-12298	Says Johnny Depp died after being apprehended for threatening President Donald Trump’s life.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/27/blog-posting/fake-news-saga-said-depp-threatened-trump-died-fed/	A series of fake news posts that said actor Johnny Depp first threatened President Donald Trump’s life and then died after being caught by federal authorities is yet another fake news saga created by a well-known liberal troll. A June 24, 2017, post on Snoopack.com that read "Johnny Depp Taken Into Custody By Secret Service" said that Depp had talked about assassinating Trump, leading to the actor being detained. The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. Users also flagged a follow-up post on June 24 at WashingtonFeed.com that said Depp was in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest during his interrogation. There’s more to the entire saga, according to a number of posts that first appeared on June 22-23 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The website said that Depp, who was taken into custody and held under the Patriot Act, later died from his heart malady, although not before recanting his faith in Islam on his deathbed. None of this is real. TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which created the stories, is run by Christopher Blair. Blair has told us before that he fabricates absurd news posts in an attempt to fool conservative readers with his fake news. His site’s About Us section noted that TheLastLineOfDefense.org "is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth" — but it isn’t. The website has a history of writing multiple posts about far-out events involving famous personalities. It’s published tales of U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy’s fictional son being found dead, Tucker Carlson being assassinated in a car crash, Sarah Palin being run off the road and Ted Nugent faking his own death. These contrived storylines, often barely keeping their own counterfeit details straight among the various posts, end up being passed around on other fake news websites, with no indication that they are made up. That is again the case with Depp, who was not detained by the feds and did not die during questioning. We rate this series of fake posts Pants On Fire!

pomt-04156	"One out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma. In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/23/paul-ryan/one-four-kids-and-half-big-cities-dont-graduate-hi/	On Dec. 4, 2012, a month after the presidential election, Republican stars Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio gave speeches at a Washington event that were described as charting a new path for the GOP. Ryan, coming off a defeat as Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate, spoke about the government’s response to poverty. He argued that "in most cases, we’re still trying to measure compassion by how much we spend, not by how many people we actually help." The Wisconsin congressman and House Budget Committee chairman then ticked off a number of poverty-related statistics, including these two, saying: "One out of every four students fails to earn a high-school diploma. In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate. Half." Do so many students fail to finish high school? Let’s check both parts of Ryan’s claim. 1 in 4 don’t graduate? We’ll note from the top there are different ways to measure graduation rates, depending on how you account for things such as students who take more than four years to earn a diploma and those who obtain equivalents such as a GED. The National Center for Education Statistics, the primary federal entity for education data, calculates something called the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR) for students in public high schools. It estimates the rate of public school students who started as freshmen and finished high school within four years -- in other words, those who graduated "on time." (We’ll also note that while the government tracks enrollment for private high school students, it doesn’t track graduation rates. About 15 million students attend public high schools and about 1.3 million attend private high schools; that means about 8 percent of all students are in private high schools.) Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert cited the most recent AFGR to support the first part of Ryan’s claim -- that "one out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma." The figures show that in the 2008-2009 school year, the AFGR was 75.5 percent. To express that another way, three out of four high school students graduated on time -- or, as Ryan put it, one in four did not. (Wisconsin, by the way, had the highest graduation rate: 90.7 percent.) Separately, we found that Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, a nonprofit research center and publisher of Education Week, found a nearly identical result using a different calculation. The graduation rate for the class of 2009, the most recent year available, was 73.4 percent. So, the first part of Ryan’s claim is on target -- as far as it goes. It doesn’t take into account public school students who take more than four years to get a diploma and it doesn’t take into account more than a million kids who attend private high schools. Half in major cities don’t graduate? For the second part of Ryan’s claim -- "in our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate" -- Seifert cited a report done by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center for America’s Promise Alliance. Colin Powell, the retired Army general and secretary of state, is the founding chairman of the alliance, which is dedicated to helping children and youth. Again, we’re dealing only with public school students. The April 2009 report, the most recent available, found that 53 percent of public high school students in the nation’s 50 largest cities, including Milwaukee, graduate on time. (The research center also did a separate calculation for the nation’s 50 largest school districts. Milwaukee Public Schools’ high school graduation rate for 2009 was listed at 52.6 percent, ranking 45th.) We also contacted some other national experts on high school graduation. Spokesmen for the Alliance for Excellent Education, which is a partner of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University; and the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents Milwaukee and 66 other large-city public school districts, said the two sources cited by Ryan are the best and most recent available for public school graduation rates. Our rating Ryan said: "One out of every four students fails to earn a high-school diploma. In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate." The claim suggests Ryan was speaking about all students, but his figures apply only to those who attend public school. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12236	In Ohio, due to Medicaid expansion, "nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists ... leaving them without the care they need for months or even years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/17/mike-pence/pence-falsely-ties-medicaid-expansion-disability-w/	Providing more Americans health insurance through Medicaid might sound good in the abstract, but Vice President Mike Pence told a story recently about how it can have unintended and dire consequences. Speaking at the National Governors Association meeting in Rhode Island, Pence said in the state of Ohio -- which expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act -- disabled Ohioans are unable to access care because able-bodied adults have been added to the Medicaid rolls. "Obamacare has put far too many able-bodied adults on the Medicaid rolls, leaving many disabled and vulnerable Americans at the back of the line," Pence said July 14. "Gov. (John) Kasich isn't with us, but I suspect that he's very troubled to know that in Ohio alone, nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists, leaving them without the care they need for months or even years." Is it true that Ohio’s expanded Medicaid system has sucked up state dollars that could have shortened the waiting list for the disabled in Ohio? Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said the vice president was saying that "we need to provide states the flexibility to create systems that best meet the needs of their people." Lotter pointed to a Wall Street Journal op-ed that said the more generous federal reimbursement for Medicaid expansion "diverts resources from the program’s traditional targets." "A temporary enrollment freeze might lead Ohio to prioritize resources for the truly needy," the piece said. What we found is that there are about 60,000 people on county waiting lists across Ohio. But Pence is wrong to create a connection between the programs to help them and Medicaid expansion. Home and community-based service waivers The waiting list Pence mentioned is part of a 30-year-old effort by Washington to give states more options to keep the long-term disabled out of institutions. It’s called home and community-based services, or HCBS. The money can pay for a variety of services, such as adult day care and assistance at home with eating and dressing. States set the number of people who can apply for waivers and Washington picks up between 50 and 70 percent of the cost. That’s less favorable than the 90 percent share that the federal government pays for Americans who receive Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act expansion. Health analyst MaryBeth Musumeci at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source of health care data, told us there’s no escaping these budget realities. "The expansion adults are a less costly population in that they are generally healthier and therefore use less services than someone on an HCBS waiver who by definition has chronic and long-term care needs," Musumeci said. But when Musumeci crunched the data, she found no simple trade-off between expansion and waiting lists. In fact, states that didn’t expand Medicaid were more likely to see their waiting lists grow compared to those that did expand. Point being, Musumeci said, is that there is no relationship between the waiting list and Medicaid expansion. Pence also spoke too broadly when he said people were left without the care they need, Musumeci said. Musumeci and her colleagues found that just because someone is on a waiting list, that doesn’t mean they aren’t getting any Medicaid services. According to federal data, 93 percent of people on waiting lists with intellectual and developmental disabilities receive Medicaid services that don’t depend on the waiver process. Further complications As it turns out, the waiting lists in and of themselves don’t always show how many people are going without care. When the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities commissioned a survey of people on the waiting list, it found that over 40 percent said they had "no current area of need." (The study was last updated in 2015.) Part of the problem Musumeci said is that the lists can include people from many years back. Their situations may have changed or some of them would never have qualified for waivers in the first place. The disability community differs with Pence Pence’s claim about Ohio also contradicts the work of advocates for the disabled. In an initial assessment, the National Council on Disability reported in 2016 that "both interview results and available literature suggest that Medicaid expansion has helped people with disabilities." The National Health Law Program, a group that advocates for the legal rights of the poor, agreed. It wrote that "expanded eligibility for Medicaid means that some of people on waiting lists who could not qualify for Medicaid under the traditional categories now access Medicaid services, which includes some community-based services." The group also said that "states expanding Medicaid have saved millions in spending on people with disabilities, savings that could be used to expand HCBS programs." Our ruling Pence said that Medicaid expansion in Ohio left 60,000 people waiting for the services they need. We found no link between the waiting list and Medicaid expansion. In fact, studies found that Medicaid expansion increased services for the disabled. They also found that in Ohio, over 40 percent of people on those lists said they had no immediate need for services. In short, the size of the list is not a sound measure of need. One analysis argued that Medicaid expansion frees up state dollars that could go toward reducing the ranks of people on the waiting list. And overall, there is no clear connection between expanding Medicaid and rising waiting list numbers. In fact, non-expansion states were more likely to see their waiting lists grow.

pomt-12851	"In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane. They overstayed a visa."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/feb/02/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-majority-florida-undocumented-imm/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio supports President Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall at the Mexican border but says it won’t address the main path that undocumented immigrants use to arrive in Florida. "In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane," Rubio, a Florida Republican, told reporters while visiting growers in Immokalee Jan. 27. "They overstayed a visa -- the wall isn't going to address that." Rubio, who along with Trump advocated for implementing a system to track visa overstays, is one of many politicians to raise concerns about immigrants overstaying their visas -- in 2015 he said that nationally 40 percent of illegal immigrants had overstayed a visa, a claim we rated Mostly True. But in Florida, is the rate really 70 percent? We found no comprehensive data from the federal government to back up Rubio’s point and his spokespersons didn’t respond. However, a former government official and longtime researcher about the undocumented population came up with an estimate for Florida that was close to Rubio’s number. Visa overstays Although there are legislative requirements to track nonimmigrants’ entry into and exit from the United States, the federal government has struggled to accurately count visa overstays. What we know about the number of immigrants who overstayed their visas nationally is largely based on either recent incomplete data from the federal government or data that is several years old or estimates. In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that out of 45 million U.S. arrivals by air and sea whose tourist or business visas expired in fiscal year 2015, about 416,500 people remained in the country in 2016. However, that data only covers a small slice of the undocumented population, capturing one year of data and omitting people who arrived via land. Also, the report did not provide a breakdown by state. In 2006, the Pew Research Center estimated that as much as "45 percent of the total unauthorized migrant population entered the country with visas that allowed them to visit or reside in the U.S. for a limited amount of time." That report relied on a 1997 study from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the United States legally. There have been other estimates of overstays (though they are also old): In January 2003, an INS report said that 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. A 2004 report from the General Accounting Office, based on 2000 data, estimated visa overstays ranged from 27 to 57 percent. Since the U.S. government has not provided an overstay rate for the entire unauthorized population in recent years, the only way to come up with a figure is an estimate. Robert Warren, a former INS demographer whose work was a part of that 1997 INS report, said that in recent years relatively more immigrants have overstayed their visas than have "entered without inspection." Source: Center for Migration Studies The percentage of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico dropped significantly during the past 15 years -- and that’s a key country for the group of immigrants who cross the border illegally without a visa. Warren, who is now a fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies, did some calculations for PolitiFact Florida. Warren used the Center for Migration Studies’ estimates of the undocumented population in 2014 based on data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Those estimates show about 10.9 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, including 710,000 in Florida. Then Warren examined the number of undocumented immigrants from 148 countries living in the United States and in Florida. He made some assumptions about what percent of undocumented immigrants from various countries overstayed their visa compared with those who sneaked across the border. For example, he estimated that 15 percent of undocumented Mexicans were visa overstayers while most arrived by crossing the border. Meanwhile, 75 percent of undocumented immigrants from the Dominican Republic were visa overstayers, he estimated. Using those assumptions, he concluded that in Florida an estimated 430,000 of 710,000 undocumented immigrants -- 61 percent -- were visa overstayers. It’s not a surprise that Florida’s undocumented immigrant population would include a higher percentage of visa overstayers than the national average. While most people crossing the border illegally come from a few countries including Mexico, undocumented immigrants who come from countries in South America, Asia or Europe are nearly all visa overstayers, he said. "What it comes down to is Florida has a higher mix of people who don’t come from Mexico or Central America than the country as a whole," he said. However, Warren said that the percentage of visa overstayers in Florida probably would be higher if you just looked at arrivals in the past 10 years. "To make estimates in this area of research you must make some assumptions based on the best information you have -- that is what I have done here," he said. We sent Warren’s estimate to other immigration experts, including Jeffrey Passel at the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan "fact tank" that doesn’t take policy positions, and Jessica Vaughan, who works for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. Both Passel and Vaughan said Warren’s estimates were reasonable, although Vaughan said his starting point numbers for the size of the undocumented population are too low. While Warren estimated the nationwide population at 10.9 million including 710,000 in Florida, Pew shows 11.1 million nationwide and 850,000 in Florida in 2014. "Warren’s calculations on the overstay rates are reasonable, although I sometimes disagree with some of his assumptions," Vaughan said. Our ruling Rubio said, "In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane. They overstayed a visa." Rubio’s spokespersons provided no evidence for his claim so we are uncertain of his source. The federal government does not appear to provide comprehensive data on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed their visa. However, a demographer who has studied the undocumented population for decades estimated that about 61 percent in Florida overstayed their visas.

pomt-11169	Says a young Texas rapper charged with capital crimes faces the death penalty but the alleged Santa Fe High School shooter faces prison and then parole after 40 years.	false	/texas/statements/2018/may/23/instagram-posts/false-meme-suggests-texas-rapper-faces-death-penal/	A U.S. Supreme Court ruling keeps the admitted shooter in a Santa Fe, Texas, school from facing the death penalty. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, would have had to be 18 to qualify. Still, a meme brought to our attention by readers suggests he's getting a special lift up. The meme shows an African-American 17-year-old Texas rapper, Taymore "Tay-K 47" McIntyre, and says that he faces the death penalty if convicted of capital charges pending against him. Meantime, the meme says, Pagourtzis--who admitted to the May 18, 2018, mass shooting at Santa Fe High School that killed 10 and wounded at least 10 others, according to court documents--faces no death penalty plus "parole in 40 years." Rapper T.I. recently shared the meme on his Instagram, saying, "So the question is how is the D.A. seeking the death penalty for Tay K & not the other guy?" T.I. went on to note that McIntyre is a minor, like Pagourtzis. They’re "the same age!!!!!!," T.I. wrote. According to a May 10, 2018, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story, McIntyre has been charged in two capital murders — one in Mansfield and one in San Antonio — as well as in an aggravated robbery that left an Arlington, Texas, man seriously injured. The story said he remained in jail. After the Santa Fe shootings, the Houston Chronicle, a Houston TV station and the Star-Telegram each declared that the disparity for capital crime convictions suggested by the meme lacks factual footing because of the 2005 Supreme Court ruling. To get our fix on the meme’s accuracy, we turned first to the court decision. Supreme Court acts On March 1, 2005, the court held by 5-4 that the Constitution’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment means the death penalty could no longer be imposed on juvenile offenders under 18. The Eighth Amendment provides: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." The ruling, in Roper vs. Simmons, stemmed in part, the majority wrote, from 30 states already prohibiting the juvenile death penalty. The ruling removed 72 people from death rows in a dozen states, according to a March 2005 news story in the New York Times, and "represented an about-face for a court that only 16 years ago rejected the argument that the execution of those who kill at the age of 16 or 17 violated" the constitutional bar on cruel and unusual punishments. By phone, Sarah Guidry, who directs the Earl Call Institute for Legal and Social Policy at Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law, said that after the high court acted, Texas lawmakers amended state law. Section 8.07(c) of the state’s penal code states: "No person may, in any case, be punished by death for an offense committed while the person was younger than 18 years." Before the Supreme Court ruled, Texas was among 12 states with juveniles on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that compiles information and statistics about the death penalty. From 1976 until the court acted, the center says, 22 defendants were executed for crimes committed as juveniles. By phone, the center’s Robert Dunham told us 13 of the death penalties were carried out in Texas. Dunham, calling the meme false, said the Roper ruling left no room for states to sentence to death any individuals younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. By phone, Texas state senators versed in criminal justice told us the court’s ruling in Roper means no juvenile can be sentenced to death. Sen. Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the ruling "changed the lay of the land when it came to the death penalty and juveniles." Parole in 40 years? Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, vice chair of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, said state law otherwise backs up the meme’s indication that Pagourtzis could be imprisoned yet paroled after 40 years. That's so, she said, thanks to legislative action in the wake of a June 2012 Supreme Court ruling. The majority opinion in Miller v. Alabama states: "By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment." In 2013, Texas lawmakers reacted to the ruling by passing into law a measure mandating that all juveniles convicted of capital offenses be sentenced to prison for 40 calendar years before qualifying for consideration for parole. Previously, juveniles 17 to 18 convicted of capital offenses faced life-without-parole sentences. We asked Dunham to speak to the parole part of the meme. He cautioned that Texas law solely permits juveniles sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after 40 years; the law doesn’t say anyone automatically gets paroled. Summing up, Dunham said: "If you are age 17, the most you can get for capital murder in Texas is life with the possibility of parole after 40 years." Our ruling A meme suggests a Texas rapper charged with capital offenses faces the death penalty while the alleged shooter in the Santa Fe school faces prison only and then parole after 40 years -- even though both are 17. That disparity isn’t backed up by state laws which, in compliance with Supreme Court rulings, potentially subject both the rapper and the alleged school shooter to sentences of life in prison with parole possible after 40 years. U.S. juveniles haven’t been subject to death sentences since the high court ruled out that prospect in 2005. We rate this meme False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-07311	President Barack Obama deserves to be called "the most successful food stamp president in American history" because "47 million Americans are on food stamps."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-defends-calling-barack-obama-food-st/	On the May 15, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich defended his earlier characterization of President Barack Obama as "the most successful food stamp president in American history." Host David Gregory first showed a clip of Gingrich’s earlier comment, made at a Georgia Republican Party dinner. "You want to be a country that creates food stamps, in which case frankly Obama's is an enormous success," Gingrich said in the recorded excerpt. "The most successful food stamp president in American history. Or do you want to be a country that creates paychecks?" Gregory then asked Gingrich if that comment included overtones of racism. Gingrich shot back, "Oh, come on, David!" Gregory responded, "What did you mean? What was the point?" Gingrich replied, "That's, that's bizarre. That -- this kind of automatic reference to racism, this is the president of the United States. The president of the United States has to be held accountable. Now, the idea that -- and what I said is factually true. Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps. One out of every six Americans is on food stamps." We're not going to address the racial implications but decided to check Gingrich's main comment. We see two points to investigate. First, are Gingrich’s numbers accurate? And second, is it fair to blame Obama for today's high use of food stamps? First, the numbers. We’ll start by noting that "food stamps" -- which provide qualifying, low-income Americans with vouchers to buy groceries -- have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008, although many people still use the informal name. For the most recent month with available data -- February 2011 -- roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits. That’s a bit less than Gingrich had said, but it’s in the ballpark. That also wasn’t a fluke: February marked the third consecutive month that the number of recipients topped 44 million. In fact, based on our look through the historical data, February’s numbers appear to be the highest number of beneficiaries in any month since the program was established in 1969. As recently as October 2007, about 27 million Americans received SNAP benefits. That’s more than a 60 percent increase in beneficiaries in three and a half years. The 44 million accounts for about 14 percent of Americans -- slightly less than one out of every seven, rather than one out of six, as Gingrich said. Now the second question: Is it fair to lay the blame on Obama? Obviously, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the serious recession that began in December 2007 -- more than a year before Obama took office. It’s hard to determine how much blame Obama deserves compared to his predecessor, President George W. Bush, but the experts we spoke to, conservative and liberal, agree that Obama inherited a serious economic situation. Part of the reason it’s tricky to divvy up blame is that there is typically a lag time before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The monthly growth has slowed over the last three months, and if current trends continue, it could start declining in a month or two. It’s also impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010. However, the fact remains that SNAP usage has continued to climb every single month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery. So Gingrich’s charge cannot simply be dismissed out of hand. One last point: The number of food stamp beneficiaries had started to head upward under Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits, and partly because of changes in the rules that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama. The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency -- most of which were years not considered recessionary. All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency. Where does this leave us? Gingrich was close on the numbers of Americans receiving SNAP benefits. In addition, the number of beneficiaries is at a record level, and it has risen every month of the Obama presidency. On the other hand, Gingrich oversimplifies when he suggests that Obama should be considered "the most successful food stamp president in American history," because much -- though probably not all -- of the reason for the increase was a combination of the economic problems Obama inherited and a longstanding upward trend from policy changes. On balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Half True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-05-16T17:07:19	2011-05-15	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-06301	"One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/17/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-one-third-ohios-college-grads/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been giving a lot of speeches lately to a variety of groups but the message is typically the same: that, in his opinion, the state was on life-support when he took office in January and is slowly recovering thanks to his initiatives. To drive his point that Ohioans have become increasingly disenchanted with the Buckeye state, the Republican leader suggests that many college graduates are giving up hope of ever making a career here and instead are choosing to leave to pursue life elsewhere. "One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years," Kasich said at a highway engineers conference in Columbus on Oct. 25. "We lose our best and brightest." Losing 1 in every 3 Ohio college graduates would be a classic example of what academia has come to refer as the "brain drain." PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know whether the governor accurately captured the girth of the problem. To start, the statement seems to overlook the fact that not all college graduates are Ohioans to begin with. The Ohio State University, for example, is one of the largest universities in the country with more than 56,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. About 22 percent of them are not Ohio natives. It stands to reason that some would return to their home state or be recruited for work outside of Ohio. That point aside, we decided to look at Kasich’s point of reference. His information comes from the Ohio Board of Regents, which in 2008, under a previous administration, said that just 66 percent of Ohio public college grads were still in the state three years after graduation. Then-Chancellor Eric Fingerhut aimed to raise that figure to 70 percent by 2017. The Regents said that figure still holds today. Regents spokeswoman Kim Norris said 66 percent of Ohio’s Spring 2008 public college graduates were employed in Ohio during the fourth quarter of 2010. To put it in numerical terms, Ohio had 39,736 graduates — associate, Bachelor’s, graduate and professional degrees and certificates combined — in Spring 2008 and 26,082 of them were working in Ohio late last year. Norris said the Regents came up with the figure by cross-matching college graduates with employment data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services. But there is a catch. The Regents figures only count people who are employed. It assumes the other 33-percent left the state. That would support the governor’s statement, but isn’t it possible that many of those 14,000 people earning degrees in 2008 are still in Ohio and unemployed? Norris conceded that also could be the case. Ohio’s unemployment rate in September was 9.1 percent, matching the national rate. There were more than 530,000 Ohioans out of work and actively looking for a job, according to data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services. The Board of Regents did not have a figure of 2008 college grads who were still in Ohio three years later that includes those that might be unemployed. PolitiFact Ohio thinks it is safe to say that there are not just two options at play here for those college graduates: that either they found a job here or that they left Ohio. Unfortunately, given the state and nation’s economy, some are likely unemployed and looking to put their college degrees to work. If the 9.1 percent unemployment rate is applied to the 14,000 people who earned degrees but are not employed in Ohio, it accounts for 1,274 people. That would amount to slightly more than 3 percent of the people who got degrees in 2008. The governor is making a salient point, that as the economy limps along, bright, young minds might be encouraged to look for their opportunities elsewhere and that should worry anyone concerned for Ohio’s future. The Board of Regents figure does not account for the possibility some of those grads didn’t leave, but are unemployed. That’s information that provides clarification. And even if the unemployment rate is taken into consideration, the figure the governor used is still in the ballpark. And the message behind his statement, that Ohio is losing some of its youngest talent, is a accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10846	"During his tenure in Washington and in the Illinois State Senate, Barack Obama has accumulated a record of bipartisan success."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/09/barack-obama/his-record-on-bipartisanship-is-split/	Obama wants voters to believe that he's a bipartisan legislator in Washington. And while it's true that he has co-sponsored bills with GOP members, and Republicans may count him among their friends, Obama certainly is a loyal Democrat when it comes to voting on legislation. He attempted to work on campaign finance reform with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., but McCain, ended up accusing Obama of using the issue for his own political gain. He's had more success on energy and political reform issues, working with Republican Sens. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. Senate-watchers say Obama hasn't been around Washington long enough to gain much of a reputation as a legislator. Three years just isn't enough time to judge a Senate career, said Lewis Gould, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Texas and author of "The Most Exclusive Club: A History of the Modern United States Senate." Gould declined to discuss Obama directly, but said, "It's easy enough to cosponsor things. It's very hard to judge effectiveness." But if it is difficult to evaluate Obama's work as a senator, it is possible to examine his voting record. An analysis conducted by Congressional Quarterly and released last week showed that, for the votes so far in 2007, Obama voted with his party's position 96 percent of the time. For someone who may be trying to paint himself as bipartisan, that's pretty partisan.

pomt-02982	Common Core means "there are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/21/tim-curtis/anti-common-core-government-collecting-data-studen/	Tapping into concerns about privacy, some opponents of Common Core have portrayed the new educational standards as a tool by the government to spy on children and store data on them. And they aren’t talking about a few test scores here -- but a big ol’ heap of data on every student. "There are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you," said Tim Curtis, an activist with the tea party group 9/12, at a meeting in Tampa about Common Core on Oct. 15. That sounds like a massive amount of data for the government to collect on every child and their families. We decided to engage in a little data mining of our own: what type and amount of information will the government collect on students and their families, and is because of Common Core? Data collection with or without Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Obama administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Florida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks -- though local school districts can still choose to do so. Curtis told us that when he said the "government" will collect data he meant the school district as well as the state and federal education departments. "In order for Common Core to work its supposed magic, all of this information is going to have to be consolidated at the federal level," Curtis told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. "Only then will they be able to compare state-to-state across the board." Many Common Core opponents, including in Florida, point to the National Education Data Model to argue that Common Core will lead the government to collect hundreds of data elements on students. But that data model is just that -- a voluntary model that states can use for guidance about how to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said. Buckley said he never counted the data elements in the National Education Data Model but that 400 is probably accurate. Since 2011, the focus has been on a different model called Common Education Data Standards which has over 1,000 elements, Buckley said. (Florida does not even use the National Education Data Model and has its own version called PK20 data warehouse.) "For whatever reason a lot of Common Core opponents seized upon this as if it has anything to do with Common Core, which it doesn’t," he said. We contacted a few school districts in Florida, including Broward and Hillsborough counties, to ask about their plans for data collection. Officials told us no additional data would be collected because of Common Core. We also found multiple education experts who disagreed with Curtis’ claim, including from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Foundation. The bottom line: States have been collecting data on students -- and sharing it in aggregate with the U.S. Education Department -- long before Common Core. And that doesn’t change because of Common Core. School districts collect students’ names, the classes in which they are enrolled, their reading and math proficiency and whether they graduated on time, said Paige Kowalski, director of state policy and advocacy for the Data Quality Campaign, a national advocacy organization. States collect the data to help them make decisions -- for example about tests. The U.S. Education Department can only access aggregate data -- for example, what percentage of third-graders in Florida are proficient in reading -- not the test scores of a particular third-grader. That means school districts don’t send student names and other personal details to the federal government. In fact, laws predating Common Core prohibit a federal database of personally identifiable information on students. "Absolutely nothing has changed in terms of what the state is collecting from districts as a result of adopting Common Core standards and implementing them," Kowalski said. Here’s what is different under Common Core: If Florida and another state both adopt the same standards and assessments, then the tests will provide an apples-to-apples comparison between two states. For decades, Florida has required school districts to implement a system that contains student information. And today that list of data is long -- some of it is required by the state, while other elements are optional, or only kept at the local level such as bus stop number. That list of data includes students’ race, whether they are homeless, test scores, attendance and many more factors. However, "There is no increased data collection specifically linked to Common Core," said Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters, a point repeated in the state’s fact sheet. "Florida has no plans to change the data it collects that is linked to Common Core." Iris scans and Common Core We told Curtis that educational experts said that Common Core doesn’t require new data collection. "I can shoot that claim down with a single explanation," Curtis said. "The Polk County school district began to do iris screening on school children and they did so without notifying their parents. They did so as a result of the beginning of the implementation of Common Core." According to the Florida Department of Education, the screening was intended to route children onto the proper bus. It didn’t have anything to do with Common Core. "Polk County was piloting a new school bus safety program for students that involved eye scanning, which had nothing to do with the new standards. Permission slips were mistakenly not sent out," the department said. Our ruling Tim Curtis, an activist against Common Core, said that thanks to Common Core, "There are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you." Common Core State Standards do not include new requirements for the government to collect data on school children. It’s true that school districts and the state of Florida already collect a long list of data on students. That data is aggregated for the federal government, after stripping out students’ personal information, and that data collection doesn’t change whether states adopt Common Core or not. Common Core opponents are mixing two separate issues here: the transition to Common Core and data collection that already occurs. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05758	Says when she "helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted No."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/01/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-claims-dennis-kucinich-voted-no-veter/	A 30-second TV ad for Marcy Kaptur aimed a three-point attack at Dennis Kucinich, the fellow incumbent she faces in the Democratic primary for Ohio's new 9th congressional district. Kucinich opened their recent City Club debate objecting that the ad misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors. PolitiFact Ohio previously looked at the ad’s claim that "when Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no." We rated that Half True. For this analysis, we'll look at the claim: "When Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no." The ad cites as its source the roll call vote of Dec. 10, 2009, on HR 3288, the omnibus appropriations package called the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The $447 billion measure, one of eight for fiscal 2010, included spending bills for numerous departments and agencies including the departments of State, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education. It also included funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congress faced a deadline of Dec. 18 to get the package signed into law to avoid a government shutdown. The House passed it 221 to 202. It had no support from House Republicans. Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no. Kucinich's campaign told us the congressman explained his opposition to the measure at the time of the vote. He acknowledged support for many of its provisions -- including increased veterans' benefits -- but took exception to other major provisions: "billions of dollars in military aid, sanctions and funds for policies in the Middle East that undermine the administration's call for a commitment to diplomacy; $239 million in foreign military financing for Pakistan; destabilizing investment and trade sanctions; and restrictions on aid to Gaza and the West Bank." Objecting that the Kaptur ad tried to portray Kucinich as "anti-veteran," his campaign cited efforts to fund research to help find causes and treatments for veterans suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Kaptur campaign spokesman Steve Fought acknowledged that the omnibus spending bill had "money in there for the military. But you can't really pick and choose. It was to keep the government funded, and he decided to vote no. "He wants to have it both ways. He's letting others carry the ball and do the heavy lifting. He keeps talking about Gulf War Syndrome, but he voted against his own provision. He was for the research before he was against it," Fought said. Fought was referring to a provision in HR 2055 that was approved in the House last year. Kucinich co-sponsored an effort to obtain money specifically for Gulf War illness research. A news release his office issued Dec. 16, 2011, said he and Rep. Michael Michaud, a Maine Democrat, had won $10 million for the Gulf War Veterans' Illness Research Program. The statement says: "The funding was included in HR 2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Kucinich won the adoption of an amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act in July to increase the amount of money for GWVIRP by over 25 percent over last year's level." But Kucinich voted against HR 2055 when the full measure came up for a vote of the House -- much as he had done with the omnibus measure for 2010. Kaptur voted yes. The campaign ad claimed that "when Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no." Kucinich did vote against a bill that contained money for veterans. We have noted before that legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation. And Kucinich's votes on military spending, reflecting his opposition, have been consistent. Kucinich takes credit for championing a program that he ultimately voted against. His work for the program gives a different impression than his vote. His positions help explain his votes, both on HR 2055 last December and on HR 3288, the prior spending measure cited in the ad. Those are important pieces of information needed to evaluate the claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates Half True.	None	Marcy Kaptur	None	None	None	2012-03-01T06:00:00	2012-02-15	['None']
pomt-08230	A recent report from the president's deficit commission was "completely empty" on controlling health care costs.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/16/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-obamas-deficit-co-chairs-had-no-/	The co-chairs of President Barack Obama's deficit commission released their ideas for getting control of the federal deficit last week. Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is not a fan. "I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all," Krugman said on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "But it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while patting my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?" The key to reducing the deficit, Krugman said, is reducing the future growth of health care costs. "The way you have to do that is by deciding what you're going to be willing to pay for," Krugman said. "They completely wimped out on that. They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary. So the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on earth is that doing in there?" Here, we'll fact-check Krugman's statement that the report was "completely empty" on reining in the future growth of health care costs. We'll check his statement about large tax cuts for the top bracket in a separate report. First, a bit of (recent) history on the commission: President Barack Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in February, 2010, asking it to identify "policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run." Obama asked the commission to propose ideas designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. He appointed six members, including bipartisan co-chairs, and asked congressional leaders from both parties -- Democrats Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and Republicans Mitch McConnell and John Boehner -- to appoint three each, for a total of 18 members. The proposal released Nov. 10 was not the final report, which requires approval from 14 of 18 members and has a deadline of Dec. 1. Rather, the proposal summarized the ideas of the two co-chairs: Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. We're not sure why the two took the step of releasing their proposals ahead of the deadline; some news reports speculate it was an attempt to prod other members to keep negotiating before the December deadline. If the members are not able to come to an agreement, it's possible that no report will be issued. We previously reviewed the co-chairs' proposal for our factsheet on reducing the deficit, but now we wanted to look in detail at what it said about health spending. Krugman is right that the report released last week reads like "a bunch of ideas." It reminded us more of a PowerPoint presentation than a policy brief. But it does address Medicare spending and other improvements to the health care system on pages 31 to 36. (The full report is 50 pages; view it here.) Some of its suggestions for Medicare are vague, such as its solution for addressing future shortfalls for payments to doctors and hospitals. Right now, Congress funds payments every year in a move that's come to be known as the "doc fix." The co-chairs' proposal suggests paying for that "by asking doctors and other health providers, lawyers, and individuals to take responsibility for slowing health care cost growth." It then suggests, "Pay doctors and other providers less, improve efficiency, and reward quality by speeding up payment reforms and increasing drug rebates," as well as, "Pay lawyers less and reduce the cost of defensive medicine by adopting comprehensive tort reform." The report also suggests the government "expand cost-sharing in Medicare to promote informed consumer health choices and spending." That means asking seniors to pay more for their health care benefits. But the proposal also includes budget estimates for various health care-related cost savings in 2015 and for the years 2012 through 2020, on pages 33 and 35. More specifically, the report recommends strengthening the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, a new board created under the 2010 health care law. The board is intended to make evidence-based recommendations on reducing costs and improving the quality of care in Medicare. In practice, the board will likely issue rules on which procedures it will pay for and which it won't, and these rules will apply across the board. (The board will not get involved in decisions on individual patients based on their worth to society -- the old "death panels" lie.) The board's recommendations will take effect unless Congress overrules them. The co-chairs' proposal suggested several ways that the board could be strengthened, such as applying its recommendations to all health care providers without some of the exceptions allowed under the health care law. It suggested that the board make recommendations on benefit design and cost-sharing, which the health care law does not allow. Finally, the co-chairs suggested that the board's proposals apply not only to Medicare but also to private health insurance plans sold in government-sponsored exchanges. On This Week, Ruth Marcus, a Washington Post columnist, challenged Krugman's claim and specifically mentioned the IPAB. "They did talk about strengthening that commission, the famous IPAB, and giving it more power to go after more aspects of the health care system, because it's now rather constrained," Marcus said. "They made no headlines with that," Krugman responded. "And some friends of mine are calling this the commission to put caps on lots of stuff. It's a lot of numerical caps without any explanation of how they're going to happen." We e-mailed Krugman after the show to ask him about his comments. He said his reading of the report, particularly page 31, struck him as "a model of vagueness." But, he added, "I was somewhat unfair in not giving credit for the endorsement of the IPAB." In ruling on Krugman's statement, he said the deficit proposal was "completely empty" on reining in the future growth of health care costs. Krugman has a point that the co-chairs' proposal is vague. But the proposal does have several specific ideas on how to strengthen the IPAB. It has other recommendations on health care spending as well, and it includes dollar estimates for how much its ideas would reduce spending. It does recognize that health care spending must be controlled, and it's not completely empty of ideas. We rate Krugman's statement False.

pomt-13602	The Obama administration has been "raising taxes."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/16/mike-pence/mike-pence-half-right-obama-has-been-raising-taxes/	Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, says Americans are paying higher taxes under President Barack Obama. "We’ve suffered through an administration that’s been raising taxes, raising regulations, growing government, borrowing and spending, and trying to bail our way back to a growing economy," Pence, the Indiana governor, said during an Aug. 4 rally in Norfolk. That’s a long list of charges, and we want to look at the first one - that the White House has been "raising taxes." Marc Lotter, Pence’s campaign spokesman, backed the governor’s statement by sending us a list of tax hikes enacted under Obama. The list, compiled by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, contains a levy that Obama imposed on tobacco products as well as a series of taxes that were raised to fund the president’s health care reforms. We also contacted Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. He told us that for the most part, there haven’t been many major tax changes during Obama’s term. That said, he pointed out two changes to tax laws under Obama. The first, as we’ve mentioned, were levies to pay for health care reforms in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Among them is the individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance; a 10 percent tax on tanning services; and a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income for high earners. Williams also cited the 2012 American Taxpayer Relief Act, which extended most of a series of income tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. The Bush-era tax cuts had been set to expire in 2012. Obama signed a law that extended the cuts for all taxpayers except individuals making $400,000 a year or more and married filers earning $450,000 or more. Williams said only about 1 percent of taxpayers fit into those high-income categories. "It was a really small share of people that got hit with higher taxes," he told us. "It was really a tax cut for everybody else. … If Congress had done nothing, everybody’s taxes would have gone up." Has the average federal tax burden on households increased under Obama? For that answer, we turned to a report issued in June by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It computed an average rate by factoring in individual and corporate taxes as well as payroll levies and excise taxes. The CBO figures are available only through 2013, but you still can get an idea of the trajectory of tax rates through most of Obama’s tenure. They show that in 2009, when Obama took office, the average household federal tax rate was 17.3 percent and in 2013, the rate was 20.1 percent - a nearly 3 percentage point increase. But Williams noted that 2009 is a low point to begin the comparison, in part because Obama enacted a federal tax cut that year as part of a stimulus package to combat the Great Recession. The average tax burden was 18.1 percent in 2008, the last year of the Bush administration. But that’s also a questionable year to start a comparison, Williams said, because the rate was lowered artificially by temporary tax cuts Bush approved to jump-start the economy. So we went back to 2007, when the average federal tax rate was 19.9 percent, or just under where it was in 2013. If you go back to 2006, the overall tax rate was 20.4, or slightly above where it was in 2013. The CBO figures show that in 2013, the average rate paid by people in the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers was lower than it was for those in the same income level in 2006 or 2007. The average rate for those in the top 20 percent, however, rose during that time. The Tax Policy Center last month released its own tallies of the average federal tax rate. The center calculates its figures differently than the CBO. For example, the center counts estate taxes in its tax rate figures, while the budget office doesn’t. The CBO includes the value of Medicare and Medicaid benefits in its income computations, while the Tax Policy Center doesn’t. One drawback to the Tax Policy Center’s figures is that they go back only to 2011. That year, the average federal tax rate came to 16.8 percent. By 2016, the average federal tax rate was 19.8 percent. That’s a 3 percentage point jump, but there’s a couple of things to keep in mind: Some of the temporary tax measures meant to stimulate the economy expired during that time. Chief among them is a temporary drop in the payroll tax from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent, an Obama-era measure that ended in 2012. Beyond policy decisions, changes in the economy also affect the average tax rate. The average tax rate has gone up as incomes have risen in the past five years and people have moved into higher tax brackets, Williams said. Our ruling Pence said that the Obama administration has been "raising taxes." Obama certainly raised some levies, including income taxes on people earning more than $400,000 a year. Although most folks don’t fall into that category, Obama’s health care reforms come with a series of new taxes that do affect lower earners. But Pence’s statement leaves a lot out of the story. Obama also has extended permanently tax cuts that were set to expire. He also enacted a series of temporary tax cuts aimed at jump-starting the economy. Figures from the CBO and the Tax Policy Center show that average tax rates have risen under Obama, but part of the reason is that Obama also allowed some special tax cuts enacted during the recession to expire. If you go back to CBO figures before the recession and compare them with figures after it ended, the average household tax rate was about the same in 2006 as it was in 2013. So on balance, we rate Pence’s claim Half True.	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-08-16T12:22:06	2016-08-04	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-02295	David Alameel "is giving thousands of dollars to support the Republican Party candidates" including John Cornyn and Greg Abbott.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/03/kesha-rogers/david-alameel-has-been-5-million-bipartisan-donor-/	Kesha Rogers of Houston described her foe in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the state's Democratic U.S. Senate nomination as a current donor to Republicans including that party’s nominee, second-term Sen. John Cornyn. Rogers, a LaRouche Democrat making her first bid for statewide office, made her comment about Dallas investor David Alameel in our March 27 interview with her during our check of a claim that she’s not a Democrat. Rogers is a Democrat, we concluded, though she espouses views out of step with mainstream Democrats such as a desire to impeach President Barack Obama. In that interview, we asked if Rogers had more to share on her Democratic bonafides. "We should look at the fact that my opponent… Mr. Alameel... is giving thousands of dollars to support the... Republican Party candidates such as... John Cornyn and John Abbott himself," Rogers replied, shortly agreeing that she meant Greg Abbott, the state attorney general and 2014 Republican gubernatorial nominee. Alameel’s donations to numerous candidates over the years have been noted. But has he backed Republicans of late? News coverage In a news story posted online Dec. 2, 2013, the Dallas Morning News said Alameel and his wife donated $8,000 to Cornyn’s campaign and $7,500 to Cornyn’s political action committee in 2004 and 2005. The story also said Alameel gave Abbott $165,000 from 2002 to 2008 while Alameel gave $30,000 in 2012 to state Sen. Wendy Davis, the Fort Worth Democrat then on her way to becoming the Democrats’ 2014 choice for governor. Broadly, the story said, Alameel had pitched in for candidates from both major parties. "He’s given $700,000 in the last six years to Democrats at the federal level," the newspaper said, while donating $250,000 to Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst from 2002 to 2008 and earlier giving $75,000 to Rick Perry’s campaign in 1998, when Perry, now governor, was bidding for lieutenant governor. "I’m not your typical Democrat," Alameel was quoted as saying. "I’m conservative in many ways and have worked with both parties." About a month later, the weekly Austin Chronicle said in a news story that another Democratic Senate candidate, Maxey Scherr of El Paso, had described Alameel as a DINO--Democrat In Name Only. According to the Chronicle, Scherr singled out past Alameel donations to Dewhurst as well as $4,200 given to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and $8,400 donated to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. The story further noted the donations to Cornyn and said Alameel gave $50,000 in 2005-06 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Then again, the story said, Alameel stopped giving to Republicans after the 2008 elections. "Since then, Alameel's donations have been strictly Demo­cratic and progressive," the story said. "His campaign notes that he is the nation's 15th biggest Democratic donor. That includes $100,000 to the progressive Lone Star Pro­ject PAC, and almost $2 million to his North Texas Leader­ship PAC." Federal Election Commission breakdown We asked the Federal Election Commission to itemize Alameel’s donations to candidates and political committees. By email, spokesman Christian Hilland sent charts showing Alameel and his wife ponied up about $1 million to nearly 60 recipients from 1989 into May 2013, counting his largest contribution of $500,000, in 2012, to Majority PAC, a super PAC created by a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with a focus on protecting the Democrats’ Senate majority. That year, Alameel sought a Dallas-Fort Worth U.S. House seat, losing the Democratic primary to a Fort Worth state representative, Marc Veasey. Cornyn fielded $8,000 from Alameel in November 2004, according to the chart. In a Jan. 30, 2014, news blog post, the Morning News noted that Alameel had recently said he wanted that money back with Cornyn shooting back that a refund wasn’t going to happen. Outside of the six-figure donation to Majority PAC, Alameel’s federal donations went more to Republicans than Democrats: He and his wife donated nearly $270,000 to about 17 Republican candidates or committees and about $180,000 to about 15 Democratic beneficiaries. See the main chart provided by Hilland here and one covering other Alameel donations here. Alameel’s latest donation to a Republican seeking federal office amounted to $28,500 supportive of Sen. John McCain, dated April 23, 2008, according to the FEC information, while after that, Alameel donated nearly $660,000 to Democratic candidates and committees. Texas Ethics Commission records To get a fix on how much Alameel has given to candidates for state office, we searched state campaign finance reports stockpiled on the Texas Ethics Commission website. From February 2000 into January 2014, this search indicated, Alameel donated about $4 million to such candidates and committees including Democrats, Republicans and Carole Keeton, then Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who declared herself an Independent before running for governor in 2006. Alameel’s biggest state beneficiary was his since-disbanded PAC, which drew in some $2.8 million, according to the search. Per Rogers’ claim: Alameel made five donations to Abbott, adding up to $165,000, from December 2002 through June 2007, the search shows, though Alameel earlier in 2002 gave $30,000 to Democrat Kirk Watson when Watson faced Abbott for attorney general. Alameel’s latest donation to a Republican aspirant for state office was $10,000, given March 3, 2008, to Texans for Cole, the committee for Jonathan Cole, a Collin County candidate, our search showed. More recently, Alameel and Alameel Family Partners, Ltd., gave $307,500 from January 2013 through January 2014 to Democratic interests. This included $250,000 that went to the state kitty of the Lone Star Project, a pro-Democratic group managed by Matt Angle out of the Washington, D.C. area, and $50,000 given to the Democratic caucus in the Texas House, according to the search. A Rogers’ campaign adviser, Harley Schlanger, said by email that Rogers obviously meant Alameel had donated funds to Republicans in the past. "If she said in her discussion with you he ‘is giving,’ she misspoke," Schlanger said. He said earlier: "Her point is that the people attacking her for her opposition to Obama are embracing a candidate who has a clear and defined past relationship with the Republican Party." We were unable to reach Alameel or anyone with Alameel’s campaign. Our ruling Rogers said Alameel "is giving thousands of dollars to support the Republican Party candidates" such as Cornyn and Abbott. Alameel donated some $5 million to political committees including individual Republicans and Democratic candidates from 1989 on, and his donations included aid to campaigns for Cornyn and Abbott. However, records do not show any donations to Republicans after 2008. Whether Rogers misspoke or not, what she said is incorrect, though we see an element of truth due to Alameel’s historically bipartisan giving, making this interview claim Mostly False.

pomt-04999	Says it's not "accidental" that the villain in the Batman movie is named Bane.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/18/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-claims-link-between-batmans-bane-and/	What’s behind the mask of the snarling, hulking, steroid-crazed villain who wants to take down Batman and rule Gotham City? A plot to swing the presidential election! This week on his popular radio show, conservative host Rush Limbaugh casually tossed out the theory that it’s no accident that the evil genius in The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, bears the same name as the much-maligned private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Bane is the very, very bad guy out to kill Batman. Bain Capital is Romney’s former company, which has been the target of accusations that it outsourced jobs, closed factories and reaped huge profits for itself. "Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire-breathing, four-eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane?" Limbaugh suggested to his listeners. You can see our serious fact checks about Bain Capital here. For now, we thought we’d take a pop-culture diversion from politics to the comic book underworld to see if Limbaugh has really uncovered an evil plot. What he said From the transcript of Limbaugh’s July 17, 2012, show: "This evil villain in the new Batman movie is named Bane. And there's now a discussion out there as to whether or not this is purposeful and whether or not it will influence voters. It's gonna have a lot of people. This movie, the audience is gonna be huge. A lot of people are gonna see the movie, and it's a lot of brain-dead people, entertainment, the pop culture crowd, and they're gonna hear Bane in the movie and they're gonna associate Bain. The thought is that when they start paying attention to the campaign later in the year, and Obama and the Democrats keep talking about Bain, Romney and Bain, that these people will think back to the Batman movie, ‘Oh, yeah, I know who that is.’ There are some people who think it'll work. Others think you're really underestimating the American people to think that will work." He wrapped up: "You may think it's ridiculous, I'm just telling you this is the kind of stuff the Obama team is lining up. The kind of people who would draw this comparison are the kind of people that they are campaigning to. These are the kind of people that they are attempting to appeal to." A short history of Bane So listen up, brain-dead people. To learn more about this villain, we consulted scholarly sources such as The Essential Batman Encyclopedia, and io9, a site that covers science, science fiction and the future. Bane, the encyclopedia tells us, was born in the fictional South American country of Santa Prisca and grew up in prison, forced to serve a sentence for the crimes of his father. He grows into a violent genius, who commits murder at age 8 and acquires superhuman strength after surviving experiments with a drug called Venom, which left him impossibly virile but forever reliant on the drug. The tentacled mask he wears connects to pumps that deliver regular doses. He eventually breaks out of prison, bound for Gotham City, where he plans to overpower Batman and assume power. A compelling personal history, to be sure. But the bottom line is this: Bane entered the Batman storyline in 1993. That’s more than a decade before Romney first ran for president in 2007. Think Bane creator Chuck Dixon had that much foresight? He doesn’t. "Ridiculous," is what Dixon called suggestions of a connection between his character and Romney’s company. Dixon responded on his message board to the notion, first raised by a Democrat, that the two story lines are linked. "I saw it on FB like two hours ago," Dixon wrote. "Ridiculous. Tho' I got a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach that Rush may pick up on this. And (that) would be the second time he pegged me and (co-creator) Graham (Nolan) as liberals on his show." Limbaugh hadn’t yet weighed in, but Dixon showed his crafty knack for foreshadowing. He’s no liberal -- he identifies as a conservative. Not that he minds the publicity. "Overgrasping Dems? Hey, if it gets Obama supporters into theaters. Maybe they'll buy thousands of Bane toys to throw at Romney. It all adds to MY Bane capital. I wonder if the Romney campaign will contact me?" Dixon wrote. We’ve also read several commentaries that find a more obvious parallel between the wealthy Romney and the Bruce Wayne character, a proverbial 1-percenter. In one trailer, Catwoman echoes the Occupy Wall Street movement, telling Wayne, "There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us." Dixon too saw more parallels between Batman and Romney, telling a call-in radio show, "Bane is a force for evil and the destruction of the status quo. He's far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street-type if you're looking to cast him politically. And if there ever was a Bruce Wayne running for the White House it would have to be Romney." Our ruling Limbaugh suggested it’s no accident that in a movie coming out four months before the presidential election, the villain bears the same name as the company formerly run by Romney and now being attacked by Democrats. In politics, conspiracies are everywhere if you look hard enough. But Limbaugh’s superpowers of persuasion can’t make this theory stand up. The villainous Bane first appeared in Batman comic books in 1993, long before Romney entered presidential politics. Even the character’s creator called a suggested link "ridiculous."

pomt-09467	Says she’s "tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts."	false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/03/mindy-montford/judicial-candidate-mindy-montford-says-mailer-shes/	Austin lawyer Mindy Montford, seeking the Democratic nomination for a state district judgeship, says she’s got vast courthouse experience, much of that from eight-plus years as a Travis County assistant district attorney, which followed her job as a Harris County prosecutor. Montford, running for judge of the 299th state district court, says on her campaign Web site that she’s had over 100 trials and handled thousands of cases, a claim that seems possible considering she worked nearly a decade as a prosecutor. We were exploring those claims when we came across a more dramatic Montford mailer that reached voters in mid-February. It states that Montford "has tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts." Talk about close-to-home experience. We shifted gears to check her Travis County claim. Montford earlier had told us she reached her total for Travis County jury trials by estimating trials she had worked on while in the Travis County DA's office, from October 1999 through the end of her tenure there in May 2008. Montford said she averaged 10 jury trials a year. "Some years there were fewer than 10 and some years there were more than 10," she said. Using Montford's claimed average, that adds up to 87 jury trials over eight years and eight months. Montford said she also had one jury trial as a lawyer in private practice, in 2009. That brings us to 88 Travis County jury trials, short of her mailer's claim to over 100 jury trials. After we asked her about the mailer, Montford admitted it was in error. "You are correct that some of our campaign literature mistakenly says that I have tried over 100 jury trials in Travis County," she said. "That was an oversight and one that was never meant to mislead anyone. In every speech I have made on the trail, I have never claimed that all my jury trials were in Travis County and our Web site correctly states the information." On her campaign site and on other mailers, Montford's claim to over 100 jury trials does not say they were all in Travis County. UPDATE: After our initial post of this item Feb. 27, PolitiFact Texas came across a door hanger distributed by Montford's campaign including the statement that she'd tried over 100 cases in Travis County courts. Her consultant, Mark Littlefield, then said that 1,000 of the door hangers were printed and distributed though he said volunteers spent time marking out the Travis County trials' claim on the hangers--a cross-out that didn't appear on the hanger we fielded. Littlefield said there are no other campaign items with Montford's trials-in-Travis County claim. Seeking an independent count of Montford's Travis County trials, we contacted the Travis County DA’s office. Spokesman Rudy Magallanes said Montford was the first- or second-chair prosecutor in 61 trials. She topped out at 14 trials in 2000. She had her low of two trials in 2006. Counting the single jury trial that Montford reports having as a lawyer in private practice, her confirmed jury trials in Travis County would number 62. There’s a small wrinkle, though. Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who bested Montford in a 2008 runoff for the Democratic nomination for district attorney, vouched for the 61 Montford jury trials reflected in a list kept by the executive assistant to the first assistant district attorney. But Lehmberg said the list might be incomplete. "There could have been more (Montford) trials that we did not write down," she said. We also checked with Harris County and compiled a list of 36 trials that had Montford as a prosecutor there. Like Lehmberg, Scott Durfee, an assistant general counsel for the Harris County District Attorney’s office, cautioned that the tabulation of trials by each attorney might be incomplete. So how does Montford’s statement of "over 100 jury trials" in Travis County stand up? As she admitted, not well; it was an erroneous mailing. Using Montford's own annual estimate, we reached a total of 88 Travis County jury trials. The DA's list is even shorter, prompting us to presume just 62 Montford jury trials in the county. In both counts, we take Montford at her word that she handled a single jury trial as a private lawyer. Even if the DA's office failed to count a few Montford trials, it wouldn't be enough to make her statement accurate, though Montford's trials confirmed by Travis and Harris counties plus the one she says she had in private practice add up to 98, which is close to 100. Montford owned up; we agree her mailer was wrong. We rate her statement as False.	None	Mindy Montford	None	None	None	2010-03-03T12:29:15	2010-02-22	['Travis_County,_Texas']
pomt-11590	Says Paul Soglin took Madison backward -- "businesses have left and murders have gone up."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/31/scott-walker/scott-walkers-overstated-attack-governor-rival-pau/	Republican Scott Walker, aiming to smack down the latest Democrat seeking to deny him a third term as governor, got off to an early start in attacking Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. At 6:41 a.m. on Jan. 10, 2018, the day Soglin announced his candidacy, Walker tweeted: The last thing we need is more Madison in our lives. @Paulsoglin is the latest extreme liberal who wants to take our state backward -- just like he did in Madison, where businesses have left and murders have gone up. We want to go forward. The capital city is generally known for having economic vitality and relative safety. So, let’s check the attack: Walker is claiming that in Madison, businesses have left and murders have gone up, and that Soglin is at least partly to blame. (We’ll note: The Wisconsin Republican Party unveiled an anti-Soglin website the same day and made an attack on Soglin similar to Walker’s.) Businesses leaving To back the first part of Walker’s statement, his campaign cited to us two large employers that left the city: 1. Spectrum Brands, the owner of Rayovac, Remington and other consumer product lines, announced in 2012 it was moving its headquarters and more than 500 employees from Madison to Middleton, a suburb. Soglin complained that Spectrum Brands didn’t give Madison a chance to bid on keeping the company in the city. The company said its Madison facility was outdated and not energy efficient, and that it did consider sites in Madison. The company also said the cost savings -- along with a $4 million award from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a state agency under Walker -- "were substantial enough to shelve plans to move" to Florida. 2. Heinz Kraft, the parent company of Oscar Mayer, announced in 2015 it would shut down its 1,000-employee Oscar Mayer plant in Madison. Kraft Heinz said the decision was part of a plan to close seven factories in the United States and Canada, following its merger with Oscar Mayer. State Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, a Republican, pointed a finger of blame at Soglin, while Soglin criticized the Economic Development Corp. for not trying to keep the plant in Madison after learning that other states were trying to get the Wisconsin facilities. Walker’s campaign also pointed to criticism of Soglin over Oscar Mayer by former Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. But Cieslewicz concluded that the company’s decision to close the plant "almost certainly couldn’t have been headed off by state or local efforts, even if officials knew it was coming. This appears to be a straightforward business decision that had to do with changes in the industry and the configuration of the aging plant here." So, based on news reports of the companies’ own statements, it’s not clear how much of a role, if any, Soglin played in the companies’ decisions. Moreover, Walker didn’t provide any evidence that the two cases are anything more than isolated examples. We thought it was important to look at the number of businesses in Madison overall. Finding those numbers isn’t as simple as it might appear. These entities don’t count businesses at the City of Madison level: the state departments of Workforce Development and Financial Institutions; the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce; and three federal bodies -- the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The best count we could find is from the City of Madison assessor’s office, which tracks business that are subject to what is known as the personal property tax, but is only paid by businesses, based on their equipment and furnishings. (Utilities and manufacturers are excluded from the counts.) Business in Madison, per city assessor counts 2011 (Soglin takes office in April) 4,700 2012 5,095 2013 4,791 2014 4,949 2015 4,701 2016 4,704 2017 4,847 So, the figures indicate the number of businesses has gone up and down during Soglin’s tenure, but there are more now than when he took office. In other words, it isn’t a picture of a net loss in businesses. Murders in Madison Homicide in Madison is uncommon enough that, to the best of the Madison Police Department’s knowledge, the number has been in the single-digits in every year but one. So, even one or two incidents could cause an increase in a given year. In contrast, although Milwaukee’s population is only about 2.4 times larger than Madison’s (595,000 to roughly 252,000), it had more than 11 times as many homicides (124) in 2017. Here’s a look at the numbers: Homicides in Madison Year Number of homicides 2011 (Soglin took office in April) 7 2012 3 2013 5 2014 5 2015 6 2016 8 2017 11 So, the number of murders in 2016 and 2017 was higher than in every other year during Soglin’s tenure. In fact, the 11 in 2017 is a record for the city. Like many mayors, Soglin has sometimes clashed with his police chief over police staffing. And policing certainly is one factor in homicides. But criminologists say many other factors are involved. Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy James Alan Fox told us Soglin can’t be singled out for blame, saying: As is common for jurisdictions that tend to have fewer than a dozen homicides a year, there is a substantial volatility in the homicide counts that have little to do with any policy or practice. Such factors as whether a gunshot victim is struck in a vital organ or not, and how quickly an assault victim is brought to the hospital for emergency treatment, can impact whether a crime is a homicide or an aggravated assault. (Police policies and staffing could affect homicides), however, staffing levels have little impact on many forms of homicide. And whatever impact there is, it is hard to connect that with an increase of a few homicides. Said Rick Rosenfeld, a criminology and criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis: These numbers are simply too low to draw meaningful conclusions about an increase, not to mention assigning "blame." Homicide counts will vary one year to the next simply because a bullet hits or misses a vital organ. Social scientists refer to such variation as measurement error. The Madison numbers are well within expected measurement error of this sort. Our rating Walker says Soglin took Madison backward -- "businesses have left and murders have gone up." There are, of course, examples of businesses having left Madison, but the total number of businesses appears to be higher now than when Soglin took office. As for murders, they increased by two in 2016 and by three in 2017, hitting a record high of 11. But the two large companies cited by Walker that pulled out of Madison cited business reasons, not Soglin, for leaving. And while a mayor can play some role in combating homicides, primarily through a police department, there are many factors that lead to murder. Walker’s statement contains an element of truth but is overbroad. We rate it Mostly False. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2018-01-31T06:00:00	2018-01-11	['None']

pomt-03934	Says, "when this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar - I call it mismanagement – deficit."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/21/jon-bramnick/jon-bramnick-says-chris-christie-had-11-billion-de/	It’s the number that keeps on giving. Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick is the latest public official to get mileage from a claim about an $11 billion albatross that was hanging around Chris Christie’s neck when he became governor in 2010. Bramnick, a Republican representing parts of Union, Somerset and Morris counties, mentioned the number during a roundtable discussion Feb. 8 for NJTV’s "On The Record" with Michael Aron. PolitiFact New Jersey has checked the existence of such a deficit on several occasions when Christie made similar claims. Why did Bramnick bring up the number? Bramnick and several other legislators were discussing the concept of the state returning money to municipalities that utilities pay towns for hosting utility poles, facilities and more. That money is paid to the state, which is supposed to then send the money – estimated in the hundreds of millions -- to the municipalities. That hasn’t happened, however, as the state grapples with various economic issues. Bramnick said the theory of returning the money is an idea no one would disagree with, but he questioned where the millions would come from. "When this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar -- I call it mismanagement – deficit," Bramnick said, adding that Christie has been working to improve the state’s finances. Bramnick’s right that Christie took office with an $11 billion deficit, but that number is a theoretical figure only. Let’s explain the deficit. The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. That budget was put together under then-Gov. Jon Corzine. Christie’s first budget was for fiscal year 2012. A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all statutory spending obligations were fully funded. The state, however, does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute. That means that while a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise. And like his predecessor, that’s basically what Christie did when it was his turn to craft a spending plan. In Christie’s case, he skipped a $3 billion pension payment and didn’t fully fund the school-aid formula or the state’s property tax rebate program. The result? New Jersey still had a projected structural deficit for the fiscal 2012 budget year, but slightly smaller. It was $10.5 billion, according to the OLS. So there was an approximate $11 billion deficit when Christie took office, but in theory only. Bramnick acknowledged that the deficit in place when Christie took office was a structural deficit, and said he cited it during the discussion to illustrate the state’s financial woes. Our ruling Bramnick said during a roundtable discussion on NJTV’s "On The Record" with Michael Aron" that "when this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar -- I call it mismanagement -- deficit." The OLS projected a nearly $11 billion structural deficit for the fiscal year 2011 budget created under Corzine, but it’s the type of deficit that measures how much money the state would need to maintain funding for services, if all required spending was fully funded and revenues stayed the same. Bramnick’s right that a deficit existed when Christie came into office, but it was a theoretical one that resulted because administrations prior to Christie’s didn’t spend all of the money needed to fully fund required expenses -- a move Christie repeated for his first budget as governor.

pomt-12284	"We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/30/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-offers-credible-projection-federal-deb/	Could the United States be facing a future with $129 trillion in additional deficits over the next 30 years? Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., contends it’s possible. On June 26, 2017, as a Senate bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was foundering, Johnson wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled, "Where the Senate health care bill fails." The op-ed focused on the difficulty of reining in federal outlays for health care spending. "We are $20 trillion in debt," Johnson wrote. "The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years. A truly moral and compassionate society does not impoverish future generations to bestow benefits in the here and now." Let’s take a closer look at those figures. Diving into the numbers The U.S. Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator allows you to track the federal debt on a daily basis. The website lists two kinds of debt -- publicly held debt and gross federal debt. The difference is that federal debt is calculated by taking the amount of publicly held debt and adding to it the debt that is held by the government. These are typically IOUs between one governmental entity and another, such as the money owed by the general treasury to the Social Security trust fund. As of June 29, the gross federal debt -- the more all-encompassing of the two figures -- was $19.8 trillion. That rounds up to $20 trillion, the figure Johnson cited. The other debt figure -- publicly held debt -- is smaller, at $14.3 trillion. However, since Johnson was very close to one of the two official figures, we won’t quibble. It’s trickier, though, to check whether the Congressional Budget Office -- a nonpartisan arm of Congress whose analyses are given significant weight in Washington policy debates -- projected an additional $129 trillion of "accumulated deficits." CBO does indeed calculate a figure for accumulated future deficits. CBO’s most recent Long Term Budget Outlook, released in March 2017, mainly discusses deficits and debt between now and 2047 as a percentage of gross domestic product. But we were able to check Johnson’s statement by reverse-engineering the dollar amounts using the percentages in the report. CBO projects $91.5 trillion in public debt by 2047, up from $14.8 trillion in 2017. That’s an increase of $77 trillion over 30 years. But remember that this is the figure for the public debt, the smaller of the two debt measurements, so we used that to estimate the size of the gross federal debt. Today, gross debt is 1.39 times larger than public debt. If that ratio holds steady over the next 30 years -- a big assumption -- then the gross federal debt in 2047 would be about $107 trillion. That still falls a bit short of Johnson’s $129 trillion. Why the gap? The answer: Johnson was applying a no-longer-used CBO formula to make his own calculations Since 2013, Johnson, a trained accountant, has regularly sought to spread the word about the United States’ long-term debt challenges. He put together a series of charts and graphs that he shared with fellow lawmakers and members of the media, focusing on the 30-year time frame, a long-term view that Johnson felt was too often missing from the conversation. To put these charts together, Johnson used a calculation made by the CBO called the "alternative fiscal scenario." The main CBO projections usually use current law as the starting point and assume that current law will continue indefinitely. However, to offer a wider range of future possibilities, CBO sometimes offers an "alternative" scenario using different assumptions about what the law would look like in the future. Because this alternative scenario tends to project higher future deficits, it explains why Johnson’s figure of $129 trillion is bigger than the official CBO projection of $107 trillion. CBO produced the alternative fiscal scenario itself, so it comes with significant credibility. However, it’s worth pointing out a caveat: The CBO hasn’t produced calculations based on its alternative fiscal scenario since its 2015 report, when Congress made moot a major reason the calculation was devised in the first place. (That year, Congress stopped putting off a planned cut in Medicare reimbursement for doctors and incorporated the higher rates into permanent law.) Johnson’s office said it ran the calculations by CBO while they were being developed. Still, the way Johnson framed the numbers in the op-ed is not strictly accurate. Johnson in his op-ed adapted a past calculation by CBO to make his claim. He wasn’t reporting what CBO produced. This framing matters, because it effectively turns a calculation by a partisan senator into one by an independent analyst. Our ruling Johnson wrote, "We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years." Johnson’s figures are plausible. Even the official CBO figure of $107 trillion in 30 years -- while smaller than Johnson's $129 trillion -- is a huge number. But the attribution is sloppy. While the figure is based on CBO data, it is not an actual, current projection by CBO. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-00216	"The latest round of tariffs now means that the total tax increase on Americans from enacted tariffs exceeds the tax increases from the Affordable Care Act."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/12/national-taxpayers-union/trump-tariffs-cost-more-health-care-taxes/	In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, analysts at the National Taxpayers Union wrote that President Donald Trump’s tariffs would cost American taxpayers more than the Affordable Care Act. The pro-free trade group estimated the annual cost of Trump’s enacted tariffs at $41.65 billion. (The research was conducted by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the National Taxpayers Union advocacy group.) "That easily outpaces the tax bill from the Affordable Care Act for next year ($34.6 billion) after accounting for recent changes to the ACA," they wrote. Are the tariffs costing Americans more than the health care law, or ACA? They are focused on the new taxes that were specifically created in the Affordable Care Act. But Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us there are hundreds of billions of dollars of general tax revenues that pay for Obamacare. So while the National Taxpayers Union is mainly correct in terms of the new taxes, it doesn’t quite capture all of the tax money that funds health care. The group used Congressional Budget Office July 2017 estimates of what repealing taxes connected with the health care law would cost in lost revenue. That was $49.2 billion. The repeal was unsuccessful, so taxpayers would have continued paying that sum. But two of those taxes were suspended for 2019: the tax on medical devices and insurers. That led to a reduction of $14.6 billion, landing the estimate of 2019 ACA taxes at $34.6 billion. However, the National Taxpayers Union’s estimate excludes the unpopular individual mandate, which imposed a penalty on people without insurance, as well as the employer mandate. The individual mandate is not being enforced, so that exclusion makes no difference. However, employer mandate penalties would add as much as $8 billion to the total in 2019, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would bring the total of ACA-imposed taxes somewhere around $42 billion, which exceeds the estimated cost of the tariffs. Trump tariffs The National Taxpayers Union’s rhetorical point is that tariffs are simply taxes on imports; businesses in the United States pay taxes on the imported goods, not China. For the tariffs, the National Taxpayers Union multiplied the percentage of each tariff by the amount of those goods imported last year. So the cost of a 25 percent steel tariff, for example, was $7.3 billion because in 2017, the U.S. imported just over $29 billion of steel. The American Tax Foundation used the same method and came to a similar estimate, $41.9 billion. That methodology assumes the same amount of goods will be imported as last year. But that’s by no means set in stone. "The dollar cost of the tariffs will be higher than we estimated if imports increase," said Bryan Riley, director of NTU's Free Trade Initiative and op-ed co-author. "However it's also possible that high tariffs could reduce import volume, which could offset some of the projected tariff revenue increase." Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, added that regardless of imports volume, we don’t know how they will get passed through by the companies paying them, either. And not everyone has to pay them -- consumers could simply redirect their demand. "Will it all get passed through in the form of higher prices on retail goods? Will the employees of these companies get lower wages? Likely some combination of these things, but nobody yet knows," Gardner said. Our ruling The National Taxpayers Union said, "The latest round of tariffs now means that the total tax increase on Americans from enacted tariffs exceeds the tax increases from the Affordable Care Act." Their estimates were that the annual cost of Trump’s enacted tariffs would be $41.65 billion in 2019, while taxes for the health care law would be $34.6 billion. Both of these are estimates. Estimates of tariff costs fall slightly below new taxes introduced by the ACA when you factor in mandate penalties. However, the costs of tariffs are yet unknown, and its effects indirect on American taxpayers. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-06347	"We spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/07/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-taxpayers-spend-half-trillion-doll/	During the now-famous New Hampshire address by Rick Perry on Oct. 28, 2011 -- in which Perry’s animated banter went viral and drew satirical jabs from Saturday Night Live -- the Texas governor made a claim about how much Americans spend on preparing their taxes. "Everybody's got a slogan, right?" Perry said. "Mine's cut, balance and grow. Get that? Yes. Cut the size of this government and balance that budget and grow the economy, and it's pretty simple actually. Or you can stay in the old system that's out there. And then … the ones that want to stay in the old system, pay the lawyers, pay the accountants, all the money that's gone, or that. Think about it. You know, we spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation. Any accountants or tax lawyers out there -- I'm sorry, dude, but that's too much money, a half a trillion dollars." A reader asked us to check whether it’s true that "we spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation." (It’s a popular topic across the ideological spectrum; President Barack Obama's administration has proposed simplified tax filing procedures, though the effort is rated Stalled on our Obameter.) We called the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to see if it tracked that figure, and it said it didn’t. We also looked at federal gross domestic product statistics and found that the industry breakdown does not specify tax preparation among its categories of professional services, making an estimate impossible. However, the Perry campaign provided us with a source: A 2005 paper by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues. The paper noted at least three burdens caused by the tax code: tax planning -- or efforts to limit one’s taxes; defending against tax audits and tax litigation; and tax compliance, which includes record-keeping, education about tax laws, form preparation and packaging and sending tax forms. The foundation decided to look only at the third category -- tax compliance -- for calendar year 2005. Its researchers concluded that the costs of compliance for individuals was 2.8 billion hours, or $110 billion; the cost for businesses was 3.1 billion hours or $148 billion; and the cost for nonprofits was 141 million hours or $6.8 billion. In all, that works out to upwards of 6 billion hours and $265 billion. If that were the final number, Perry’s estimate would be significantly off base. But there are a few additional points we need to make. First, the same paper projected that compliance costs would rise to $483 billion by 2015, or $406 billion adjusted for the 2005 value of the dollar. The $483 billion number is closer to Perry’s estimate -- and in fact, his staff said that that’s the number he was referring to during the New Hampshire speech. However, that figure is an exaggeration of today’s cost. Using the same study’s projections, the amount for 2011 should be $392 billion, or $354 billion in 2005 dollars -- well below Perry’s $500 billion figure. At the pace projected by the paper, it would take until 2016 (using regular dollars) or 2022 (using inflation-adjusted dollars) to reach Perry’s amount of $500 billion. That’s either five years or 11 years into the future -- assuming the estimate was correct in the first place and assuming nothing fundamental has changed the long-term arc since 2005. There’s another concern. Perry said that we spend "half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation. Any accountants or tax lawyers out there -- I'm sorry, dude, but that's too much money, a half a trillion dollars." This suggests that the costs we’re talking about are specifically those paid to accountants and lawyers. However, the amount calculated in the Tax Foundation study is broader. It includes time spent on internal bookkeeping and education about tax laws as well as money spent on postage and the like. In the Tax Foundation data, the costs strictly for "form preparation" -- the primary job of an accountant -- add up to 31 percent of individual tax compliance costs, 32 percent for businesses, 22 percent for nonprofits and 28 percent overall. Even if that percentage undercounts what taxpayers pay accountants, this would make Perry’s estimate even further off base. However, the decrease would be at least partially offset by adding in the cost of "tax lawyers," in Perry’s words, whose costs are not included in the Tax Foundation study. All this makes clear that estimating the tax compliance burden on the United States is tricky business. Indeed, the Government Accountability Office came to that very conclusion in a 2005 report. "Estimating total compliance costs is difficult because neither the government nor taxpayers maintain regular accounts of these costs, and federal tax requirements often overlap with record-keeping and reporting that taxpayers do for other purposes," the GAO wrote. "Although available estimates are uncertain, taken together, they suggest that total compliance costs are large. For example, combining the lowest available estimates for the personal and corporate income tax yields a total of $107 billion (roughly 1 percent of GDP) per year." Other studies, GAO added, estimate costs as 1.5 times as large. We also checked in with Eric Toder, a fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied tax compliance costs. He estimated that current compliance costs for all individual filers is about $100 billion, plus nearly another $100 billion for small businesses, plus an undetermined amount for nonprofits and large businesses. Added together, this is likely a bit lower than the Tax Foundation’s projected 2011 figure of $392 billion and significantly lower than Perry’s $500 billion figure. Toder added that Perry’s tax proposal -- keeping the current system, but giving filers an option of paying a flat tax instead -- wouldn’t necessarily reduce compliance costs by much. "If you look at IRS data, you will find that ‘business’ taxpayers -- individuals who complete schedules C, E, or F -- spend a lot more time on their returns than non-business taxpayers," he said. "Business returns are complex because it is hard to determine which expenses are business expenses (deductible) or personal expenses (non-deductible). For example, what share of the expenses of maintaining a car that is used for both business and personal reasons is deductible? None of those types of problems would be made easier by the Perry proposal." Toder added that the biggest part of burden is record-keeping, "which has nothing to do with the cost of completing forms, such as switching to a postcard" -- a centerpiece of Perry’s plan. Our ruling Looking at the Tax Foundation report which Perry used -- as well as alternate analyses of the question -- it’s clear that $500 billion is a high estimate, at least as the numbers stand today. If you define this number narrowly -- to tax preparers and tax lawyers, the groups Perry named specifically -- Perry’s estimate is even further off base. Perry has a valid point to make -- that a whole lot of money is spent on tax preparation in the United States today. But he not only takes the highest estimate, he also uses a number projected into the future and makes it sound like that's what is being spent today. On balance, we rate Perry’s statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-11-07T16:36:30	2011-10-28	['None']

In the past year, the Governor’s Workforce Board gave out a number of outlandish grants." Stenhouse and Williams cited two examples. One in particular caught our eye: "A grant for $5,000 went to teach an employee at a company that makes ornamental business card holders how to use Facebook and Twitter." That's an eye-catching claim, and several media outlets quoted it. We were intrigued -- $5,000 to teach one person how to use two immensely popular social media websites? That certainly seemed to qualify as outlandish. We put on our fact-checking hats and tried to learn more. Our first stop: the report released by Stenhouse's and Williams' organizations. It says that the board spent "$5,000 to provide social media training for employees at Ahler's Designs." It linked to a document from the board saying that the training was for three employees -- not one -- plus one student. When we asked Stenhouse about the discrepancy, he contended that he said "an employee," in the commentary, not "one person." We don’t see the difference. Stenhouse also said he forwarded our query to Williams, who did not respond to us. So was the $5,000 spent to teach people about Twitter and Facebook? Yes. And more. According to the grant contract, it covered part of the cost of 32 hours of social media training, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+ and YouTube. It also covered 20 hours of "sales and process" training at Ahlers, a Pawtucket-based company that creates gifts and awards that are hand-crafted in Rhode Island. Rick Brooks, executive director of the Workforce Board, said such grants are designed to improve the skills of current and future workers, and only cover part of the training costs. "We want the business to have some skin in the game," he said. The grants come from the Job Development Fund, which is financed by the payroll tax the state levies on business to cover unemployment insurance. "The money comes from businesses and we make the money available to businesses," said Brooks. In this case, Ahlers Designs asked for help in underwriting its training costs because it was trying to shift its business to focus on custom artwork for individuals and corporations. It needed to train more people in sales and marketing, a job mostly done by CEO Gail Ahlers, according to Ahlers and her grant application. Companies also get a bigger grant if they agree to set up internships, which Ahlers did, training two students, not just the one that it promised to do. That's five people trained with the grant. Both Brooks and Ahlers argued that social media skills are crucial to helping a business succeed in the Internet age, and they involve a lot more than finding friends on Facebook. There are tricks to getting your products listed ahead of others in a Google search, techniques to avoid being smeared online by competitors, and special rules that have to be followed if you're trying to market something on a social media site. "Knowing how to use Facebook for sales is a different skill set" than simply being a casual user, said Brooks. In his email, Stenhouse said, "Taxpayer dollars being spent on something that millions have figured out for themselves is outrageous. We question, however, the public service value of fact-checking the semantic difference between 'an employee' and 'employees’ when a much larger public policy question is at the core of the issue." "Aren't we trying to retrain people so we can keep the jobs? And it's the small companies that really need the help so they can hire more people," Ahlers responded. We'll let others debate whether state funds should be spent on this type of training -- or any training at all. PolitiFact focuses on whether politicians, advocates and pundits can get their facts straight. Our ruling Michael Stenhouse and his coauthor, David Williams, made this provocative claim: "A grant for $5,000 [from the Governor’s Workforce Board] went to teach an employee at a company that makes ornamental business card holders how to use Facebook and Twitter." So let's walk through the important elements. Was it a $5,000 grant? Yes. Was it just "an employee" who got $5,000 worth of training? No. And Stenhouse’s and Williams’ own report acknowledges that. Did the grant go for training to use Facebook and Twitter? Yes. But it was also spent on other forms of social media and involved a lot more than how to "friend" someone or keep a tweet below 140 characters. In addition, nearly 40 percent of the training time was spent on more-traditional sales training. Because the statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04870	"This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fishermen. Washington commercial fishermen would still be allowed to use gillnets on the Columbia River."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/09/salmon-all/would-proposed-ban-target-only-oregon-commercial-g/	Oregon Ballot Measure 81 would prohibit the use of gillnets by nontribal commercial fishermen in the Oregon side of the Columbia River. Advocates of the ban say the outdated nets kill all sorts of fish, including protected native salmon. Opponents, however, say the measure is nothing but a power grab by sports fishermen, who want more fish bites. Brenda Wall is on the board of Salmon for All, an organization that represents gillnetters. In a guest column published in The Oregonian, she argues that the ban would allow Washington fisheries to continue to use gillnets in the Columbia River, but not Oregon fisheries. "This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fishermen. Washington commercial fishermen would still be allowed to use gill nets on the Columbia River," she writes. This prompted a query from a reader to PolitiFact Oregon: "Is it true that the measure restricts Oregon fishermen on the same river where Washington fishermen would not be restricted?" Great question. (Readers, send us more questions!) We’d like to add another question to that: Would a ban, if approved by Oregon voters, only apply to Oregon fishermen but exempt Washington fishermen? To explain the answers to these questions, we need to give readers a quick rundown of how fish runs work in the Columbia River. Oregon and Washington have concurrent jurisdiction over the Columbia, which forms much of the border between the two. Nontribal commercial gillnetting is authorized in the 140-mile stretch west of Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean. For the most part, the physical boundary between Oregon and Washington is sliced down the middle of the river. But as you move westward toward the mouth of the river, maps clearly show that more of the Columbia is within the Oregon state line. However, fish don’t respect state lines, so the two states work together to manage for endangered species. Washington and Oregon together decide when to allow sports and commercial fishermen to fish on the river. Washington issues licenses and permits to its people, and Oregon issues licenses and permits to its people and the two states recognize the validity of the other’s licenses and permits in their part of the river. This is all highly regulated and tightly coordinated. The ballot measure aims to amend Oregon Revised Statutes 508.775 to read: (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, it is unlawful for an individual to use a gillnet or tangle net to take salmon, steelhead or other fish in the inland waters of the state of Oregon. (new language is in italics, bold.) So let’s say Oregon voters approve Ballot Measure 81 in November. Would the ban apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen, and not Washington commercial fishermen, in Oregon’s side of the river? No, state law applies equally to all. Would a gillnetting ban mean that Washington commercial fishermen could continue to use gillnets on the Columbia River? Yes, an Oregon ban has no authority in waters outside Oregon. Washington fishermen could continue to use gillnets on their side of the river. We could have split regulation down the river. "This doesn’t apply to Washington," said Rick Hargrave, a spokesman for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. "Washington commercial gillnetters can continue to do their thing in Washington waters." Guy Norman, regional director for Washington’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, says the goal always is concurrent regulation. "However, if we are unable to attain concurrent regulation, for one reason or another, then each state reserves the right to set regulations within their respective boundaries," he said. Certainly this ballot measure would upend the idea of reciprocity between the states. How that plays out, nobody knows yet. For example, will Washington state allow Oregon fishermen to use gillnets in Washington water? Will Washington follow Oregon in prohibiting gillnets? Those are policy questions for Washington to address. Likewise, we don’t know the logistics of how enforcement might be carried out. PolitiFact Oregon can’t rule on how Washington might respond should the measure be approved, because those decisions haven’t been made. But we can rule on what the measure says it will do, and there’s no real argument from the two campaign sides: Ballot Measure 81 prohibits the use of gillnets in the inland waters of the state of Oregon. The point made by Brenda Wall is that the measure does nothing to prevent Washington commercial fishermen from using gillnets on their side of the river. The "Stop Gillnets Now" campaign objects to the assessment because Wall gives the impression that Washington fishermen can continue to use gillnets throughout the Columbia, when they wouldn’t. They would be limited to their side of the river. It is not accurate to say that the Oregon ban would apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen. It is accurate to say that Washington commercial fishermen can continue to use gillnets in the Columbia -- so long as they stick to their side of the river. One part of the statement is true and the other part is not true. We split the statement -- like the Columbia River -- down the middle and rate it Half True.

pomt-01820	The Obama Administration is suing a Wisconsin company for forcing employees to speak English.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/20/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-feds-sued-company-requiring-workers/	In the fall of 2012, Wisconsin Plastics, Inc., a Green Bay-area manufacturer, fired 22 people, most of them Hmong or Hispanic workers. The action led to a lawsuit against the company by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which argues the workers’ civil rights were violated. The agency sued June 9, 2014 after its mediation efforts failed. The lawsuit alleges that the workers were fired based on 10-minute observations that marked them down for their English skills, even though those skills were not needed to perform their jobs. Several weeks after the suit was filed, the case caught fire. Fox News did a piece on it, criticizing the government’s case. And a series of conservative blogs slammed the agency’s actions, including FreePatriot.org. A PolitiFact Wisconsin reader came across that post and asked us to examine it. The posting carried this headline: "Obama administration suing Wisconsin company for forcing employees to speaking English." Yes, it said "speaking English." But we’re not here to check typos. In any case, the claim is a good one for a fact check: Is the Obama Administration suing a Wisconsin company "for forcing employees to speak English." We started with the author of the FreePatroit item, Tim Walker, who blogs from the Philippines. In an email, he said the sole source for his item was RightWingNews.com which had posted an item with this headline: "Feds suing county in Wisconsin for requiring workers to speak English." (That headline is actually incorrect, because a business is being sued, not a county.) The Rightwingnews.com item linked to an item from a site called Weasel Zippers, which had reposted an item from Judicial Watch that carried this headline: "U.S. sues American co. for requiring workers to speak English." In each case, the bloggers claim the EEOC lawsuit is about workers forced to speak English -- what the agency terms an "English only" case. These cases revolve around situations where workers are required to speak English at work or when interacting with customers. But the EEOC says the bloggers got it wrong. So does the company. What the agency says When we contacted the EEOC, agency attorney Cesar del Peral said the case is about the rights of the employees being violated because they had been subjected to "a sham performance improvement plan" that pointed out a lack of language skills. The complaint says that the firings violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects employees from discrimination based on national origin, which includes the linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. "The company based its decisions on English language fluency," said del Peral, who noted that some of the dismissed employees had been with the company for seven to 10 years and had previously received satisfactory performance evaluations. Del Peral said the case was different from other actions that the agency has taken against companies who have "English only" rules. He noted the suit doesn’t allege that "anyone was forced to speak English or that anyone refused." The company’s side After the blog postings started to appear, the company issued a July 2, 2014 news release that criticized the posts and said language was not a factor in the firings. "The recent story regarding the EEOC lawsuit filed against Wisconsin Plastics, Inc. is sensationalizing a lawsuit that has no merit," said Bruce Wendt, vice president of operations, in the statement. "WPI is proud to have a diversified workforce and have interpreters on staff to accommodate the language needs of our workforce." The statement also said: "The reality is the decision to lay off employees in the fall of 2012 was made based on the employees’ overall comparative skills, behaviors and job performance over time." So, where did the English-only idea picked up by the bloggers come from? Once we plowed through numerous web sites to the source, we discovered a sloppy EEOC news release. The agency’s June 9, 2014 release included this statement: "Our experience at the EEOC has been that so-called 'English only' rules and requirements of English fluency are often employed to make what is really discrimination appear acceptable," said John C. Hendrickson, EEOC Chicago regional attorney. "But superficial appearances are not fooling anyone," he said. "When speaking English fluently is not, in fact, required for the safe and effective performance of a job, nor the successful operation of the employer's business, requiring employees to be fluent in English usually constitutes discrimination on the basis of national origin -- and thus violates federal law." When asked about the news release, Hendrickson backed away from the statement about English Only rules in the case. The "EEOC does not contend that Wisconsin Plastics either has an ‘English Only Rule’ or that the charging parties were terminated because of the failure or refusal to obey an such rule. Perhaps my reference to English Only Rules was therefore not helpful," he wrote in an email. The statement continued: "Our contention is that they were terminated on account of their national origin and that termination followed some sort of test of their fluency in English -- notwithstanding the fact that fluency in English was not required for the performance of their jobs (as evidenced by their prior successful performance of those jobs)." Our rating Various blogs said that the EEOC sued Wisconsin Plastics because the company "forced employees to speak English." That’s not what the lawsuit says. The complaint says the company violated workers’ civil rights by subjecting them to a sham performance exam that focused on English language skills. Even the company says the bloggers, while trying to sympathize with it, took matters too far and sensationalized the lawsuit. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01277	"25,000 businesses have been created since (Scott) Walker took office."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/03/republican-party-wisconsin/state-republican-party-25000-new-businesses-under-/	The Republican Party of Wisconsin may have committed a Freudian slip in its Oct. 29, 2014 news release touting Gov. Scott Walker’s accomplishments. "Over 110,000 new jobs and 25,0000 businesses have been created since Walker took office," the release originally said. We noted the extra zero on that second figure, an echo perhaps of Walker’s promise that Wisconsin would create 250,000 private-sector jobs on his watch. (He will fall far short and we have rated it Promise Broken). But what really got our attention was the corrected version of the release, which says 25,000 new businesses have sprung up since Walker took office in January 2011. It’s a nice round number, and a sharp contrast to what the GOP said in an earlier news release -- that 27,000 businesses "fled the state" due to the policies of former Gov. Jim Doyle and Mary Burke, the former state Commerce secretary trying to unseat Walker in the Nov. 4 governor’s race. We’ve heard the 25,000 new businesses claim before -- Walker’s campaign uses it, pointing to figures published by a state agency, the Department of Financial Institutions. The agency reports the number of registered "business entities" in Wisconsin, including filings by newly formed business corporations, non-stock nonprofit corporations, cooperatives, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and partnerships, common law trusts, veterans organizations and certain religious corporations. The numbers rise and fall as some entities fall away and others are created, giving what economists say is a rough sense of economic activity. The net gain in the number of active entities during Walker’s three-plus years is 24,947, or a 7 percent increase. (There were 389,316 business entities registered as of Sept. 30, 2014). So that’s the 25,000 figure in the GOP claim. That’s far from the end of the story. That number turns out, in many cases, to have very little to do with actual operating businesses and job creation. We’ve closely examined this issue before. In May 2014, we reported that the count of newly registered "business entities" includes not only new ventures that bring new jobs, but thousands with no workers on the payroll at all -- and little if any prospect of hires to come. That analysis by PolitiFact Wisconsin found that the count includes: -- Thousands of limited-liability companies set up by real-estate investors solely to hold ownership of property or properties. Even investors as far away as Australia are on the list because they bought Wisconsin rental properties. -- Out-of-state firms that registered in Wisconsin because they may want to do work here. -- Hundreds of nonprofit organizations, often volunteer-run, including Scout troops, condo associations, youth sports leagues, volunteer fire departments, historical societies, "friends" fundraising groups, scholarship funds and many more. -- Startups that are just getting organized and not yet able to pay employees. As PolitiFact Wisconsin has noted several times in evaluating Walker’s promise to create 10,000 new businesses in his term, business experts caution that many LLCs are set up for tax and liability purposes and employ no one. To judge Walker’s final progress on his new business promise, we will also consider a second measure related to business formations -- the number of new locations, or "business establishments," set up by companies. We reported in September that the state had added 6,657 such establishments through March 2014. To be sure, there are many job-producing startups among the thousands of entities cited by the GOP. But it’s impossible to say, without calling every person registering a new firm, exactly how many fit in that category. It is easy, however, to say the GOP claim, which ignores the thousands of non-operating businesses in the mix, is far off the mark. At the same time, the party’s characterization of a net loss of business entity filings during the Doyle years as firms having "fled the state" is off base. The drop reflected the slowdown in business activity during the Great Recession, but there is no official tally of how many active employers shut down or picked up and left. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP claimed that "25,000 businesses have been created since Walker took office." There’s an element of truth: that’s the number of business "entities" that were created. But portraying these registrations as businesses in the context of job creation is a major stretch because many are just corporate shells, non profit organizations, reconstituted versions of existing businesses and out-of-state firms. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2014-11-03T05:00:00	2014-10-29	['None']

pomt-04758	Says our national debt is greater than our gross domestic product.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-addressing-delegates-says-national-debt-e/	Rallying delegates at the Republican National Convention, Ted Cruz mentioned his eldest daughter to make a point about the rising national debt. Cruz, Texas’ Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison, said the national debt -- $10 trillion when his daughter, Caroline, was born -- had spiked to $16 trillion as of today, "larger than our gross domestic product." (The debt was more than $9.6 trillion in late August 2008, according to the U.S. Treasury’s Debt to the Penny web page, and nearly $16 trillion as of Aug. 27, 2012). We wondered if the debt is really bigger than the Gross Domestic Product, the marquee measure of national economic output. The government defines the GDP as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country. A footnote to the prepared text of Cruz’s Aug. 28, 2012, convention speech attributes his conclusion to an Oct. 20, 2011, blog post by the Atlantic magazine suggesting the debt would surpass the nation’s GDP by the end of that month. We looked for what has happened since that speculation. Fortuitously, we’d started exploring this topic when Cruz aired a similar comparison during an Aug. 27, 2012, interview with Alana Rocha, a convention reporter for YNN Austin. In a March 13, 2012, blog post, the anti-deficit Concord Coalition said the gross debt would top the nation’s GDP this year for the first time since World War II. Projections showed the gross debt continuing to increase rapidly "as we continue to borrow and as today’s unusually low interest rates eventually rise toward their historic average," the group wrote. The gross debt is best understood in two parts. Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, which is why the coalition tends to focus on it, Josh Gordon, a coalition analyst, told us by phone. "If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market." An August 2011 fact check quoted Gary Therkildsen, a fiscal policy analyst at OMB Watch, a nonprofit government-accountability group, as saying that’s why the public debt, not the gross debt, is what’s most important for understanding the government’s fiscal health. PolitiFact Ohio rated Mostly True a claim by the state’s Republican Sen. Rob Portman that the nation’s debt was equal to 100 percent of its GDP. The total debt then amounted to 97.2 percent of the GDP, while the public debt was equivalent to 66 percent of the GDP. According to a July 27, 2010, report on the federal debt by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the ratio of the public debt to GDP had previously exceeded 50 percent once before -- during and shortly after WW II. Gordon pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office said in its Aug. 22, 2012, update on the nation’s economic outlook that by October 2012, the public debt would reach 73 percent of GDP -- the highest level since 1950, the report said, and about twice the share that it measured at the end of September 2007, before the financial crisis and recent recession. The report says too that if deficits continue apace, "debt held by the public would climb to 90 percent of GDP by 2022 -- higher than at any time since shortly after World War II." Such background in hand, we looked at Cruz’s comparison both by considering the gross debt versus the GDP and by weighing just the public debt against it. According to the U.S. Treasury’s Debt to the Penny web page, the gross federal debt on Aug. 27, 2012, was more than $15.9 trillion, counting nearly $11.2 trillion in public debt and nearly $4.8 trillion in intragovernmental holdings -- that money owed within the government. The size of the U.S. economy, measured by the GDP, was more than $15.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2012, the most recent quarter for which data are available. This number comes from a chart, last revised July 27, 2012, downloadable from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. To ensure more of an apples-to-apples comparison, we checked the total national debt toward the end of the second quarter, at about the time the GDP was more than $15.6 trillion. The total debt as of June 29, 2012, was more than $15.8 trillion; the public debt portion was $11 trillion. At this pass, then, Cruz’s comparison holds. Gross debt outpaces the GDP by $200 billion to $300 billion. But the public debt was equal to about 71 to 72 percent of the GDP, depending on which public debt figure is used. The public debt has been running $4.4 trillion to $4.6 trillion behind the GDP. Gordon said it’s questionable that the ratio of the debt to GDP means much except as a reminder that the debt continues to rise. "Is there an economic difference in (the debt) being lower than the GDP or higher? No, there isn’t. It doesn’t make a difference," Gordon said. "There is no magic line that you’ve crossed." Jason Pequet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, floated a slightly different interpretation, saying that while no expert knows the precise level at which debt eclipsing some threshold of the GDP will start significantly holding back the American economy, research by Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff and others of debt-to-GDP ratios in other countries suggests that once the gross debt exceeds about 90 percent of the GDP, economic growth starts to noticeably slow. Pequet cautioned, though, that the United States has unique powerful advantages in that its economy is the world’s largest and the American dollar doubles as the world’s reserve currency. It’s not certain that the debt exceeding the GDP is, or will, have the same effects here as in other countries. Summing up, he said, the relationship of debt to the GDP is not an arbitrary threshold because it "shows the ability of your economy to pay for and finance that debt going forward." Our ruling The total federal debt exceeds the nation’s economic output or GDP. However, the public debt -- borrowing that relates to the economy’s strength -- hovers below three quarters of the GDP.

pomt-06386	Says the main Central Texas food bank is delivering 50 percent more food to the poor than three years ago.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/01/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-central-texas-food-bank-deliver/	In a September 2011 floor speech, Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin spoke of two concerns he said are growing in the Lone Star State: poverty and hunger. Doggett said that in tough times, more families are turning to food banks, creating "immense" demand. Among his examples: The Austin-based Capital Area Food Bank of Texas "this year is delivering 50 percent more food to poor people than it did three years ago." In his speech, Doggett attributed that figure to John Turner, a food bank official. We wondered if the proclaimed increase was correct, and if so, whether that accurately reflected a surge in hunger in our area. The food bank, founded in 1981, takes in donations of food and money from the government, the food industry and the public, then distributes food to Central Texas residents directly and through more than 350 agencies in its 21-county service area roughly centered on Travis and Williamson counties. (Click to view a map.) The region’s north edge runs from Mills County in the west to Freestone County in the east; its south edge runs from Gillespie and Blanco counties in the west to Fayette County on the east. Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us by email that Doggett drew his 50 percent figure from a Sept. 4, 2011, news story in the Guardian, a British newspaper, which quotes Turner saying the food bank was delivering 50 percent more food to the poor than it had done three years ago. In an interview, Turner, the food bank’s senior director for marketing and branding, recently told us he’d given the Guardian a conservative estimate: The pounds of food distributed by the bank had actually increased 64 percent, going from 15.4 million pounds in 2007 to 25.3 million pounds in 2010. Turner noted, too, that the 2010 poundage was inflated by one-time federal stimulus aid enabling the bank to buy an additional 2.3 million pounds for the Summer Food Nutrition Program. Subtract that, and the 2010 figure becomes 23 million pounds -- up 49 percent from what the bank gave out in 2007. So, do the poundage figures mean hunger in the area shot up 49 percent or more over the past few years? J.C. Dwyer of the Texas Food Bank Network, the state association of food banks, told us pounds of food distributed generally isn't the best measure of need in a food bank's region: "It’s more of a metric for how we’re dealing with the needs," Dwyer said. A better way of gauging needs, he said, is to track the number of residents requesting food assistance. That is, the amount of food distributed doesn't necessarily reflect ups and downs in need. In the holiday season, donations and distributions surge, for instance, but that doesn’t necessarily mean surges in need. Dwyer and Turner each suggested we check on changes in food demands through "Hunger in America," a report commissioned every four years by Feeding America, a national charity that acts as a clearinghouse connecting food supplies to 200 food banks, including the one in Austin. There was no "Hunger in America" report for 2007, the first year in Doggett’s statement, but the reports based on surveys in 2005 and 2009 were broken down into smaller reports covering the Austin bank’s 21-county region: In 2005, the Capital Area bank fed an estimated 174,900 people. In 2009, the estimated number of people served was 284,900 for the year, up 63 percent from those who were served in 2005. That change outstripped population growth, according to U.S. census estimates. In 2005, the 21 counties had 2,265,981 residents. By 2009, the region’s population was 2,547,559 -- up 12.4 percent. Put another way, the food bank provided sustenance to nearly 8 percent of the region’s residents in 2005 while about 11 percent of a greater total of residents got food in 2009. Finally, we wondered if Doggett was correct in saying the food aid went to the poor alone. Turner told us the bank does not question people who come seeking food as to their income -- if you show up, you are fed, he said, though depending on the lines that form, it could take an hour or two. However, the "Hunger in America" report using 2009 data states that 73 percent of the Capital Area food bank’s clients had incomes below the federal poverty level. Census figures for 2010, drawing on 2009 data, show that poverty in the 21-county region matched the percentage for Texas overall: Seventeen percent of residents had income below the federal poverty level. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Dwyer told us, "food insecurity" across Texas -- the percentage of households at risk of missing meals because of financial pressure -- rose from 14.8 percent in the three-year period 2005-07 to 18.8 percent in 2008-10. Our conclusion: Changes in the amount of food distributed over several years, which Doggett cited, might not be the best way to gauge changes in residents’ needs. That said, the number of Central Texas requestors for food aid over those years outpaced regional population growth. The 63 percent increase in requestors also exceeded the 50-percent increase in food distributed that he stressed, though, contrary to his statement, not all those pounds of food went to "the poor." We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2011-11-01T06:00:00	2011-09-21	['None']
pomt-06943	"Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/19/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-said-economy-has-grown-or-been-dam/	Nobody opposes tax increases quite like Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. For example, comedian Stephen Colbert recently asked Norquist what he would do if terrorists kidnapped all of our grandmothers and threatened to kill them with fire ants. Their ransom demand? Tax increases on the wealthiest 2 percent of all Americans. Would Norquist give in? "I think we console ourself with the fact that we have pictures," he said. He was kidding, right? It's hard to tell. In a more serious vein, Norquist was interviewed on July 13, 2011, by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, who also asked Norquist about taxes on wealthy Americans. "John Paulson, who's a hedge fund manager, he made last year $4.9 billion. Billion with a 'B.' Not million but $4.9 billion. And a big chunk of that income was taxed at 15 percent, not the maximum 35 percent, because it was seen as some sort of capital gains or whatever. Is that fair?" Blitzer asked. "Well, certainly the Democrats have been arguing to raise the capital gains tax on all Americans. Obama says he wants to do that," Norquist said. "That would slow down economic growth. It's not necessarily helpful to the economy. Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged. It's one of those taxes that most clearly damages economic growth and jobs." We decided to check Norquist's claim on capital gains taxes. We contacted his organization, Americans for Tax Reform, but we didn't hear back. What are capital gains taxes? If your only income is normal wages, you've probably never paid them. But here's how they work: When you sell an asset, such as a share of stock, for a profit, that profit is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the taxpayer's income and the length of the investment. But most long-term capital gains are taxed at 15 percent, less than many people pay in income taxes. (The top income tax rate is now 35 percent.) The idea is that a lower tax rate encourages investment and economic growth. Blitzer, though, was talking about a loophole that allows compensation paid to investment fund managers, including hedge fund managers, to be treated as capital gains, not income. Over the years, capital gains taxes have gone up and down, providing lots of fodder for economic analysis. They increased in 1986 under President Ronald Reagan, decreased under President Bill Clinton in 1997 and decreased under President George W. Bush in 2003. We should note that these changes have taken place as part of packages of other tax cuts and tax increases, usually alongside changes to income tax rates. We decided to compare charts of annual economic growth rates compared with capital gains tax rates to see what we would find. In one column, we listed the percentage growth using inflation-adjusted numbers for the Gross Domestic Product as compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the other column, we included the maximum tax rate for long-term capital gains taxes, as compiled by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, going back to 1977. The Tax Policy Center's rates tend to be just a bit higher than statutory rates because it accounts for other parts of the tax code that interacted with the capital gains tax rate. We noted exceptions in 1982 (tax rates were lower, but the economy declined); in 1987 (tax rates increased, but the economy still grew); and in 1993 (tax rates increased slightly, and the economy still grew.) We looked for other research on the issue and found that Troy Kravitz and Leonard Burman put Norquist’s contention to the test in a simple study published in the respected nonpartisan journal Tax Notes in 2005. They looked at changes to capital gains taxes and compared them with both to stock market performance and overall economic growth. They found a weak relationship between tax changes and the stock market, but virtually no correlation to overall economic growth, measured by gross domestic product (GDP). "Capital gains rates display no contemporaneous correlation with real GDP growth during the last 50 years," they noted. They also tested whether the tax changes had any delayed effects, testing lags up to five years, but found no statistically significant effect. On the issue of stock market growth, they noted that pension funds and foreign investors don't pay capital gains taxes the same way that individual investors do. "Thus, capital gains tax rates can increase significantly, as they did following the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and have little apparent effect on the stock market," the report said. "Likewise, the stock market can fluctuate even when rates remain unchanged." We consulted a number of tax policy experts who considered the study sound and knew of no evidence to contradict it. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analysis agency for the U.S. Congress, compiled research on capital gains taxes and concluded that reductions to capital gains taxes are "unlikely to have much effect" on economic growth. "A tax reduction on capital gains would mostly benefit very high income taxpayers, who are likely to save most of any tax reduction," the report said. Does this mean reductions in capital gains taxes don't cause the economy to grow? We asked Burman, who conducted the Tax Notes study and is the author of The Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed. "It doesn't rule out that there could be a connection," he said. But in practice, he said, "It's as likely to do damage as to help." That's because when the capital gains tax rate is lower than that of regular income, people look for ways to avoid taxes by converting regular income to capital gains income -- just as Blitzer's question suggested. In our queries of tax experts, we found a wide difference of opinion on the capital gains tax itself. Here's the "pro" view, from economist J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation: "I believe capital gains taxation is a uniquely powerful tool for good or evil in terms of economic growth because it strikes at the heart of the most productive, transformational forms of investment. What kind of investment is that? Long-term, high risk investment. So changes in the tax treatment either way doesn't turn the economic world on a dime. It's a powerful influence, but not one that can be reliably sifted from the data either way." Alternatively, here's the "con" view from David Rosenbloom, a tax law professor at New York University: "The best tax policy would not have a difference as between capital gains and ordinary income because there is no compelling reason for any such distinction, and it enormously complicates the Internal Revenue Code. We had such a best policy, briefly, following passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, in Reagan's second term. Everything was taxed at a top rate of 28 percent (with a few minor deviations). Does Norquist think that was so bad? For heaven's sake, why? And we have had extraordinarily low rates on capital gains since the first years of the Bush II Administartion (and still have them today). Does Norquist think the economy has done splendidly during the ensuing years? What have I missed?" Getting back to Norquist's statement, he said, "Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged." Clearly, he intends that as a statement of causation. But the analysis of Kravitz and Burman rebuts that. They found no evidence of a connection between actual economic growth and changes in capital gains tax rates. The actual effect of capital gains tax rates remains a hotly contested issue. We rate Norquist's statement False.	None	Grover Norquist	None	None	None	2011-07-19T17:42:00	2011-07-13	['None']

pomt-00531	The Confederate battle flag at the South Carolina statehouse "must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/21/jean-casarez/flying-confederate-battle-flag-south-carolina-half/	The massacre of nine African-Americans at a Charleston, S.C., church June 17 has renewed calls to remove a Confederate battle flag flying at the South Carolina statehouse. The NAACP, which has long requested the flag’s removal from a monument to Confederate soldiers at the statehouse in Columbia, reiterated its call this week, joined by countless politicians and almost 400,000 petitioners. Hundreds marched June 21 in South Carolina cities to protest the flag remaining unfurled on government property. One of the oddities is that while the U.S. and South Carolina flags are flying at half-staff, the Confederate flag remains at full-staff. CNN reporter Jean Casarez explained the situation to viewers on June 21. "By law, it must fly at a height of 30 feet," she said. "Any changes — taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done — must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly." We’ve seen many versions of this claim, so we wanted to give it a closer look. South Carolina’s Code of Laws allows the governor to order the lowering of the state and U.S. flags flying atop the capitol building to half-staff, which Gov. Nikki Haley has done. But according to her spokesperson, it’s the Legislature, not the governor, who has the legal authority to alter the Confederate flag. Title 1 Chapter 10 of state law spells it out: "The flag authorized to be flown at a designated location on the grounds of the Capitol Complex is the South Carolina Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag must be flown on a flagpole located at a point on the south side of the Confederate Soldier Monument, centered on the monument, 10 feet from the base of the monument at a height of 30 feet." "The provisions of this section may only be amended or repealed upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly." The two-thirds vote applies to both permanent changes and temporary adjustments alike, according to the Democratic State Rep. James E. Smith, who doubts the law’s constitutionality and who’s been working on removing the flag since it was first moved to the grounds. The Confederate flag has been displayed at its current location since 2000, when the state passed the Heritage Act, a compromise that removed the flag from its place of sovereignty atop the capitol but allowed it to remain on the grounds. (The same piece of legislation also requires a two-third's vote by the General Assembly to make changes to Civil Rights monuments.) While the flag can be lowered physically, no one we spoke to could recall a time -- be it Memorial Day or 9/11 -- when it wasn’t flying at full-staff. "It’s not a flag of sovereignty, it’s a veterans’ battle flag. … Should that flag be on the dome, which it should, it would be lowered, but it’s not," said Thomas Leland Summers, commander of the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who noted that the Confederate flag wasn’t lowered to honor Civil War anniversaries. Smith, a Democratic state lawmaker, agreed, but also said: "That’s beside the point. It shouldn’t be flying anyway. If we were to lower it, it would give it the status of a sovereign flag, a status greater than it deserves. It should just be furled." Republican State Rep. Norman "Doug" Brannon told MSNBC on June 19 that he plans to sponsor a bill to remove the flag in the next legislative session. Most likely, Brannon won’t be the only one, said Statehouse Report editor and publisher Andy Brack. (Smith says he wants to do better than supermajority, he’d like a unanimous vote.) "These deaths — especially of one of their own (Democratic State Sen. Clementa Pinckney) — might be the best chance in a decade to get the flag out of a place of prominence," Brack said. "If the issue becomes a hot-button issue — so hot that legislators fear they'll lose their seats or face a challenger in the primaries for doing nothing — they could move promptly. They moved with the legislative equivalent of light speed after the death of Walter Scott in April and by June passed a bill to help pay for body cameras for police." "The atmosphere is changing it appears," said Don Gordon, political science professor at Furman University in Greenville. "The attempts to remove the flag from visibility off Gervais Street in front of the Capital may gain traction. The pictures on the shooter's Last Rhodesian website and the clearly racist message some feel have moved the flag from a symbol of heritage to one of blatant hate, a shifting symbolism." Our ruling A CNN reporter said, "By law, (the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol) must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the general assembly." In 2000, South Carolina passed legislation that mandated the flag’s location, a height of 30 feet, and a supermajority vote to make any changes. The Confederate flag has never been removed or, to our knowledge, lowered since it was raised on the Confederate Soldiers’ Monument on the capitol grounds. We rate this claim True.

pomt-03457	"Immigrants are more fertile."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/18/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-immigrants-are-more-fertile/	The aging of America draws a lot of attention as the country tries to control the rising cost of health care and sustain critical programs such as Social Security. Jeb Bush, former Republican governor of Florida and potential 2016 presidential candidate, has a partial solution -- promote immigration. Bush, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington, made a pitch for immigration reform, saying America needs more new workers to help pay for retirees -- "to rebuild the demographic pyramid" as he put it. "Immigrants are more fertile," Bush said. "And they love families and they have more intact families, and they bring a younger population. Immigrants create an engine of economic prosperity." Bush’s reference to the fertility of immigrants stirred up an immediate flurry of activity on Twitter and the comment sections of news websites. Some said his words were callous, some said he was simply speaking the truth. We decided to take an evidence-based look into the fertility of immigrants. The key here is understanding the meaning of the word "fertile." Fertility can mean the ability to have children, but it can also refer to the birth rate of a population. In context, Bush's comments clearly referred to the second definition. We contacted Bush’s office; his spokesperson, Jaryn Emhoff, told us Bush was referring to birth rate. On that front, there is no debate about the numbers. The Pew Research Center reported in 2012 that the birth rate among foreign-born women was nearly 50 percent higher than for U.S.-born women -- 87.8 births per 1,000 women compared with 58.9 births per 1,000 women of prime child bearing age (15-44). A major reason why immigrant birth rates are higher has to do with the age of new arrivals; as a group, they skew young, which means more of them are likely to be ready to start families. If you looked at a group of foreign-born women and the same number of U.S.-born women, all between 15 and 44 years old, you would find more women closer to 20 years old among the immigrants. However, the Pew report noted an important trend. While birth rates for all women dropped between 2007 and 2010, it fell much faster among immigrant women. It declined by 14 percent compared with 6 percent for women born in America. Analysts differ on what is driving this change, and the debate has some bearing on Bush’s main interest in promoting immigration. The Pew researchers believe the data shows that these women are simply not having children. An alternative explanation is that there are fewer young immigrant women. Emilio Parrado, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, leans towards that one. Parrado said that the data tell him that the real reason for the drop in the immigrant birth rate is the recession. With fewer jobs in America, fewer people had the incentive to come. "There are no new entrants," Parrado said. "The immigrants who are already in the U.S. have already completed their family size, so they are no longer having kids and rates are declining." This debate has significant implications for Bush’s argument on immigration. If birth rates for immigrants continue to drop, then immigration reform as a way to rebalance the country’s age distribution is not simply a matter of creating a legal option for those who are already here. It requires a steady influx of newcomers. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that opposes high levels of immigration, said it is easy to overstate the benefits of attracting people from other countries. He noted that the children of foreign-born women still represent a significantly smaller slice of all births. This shows up in the data. The overall birth rate in the Pew report is 64 per 1,000 -- for U.S.-born women it is 58.9. "Immigrants do pull up the average but not by very much," Camarota said. To really change the birth rate, Camarota said a much larger number of immigrants would be needed. We should also note that it’s not a good idea to lump all immigrants together. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the country of origin can have a big impact on fertility rates. For mothers from Mexico, the rate is 77; that jumps by about a third for people from Central and South America. For mothers from Asia, the rate is 59 per 1,000. In addition, rates can change from one generation to the next. A paper presented at the Population Association of America 2013 conference found significant shifts among first-, second- and third-generation immigrant families. In terms of the number of children a woman will have in her lifetime, fertility falls steadily among Asians, from 1.84 in the first generation to 1.3 by the third. In contrast, Hispanic women show a dramatic decline from the first to second generation -- 2.41 to 1.9. But in the third generation, the number rises to 2.1. Our ruling Bush said that immigrants are more fertile and the data back him up. National statistics show that birth rates among foreign-born residents are about 50 percent higher than for U.S.-born women. However, the rates are converging, they vary widely among immigrant groups and over the years, the rates change. Still, Bush’s words were on track, and we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05355	Says George Flinn has been a "no show" at scheduled "forums."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/may/11/charlotte-bergmann/gop-2010-nominee-congress-says-george-flinn-confir/	When is a no-show not a no-show? That’s at issue in an ongoing contretemps between the Charlotte Bergmann and George Flinn campaigns for the Republican nomination for the 9th Congressional District. Bergmann, the 2010 GOP nominee who got 25 percent of the vote in her loss to incumbent Democrat Steve Cohen, contends Flinn was a "no show" at recent scheduled "forums." In a press release in early April, Bergmann said that Flinn "has been invited to forums where he can make his case for his bid for office, he confirms his attendance, then does not show." In the paragraph following that assertion, Bergmann asks where Flinn was in the previous 30 days when she attended meetings of the Republican Women of Purpose, the Shelby County Republican Women, the Collierville Republican Club, and the East Shelby Republican Club. The clear implication is that those were forums where Flinn confirmed and was a no-show. We decided to determine whether Flinn, a former Shelby County commissioner who spent $3.5 million in finishing third for the 8th Congressional District nomination in 2010, did in fact duck those events and others Bergmann’s campaign subsequently said he missed with the Midtown Republicans on March 27 and two events it called "forums" -- on April 12 at The Cupboard restaurant and on April 27 at Tom Lee Park. Is it true that Flinn, a wealthy Memphis radiologist and radio station magnate, confirmed his attendance then did "not show" up to various events for Shelby County Republicans? We asked Bergmann’s campaign for the specifics of the events at issue and campaign manager Randy Lawson provided details. Then we checked in with the presumably jilted hosts of the events and with Flinn’s campaign. Republican Women of Purpose spokeswoman Mary Jane Anderson of Germantown emailed us: "After checking the records, I will tell you that this did not happen." She said Flinn spoke to the group when he was running for the 8th Congressional District seat in 2010 but "other than that, Dr. Flinn has not been invited to speak at our meetings." Shelby County Republican Women’s Club president Debbie Stamson said she couldn’t recall whether Flinn attended the club’s luncheon in March but was on hand at both its April 10 and May 8 luncheons. In April, she said, "we didn’t really have a speaker because we had a fashion show." As for whether he confirmed his attendance in advance by making a reservation, Stamson said she couldn’t say. But he wasn’t a no-show; he was there. Stamson made another curious observation: "Normally, she (Bergmann) comes to our meetings. She was not there April 10." Collierville Republican Club president and Collierville vice mayor Tony Sarwar, who owns the restaurant where the group meets, said, "we’ve never had a situation when Dr. Flinn ever cancelled out on us or was ever supposed to be . . . the main speaker for the evening and cancel on us. . . . As far as I recall, I think Dr. Flinn has been there less than a handful of times." But Flinn’s campaign manager, Kristi Stanley made two salient points: first, the Collierville club’s March 20 meeting agenda dealt with school board issues, not Congressional races; and second, Collierville (like Germantown) is actually no longer in the newly redrawn 9th Congressional District. East Shelby Republican Club president Arnold Weiner, who will be a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Tampa this summer, said he would not take sides in the Bergmann-Flinn contest. Told that all he was being asked to confirm was whether Flinn had been invited to speak to his group and had not shown up, Weiner said: "No." And added: "We’re going to have a candidate forum in July. But there’s never been anything -- official forum -- where he has been a no-show." Stanley says Flinn regrets a conflict prevented him from addressing the Midtown Republican Club on March 27, but notified the club in advance that he would not be there. The campaign sent consultant Gene Bryan to speak in Flinn’s behalf to the Midtowners. Lawson said Bergmann also did not attend that event and sent a surrogate -- because the campaign learned, before the event, that Flinn would not attend. As for the noon forum at The Cupboard forum on April 12, Stanley says the campaign never received an invitation. Members of the news media, however, were informed of the event by email on April 10, so it’s likely Flinn’s people were at least aware of it. A back room of the restaurant was reserved by Bergmann’s campaign manager for a private party of 20, records show, and that gathering did occur, according to Cupboard manager Darla Morgan. A video of the April 27 event at Tom Lee Park captures the drama of the session in which a squawking rubber chicken in a folding chair stands in for Flinn. Again, Stanley said Flinn never received an invitation and said her review of the video indicates the "debate" didn’t have a sponsor; it was a Bergmann campaign media event. "Did they plan on us not being there, so they brought the rubber chicken?" she asks. The video shows the moderator, Bartlett City Alderman David Parsons, asking both Bergmann and the rubber chicken about jobs, energy and "restoring liberty," with the Mississippi River and the Arkansas shoreline as backdrop. In Bergmann’s remarks, she said, among other things, that she was looking forward to going "toe-to-toe" in the House Chamber’s well with 21-year veteran California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. At the end of the video event, Parsons says, "I’d like to thank all the listening audience out there for participating today and joining us down here at Tom Lee Park." But, in the course of the "debate," the camera scanning the park and bluff beyond where an audience should be visible shows no one there. Who Parsons was thanking is a mystery since an audience, in this case, was the no show. Parsons has not responded to email and voicemail messages seeking clarification. Our ruling Charlotte Bergmann’s 9th Congressional District campaign claims that George Flinn, her Republican primary opponent, has a pattern of confirming his attendance at partisan forums and then not showing up, and is seeking to label him a "chicken," unwilling to debate. But the evidence shows Flinn has either attended events or sent his regrets in advance. We rate Bergmann’s claim False.	None	Charlotte Bergmann	None	None	None	2012-05-11T06:00:00	2012-04-10	['None']

pomt-00442	"Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/aug/22/unite-here-florida-pac/florida-governors-race-ad-attacks-gwen-graham-mega/	Democrat Gwen Graham is facing attacks for her family’s role in the American Dream mega-mall project in Miami. Unite Here Florida PAC, a union group that represents service industry workers, launched a TV ad that refers to the Graham family and the project as "their controversial mega-mall." "Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall," says the text of the ad. "60 percent of the jobs at the American Dream Mall will be low-wage. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion." The ad is running in advance of the Aug. 28 primary for governor. A union associated with the PAC has endorsed Philip Levine, one of Graham’s Democratic rivals. Levine said he is against the development, citing low-wage jobs and traffic. The ad overstates the role of Graham and her family in the project, and more context is needed about the low-wage jobs and impact on wildlife and traffic. The PAC sent us information from local news reports, as well as county records about the project. American Dream Miami mall project Graham Companies is involved in the mall project. But Graham has not served on the board for the company since she won elected office, and her family is not the project developer. When Graham started in Congress in 2015, she stepped down from the company and put all of her assets in a transparent trust. Graham owns about $13.7 million million in company stock, and made about $830,000 in income in 2017, according to her financial disclosure. Her campaign spokesman said she owns less than 1 percent of voting stock. Graham said if the state had to act on the project and she were governor, she would recuse herself and let her elected counterparts on the Cabinet make decisions. Graham has emphasized that her family isn’t the developer. "My family is not building a mall. Period. End of story," she said during a forum in Jacksonville. It’s true that her family isn’t building the mall, but approximately 80 acres owned by the Graham Companies is under contract for purchase by the American Dream developers, said Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, the developer’s lobbyist. That piece of land is a little less than half of the 174-acre project. Triple Five, the company that developed Minnesota's Mall of America, wants to build the $4 billion mall project, which includes an indoor ski slope, hotel and a submarine lake. The project between Interstate 75 and Florida’s Turnpike in northwest Miami-Dade County is expected to draw 30 million visitors a year. Diaz de la Portilla said the amount of money the Graham Companies will receive from the land sale is confidential. Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate research analyst who isn’t involved in the project, estimated that the 80 acres would sell for between $2.4 million and $6.5 million. The Graham Companies is also planning to build a mixed-used development on 300 acres south of the mall. In May, the Miami-Dade County Commission voted in favor of zoning approval for the mall. In July, the South Florida Regional Planning Council voted against the project but that is largely symbolic because the county and the state have authority. It still has to go through several other approvals before it is built. "Poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion." County records show the American Dream will create about 14,530 permanent full-time jobs. About 64 percent of those workers would earn less than $25,000 a year. The federal poverty guideline is $25,100 for a family of four. For an individual it is $12,140. Diaz de la Portilla said the developer projects 25,000 permanent direct and indirect jobs based on the developer’s experience at other malls. He said the county used a specific model to project a range of direct jobs of 9,236 to 22,331. The project has drawn criticism from environmentalists, such as the Sierra Club and Everglades Trust. The trust endorsed Graham in spite of it. "While we are fighting like the dickens to ensure the survival of the Everglades and the source of drinking water for eight million Floridians, mega-developers and projects like these continue to put it all at risk," said Everglades Trust executive director Kimberly Mitchell. The county staff analysis, which recommended approval, stated that the site contains wetlands. It also stated that the site is within the core foraging area of wood stork colonies and may provide habitat and/or foraging areas for several threatened and endangered animal species. The county’s environmental resources department drafted provisions within the development agreement related to stormwater management, natural resources and endangered species, Diaz de la Portilla said. The project is expected to generate 70,000 vehicle trips a day. Diaz de la Portilla said that the developer has to mitigate the impacts on the environment and the traffic, which includes spending more than $200 million on road infrastructure and public transportation. He said that the site has been inside the county’s Urban Development Boundary for over a decade. Our ruling A Unite Here Florida TV ad said, "Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion." The ad was imprecise when it said that her family’s company is "behind the American Dream Mall." That could create a misleading impression that her family is developing the mall. Her family owns about 80 acres which is under contract for the developer, less than half of the future mall site. We don’t know how much Graham and her family will earn from the sale of the land, which is under contract, but one real estate analyst told us the sale could be for millions of dollars. Graham’s financial disclosure shows she owned $13.7 million in stock in the Graham Companies in 2017. Graham has not been on the board of her family's company since she won elected office. About two-thirds of the permanent jobs will pay less than $25,000. That is the federal poverty guideline for a family of four, but more than twice the poverty level for an individual. Plans show that the development site includes habitats for threatened and endangered species and will add to traffic in the area. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-00448	"Cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/20/blog-posting/washington-redskins-werent-stranded-police-game/	An online story says the Washington Redskins had an unplanned locker room slumber party. The article’s headline reads, "Cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight." Clickbait site Universaleinfo posted the story on Aug. 5. It says that Redskins players knelt during the national anthem, angering the police officers providing security at the game. The cops decided to stage a counter-protest: they got down on one knee, yelled "blue lives matter" and then left the team in the locker room. Unable to get past the angry fans outside, the players were stuck all night. The Universaleinfo article was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s a compelling story, aside from the fact none of it happened. The timeline NFL protests have been in the national spotlight since 2016, when Colin Kaepernick, former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, knelt during the anthem to oppose police brutality. Since then, over 200 players throughout the league have chosen to kneel or sit in protest. Protests spiked in September 2017, when President Donald Trump encouraged NFL owners to fire players who didn’t stand for the anthem. Two days after Trump spoke against Kaepernick, some Redskins players knelt before their game. Since then, there have been no reports of Redskins players refusing to stand during the anthem. The Universaleinfo article was posted on Aug. 5, 2018. It says that the Redskins knelt before their game on "Monday night" in Philadelphia. Aug. 5 was a Sunday, so previous Monday would have been six days before, on July 30. The Redskins did not play a game on July 30. In fact, they hadn’t even started pre-season yet. The article also said that the Philadelphia Police Department released a statement after the incident, but there were no recent press releases about the Redskins online. A spokesperson for the Redskins confirmed that there was no game on July 30. As far as we can tell, this article was entirely fabricated. The origin Where did this article come from, if not any actual news sites? It seems to be a repeat of a hoax from October 2017. An identical article was posted on Freedum Junkshun, a satire site meant to anger conservatives. The article is "a boatload of bullhonkey," according to the disclaimer at the bottom of the Freedum Junkshun page. The related articles linked on the page are more of the same: football teams across the country, being punished in creative ways for not standing during the anthem. Our ruling Universaleinfo posted an article that claimed, "cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight." None of the dates or information in the article match up to reality. This article is copied directly from a satire site and presented as though it was true. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

ranz-00018	Only seven people have been imprisoned this year for possession of marijuana.	fact	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201858175/fact-or-fiction-all-just-spin	Jacinda Ardern has stated in the first two leaders debates that under a Labour government, people wouldn’t be locked up for smoking cannabis. During The Spinoff’s debate Paula Bennett claimed that only seven people were currently in prison for possessing the drug. The New Zealand Drug Foundation (via Twitter) confirmed that the numbers were indeed correct. The foundation based this on information obtained from the Department of Corrections through a recent official information request, which shows an average of seven people per year are imprisoned for possession of marijuana (as their only offence). It is unlikely that all seven are in prison at one time. About 150 people were imprisoned in 2016 with a cannabis charge (possession for supply, etc) as their most serious offence. Neither Mrs Bennett nor Ms Ardern mentioned overall (non-custodial) convictions for cannabis, which number in the thousands each year.

pomt-06671	Says Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin ranks "as the most liberal member of the House."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/09/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-democratic-rep-tamm/	Until U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., announced her 2012 candidacy for the U.S. Senate, her campaign website displayed a 2006 news article that began with the words: "Rep. Tammy Baldwin, one of the most liberal members of Congress." Evidently, Baldwin’s congressional re-election campaign wasn’t concerned about the candidate being cast as one of the most left-wing members of the U.S. House. Certainly Baldwin’s critics aren’t shy about portraying her in that way. On Sept. 6, 2011, the day Baldwin announced her run for the seat being vacated by Democrat Herb Kohl, Republican Tommy Thompson’s team weighed in. Darrin Schmitz, a consultant to the former Wisconsin governor and likely Senate candidate, issued a statement that said: "Tammy Baldwin is a classic tax-and-spend liberal, and her ranking as the most liberal member of the House puts her clearly out of the mainstream of Wisconsin voters." So does Baldwin, who has served in the House since 1999, rank as its most liberal member? As evidence, Thompson cited a 2010 ranking of House members by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine and website. Baldwin tied with six other House members for the most liberal. The rankings were based on what the journal judged to be 93 votes taken in 2010 that showed "ideological distinctions between members." The largest number -- 59 votes -- were on economic issues. So in one rating system, seven House members, including Baldwin, were rated the most liberal. Let’s look at other major rankings: American Conservative Union The American Conservative Union says it promotes economic growth through lower taxes and reduced government spending, as well as liberty, personal responsibility, traditional values and national security." The organization said its 2010 rankings were based on 24 votes taken in 2010 that created a "clear ideological distinction" among House members. The American Conservative Union had urged House members to vote, for example, against extending long-term unemployment benefits, for ending moratoriums on offshore drilling and against the repeal of the military don’t ask-don’t tell policy. Baldwin’s rating: Zero on a scale of zero to 100, which the organization called a "perfect liberalism score." That certainly puts Baldwin at the extreme end of the spectrum. But it’s also less of a distinction than it might appear: Baldwin was among 150 House members who received that score. Americans for Democratic Action Americans for Democratic Action is an organization that says it is "committed to liberal politics, liberal policies and a liberal future." It ranks lawmakers based on their votes on what the group considers the 20 most important votes of the year. In 2010, the group urged House members to vote for measures such as health care reform, the extension of long-term unemployment benefits and repeal of don’t ask-don’t tell. Baldwin’s liberal rating on the 2010 list: 100 percent. Again, this ranking marks Baldwin as an extreme liberal, but it didn’t exactly single her out. Baldwin was among 49 House members who received a perfect score. Voteview.com Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists, uses a complicated calculation based on patterns of how often each member of Congress votes with other members, and then plots them on a liberal-conservative spectrum. Voteview is different in that members are ranked based on the entire time they have served in the House. Voteview’s latest rankings are for the 111th Congress -- members who served during the 2009-2010 session. Baldwin’s ranking: 19th most liberal. (Note: After our item was posted, researchers with the group were able to pull out just the votes from the most recent session. Based on those votes, Baldwin would be tied for 12th most liberal.) Asked about Thompson’s attack, Baldwin campaign spokesman Phil Walzak dismissed the various rankings as "just one group or organization's opinion based on its own selected criteria." He also cited four votes that he said show Baldwin supports the middle class. But four votes don’t go far in refuting the claim and the issue wasn’t whether Baldwin supported the middle class. Our conclusion Thompson says Baldwin, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2012, ranks "as the most liberal member" of the House of Representatives. He singled her out as being more liberal than any of the other 434 members. One ranking puts Baldwin as the 19th most liberal. But that ranking covers her entire House career, and Thompson’s claim refers to the present. Three other major rankings -- one liberal, one conservative and one nonpartisan -- all ranked Baldwin as being among a group of House members considered the most liberal in 2010, the most recent period available. But she was not singled out as being the most liberal in any of the rankings. We rate Thompson’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-02605	Deer baiting, planned for Block Island by DEM, is illegal in Rhode Island.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/26/richard-august/gun-commentator-says-technique-rhode-island-plans-/	Nothing gets under people's skin like the government engaging in activity that is illegal for everyone else, such as when Congress passes laws and then exempts itself from them. On Jan. 12, 2014, in a letter to The Providence Journal, Richard August, co-host of the WHJJ radio show "Lock, Stock and Daria," asserted that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management would be doing exactly that if it carries out its plan to hire professional hunters to cull the deer population on Block Island. According to the plan, the hunters would use feeding stations to lure the deer. "Baiting deer happens to be illegal in Rhode Island," August wrote. "But I guess if you are the state, the laws don’t apply." We wondered what the law actually said. First, some background. Block Island, officially known as New Shoreham, is overrun by deer -- an estimated 800 to 1,000 on the 9.5-square mile island. The town and the DEM have agreed on a plan to hire a Connecticut firm to reduce the population to 150 or fewer over the next four years. Corn bait will be used to lure deer to 15 to 20 sites on the southwestern part of the island. Sharpshooters perched on raised platforms will shoot the deer. Their goal for this winter is to kill about 200, beginning in the last week of February. The carcasses will be carved into venison using a mobile meat processing service based in Maine. The meat will be offered first to Block Island residents; the rest will be distributed to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank and other hunger programs. Going back to August's claim, the "Deer Hunting" section of state law says the DEM can adopt rules and regulations on deer hunting in Rhode Island but, "In any event, the following prohibitions and restrictions shall always apply to deer hunting:" Paragraph 6 says, "No person shall make, set, or use any trap or snare, or salt lick or other device for the purpose of ensnaring, enticing, taking, injuring, or killing a deer." When we asked the DEM about this, the department released a statement through spokeswoman Gail Mastrati saying that the rule only applies to "recreational hunting." That's not what the DEM would be doing, she said. "The bait and shoot deer reduction project on Block Island, authorized under emergency regulations filed by DEM on Nov. 7, 2013, to address a serious problem on the island, is not a recreational hunting activity," her statement said. "A bait and shoot deer reduction effort is very different from recreational hunting. The knowledge of animal behavior and the discipline and skills in marksmanship are more sophisticated and strategic than those necessary to be a successful recreational deer hunter." The "deer hunting" section of state law does not make any distinction between recreational and non-recreational hunting. We asked the DEM about that. The department responded in an email: "Hunting regulations do not apply to the deer culling operation because it is not a hunting activity. Rather, it is a wildlife management action authorized under DEM's statutory authority." We'll leave it up to others to debate whether the culling of the island’s deer herd is really a hunt and, if so, whether the state’s hunting laws should apply to the DEM. (We should note, for example, that most of us have no problem with agents of the state, such as police officers, ignoring traffic signals or speed limits when chasing criminals.) But when Richard August asserts that state law makes it illegal for hunters to use bait to lure deer, which is what the DEM plans to do when it stages a mass shooting of deer, he is correct. We rate the claim True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-05514	"[O]ver 200,000 ordinary citizens were given the opportunity to identify projects they preferred."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/13/metro-atlanta-voter-education-network/group-200000-given-chance-sound-tax/	A new mailer about a referendum to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta makes it appear as if voters had a hand in this plan to raise their taxes. Voters will decide July 31 whether they want to pay a 1 percent sales tax to build an estimated $7.2 billion worth of roads, highway interchanges, mass transit infrastructure and other projects to ease traffic in a region that’s choking on it. More than two dozen local leaders spent months hammering out that list of projects through state-created regional roundtables. The mailer, which appeared in a PolitiFact Georgia reporter’s home mailbox April 3, said the average Joe had a say, too. "[O]ver 200,000 ordinary citizens were given the opportunity to identify projects they preferred," it said. It’s enough to make a populist swoon. But 200,000 people? Is that even possible? PolitiFact Georgia called up the Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network, which sent out the mailer on the proposed transportation special local option tax, or T-SPLOST. The nonprofit’s mission is to educate voters about the referendum. A MAVEN spokeswoman said the Atlanta Regional Commission, the region’s planning agency, contacted 1.3 million residents last year for telephone town hall meetings about the plan. Part of ARC’s mission is public outreach, so it regularly tallies the number of residents it involves, spokeswoman Julie Ralston said. Our research shows ARC has a track record for doing so. It counted residents who participated in Plan 2040, which identified transportation projects the region will need in the next three decades. It posted numbers on the project’s website. T-SPLOST’s website, news accounts and ARC news releases chronicle the series of 10 evening telephone town hall meetings in June. ARC contracted with Telephone TownHall Meeting, a Denver-area company that uses Web and telephone technology to hold virtual meetings. Members of Congress often use the meetings to connect with voters back home. Telephone TownHall Meeting owner Curt Cerveny told us how the meetings typically work: The company calls tens of thousands of land lines and cellphones for their target households. Some numbers don’t work. Others send the call to voicemail or a fax machine. Sometimes, people hang up. About 15 percent to 20 percent of the time, someone picks up and listens in for at least one minute, Cerveny said. Usually, listeners spend eight to 10 minutes on the line. The T-SPLOST town halls attempted to reach 1.3 million registered voters, an ARC report said. The town halls took place by county. "It was the biggest call we had ever done," Cerveny said. "It was kind of ahead of its time." Some 134,400 households participated. They stayed on the line for an average of 10.59 minutes. Presenters took 213 live questions. (This PolitiFact Georgia scribe received one of those calls on her cellphone. She was in her car, stuck in gridlock.) This number does not include calls that went to voicemail. These households received messages telling voters how they can have a say in the project. The report did not state the number of listeners per call. This amounts to about 10 percent participation, or slightly less than what Cerveny said was typical. ARC launched other outreach efforts. In March and April 2011, 126 residents of the affected counties participated in a series of 12 focus groups. In July, about 200 attended a 3 ½-hour town hall meeting. In September, 12 public meetings were attended by about 1,700 people, according to ARC meeting notes. An online survey generated 9,600 responses. Interested residents could also consult the project’s website, www.atlantaregionalroundtable.com. Local governments and private organizations also conducted their own outreach. ARC collaborated with more than 80 of them to get the word out, Ralston said. One is the Livable Communities Coalition, an Atlanta nonprofit that works on regional growth strategies. A "very conservative" estimate is that its efforts reached 5,000 people, said Jim Stokes, the group’s interim executive director. To conclude: Since ARC tried to reach 1.3 million people through its telephone town halls and managed to get about 10 percent of them, we think it’s safe to say that more than 200,000 were "given the opportunity" to participate. In addition, some 20,000 participated in meetings, online surveys and other outreach efforts organized by the planning agency. Local governments and other organizations performed outreach as well. This is a lot of "ordinary citizens," but their influence had limits. The decision rested with the regional roundtable. Members could accept -- or ignore -- public comments as they saw fit. That said, MAVEN’s mailer stopped short of saying that these voters controlled the process. Furthermore, its participation estimate is conservative. Its statement earns our highest rating -- True.

pomt-10956	"[The] unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/jul/23/mike-pence/record-low-unemployment-philly-area-pence-right-so/	Vice President Mike Pence is in Philadelphia on Monday to speak about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and attend a fundraiser for U.S. Senate candidate Lou Barletta. Protesters are expected to greet him, as they did during an earlier visit this year. Ahead of his trip, Pence published an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer that declared the Trump administration’s policies are benefitting Pennsylvania: "Our agenda is delivering real results – and we’re just getting started." Among the "real results" touted by Pence? That "the unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded." As jobs will likely be a major talking point during the midterm elections in Pennsylvania, we decided to check that statement. Most experts agree that presidents have little control over the economy. In his piece, Pence uses the unemployment rate for the Philadelphia area to bolster his argument that the Trump administration’s policies are benefiting the city. But presidential actions do not necessarily have much of an impact on job numbers, which are often driven by broader factors, such as international economic conditions and technological change. Experts also debate whether the unemployment rate is a meaningful indicator of the economy’s well-being. That probably rings true for the 48 percent of city residents living below the poverty line or for those who have stopped looking for work. But for the purposes of this fact-check, we stuck with the numbers. "Based on data from the Philadelphia Metropolitan Division, the unemployment rate (4.7%) in May 2018 was the lowest ever recorded," the vice president’s spokesperson, Alyssa Farah, said via email when asked about the source of the claim. Unemployment data comes from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division is a subset of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD metropolitan statistical area and includes both Philadelphia and Delaware counties. BLS releases both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted Local Area Unemployment Statistics. The Pa. Department of Labor & Industry uses seasonally adjusted data, as it allows for month-to-month comparisons and accounts for trends like layoffs after the holiday season, analyst Jeff Newman told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. For the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in May, according to BLS. That number is preliminary and will be finalized within a month, Newman said. That 4.7 percent rate is the lowest number on record since January 1990. That’s as far back as BLS went when it reconstructed unemployment data based on MSA and metro division delineation changes that happened after the last census. Pence’s claim would not be true using non-seasonally adjusted unemployment data. The unadjusted unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in May, according to BLS, and was lower in April 2000 (4.3 percent). Our ruling Ahead of his visit to Philadelphia, Vice President Mike Pence claimed in an opinion piece that the unemployment rate for the city’s metro area is the lowest on record. That is true only if one looks at seasonally adjusted unemployment data for the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division (which includes Delaware County) since 1990, which is important context.

pomt-02801	"The recidivism rate is nearly 29 percent and has been climbing steadily since detainees began being released from Guantanamo."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/02/saxby-chambliss/chambliss-statement-partially-true-needs-context/	U.S. senators fighting to close Guantanamo Bay won a small victory late last month despite opposition from their colleague Saxby Chambliss. Senate Democrats joined forces with a handful of Republicans to successfully defend their bid to ease restrictions on transferring detainees out of the controversial military prison. The changes have yet to clear Congress. But the victory may be a sign that support for closing Guantanamo is growing. \Chambliss, who opposes current efforts to close Guantanamo, warned during a Senate floor debate that the proposed changes could free terrorists to strike again. "These are not abstract theories; they are facts. The recidivism rate is nearly 29 percent and has been climbing steadily since detainees began being released from Guantanamo," the Georgia Republican said. PolitiFact Georgia decided to unleash the AJC Truth-O-Meter to determine whether those really are the "facts." The proposal to alter detainee transfer rules is part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which would provide defense funding. Chambliss, who is vice chairman of the Senate’s Select Committee on Intelligence, co-sponsored a failed amendment that would have prevented the changes. How many former detainees have returned to terrorism is a central issue in the Guantanamo debate. A low recidivism rate could breathe life into President Barack Obama’s attempt to fulfill his 2008 campaign promise to close the prison. (We gave him a Promise Broken rating on the Obameter in August.) A high rate could kill it. But tracking former Guantanamo detainees isn’t as easy as counting prisoners released from a state penitentiary. The calculation relies on intelligence that the government keeps classified. Critics complain that the figures are impossible to verify because the names of re-offenders are not released. A few may have been branded as recidivists for merely criticizing the U.S. Some former prisoners may never have been terrorists in the first place, they say. A semiannual report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence addresses some of these criticisms by giving more precise descriptions for what counts as returning to terrorism. When an ex-detainee is "confirmed of re-engaging" in terrorism or insurgency, intelligence gatherers have found a "preponderance of information" showing the former prisoner is directly involved in activities such as planning attacks, financing operations or recruiting for terrorist groups. The group does not include those who only make anti-U.S. statements or call other former prisoners to talk about old times. When an ex-detainee is "suspected of re-engaging," intelligence gatherers have "plausible but unverified" evidence or "single-source reporting" showing the former prisoner is directly involved. According to the latest ODNI report, which was released in September, 100 of 603 released detainees were "confirmed of re-engaging," or about 16.6 percent. An additional 74, or 12.3 percent, were "suspected of re-engaging." Add them together and you get 28.9 percent, or "nearly 29 percent," as Chambliss said. As part of our assessment of the senator’s statement, we also considered whether the number of "re-engaging" ex-detainees is "climbing steadily." During the George W. Bush years, 532 detainees were released, according to the report. Of those, 97 were "confirmed of re-engaging," while 70 were suspected of it. Under Obama, 71 detainees were released. Three were confirmed as returning to terrorism. Four are suspected. In other words, the total number has increased under Obama, but his percentage is lower than the Bush administration’s. So, did Chambliss get it right? A spokeswoman for Chambliss says it’s common to combine the categories because ex-detainees often switch from the "suspected" to "confirmed" designation. Also, she says, intelligence gatherers have to detect some level of terrorist activity before it classifies someone as "suspected." But The Washington Post pointed out that when Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess Jr., then the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified before Congress in February 2011, he corrected Chambliss when the senator used a recidivism figure that combined the classifications. Burgess said the figure "would not be confirmed by the Defense Intelligence Agency in terms of having returned to the fight or re-engaged." In addition, the ODNI report makes clear that ex-detainees classified as "suspected of re-engaging" may not have done so. Chambliss’ decision to combine them with confirmed terrorists gives the impression that the data support his argument more forcefully than it actually does. Chambliss’ assessment that the rate of recidivists is "climbing steadily" also has some weaknesses. The number of suspected or confirmed recidivists has grown by a half-dozen or so since Obama took office, but his percentage is lower than that of the Bush administration. PolitiFact’s definition of "Half True" means that a statement is at least partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think Chambliss’ claim fits the bill. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Saxby Chambliss	None	None	None	2013-12-02T06:00:00	2013-11-19	['None']

"Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business," said a February 2017 headline from My Christian Daily, which circulated social media last week. My Christian Daily is a project from Initiate Media, a Christian media company that "seek(s) to make God famous," according to its "About" page. Similar stories have appeared on various websites since 2013. My Christian Daily cited an article from the Washington Press — a website that we were unable to find and may no longer exist — as well as an article from Forbes. Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story about Schultz said that during a 2013 annual meeting for Starbucks shareholders, Schultz received a complaint from Tom Strobhar, founder of The Corporate Morality Action Center, an organization with a mission to "challenge companies that offend traditional moral norms" such as "the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman." Strobhar said he believed Starbucks lost revenue because of its public support for a 2012 same-sex marriage referendum, which in turn inspired boycotts from anti-gay-marriage groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage. The referendum asked voters if same-sex marriage should be legalized in the state of Washington, and Starbucks joined other leading Washington-area companies in supporting the measure. In response, the story went, Schultz told Strobhar to sell his Starbucks shares and invest in other companies. As it turns out, Schultz’s actual remarks were more nuanced, and we did not find any credible articles that quoted him saying he did not want business from opponents of same-sex marriage. Snopes debunked this falsehood years ago and updated its post on Sunday. Schultz said at the time that the decision to support same-sex marriage was about respecting diversity rather than maximizing revenue. "Not every decision is an economic decision," Schultz said. "Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year. I don’t know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months." He continued: "Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people. We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity of all kinds. If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company." Schultz’s 38 percent figure comes from fiscal year 2012, meaning the timeframe between October 2011 to September 2012. This return was down from the previous fiscal year, which saw a 46 percent shareholder return. (See a video of Schultz’s full response.) When the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, Starbucks issued a statement applauding the decision and recalling Schultz’s exchange with Strobhar as "the company’s most vocal statement on diversity and equality." Reggie Borges, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said the My Christian Daily story is not accurate and pointed to the Snopes fact-check, a video of Schultz’s response and the statement released after 2015 Supreme Court ruling as evidence. My Christian Daily did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A headline stated, "Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business.’" This is a claim that has circulated since 2013. At an annual meeting for company shareholders, Strobhar said the company’s support for same-sex marriage was eroding its bottom line, which prompted Schultz to defend his decision. Schultz said Strobhar was free to sell his Starbucks stocks and invest in another company if he believed the company’s social policies meant he could get a better return on his money elsewhere. He did not say opponents of same-sex marriage were not wanted as investors or as customers. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12790	New York state subsidizes private colleges "probably more than any other state except maybe one."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/feb/16/andrew-cuomo/new-york-gives-more-aid-private-college-students-a/	New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed free college tuition for resident students in families that earn $125,000 or less a year -- but only at the state’s public colleges and universities. Private colleges worry about their enrollment and finances if the plan passes. It wouldn’t be an even playing field, the private colleges say. Cuomo fired back at the critics at a Buffalo rally to promote his idea. "We happen to subsidize private colleges probably more than any other state except maybe one," Cuomo said. Is Cuomo right? State tuition aid The National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, which tracks college financial aid, said New York state provided $253 million in need-based grants to students attending not-for-profit private colleges in the state. That’s how much the state gave in the 2014-2015 school year, the most-recent available year for data. Only Texas offered more, giving private college students $289 million in all. Need-based grant programs vary widely among states, making it hard to rank per capita spending by state. Overall aid per student is difficult to track because students in some states can take advantage of multiple aid programs. So while it's possible to know how many students benefited from an individual program, no one keeps track nationally how much individual students receive from multiple programs. Other states give more to individual students. The maximum award from New York state’s Tuition Assistance Program is $5,165 a year. Students in California could be eligible to receive more than double that amount. New York state’s average need-based award for private college students -- $3,200 -- is also lower than in other large states. Private college students in California receive about $8,500 on average. But New York state has more aid recipients than other states. The latest data shows nearly 79,000 private college students in New York state take advantage of the need-based TAP aid, while only about 28,000 are given comparable aid in California. Percentage of state aid Despite New York's No. 2 ranking in total aid, 15 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., allocate a higher percentage of their total need-based aid to private college students. Two-thirds of New York's need-based grant aid goes to public college students. Iowa gives 80 percent of need-based grants to students at not-for-profit private colleges. What about merit aid? On a different kind of college assistance -- merit aid -- New York ranks first in awarding $5.5 million to private college students. About 52 percent of the total merit aid went to private college students. Our ruling Cuomo said New York state subsidizes private colleges "probably more than any other state except maybe one." Data from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs shows New York state ranks second behind Texas in dollar amount of aid given to private school students.

pomt-02302	Wisconsin is "one of the bluest" states, but under Scott Walker its unemployment rate "is around 3.5%."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/02/rush-limbaugh/wisconsin-heavily-democratic-state-and-yet-under-s/	Rush Limbaugh was noting with amazement that the New York Times had carried an item about the Wisconsin Legislature approving a $504 million tax cut proposed by Gov. Scott Walker. "I think this is one of the biggest and most under-commented on -- including in conservative media -- stories this year," Limbaugh said on his show on March 19, 2014, according to a transcript on his website. "This is simply huge, what Governor Walker has done, no matter how you look at this." The nation's highest-rated radio talk show host continued by making a claim about how Democratic-leaning Wisconsin is and how low unemployment is under the Republican governor. Wisconsin, Limbaugh said, is "one of the bluest of blue states. One of the bluest of the blue universities. One of the headquarter states for malcontent state unions. One of the headquarter states for malcontent Democrat Party union activism. They did everything they could not just to destroy Walker's political career; they tried to destroy his reputation and his political life. They attempted to recall him a couple of times. The Democrats in the Senate walked out. "He persevered. He overcame. He dominated, and he won. And in the bluest of blue states, unemployment is around 3.5 percent." Leaving aside Limbaugh’s reference to a couple of recalls (Walker prevailed in the one recall attempt, in 2012, made against him), many Wisconsinites likely regard their state as being roughly as much red (Republican) as it is blue (Democratic). And they, along with Limbaugh’s millions of other listeners, might be surprised that unemployment has gotten so low. Blue, red and purple The Washington Post traces the widespread use of red and blue to the late "Meet the Press" host Tim Russert and an appearance he made on "The Today Show" about a week before George W. Bush’s victory over Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Russert and host Matt Lauer discussed a map that had a red-and-blue color scheme. Up to then, there had been no consensus and some media identified Democratic states as red and Republican states as blue. How states vote for president, in the most recent election or the last several presidential contests, has become a common way to identify states as blue or red. Viewed narrowly, Wisconsin is blue, having voted for the Democratic nominee in each of the last seven presidential contests. Over the past five decades, only two Republicans, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have won Wisconsin. (Nixon won in 1960, 1968 and 1972, and Reagan won in 1980 and 1984). Limbaugh spokeswoman Rachel Nelson said Limbaugh based the blue-state part of his claim on the fact that Wisconsin hadn’t voted for the GOP presidential nominee since ‘84. But calling Wisconsin "one of the bluest" states suggests it’s an automatic in the Democratic column, when in fact it has often been a presidential battleground. Four months before the 2012 election, for example, Politico listed Wisconsin as one of nine swing states; days before the vote, the New York Times listed Wisconsin as one of just six swing states. And on other measures, Wisconsin isn’t clearly blue at all. In terms of control of state government, Wisconsin’s hue is red, with Walker as governor and the GOP in control of both houses of the Legislature. Accordingly, The Post in December 2013 colored Wisconsin red in observing how states are aligning completely with one party -- three-quarters of them are now controlled by either Republicans or Democrats. It’s worth nothing, however, that things can change quickly in Wisconsin. Just prior to the 2010 elections, which put Walker and his fellow Republicans in power, Wisconsin state government was blue, with a Democrat as governor (Jim Doyle didn’t seek re-election) and Democrats controlling the Legislature. Meanwhile, Wisconsin looks purple -- as in a mix of blue and red -- when it comes to federal representatives and party preferences. In the U.S. Senate, conservative Republican Ron Johnson and liberal Democrat Tammy Baldwin are about as far apart politically as any state's senators. Wisconsin’s House delegation is closely split, with five Republicans and three Democrats. As for party preferences, a yearlong annual Gallup poll released in January 2014 identified 17 states as blue, meaning their residents were solidly or leaning Democratic; and 14 as red, as in solidly or leaning Republican. That left 19 states, including Wisconsin, rated as competitive. In sum, Wisconsin doesn’t measure up as one the bluest states. Unemployment down, but not that low On the 3.5 percent unemployment part of his claim, Limbaugh misspoke, his spokeswoman said. She noted Limbaugh had also referenced the Dakotas during that part of his show. (In January 2014, the latest rates available when Limbaugh made his statement, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in South Dakota and 2.6 percent in North Dakota.) Two weeks before Limbaugh made his statement, we evaluated a claim by Democrat Mary Burke, Walker's challenger in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. We gave her a Pants on Fire for claiming that unemployment under Walker is up. Although Walker is not on pace to meet his campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs by January 2015, unemployment has dropped from 7.7 percent when he took office in January 2011 to near 6 percent. It was 6.1 percent in January 2014. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate last hit 3.5 percent in November 2000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our rating Limbaugh said Wisconsin is "one of the bluest" states, but under Walker its unemployment rate "is around 3.5%." Although Wisconsin has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last seven presidential contests, as a frequent battleground state, it is far from being an automatic in the Democratic column. At the state level, meanwhile, Wisconsin is currently Republican red but was recently Democratic blue, and by other measures it is somewhere between the two. As for unemployment under Walker, it has dropped to near 6 percent, but nowhere near 3.5 percent. We rate Limbaugh’s statement False.

pomt-00046	Says Marshall Tuck "is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor" pictured as Betsy DeVos.	false	/california/statements/2018/nov/05/tony-thurmond/ad-wrongly-implies-marshall-tuck-backed-betsy-devo/	An attack ad in the race to be California’s next schools chief strongly suggests candidate Marshall Tuck is "backed" by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a polarizing Trump administration appointee. Tuck is a Democrat and former education executive. He’s running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction against State Asm. Tony Thurmond, also a Democrat, whose campaign produced the ad. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. Here’s what the ad claims, as a photo of President Trump standing next to DeVos appears on the screen and then zooms in on DeVos. "Tuck is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor and financed by the same billionaires behind Betsy DeVos." Ad by Tony Thurmond campaign Both Tuck and DeVos support charter schools. Meanwhile, Thurmond is a strong advocate for public schools. Tuck has said he supports nonprofit charter schools in areas with few quality public school alternatives, though he wants to implement some changes. According to his website, he wants to make for-profit charter schools illegal, require greater school transparency and open charter schools to all students. But we wanted to know whether DeVos really supports Tuck in the race, as the ad suggests. Our research DeVos’ office did not respond to our requests for comment. We asked Thurmond’s campaign about the claim. Instead of providing evidence that DeVos supports Tuck, they said he’s backed by Bill Evers. Evers is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who specializes in education policy. He was also "head of the ‘agency action team’ for the U.S. Department of Education in the Trump transition from early September 2016 through January 2017," according to his biography. In June, Evers posted a pro-Tuck campaign ad on Facebook and supported Tuck four years ago in his run for the same office. He’s not, however, on the long list of supporters on Tuck’s website. A spokesman for Tuck's campaign said Evers probably supports Tuck but hasn't made any financial contributions. Tuck's website includes a news article by the Independent Voter Network website that refers to Evers as a supporter of Tuck. Evers did not respond to a request for comment. Perhaps more importantly, the ad never mentions Evers’ name or shows his photo. Its primary focus is on DeVos. A spokesman for the Tuck campaign called the claim "a false and misleading attack by Tony Thurmond." He pointed to examples of Tuck criticizing DeVos. "I’d rate Betsy DeVos extremely low. I think she is not qualified really for that job," Tuck said in a video posted in March by the news website gvwire.com. "I’ve been very clear: My agenda is strongly against the Trump/DeVos agenda," he added at a campaign forum in May. Our ruling State Asm. Tony Thurmond, a candidate for California schools chief, left the strong impression in a recent ad that his opponent, Marshall Tuck, "is backed" by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The ad zooms in on a photo of DeVos as it says Tuck "is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor." But Tuck has criticized DeVos and the Thurmond campaign offered no evidence she supports Tuck. They did say that Bill Evers, who advised Trump on education during his transition, supports Tuck. But he’s not mentioned by name or shown in the ad, and Tuck doesn’t list him as a supporter on his website. In the end, we agreed the ad is misleading. It gives the impression DeVos supports Tuck. But there’s zero evidence to back that up. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-04614	"Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-50-percent-kids-coming-out-school/	Secretly recorded video of Mitt Romney grabbed attention on Sept. 17, 2012, primarily for his claim that 47 percent of Americans "believe they are victims" entitled to government help. But there’s more to the video snippets of Romney speaking privately to big Florida donors in Boca Raton. As the Republican presidential candidate explained his approach to wooing independent voters, he reeled off a series of statistics about the disappointing economy. "The best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won't graduate from high school. What're they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, ‘Yeah, I think you're right.’" We’re checking several statements from Romney’s remarks on May 17, 2012, but here we’re asking whether, "Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job." Fifty percent of kids Romney has made similar remarks on the campaign trail before, and his campaign has pointed us to articles by the Associated Press and Time.com that each address the bleak job market for 2012 college graduates. The key piece of evidence is from the Associated Press article, "In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed." It’s based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs. Here’s how the AP summarized the findings: "A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ... "About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year." Rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job, the reality is that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren’t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed, and about half are in jobs that don’t require a college degree. In August, PolitiFact checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research. Sum agreed with our analysis. Romney would have been more accurate if he had phrased his claim the way he did on other occasions, when he said "half the kids coming out of college this year … can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree." We also think there’s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. Viewers shouldn’t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which is currently at 8.5 percent. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities. According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- "before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields." That’s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets. While Romney glossed over details when he spoke with donors, painting a darker picture than supported by the research, he did get the tone right: At 53.6 percent, the number of college graduates unemployed or underemployed is the highest it’s been in at least 11 years. Our ruling Romney told campaign donors that "50 percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job." He missed a key qualifier -- according to the research, about a quarter of recent college grads literally can’t find a job, while another quarter have found a job, but one that doesn’t require a college degree. Still, the research shows the employment picture for college grads is grimmer than at any time in more than a decade. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02674	The Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a "Koch brothers affiliated group."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/09/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-claims-florida-group-backs-drug-test/	PunditFact isn't always the first to weigh in on the tit-for-tat of cable news shows, in part because the nature of our work requires more than claims and counterclaims. And sometimes, a few extra days allows matters to become more settled. Such is the case in examining the back-and-forth recently between MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and representatives for Charles and David Koch. You probably have heard the story by now, but here's a quick catch-up. On Maddow's Jan. 2, 2014, show, Maddow accused the Koch brothers -- through "affiliated state groups" -- of pushing and promoting a Florida law that requires welfare recipients to first pass a drug test. Representatives for the Koch brothers pushed back against the allegation, saying they were not involved with the Florida law or the Florida group who supported the law, the Foundation for Government Accountability. Maddow is sticking by her story and refused to read a Koch-prepared on-air apology. In her original report, Maddow said that Koch brothers affiliated groups "in Florida they, at least, have been promoting forced drug tests for people who are on welfare." Later after Maddow read a description of the same group, the Foundation for Government Accountability, she said, "That’s the Koch brothers group that has been promoting this idea, right, the same Koch brothers group that has been telling people not to get health insurance. They're the ones that came up with the idea that it’s a great use of state funds." We're boiling down those comments to fact-check this statement: The Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a "Koch brothers affiliated group." The Koch brothers and their money The Koch brothers, Charles and David, inherited their father's Koch Industries, an oil refinery business that has since expanded into energy, textiles and manufacturing. Koch subsidiaries make Quilted Northern tissue paper, Dixie cups and Stainmaster carpet, among other products. Forbes estimates the brothers to have a combined wealth of $72 billion. And they spend it. An examination by the Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post found that the Kochs' political groups raised more than $400 million for political causes during the 2012 election. The Kochs are rich, shrewd and conservative, and they have helped create a labyrinth of political groups and funding sources with names like the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Center to Protect Patient Rights, Public Notice, Americans for Prosperity, and Generation Opportunity. They fought the re-election of President Barack Obama and continue to fight the health care law. As a result, the Kochs have become a leading target of liberals and Maddow’s bête noire. Their tentacles are many places, to be sure, but how deeply do they reach into the Foundation for Government Accountability and a Florida law to require drug tests of welfare recipients? Florida's drug-testing law Let’s start with Florida’s drug-testing law. The law, which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge Dec. 31, 2013, required people applying for welfare benefits to first pass a drug screening. The idea, in Florida, started with Gov. Rick Scott. While campaigning in the Republican primary for governor in 2010, Scott unveiled a seven-step plan to create 700,000 private-sector jobs over seven years. As part of that umbrella promise, Scott also pledged to save the state $77 million in part by adding a drug-testing requirement for welfare. The idea was born when Scott was still an underdog to then-Attorney General Bill McCollum and did not come from the Kochs or the Foundation for Government Accountability, said Mary Anne Carter, a senior campaign adviser who helped craft Scott’s policy plan. The idea came from other states, Carter said. Arizona passed a law to drug test welfare recipients in 2009. Michigan passed the first such law in 1999, but a federal appellate court struck it down in 2003. And in 1996, amid federal welfare reform, St. Johns County in northeast Florida approved a policy to test applicants of county assistance for some medical services. The New York Times found at least 29 states debated the measures in 2013, though just a couple passed. "This is an issue that has been around at least a decade," Carter told PunditFact. Scott and the Kochs do have some connections. In June 2011, Scott attended a retreat hosted by the Koch brothers near Vail, Colo., where he says he discussed the drug-testing plan. "It was very interesting," Scott said of the meeting. "They wanted basically to know what am I doing in Florida." And in 2013, Scott gave a keynote address at an Americans for Prosperity Foundation summit in Orlando. The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is affiliated with Americans for Prosperity. Americans for Prosperity was founded by Koch. The Foundation for Government Accountability So that's the origin of the law in Florida, but what about the group Maddow says is Koch affiliated -- the Foundation for Government Accountability? The foundation is a conservative think tank that incorporated in Naples in late June 2011, one month after Scott signed the drug-testing law. It clearly supported the drug-testing law after it passed. One of its pamphlets was cited by the state in defense of the drug-testing requirement and the foundation promoted the law at a conference of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in December 2011. During her show, Maddow didn't explain how she determined that the Foundation for Government Accountability is a "Koch brothers affiliated group." Lauren Skowronski, an MSNBC spokeswoman, told us the crux of Maddow's argument relates not to the Foundation for Government Accountability but to another group called the State Policy Network. Maddow says the State Policy Network received money from Koch, and in turn the State Policy Network gave money to the Foundation for Government Accountability. Ergo Koch money went to the Foundation for Government Accountability. Ergo the Foundation for Government Accountability is a Koch affiliate. "The Kochs have funded an umbrella organization which disbursed money for the start-up of (the Foundation for Government Accountability) in 2011. That umbrella organization is the State Policy Network," Skowronski said. For its part, the Foundation for Government Accountability notes the foundation did not exist until after the drug-testing law was passed, and its leaders did not communicate with Koch officials or their intermediaries about the law. (That fact significantly colors Maddow's assertion that, "They're the ones that came up with the idea that it’s a great use of state funds.") "We did not work with Koch on the Florida welfare drug-testing issue," foundation CEO Tarren Bragdon said. "To the best of my knowledge, Koch wasn't involved at all. I have never heard anyone involved in the issue in any capacity mention Koch or reference their engagement or financial support." As with Scott, however, there are some connections between Koch and the Foundation for Government Accountability. The Tampa Bay Times reported in 2012 that the foundation supported Scott’s drug-test law, and Bragdon had touted a similar drug-test policy in Maine. The Times wrote that Bragdon said the Kochs had not donated to his foundation, but that people with connections to Koch have, including Robert A. Levy and the Atlas Research Foundation. Levy is the chairman of the Cato Institute, which was co-founded by Charles Koch. But the more important tie is between the Foundation for Government Accountability and the State Policy Network. The State Policy Network gave the Foundation for Government Accountability $60,000 in 2011 "for start-up, direct mail prospecting," and $108,150 in 2012 for "general operating and health care policy research," tax filings show. The contributions equal about 28 percent of what the Foundation for Government Accountability received in 2011 and about 15 percent in 2012. So what’s the connection between Koch and the State Policy Network? Mark Holden, an attorney for Koch Industries, told PunditFact that various Koch foundations gave $40,000 to the State Policy Network between 2002 and 2012. But Holden says Koch foundations have no connections to the Foundation for Government Accountability, Other Koch money also could be at play. How much is hard to say. The Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal group, published a report about the State Policy Network in November. The report attempts to track the money of various corporations and entities -- including those connected to Koch -- using publicly available tax forms over several years, cross-referencing third-party reporting. Interestingly, the report also lists Comcast as a donor to the State Policy Network. Comcast is the parent company of Maddow's MSNBC. We read the Center for Media and Democracy analysis and then conducted our own. The result, like the reporting from the Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post, shows the complex network in which the Kochs' distribute their money. In 2008 and 2010, a not-for-profit called the Knowledge and Progress Fund donated $3.24 million to another not-for-profit called Donors Trust, tax forms show. Charles Koch is a director of the Knowledge and Progress Fund. In 2011, Donors Trust made various donations to the State Policy Network. The group also made a $500,000 contribution to another group called Donors Capital Fund, for a "donor-advised fund," tax forms show. We don’t know what the money was for. The president of Donors Trust is a woman named Whitney L. Ball, who previously worked at the Cato Institute (a think tank founded by Charles Koch) and serves on the board of Donors Capital and the State Policy Network. It gets more interesting. Donors Capital Fund gave $1.97 million to State Policy Network in 2011 (2012 records were not immediately available), including $135,000 earmarked for the purpose of "start-up activities in Florida." That was the same year the foundation started. Donors Capital Fund also gave almost $300,000 in 2010 to Bragdon’s then-Maine Heritage Policy Center for various purposes. Does "start-up activities in Florida" mean the Foundation for Government Accountability? We don’t know for certain. If it does, could you directly link that money back to the Koch-controlled Knowledge and Progress Fund? We could not. Holden, the Koch Industries attorney, told us he didn’t know the purpose of the donations of either Donors Trust or Knowledge and Progress Fund. "We've got a long long list of other groups David and Charles supported," Holden said, naming the Smithsonian, Johns Hopkins and the Salvation Army. "Are they ‘Koch-connected?’ As far as the FGA group (Foundation for Government Accountability) we have no involvement. We did not give them any money. We are not connected with them. We have nothing to do with them." A tenuous connection It's easy to find connections between people and groups; "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" taught us that. And certainly with people like Charles and David Koch, who have billions of dollars and spend it on a variety of conservative political causes, it’s even easier. But in the case of the Foundation for Government Accountability, the ties to Koch are dubious. Part of that may be the fault of the system, which allows donors to largely remain anonymous, and shuttle money through shadow groups. Maddow suggested as much in a follow-up segment detailing the Koch controversy. "The Foundation for Government Accountability is part of a huge network of state-based conservative think-tanks that is frankly kind of designed to not look like a network. They all look vaguely indigenous. They all have what look to be locally specific names," Maddow said on Jan. 3. "But their funding if you follow it comes in part from a central source of big money corporate donors. Including groups affiliated with the Koch brothers." Yet Maddow drew a straight line linking Koch, the Foundation for Government Accountability and the Florida drug-testing law when reality is different. Yes, there are some ties among Scott, Koch and the Foundation for Government Accountability. And yes, there are some slightly stronger interactions between Koch and the State Policy Network. But it's not enough to declare the Foundation for Government Accountability a Koch affiliate. "The Kochs have certainly supported the State Policy Network and some of its think-tank affiliates. But I haven’t seen evidence that they have directly funded the Foundation for Government Accountability or proactively pushed for the drug-testing law," Daniel Schulman, a journalist with Mother Jones who is writing a book about the Kochs, told the Washington Post. "Do they want to rein in entitlements? Absolutely. But in the case of Florida, I think the connection is tenuous." Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame law professor who focuses on nonprofit advocacy issues, told us the Kochs’ network of entities shows that "they have gone to significant lengths and expense to hide their contributions and where those contributions are going," But, "it does seem to be a stretch to say that all of the donors to the State Policy Network are somehow affiliated with Foundation for Government Accountability given the small size of the grant to the foundation compared to all the grants made by the network." Maddow said the Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a "Koch brothers affiliated group." The evidence to prove that particular claim is thin. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2014-01-09T17:31:29	2014-01-02	['None']

pomt-13928	"Al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole (for purchasing guns despite being on a watch list) to attack and kill Americans.'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/23/cory-booker/sen-cory-booker-says-al-qaida-has-urged-followers-/	New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker was one of the U.S. senators who spent nearly 15 hours in an overnight filibuster designed to pressure Congress to vote on two gun amendments proposed in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. One would block anyone on the government's terrorist watch list from buying a firearm. The other would expand background checks to all gun show purchases and internet sales. Both were rejected in a largely party-line vote June 20, 2016. Ahead of the vote, MSNBC's Chris Matthews asked Booker in a June 16 interview how the filibuster would "lead to an actual bill, something the president can sign?" "Well, what I have been finding recently is how many Americans did not realize that you can be under investigation by the FBI, that you could have been put on the no-fly list because you were considered to be too dangerous to enter plane, but you could still go out and buy a trunk load full of weapons," he said. "And so here we have this real war that we’re on — a war against terrorism. We’re basically telling our enemy, exploit this loophole. In fact, our enemy, al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole to attack and kill Americans.' " We've covered the fact that people on terrorist watch lists have been able to buy firearms. For this fact-check, we decided to look into whether al-Qaida propaganda has actually been urging people to exploit that situation. When we contacted Booker's office, a spokesman responded immediately with several links, all pointing to a 2011 video made by Adam Gadahn, an American serving as a spokesman for al-Qaida. "Muslims in the west have to remember they are perfectly placed to play an important and decisive part in the jihad against the Zionists and crusaders, and to do major damage to the enemies of Islam, waging war on their religion, sacred places, and things and brethren. This is a golden opportunity" to rush to do battle with everything at your disposal, he says. "And in the West, you've got a lot at your disposal. Let’s take America as an example," Gadahn said. "America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?" (Gadahn's information was not entirely correct. As CNN noted, only specially licensed dealers can sell fully automatic weapons and they require a background check.) Gadahn, the first American charged with treason since World War II and an occupant of the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists, was killed by the United States in January 2015 counterterrorism operation. Max Abrahms, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University, said he couldn't recall "any other videos as explicit about the ease of using guns in the United States on Islamists' behalf. That said, I would be surprised if there isn't other propaganda seeking to exploit the permissiveness of gun access in the U.S." Our ruling Booker said, "Al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole (for purchasing guns despite being on a watch list) to attack and kill Americans." We've seen a 2011 video from one operative, an Al-Qaida spokesman born and raised in America, who did indeed urge Muslims to use the gun show loophole to purchase weapons and attack Americans. While an expert said its reasonable that other pieces of propaganda exist, we don't know of any. With that caveat, we rate the claim as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/475e31b4-c182-4fd0-9834-ea5d0efad56f	None	Cory Booker	None	None	None	2016-06-23T10:30:00	2016-06-16	['United_States']
pomt-14496	"If it weren’t for me … (illegal immigration) wouldn’t even be a big subject."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-claims-he-started-immigration/	Count on Donald Trump to repeat his talking points. The Republican presidential debate in Houston, Texas, on Feb. 25, 2016, opened with a discussion about illegal immigration. Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz sparred over how to deal with people living here illegally and how to secure the southern U.S. border. In the middle of the back-and-forth, Trump made the blanket statement that we wouldn’t be talking about illegal immigration if not for him. "If it weren’t for me … (illegal immigration) wouldn’t even be a big subject," Trump said. It’s a line we’ve heard from Trump since at least August. It was False then, and it’s still False now. Back in August, we searched major newspapers for the 51 days before Trump entered the race -- on June 16, 2015 -- and the 51 days after Trump’s announcement. We looked for the terms "undocumented" and "illegal immigrant" within 10 words of the word "president." The results? The subject of illegal immigration certainly was a subject pre-Trump, and post-Trump. Date range Search term Number of articles April 25 to June 15 Undocumented 65 June 16 to Aug. 6 Undocumented 42 April 25 to June 15 Illegal immigrant 60 June 16 to Aug. 6 Illegal immigrant 79 Source: Lexis-Nexis Anecdotally, Cruz certainly has made illegal immigration a subject of his campaign. In Cruz’s announcement speech for president March 23, 2015, Cruz said, "Instead of the lawlessness and the president’s unconstitutional executive amnesty, imagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures the borders." Our ruling Trump said, "If it weren’t for me … (illegal immigration) wouldn’t even be a big subject." Trump’s talk about building a wall -- and making Mexico pay for it -- certainly has made headlines. But talk about America’s immigration system and proposed changes preceded the billionaire businessman’s candidacy for president. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09071	Blue Cross’ new $90-million Providence headquarters "was outfitted with $25 million in decor."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/28/bill-lynch/Bill-Lynch-campaign-claims-Blue-Cross-spent/	William "Bill" Lynch, one of the four Democrats running for Patrick Kennedy’s 1st District seat in the U.S. Congress, has been trying to rally support by repeatedly railing against Blue Cross, the health insurer whose double-digit rate increase requests have been widely condemned. The fact that Blue Cross is seeking the increase after building a towering headquarters near Providence Place mall, combined with rumors that the company spent lavishly on furnishings, has made it a tempting target. So Lynch has called on the health-insurance commissioner to deny the request, and his campaign issued a news release in May that included this statement: "Last month Lynch criticized the construction of Blue Cross’s new $90 million headquarters, which was outfitted with $25 million in decor." That would buy some pretty cushy cubicles. We wanted to know if the $25-million figure was true. When we contacted the Lynch campaign, spokesman Bill Fischer said the number also includes furnishings, such as desks and office equipment, and the sources were a Providence Business News story, which he could not locate, and an Oct. 5, 2009, Providence Journal story. We checked the Journal story but there was no reference to $25 million being spent on anything. When we asked Fischer about that, he cited this sentence in the story: "But Blue Cross president and chief executive officer James E. Purcell is proud of his $90-million ($125 million when you include furnishings and ‘soft’ costs such as fees and engineering) building and insists it is actually saving money for the health insurer." Fischer said the campaign arrived at the $25-million figure by taking the $35 million difference between $125 million and $90 million, then subtracting $10 million to be on the safe side. He said the Lynch campaign has repeatedly sought more reliable information from Blue Cross and the state Department of Business Regulation, which uses data from the health-insurance giant to rule on premium increases. But both, he said, have refused to disclose that data. "It’s the best information we could ascertain from the limited information Blue Cross will provide on this matter," said Fischer. No it’s not. It’s a number pulled out of thin air. Fischer added that Lynch has publicly repeated the $25-million claim in several venues, in news releases and on the radio. "Not once did Blue Cross refute it," he said. They don’t have to. It’s up to a candidate to know what he or she is talking about. Repeatedly presenting rough guesstimates as hard facts does not make them true. "We stand by our number," Fischer said. And we stand by our rating: Pants on Fire. By the way, we asked Blue Cross how much it spent on furnishings and received this response from Kimberly R. Reingold, director of media relations and external affairs: "The cost characterization of our decor, including workstations, office furniture, tables, seating and files, is inaccurate. The actual cost was modestly in excess of $7 million." Reingold said "modestly in excess of $7 million" means less than $7.5 million and was based on "invoices received from multiple vendors." We asked Blue Cross for documentation to back up that number. The company declined to provide it.	None	Bill Lynch	None	None	None	2010-06-28T00:06:00	2010-05-19	['None']

pomt-08474	"Never once did they (House Republicans) actually cut spending or reduce the state budget. Even when they cut taxes in 2005, they increased spending. They never paid for their tax cuts."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/12/armond-budish/ohio-house-speaker-armond-budish-raps-republicans-/	House Speaker Armond Budish kicked off what he called his "rhetoric reality tour" last month in Columbus hoping to fight back against House Republicans who have painted Democrats with the usual "tax and spend" brush. At a news conference, Budish got uncharacteristically lathered up, saying that Democrats have "made the cuts that Republicans wouldn’t" in slicing almost $2 billion from the current $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget. The mild-mannered Beachwood Democrat then attacked the House Republican record from 1994 to 2006 when the GOP controlled the 99-member lower chamber (as well as the governor’s office and the Ohio Senate). "Never once did they actually cut spending or reduce the state budget. Even when they cut taxes in 2005, they increased spending," Budish said. "They never paid for their tax cuts." Instead, they put off the bills until last year using budget gimmicks, he said. Those are fairly inflammatory claims, and just the kind of thing that PolitiFact Ohio likes to check out, so we did some digging to see if Budish was right. First, we pored over the state budget details dating back to 1994. We quickly saw that the first part of his statement is true, as long as Budish is talking about the entire budget and not individual programs that may have seen cuts at one time or another. From 1994 to 2006, the seven state budgets approved while Republicans were in complete control increased spending an average of 9.39 percent from one budget to the next. The closest thing to a cut under Republican control was the 2005-06 budget, which went up only slightly, but included a 21 percent across-the-board income tax reduction spread over five years — which is the tax cut Budish is referring to in his comment. So far, so good. But to evaluate the second portion of Budish’s statement where he says Republicans "never paid for their tax cuts," you need a brief education in the numerous changes made to the state’s tax structure in 2005 by lawmakers. In a nutshell, a number of taxes of business and individual taxes were adjusted at the same time — some were increased by lawmakers in 2005 while others were cut or phased out entirely. A pair of business taxes that were phased out slowly by the budget that was passed in 2005 were the tangible personal property tax and the corporation franchise tax. They were replaced by a new tax on businesses called the Commercial Activities Tax, or CAT, which was phased in as the duo was ramped down. While those changes affected businesses, individual taxpayers were also affected by tax changes, including a sales tax hike and a 21 percent cut in the personal income tax rates for everyone in Ohio spread across five years. That was the plan anyway. But last year Gov. Ted Strickland proposed, and lawmakers approved, pushing the fifth year of that tax cut back a year to fill a hole in the state budget. But Budish isn’t totally correct when he says that the Republicans "never paid for" the tax cuts contained in the 2005 state budget. In fact, the 2007 state budget passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Strickland had about $1.8 billion less in revenue because of the tax cuts of 2005, according to a 2009 state budget document. That, by law, required adjustments to the budget in other places to keep the state budget balanced. Still, the impact in 2007 of the tax cuts was fairly light compared to the impact that had been projected for the current budget -- $4.2 billion. But when lawmakers adopted Strickland’s proposal to push back the final year of the income tax cuts that pushed back some of the effect. The state actually ended up with $3.4 billion less to spend in the current budget than if the tax changes of 2005 never happened. So let’s get to the grading card and see what we got: Budish is right that Republicans never actually cut spending from 1994 to 2006. And he’s right that spending went up under Republicans even when tax cuts were passed in 2005. But the second part of his statement has a hole — the bill on the tax changes started coming due in 2007 when Republicans were still in charge of the legislature and were forced to balance the budget with $1.8 billion less in revenue. Budish’s statement is largely accurate but needs additional information to see the full picture. That’s why we rate Budish’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-09054	During the year Kagan barred military recruiters from Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services, "military recruiting actually went up."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/30/elena-kagan/kagan-says-height-military-recuitment-controversy-/	During her Supreme Court nomination hearing, Elena Kagan faced intense questioning from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, about her decision to bar military recruiters from using the Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services during part of her tenure as the school's dean. Kagan defended her decision and repeatedly backed it up with a claim that the number of military recruits actually went up. "Senator, the military at all times during my deanship had full and good access," Kagan said. "Military recruiting did not go down. Indeed, in a couple of years, including the year that you're particularly referring to, it went up. And it went up because we ensured that students would know that the military recruiters were coming to our campus. Because I talked about how important military service was. Because our veterans organization and the veterans on campus did an absolutely terrific job, a terrific service to their fellow students in talking to them about the honor of military service." Sessions said he was "just a little taken aback by the tone of your remarks, because it's unconnected to reality." Kagan later said she "always tried to make sure that I conveyed my honor for the military. And I always tried to make sure that the military had excellent access to our students. And in the short period of time, Sen. Sessions, that the military had that access through the veterans organization, military recruiting actually went up." We've dealt with the military recruitment issue from several angles, and here we decided to tackle the claim that the number of military recruits went up at the height of the campus controversy. In previous PolitiFact items, we have gone into some detail about the controversial history of military recruiting at Harvard Law School, which long predated Kagan's tenure as dean from 2003-2009. But the bottom line is that military recruiters were only ever barred from the school's Office of Career Services for one semester in 2005. During that time, Kagan encouraged the military to recruit through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student organization (now called the Harvard Law School Armed Forces Association). In all other years Kagan was dean at Harvard Law School, military recruiters were permitted to use the Office of Career Services (despite Kagan steadfastly lodging her opposition to the military's "discriminatory recruitment" based on the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy which "deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible.") So we are really talking here about the 2005 spring semester during which Kagan arguably made it the most difficult for military recruiters, by barring them from the Office of Career Services. "The symbolic effect of this special treatment of military recruiters was important, but the practical effect on recruiting logistics was minimal," wrote Robert C. Clark, a professor and dean at Harvard Law School from 1989 to 2003, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on May 11, 2010. We're not big into he-said, she-said at PolitiFact, but we think a bit of point-counterpoint on Clark's statement is in order. During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Orrin Hatch cited a 2002 e-mail from an Air Force recruiter who wrote, "Career Services Offices are the epicenter for all employer hiring activities at a law school. ... Without the support of the Career Services Office, we are relegated to wandering the halls in hopes that someone will stop and talk to us. ... Denying access to the Career Services Office is tantamount to chaining and locking the front door of the law school -- as it has the same impact on our recruiting efforts." And a Feb. 18, 2005, letter from the Harvard Law School Veterans Association -- which was tapped by Kagan to coordinate military recruitment efforts in lieu of recruiters being afforded access to the Office of Career Services -- also suggests the 2005 policy was more than a seamless blip. The group lamented that "Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting events." Their effort, they wrote "falls short of duplicating the excellent assistance provided by the HLS Office of Career Services." And now the counterpoint. During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy submitted a letter from First Lt. David M. Tressler, who is currently deployed with the U.S. Army Reserve in Afghanistan. Tressler graduated from Harvard Law School in 2006 and wrote that "Military recruiters were never barred from campus. During the brief period when recruiters were not given access to students officially through the law school’s Office of Career Services, they still had access to students on campus through other means." "There are only a few of us each year who joined the military while attending, or after graduation from, Harvard Law. Kagan’s decision to uphold the school’s anti-discrimination policy for a brief period of time and express disagreement with DADT did not prevent us from talking with recruiters and joining." In fact, Tressler wrote, "in 2005 more graduating students joined the military than any year this decade." "To attack Ms. Kagan for a principled position she took as a law school dean that had no practical effect on military recruitment looks, from where I stand, like a political distraction," Tressler wrote. "I believe that, while dean of Harvard Law School, she adequately proved her support for those who had served, were currently serving, and all those who felt called to serve, including those like me who joined upon graduation as well as those patriots who were not permitted to do so under the policy of 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.'" So how did all this affect the number of military recruits? We contacted the Harvard Law School Office of Public Information, which provided a breakdown on the number of graduates, by class, who went into the military: 2000 -- 0 2001 -- 3 2002 -- 2 2003 -- 2 2004 -- 3 2005 -- 5 2006 -- 3 2007 -- 3 2008 -- 2 2009 -- 2 That's right, it went from three in 2004 to five in 2005. So Kagan is technically accurate that during the year in question, 2005, the number of recruits went up. And Tressler is correct that the five law school graduates who went into the military that year is the largest number from any class this decade. But by citing the statistic (without the numbers), Kagan suggests it backs the contention that her decision to bar recruiters from the Office of Career Services during the spring semester of 2005 had negligible, and perhaps only a symbolic, effect on military recruiting at Harvard Law School. That's a matter of dispute. While the former dean and a 2006 graduate now in the military say the policy had little real effect on recruiting, military recruiters clearly disagreed. The number of recruits in any given year at Harvard Law School is so small, we don't think citing the 2005 increase - by 2 from the previous year - settles the issue one way or the other. And so we rate Kagan's claim Half True.	None	Elena Kagan	None	None	None	2010-06-30T18:00:52	2010-06-29	['None']

pomt-05081	"Statistics show that more people at this time telecommute than they ride carpools, mass transit, bicycle or walk."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/03/debbie-dooley/tea-party-leader-makes-case-telecommuting/	Transportation planners and elected officials across metro Atlanta spent about two years coming up with a comprehensive list to resolve some of the region’s traffic troubles and a way to pay for it. Meanwhile, a tea party leader who opposes the plan has some ideas of her own to ease traffic congestion. And one of them involves no taxpayer funds being spent. Encourage more people to telecommute -- to work from home. "Statistics show that more people at this time telecommute than they ride carpools, mass transit, bicycle or walk," Atlanta Tea Party Patriots co-founder Debbie Dooley said during a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta. PolitiFact Georgia has seen some long lines of people waiting to ride MARTA or some of the suburban bus systems around town. There couldn’t possibly be more people who work from home than take public transportation or carpool. Or is Dooley right? Dooley said she did not mean to include carpools in her statement. She sent us an email distributed the day before the forum in which she made a similar argument about telecommuting but did not mention carpools. We still decided to examine the entire claim, since the audience wasn’t aware she did not intend to mention carpools. There’s little research on telecommuting. And much of it is several years old or questionable. In some cases, people who do work at someone’s home, like a plumber, are included as people who work at a home-based business. Most organizations use U.S. Census Bureau data to base their reports about the percentage of people who telecommute. In recent years, there’s been criticism from some members of Congress and a few statistical experts about the survey’s accuracy. Dooley said she based her statement on a report by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a fiscally conservative think tank based in Atlanta. The report examined the transportation plan, commonly referred to as T-SPLOST. Metro Atlanta residents will vote July 31 whether to approve a penny-per-dollar increase in sales tax to pay for billions of dollars in new transportation projects. Supporters say the 1 percent sales tax will fund projects to help untangle the metro region’s legendary traffic jams. Opponents, such as Dooley, say it will have little impact on traffic congestion while burdening taxpayers with billions in new sales taxes. The foundation’s report contains a chart from the Census Bureau that measured the percentage of residents in 10 major metropolitan areas who use various forms of transportation or telecommute. In the Atlanta area, nearly 78 percent of commuters drive alone. No surprise there. That was second among the list of cities. Dallas was first at 80 percent; New York was last at 50.4 percent. The rest of the list for Atlanta went as follows: carpool: 10.9 percent. telecommute: 5.1 percent. public transit: 3.6 percent. walk: 1.4 percent. bike: 0.2 percent. The report was based on 2009 research from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Census Bureau survey statistician Kin Koerber said those percentages were close to the mark in each category. The percentage of those who telecommuted was slightly higher and has increased in recent years. Researchers interviewed about 60,000 metro Atlanta residents and asked them where they work, which means of transportation they use, their departure time to work and their commute time. There are about 2.2 million metro Atlanta residents currently employed, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That equates to 1 out of 37 employed Atlantans interviewed. A September 2011 Census Bureau report on how people across the nation get to work had similar numbers to Atlanta, but there was a key difference. The percentage of Americans who use public transit (5 percent) was slightly higher than those who worked at home (4.3 percent). The most recent Census Bureau data show more people telecommute in the Atlanta area than use public transit, bike or walk to work. The national census data show slightly more people use public transit than telecommute. But Dooley overshot those numbers by throwing in carpools. First lady Michelle Obama recently made a verbal slip-up in a statement about the percentage of public high schools that offer physical education classes. She meant to say only 2 percent offer those classes daily. Obama got a False on the Truth-O-Meter. In this case, Dooley’s overall thrust of her statement is correct. But including carpools into the mix takes it down a notch or two on the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling: Half True.	None	Debbie Dooley	None	None	None	2012-07-03T06:00:00	2012-06-12	['None']
pomt-09507	"$100,000 in stimulus funds (were) used for a Martini Bar and Brazilian Steakhouse."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/19/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-says-100000-stimulus-funds-were-used-mar/	In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent. "I was still concerned -- Joe (Biden) and I were just talking in the back -- when this thing passed we said $787 billion -- somewhere there’s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent; $787 billion spent out over 18 months, that's a lot -- that's a lot of money," Obama said. "And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that, as Joe puts it, the dog, so far at least, hasn't barked. " But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell put out a press release titled "Stimulus Anniversary Gifts to Taxpayers: One Year of Spending Taxpayer Dollars Studying Malt Liquor and Marijuana, Researching Drunk Mice, Funding Martini Bars and Steakhouses, and Examining Facebook." It lists 15 stimulus projects. We took a look at several items on this list, as well as a few from House Republican Leader John Boehner to see if they were as billed. In this item, we look at McConnell's claim that "$100,000 in stimulus funds (were) used for a Martini Bar and Brazilian Steakhouse." This one has made the rounds. It appears on Boehner's list as well and has been cited by several Republicans as an example of stimulus waste. The short answer on this one is that it's true, or used to be. This claim refers to two projects in St. Joseph, Mo., that were awarded Community Development Block Grants by the city, with funds from the stimulus. The martini bar owner, who had been awarded $25,000 to expand his existing business, withdrew his application for the federal funds on Jan. 21, 2010, after it was discovered that the company had liens placed against it by the IRS and the state for failing to pay a little more than $8,000 in taxes, said St. Joseph's Community Development Manager Gerald McCush. "You get no funds from the stimulus if you owe the IRS money, sorry," McCush said. So, the martini bar is getting no stimulus. As for the steakhouse, a city committee awarded $75,000 in Community Development Block Grant recovery money to ECBG LLC, a private company, to build a Brazilian steakhouse downtown. "We are trying to revitalize the downtown," McCush explained. "That is a priority for the City Council. We have a pretty blighted downtown." In all, the city received $475,000 worth of Community Development Block Grant funds from the stimulus. A city committee that included two City Council members, two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, a city planner and some other city residents decided on the projects from among $2 million worth of requests. The steakhouse was selected not only because it met the city's priority for revitalizing the downtown, McCush said, but also because it would result in a number of new jobs. The steakhouse will anchor a downtown building that includes several other retail spaces. Construction of the building employed roughly 60 construction workers, McCush said, and the restaurant is expected to employ 30 people full time. The restaurant is scheduled to open in April. McConnell is largely on target with his claim about the projects and the money they were awarded in stimulus funds. The application for money related to the martini bar has since been withdrawn, though it did initially receive the award. And so we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01449	Judithanne McLauchlan "was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/03/republican-party-florida/state-gop-tries-equate-judithanne-mclauchlan-state/	While Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes ran virtually unopposed for the redrawn 22nd district stretching across Tampa Bay in 2012, he’s facing a scrappy challenger in Democrat Judithanne McLauchlan this year. The Republican Party of Florida, acting on Brandes’ behalf, is attacking McLauchlan, a University of South Florida-St. Petersburg political science professor, on an issue where constituents are liable to pay most attention -- their wallets. In a TV commercial that began running in the Tampa Bay market on Sept. 22, 2014, Brandes implied that McLauchlan wants to break with Florida orthodoxy by supporting a state income tax. A similar claim has been made by fliers being mailed to voters' homes. The ad -- which features actors pretending to be students being quizzed by a teacher -- says, "McLauchlan was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians." It goes on to say, "McLauchlan: Personal bankruptcy and a new state income tax." Accusing an opponent of wanting to raise taxes is Political Campaigning 101, but did McLauchlan really associate with people who wanted to tax Floridians at a state level? Regressive facts McLauchlan responded to the commercial the day after it appeared, issuing a press release that called it a "repulsive attack" that used "unsubstantiated falsehoods." "I oppose, will always oppose, and have always opposed a state income tax," she declared. The ad also mentions her personal bankruptcy, which McLauchlan has blamed on paying for high health insurance premiums and a surgery while she was a graduate student in the 1990s. She said the debt was too much, even after she became employed, so she filed for bankruptcy 16 years ago. She says she has since repaired her credit and is debt-free. So where did Brandes and the state GOP get the notion about a state income tax? If you look at the fine print, it reads that McLauchlan "served on Board of Directors of League of Women Voters." The ad uses her campaign site as the source. The League of Women Voters bills itself as a nonpartisan political organization focused on developing informed policy positions and voter participation. It does not endorse candidates, and members from any political party may join. McLauchlan’s spokesman clarified that she is currently a member and was on the board of the St. Petersburg chapter from 2009-11, mostly working on voter registration initiatives. She also moderated candidate forums between 2011 and 2013. The Florida chapter of the group stated where it stood on the issue in its most recent guide to public policy positions: "The LWVF supports the adoption of a state personal income tax as one part of a balanced and equitable tax structure." The booklet notes that the position was revisited most recently in 1991, although as far back as a 1966-67 study it argued that a statewide funding source that "would both be equitable and produce sufficient revenue was a personal income tax." There also is a reference in the guide that says League representatives in 2007 spoke at seven statewide Taxation and Budget Reform Commission public hearings in favor of "an equitable tax system based upon ability to pay, which suggests a state income tax." Saying the group "supports imposing" the tax isn't accurate, however, because while the League researched the issue and found an income tax a sound alternative, it doesn't lobby for the change or push it as part of a legislative agenda. They give opinions on policy issues, but don't propose processes to change laws. We asked the Brandes campaign to clarify their argument. They pointed to a couple member requirements on the St. Pete chapter’s website: First, that members of a local chapter are also part of the state and national organizations, and that the group is "open to anyone who subscribes to the mission, principles, and policies of the League of Women Voters." Second, the site says that members can’t contradict the group. "Once League (local, state or national) takes a position on an issue, members may not identify themselves as League members in publicly expressing an opinion that is in opposition to a League position," the site reads. League of Women Voters of Florida President Deirdre Macnab said that doesn’t mean members can’t disagree, just that they can’t contradict the League’s positions as a spokesperson for the organization, such as while serving as a board member. If a board member of any chapter decides to run for political office, that person must resign from the board, although they may stay in the League. "There is no requirement that members must subscribe to every position the League takes," Macnab said, suggesting the Brandes campaign is misreading the guidelines they cited. "We do have local League presidents who speak on behalf of the League, but we encourage our members to think what they want to think." Macnab said the tax hasn’t been studied since the 1990s. She said she felt most economists would agree a statewide income tax is much more fair than the policies the state has now, relying disproportionately on sales taxes, which are regressive, and property taxes. (One-time gubernatorial hopeful Nan Rich claimed earlier this year that Florida had the third-most regressive tax structure in the country, a claim we rated Mostly True.) The issue isn’t on the table either way, Macnab said, because the state Constitution has provisions preventing the institution of an income tax. Doris Weatherford, an author, women’s historian and League member who met McLauchlan through her campaign, says the group doesn’t actively support a state income tax. The League has only taken an informed stance on a policy position, as it does with countless other issues. "In the case of the income tax, the position is that this is the fairest way, but we haven’t worked to make it happen," Weatherford said. "It’s been 25 years since that was part of the platform, but even then, it didn’t say we would work for it, and still doesn’t." Our ruling The state GOP said McLauchlan "was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians." That’s a stretch. The group was the League of Women Voters of Florida, which concluded -- about a quarter century ago -- that a state income tax would be a fairer way to collect revenue for state programs. The group hasn’t lobbied for that goal (or even revisited its stance in years) and McLauchlan, as a member of the group, isn’t forced to espouse a position on that issue. She denies that she supports it. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05517	Says the treasurer’s office has "saved $37 million in management costs for the oversight of public investments."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/12/ted-wheeler/did-ted-wheelers-office-actually-save-39-million-m/	PolitiFact Oregon is going to be bold and call the race for the state’s next treasurer. We know the election isn’t until November, but barring calamity, we’re pretty sure the winner will be the Democratic incumbent, Ted Wheeler. (There’s no Republican candidate in the race, and, sorry third-party candidates, but you probably won’t beat him.) The presumed win hasn’t stopped Wheeler from launching a campaign and it doesn’t stop us from checking the claimed accomplishments on his campaign website. Among them is this bullet point: "Saved $37 million in management costs for the oversight of public investments." Voters tend to like it when elected officials save taxpayer money, so we set out to find out how these savings had occurred. For example, did the office, under Wheeler’s leadership, do anything different to save these millions? We scrolled through Treasury press releases and found this from November 2011: "Oregon Treasury saved millions in management costs, comparative analysis shows." Here’s the smaller headline on that release: "Oregon’s costs were $39.3 million less than expected, based on benchmark of large funds." Wait, so Oregon didn’t "save" any money? We just didn’t spend as much as others? According to the press release, the study was conducted by CEM Benchmarking Inc. of Toronto. It rated Oregon’s costs associated with managing the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund against 18 other large pension funds. We found the report as presented to the Oregon Investment Council, the board oversees investments. And it’s accurate to say that as benchmarked, Oregon "saved" $39 million because we paid less for more expensive, but more profitable, private investments for the period ending December 2010. The fund paid more than $445 million in management costs, which is less than 0.9 percent of assets. (In case you’re wondering about the $2 million discrepancy, Wheeler’s website should state $39 million, not $37 million). In any case, that’s excellent news. But is it fair to call it money saved? The treasurer’s office thinks it’s fair since that is money the office could have spent but didn’t. "It is an accurate way to reflect a kind of savings," says Mike Mueller, the Treasury’s deputy chief investment officer and interim CIO. "... they take a snapshot and say based on this universe, we would expect your costs to be X but your costs were Y." Oregon has been regarded as a pioneer in private equity -- the more expensive to manage but more profitable investments -- since the 1980s, Mueller explained. Because Oregon has an older, more mature program, our management fees have declined over time. That’s why Oregon is lower relative to the peer group, he said. Bruce Hopkins, a vice president with CEM, says the $39 million "is very real," he said. "Oregon has been successful at getting lower fees. I would also give them some credit for seeing this as an appropriate asset class … they were getting into private equity deals that others hadn’t thought of yet." We checked previous years, to see how long the office has been "saving" money for taxpayers by paying lower-than-peer-group fees. It’s been as low as $11 million in 2001 and as high as $57 million in 2005. We should note that Randall Edwards was treasurer for much of the decade, from 2001 to 2009. Ben Westlund took office in January 2009 and served until he died of cancer in early 2010. Wheeler can’t take much personal credit for $39 million, although his office has negotiated savings. His spokesman sends along a 2011 press release that shows the office was able to negotiate even lower fees for a new investment. That likely will be reflected in future benchmarking reports. But that’s not what we’re talking about here. Wheeler said he stands by the campaign statement. "The results are for the time during which I was Treasurer and accountable for our activities and results." He pointed out that The Oregonian has also held him accountable for past office policies. We don’t agree. Had the treasurer’s office negotiated terms under Wheeler to net $39 million in actual savings from one year to the next, we would rate this statement much differently. Wheeler’s savings statement contains an element of truth. A third-party report showed that Oregon paid $39 million less in fees than its peers. But just because a peer group spent more than Oregon doesn’t mean Oregon was ever at risk of spending that much. Moreover, a key reason for our lower-than-peer-average fees is that our private investments are older, a crop of decisions that have nothing to do with Wheeler. These are critical facts that would give a different impression of the savings statement. We find the statement Mostly False.	None	Ted Wheeler	None	None	None	2012-04-12T17:26:56	2012-04-03	['None']

pomt-03810	While the sequester is in effect, the federal government is still funding a study on duck penises.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/22/tweets/federal-government-funding-study-duck-penises/	Sequestration is serious business. Jobs are on the line. Day care for poor kids is under the ax. Yet even in this budget climate, your federal government still has the money to pay for -- please disregard our blushing -- a study examining duck penises. You read that right: duck penises. This waterfowl kerfuffle erupted earlier this week, when the conservative website CNSNews.com published a story pulling back the curtain on a $384,949 grant from the National Science Foundation for a Yale University study looking at ducks’ sexual behavior and anatomy and the evolutionary consequences. "Many duck penises are corkscrew-shaped and some scientists believe this is because of a form of evolution known as ‘sexual conflict,’" the story said. Twitter quickly took up the cause: Can’t cut spending b/c need $ to fund more studies of duck penis length" @keithcrc, March 20. $384,949 Federal stimulus funds to study "Duck Penis Length". WH still closed to tours @cincinchili, March 21. "His name is Long Duck Dong." When you're enjoying your furlough, remember that duck penis length matters. @doctrine_man, March 21. So now PolitiFact is making it our cause. We’ll fact-check the Twitter chatter stating that the federal government is funding a study about duck penises amid the austere cuts of sequestration. ‘Anti-screw anatomy’ Richard Prum is an evolutionary ornithologist at Yale University. We got him on the phone to ask: Duck penises -- really? His answer was fascinating, but first here’s a little background. In 2009, Prum applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant for his study titled "Sexual Conflict, Social Behavior and the Evolution of Waterfowl Genitalia." (It has since been renamed "Conflict, Social Behavior and Evolution," according to NSF.) The money came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus. "The funding was for three years," Prum said. "We managed to expand to a fourth year by basically being frugal." Prum and lead investigator Patricia Brennan have published several papers from their research; several are in review now, and more are forthcoming. NSF awards about 11,000 grants a year, and the process is deeply competitive. "Funding rates in this area, animal behavior, are less than 10 percent," Prum said. "Getting this money is like into getting into Yale as an undergrad." The nearly $400,000 award paid Brennan’s salary, funded the experiments at the waterfowl laboratory, kept the birds healthy and fed and covered other costs such as publication expenses and equipment. Here, in Prum’s words, is what he studied and learned: "Most birds don’t have a penis. Ducks do. They still have it from the reptilian ancestor that they shared with mammals," he said. The duck’s penis is stored inside the body, and when it becomes erect, the process of insemination is "explosive," Prum said. The duck’s penis becomes erect within a third of a second, at the same time it enters the female duck’s body. Ejaculation is immediate, and then the penis starts to regress. The length of the duck penis, as mentioned in the tweets, grows to 8 or 9 inches during the summer mating season. In winter, it shrinks to less than an inch. In duck ponds, Prum said, a lot of forced copulation occurs. Forced copulation is what it sounds like -- rape in nature. Even gang rape happens among ducks. And Prum found that while 40 to 50 percent of duck sex happens by forced copulation, only 2 to 4 percent of inseminations result from it (meaning times the female duck ends up with a fertilized egg). "The question is why does that happen? How does a female prevent fertilization by forced copulation?" he said. "The answer has to do with taking advantage of what males have evolved -- this corkscrew shaped penis." Prum said the duck penis is a corkscrew whose direction runs counterclockwise. Female ducks, he said, have evolved a complex vagina also shaped like a corkscrew -- but a clockwise one. "This is literally an anti-screw anatomy," he said. When females choose their own partners -- in other words, solicit copulation -- the muscles in the vagina are dilated and expanded. So the anti-screw effect is negated. "The females are enormously, amazingly successful at preventing fertilization by forced copulation," he said. Now, if this steamy duck sex talk reminds you of a particular Senate candidate’s controversial rape comments in 2012, Prum is right there with you. Todd Akin, who ultimately lost his Senate contest in Missouri, angered a lot of people when he claimed, "If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down." Said Prum: "What we demonstrated is that what Senate candidate Akin said about rape is actually true of ducks, and why." "This to me is really about sexual autonomy, and that is why ducks are deeply important," he said. "In the face of persistent sexual violence, females have developed a mechanism to maintain control over sexual choice." If that explanation doesn’t meet your standard for useful science, Prum had this to say in defense of pure scientific research: "I have never abandoned my commitment to the notion that the primary commitment of science is to discover new knowledge. You never know when it’s going to be practical. Advanced cultures for all of history have tried to establish new knowledge." What’s this got to do with sequester? Prum’s grant began in 2009, funded by a law passed early that year that was meant to jumpstart the sputtering economy. The stimulus spending was meant to get out the door as quickly as possible, with much of spending set for 2009 and 2010. Sequestration -- sweeping budget cuts across all federal agencies -- came about from a budget deal in 2011. President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans passed sequestration as a means of forcing each other to a broader deal on deficit reduction. The cuts were never meant to be enacted, but since the two sides have not been able to strike a deal, they went into effect March 1. Democrats and Obama have decried the effects on average Americans, such as funding cuts to Head Start programs and delayed airline flights. Republicans, who are keen on trimming federal spending, have generally sounded less dire in their sequester warnings, but they’ve cried foul when the Obama administration announces such things as an end to White House tours. We should point out that in some ways, the sequester and the stimulus are two separate issues. House Republicans tried and failed to cancel unspent stimulus money. Most of the stimulus money is already out the door. The sequester, on the other hand, is intended to reduce government spending in the future. Does Prum’s grant have anything to do with the budgetary state we’re in now? Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact: "A lot of times scientific research is pilloried -- and sometimes deservedly so. It has to be taken in context of the need and results as well as the budgetary environment. "As far as linking stimulus spending and sequestration, you get to the heart of budgetary issues. Sequestration targets budget authority – the right an agency has to write a check, not outlays – the cash out the door. So the budget authority from the stimulus left the building a long time ago. It is well inside the outlay territory and not subject to sequestration." "All that said," he added, "the federal budget is a zero sum game and it is fair to compare spending on this here to spending or cuts over there. And the goofy is meant to make a point … but the reality can be quite tricky." Our ruling Folks in the twitterverse said the federal government is cutting services, furloughing employees and cancelling White House tours, but it still has the money to pay for a study examining duck penises. The study is real, and it does indeed explore the unique sexual behaviors and physical characteristics of ducks. It was funded through a National Science Foundation grant that expires this year. It’s a bit dubious to tie that grant, which was awarded with stimulus dollars, with the current budget cuts, because they arise from different budgetary issues. But is the government subsidizing research on duck penises? It sure is. We rate the tweets Mostly True. Editor's note: We updated this item on March 24, 2013, to clarify that ducks reproduce via fertilized eggs.	None	Tweets	None	None	None	2013-03-22T16:23:45	2013-03-20	['None']
pomt-03257	"Every (personhood) bill I’ve ever support has either had language that says we’re conforming to the constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court or something to that effect."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/10/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-his-support-fetal-personhood-was-a/	Republican Ken Cuccinelli says if he’s elected governor, he won’t push for strategic bills that could be used to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v Wade decision that established abortion rights. He made the declaration during a July 20 debate against Democrat Terry McAuliffe.

Cuccinelli, who has backed such legislation in the past, said "when those things hit my desk, I’ll be supportive of them, "but stressed that his focus is on jobs and the economy. "Certainly I want to respect life as best we can, but we can’t defy the (U.S.) Constitution as it stands now," Cuccinelli said. "Every bill I’ve ever supported has either had language that says we’re conforming to the constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court or language to that effect. I’m not looking to make a challenge in that respect." We wondered whether every bill that Cuccinelli has backed granting personhood to fetuses has contained language saying the legislation is not intended to challenge high court rulings. We found two clear occasions when he supported such legislation during his career as a state senator from 2002 to 2009 and attorney general starting in 2010. Ana Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s campaign, pointed us to a 2012 bill introduced by Del. Bob Marshall, R-Prince William. Cuccinelli spoke at a rally supporting the legislation on the state capitol’s grounds. The bill contained this clause: "The laws of this Commonwealth shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens and residents of this Commonwealth, subject only to the Constitution of the United States and decisional interpretations thereof by the United States Supreme Court and specific provisions to the contrary in the statutes and constitution of this Commonwealth." So this measure, which passed the House of Delegates and died in the Senate, supports Cuccinelli’s debate statement. But his campaign neglected to mention the other personhood bill Cuccinelli weighed in on, and it erodes the candidate’s claim. In 2007, Cuccinelli cosponsored unsuccessful legislation that said life begins at the moment of fertilization and extended the "right to the enjoyment of life" from that point onward. The bill contained no language deferring to Supreme Court precedence. Our ruling Cuccinelli said all the bills he’s supported defining life as beginning at conception have contained language saying measures are intended to comply with Supreme Court rulings on abortion rights. Cuccinelli has backed two bills during his career; one had the qualifying clause he described and the other -- which Cuccinelli cosponsored -- did not. We rate his statement False.

pomt-04477	Less than 10 percent of President Barack Obama’s Cabinet members have private-sector experience.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/08/chain-email/private-sector-experience-short-supply-obama-admin/	Ah, the stealthy side of politics. Stolen campaign yard signs. Anonymous fliers mailed to voters disparaging an opponent. And then there’s the chain email. A PolitiFact Georgia reader forwarded us an email sent her way about President Barack Obama and asked us to examine its veracity. The email was full of charts and graphs that would suggest Obama has done a poor job as president. Some have been widely discussed and examined by PolitiFact and other fact-checking operations, such as how many Americans are receiving food stamps and a comparison of unemployment rates under Obama and his two most recent predecessors. There was one comparison that has come up before that we felt compelled to address since it hasn’t been written about on our site. Under a chart titled "Cabinet Appointments: Prior Private Sector Experience, 1900-2009," it had Obama below the 10 percent mark. Could it be? Did less than 10 percent of Obama’s Cabinet appointments have private-sector experience before working for the president? The email ends with a request to forward it to at least two other people. "100 would be even better," it said. Those who receive the email may want to hold off before doing so to make sure they’re distributing accurate information. One consistent theme of criticism leveled against Obama is that he does not comprehend what the American economy needs in order to grow because the president doesn’t understand how the private sector works. Obama campaign officials respond that his economic policies helped keep the nation from falling into a depression and have resulted in a modest recovery. So what about his Cabinet? Obama critics appear to be fond of claiming the president’s Cabinet had little private-sector experience, using a chart that accompanied a column written in Forbes about Obama’s "business blind spot" in 2009. Obama had by far the lowest percentage on the chart. John F. Kennedy was the next lowest, with just below 30 percent of his Cabinet appointments having private-sector experience. Most of the others were between 40 percent and 50 percent. The writer, Michael Cembalest, examined the histories of nine Cabinet positions for the comparison. The departments they headed were Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury: Conservative commentator Glenn Beck talked about the chart on his show shortly afterward, saying less than 10 percent of Obama's Cabinet appointees "have any experience in the private sector." PolitiFact examined Beck’s statement, came across the Forbes article and did its own research. It found three Obama Cabinet members in those nine departments that Cembalest cited had significant corporate or business experience: Steven Chu in Energy, Shaun Donovan in HUD and Ken Salazar in Interior. Chu headed the electronics research lab at AT&T Bell Laboratories; Donovan served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co.; and Salazar has been a partner in his family's farm, and he owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado. Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas. Cembalest said that he did discount the corporate experience of Clinton, Vilsack and Locke. Cembalest acknowledged fault in missing Salazar's business background, saying he would have given him a full point if he had it to do over again. Cembalest said Chu and Donovan did not represent the kind of private-sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study. Cembalest said he did not mean for his research to be used for political ends. Beck got a False on the Truth-O-Meter for repeating the claim, holding the commentator accountable for his words. Nearly two years later, in August 2011, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a similar claim about Obama’s Cabinet during the early stages of her presidential bid. "[Obama] has virtually no one in his Cabinet with private-sector experience," she said. Not true. Her claim got a Pants on Fire. Once again, the chart contains data that the author has since said was missing some information. It seems clear that more than 10 percent of Obama’s Cabinet has private-sector experience. The authors of this chain email should know better by now. We say hit the delete button on this claim. Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-10-08T06:00:00	2012-09-27	['None']
pomt-04301	Says "Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations" on banks.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/31/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-roll-back-banking-regulati/	In the final days before the election, the Obama campaign has put up an ad that is a sort of Cliff Notes for voters before they walk into the voting booth. It lists many of the points Obama has used against Mitt Romney throughout this contest. It warns about the future of Medicare, support for education, tax breaks for the wealthiest, and banking regulation. On that last point, it says, "Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations on the banks that crashed our economy." This fact-check examines that claim and tries to discern what Romney would do about keeping banks clear of the excesses that contributed to the financial crisis. Romney has not spoken in detail about his financial regulation plans. Sifting through his website, interviews and his public comments, we see these core elements: • He would repeal Dodd-Frank, the wide-ranging law that aims to fix many of the lapses associated with the meltdown. Romney has said he would replace the law but has not gone much beyond that concept. • Romney supports the idea of regulations. "Extensive regulation is appropriate in an industry that has such an impact on the overall economy," he said in an interview with Time. • Romney supports rules to ensure that banks have their own money at risk, as this promotes greater caution. "You have to have rules for what kind of capital has to stand behind each kind of asset on Wall Street and banks," he said on 60 Minutes. This is part of current law. • He supports greater transparency for derivatives trading. He told a group of Americans in London, mainly bankers, that "we do need to have greater transparency in the trading of derivatives, so we know what’s going on -– what kind of exposures various institutions have." Derivatives as investment devices are not inherently bad but they helped hide the weaknesses of the home mortgage market and increased the exposure of many investors when the sector collapsed. Dodd-Frank has a detailed approach to shedding light on derivatives trading. • Romney opposes the current plan for orderly liquidations when banks fail. "We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks," Romney said in the first presidential debate. However, he has not said how he would change the current law. • Romney believes regulators should move faster to define the minimum standards for a home mortgage loan. The Obama campaign backs up its claim with a Boston Globe article from last spring. The article emphasizes that Romney says he would do away with Dodd-Frank without saying what would replace it. Since that time, Romney has said a bit more, captured in that list above, but not much more. In May, one of Romney’s top economic advisers, Glenn Hubbard, said the public could expect more detailed proposals on several key fronts, including what to do if one of the biggest banks fails, consumer financial protections, and housing finance. However, those proposals never appeared. The only detail from Hubbard himself targeted the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That agency, created under Dodd-Frank, aims to stand between individuals and the marketing of unfair and deceptive financial services. Hubbard said the bureau might be moved or dismantled, with its functions passed along to existing agencies. The lack of specifics from Romney has left many people reading the tea leaves. Kenneth Scott is professor of law and business at Stanford Law School. "I very much doubt that if Romney won there would be a blanket repeal of Dodd-Frank, but there would be an effort at significant amendments," Scott said. Some have looked to Congress for clues. A Bloomberg article described the changes Republicans have passed or introduced. High on the list are looser rules governing the trade in derivatives, and especially the financial practice called "swaps." Swaps are basically insurance against the risk that a borrower won’t repay a loan. It gets more exotic, but that’s the central idea, and it’s very big business. Swaps delivered $7 billion in revenues to banks in the first quarter of 2012. Swaps played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis. Bloomberg and other news organizations have listed other areas where Republicans have worked to ease financial regulations, such as reversing the Volker Rule, which limits banks on using customer deposits to invest in trades offered by an arm of the same bank. Bloomberg offered this summary: Dodd-Frank would remain but it would be "a revamped Dodd-Frank that would accommodate some of the most profitable and riskiest activities while preserving a patina of protection for investors and consumers." Still, the precise changes Romney would support are unknown. In addition, some would argue that whatever changes emerge would not increase the odds of another financial crisis. For example, Lawrence White, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, believes the current law on big banks makes risky behavior more likely. "Repealing THAT part of Dodd-Frank would not ‘roll back regulation on the banks that crashed our economy,’ quite the contrary," White said. We asked the Romney campaign for more specifics in several areas but received no further information. Our ruling The Obama ad says "Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations" on banks. Romney has provided scant details on his plans, but he has said that he would push for changes. Romney has never suggested that tougher regulations are needed, and he has said many times that government regulates too much. It is reasonable to conclude his plans would be more in line with current Republican initiatives than the present law passed by Democrats. That direction points toward fewer restrictions than are in place under Dodd-Frank. Certainly, Romney has said that the provisions for the largest banks should be replaced. Conservative analysts would say that these changes would not put the financial system at greater risk. However, the ad simply says Romney would roll back regulations on the institutions that contributed to the financial crisis. How much of a rollback is unclear, but Romney does support a lighter regulatory touch on banks, so we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02718	"Scott Walker raises nearly 70 percent of his money from out of state"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/22/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-70-percent-money-contributed-scott/	Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign had a healthy $2.2 million on hand at last count -- and that was after he dropped $2 million getting his 2014 re-election machine revved up. Mary Burke, the Madison Democrat challenging him, tries to use Walker’s state and national fundraising prowess against him as she courts donors for her campaign. "Will I be out-fundraised? Yes," Burke told the Journal Sentinel Dec. 13, 2013, repeating a claim she has made on the campaign trail. She added: "When Scott Walker raises nearly 70% of his money from out of state, that's going to be hard to beat. But what I feel is I'll be able to raise what I need to get the message out. My money is going to come largely from the people of Wisconsin." Only time will tell if Burke gets the nomination and is outspent by Walker. She’s expected to tap her personal wealth. But we can take a look at her claim that Walker gets more than two-thirds of his campaign cash from outside Wisconsin. Did the governor, in the year after his recall election, still attract that level of interest from around the country? Different ways to count it Burke didn’t specify a time period for her claim, so there are different ways to look at it. For example, about 62 percent of Walker’s total fundraising from his first days as governor in January 2011 through the midway point of 2013 -- the most recent reporting period available -- came from out-of-state donors. Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said she meant funds raised for the 2014 election cycle. That’s a logical way to frame it, given that Burke is jumping in during that cycle. Zepecki said Burke specifically meant funds raised after the recall election Walker won on June 5, 2012. She crunched the numbers herself using the database maintained by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a widely used source on campaign fundraising. Of $4.8 million raised by Walker after June 5, 2012, 68 percent was from states other than Wisconsin, we found when using the Democracy Campaign data’s advanced search function. The data is current through June 30, 2013, when candidates last reported their fundraising to the state. So by that accounting Burke appears to be on target. But there is a problem with her analysis. The Democracy Campaign, when it issues its own reports, uses July 1, 2012 as the start date of the 2014 season. By that timeline, 59 percent of Walker’s individual receipts since then were from out of state. (Data note: The Democracy Campaign data omits some donors under $100, but that makes little difference in the bottom line.) There’s a second way to look at this, and it’s the official way described in state statutes. State law defines the recall period as extending to July 31, 2012. That July 31 marker recognizes the fact that campaigns don’t close the books on an election for several weeks or months after the polls close. Donations, for example, continue to come in, and bills must be paid. Walker booked more than $3 million in the eight weeks after the recall election, reflecting the tail end of the frenzied recall fundraising period. He booked more than 39,000 donations between June 6 and June 30 alone. Activity in his campaign accounts slowed to a trickle after July 31. So those late-June donations are pretty clearly related to the recall, and are officially considered so, but Burke’s timeframe includes them. And that makes a significant difference, because Walker’s recall fundraising was truly a national affair. Crunching our own numbers So to get the "official" number we crunched the numbers from Walker’s state campaign reports starting with donations after July 31, 2012. As part of this, we examined all individual donations instead of excluding those smaller than $100. Bottom line: We found of the $3.6 million Walker raised from the official post-recall start date of July 31 to June 30, 2013, some 56 percent was from out of state. So, still a solid majority from out of state, but not the two-thirds Burke claimed. There’s not a perfect way to do this, because Walker is free to carry over unspent recall funds and use them in the 2014 race. Walker raised money from every state in the period. Wisconsin was king, by far, followed by Texas, Illinois, Florida and California. His very largest donors are mostly from out of state "While some candidates are able to turn to a vast personal fortune to fund their campaign, we rely on folks who believe in what we’re doing, and support us by contributing their hard-earned money," Walker campaign spokesman Jonathan Wetzel said when asked about out of state contributions. In the period, 75 percent of Walker’s contributors gave $50 or less. Burke will file her first six-month campaign report in late January 2014. Our rating Burke said that "Scott Walker raises nearly 70 percent of his money from out of state." By her layman’s definition of the 2014 campaign season, she’s on target. But the number drops to 56 percent if you use the official state definition of the 2014 cycle -- an approach that weeds out a mountain of recall-related donations from the analysis, as Burke’s campaign said she intended. We rate her claim Mostly False. To comment on this article, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2013-12-22T05:00:00	2013-12-13	['None']

pomt-09025	“We are picking up oil with shovels and paper and plastic bags.”	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/07/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-critical-oil-spill-clean-efforts/	Everything from human hair to industrial vacuums has been used in the effort to soak up the globs of oil floating along the Gulf coast. But when it comes to getting rid of the tar balls washing up on the Florida Panhandle’s pristine beaches, Marco Rubio, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has some misgivings about the clean-up efforts. “We are talking about the richest and most powerful country in the world, and we are picking up oil with shovels and paper and plastic bags,” Rubio said June 26, 2010, during an interview on the show “Fox and Friends.” He added: “You would think that at this point every skimmer on the planet earth would be working off the coast of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, etc., and they are not. They are not out there.” Rubio has not backed down from his initial support of off shore drilling, “so long as it can be done safely,” said campaign spokesman Alex Burgos. During a May 5th press availability in Washington D.C, Rubio noted: "I've not heard anyone say you cannot safely drill for oil because there are thousands of rigs drilling even as we speak that are not leaking, that are not causing this ecological disaster." As tar balls, tar patties, tar mats, and any other conceivable name for the patches of rusty brown and black oil, continue to wash up on the Panhandle’s white sand beaches, we decided to take a closer look at Rubio’s statement on “Fox and Friends.” More specifically, his claim that only “shovels and paper and plastic bags” were being used in the effort. If hair and rubber tires are being used in the on-water efforts, surely there are other ways the gunk is being removed from the beaches? (By the way, we bring first-hand experience to this one. This PolitiFact Florida reporter is just back from weeks of reporting in the Panhandle, in between fact-checking duties. We walked the beaches in 100-degree heat with BP clean-up crews and saw first-hand the painstaking work of sifting through the sand to pick up gooey tar balls.) When we turned to Rubio’s campaign, Burgos told us to look no further than this June 29 photo from the Pensacola News Journal to prove Rubio’s claim. Sure enough, the picture, like hundreds of others taken along the Gulf Coast, shows plenty of plastic bags and shovels in sight. Paper bags, not so much. BP has said it plans to hire nearly 6,850 local beach clean-up workers along the Panhandle, to perform work like scooping up tar ball-mixed sand into “into 6-millimeter-thick plastic bags known as drum liners that they fill up to 20 pounds and then seal off with duct tape,” as detailed in a June 22 Miami Herald article. Those bags are eventually sent to Alabama to be incinerated or sent to a landfill in Campbellton, FL, on the Georgia border. The majority of clean-up efforts rely on manual labor, with workers wearing protective gear like thick rubber gloves and plastic cover-up suits. BP is largely steering away from using large machinery on the beach for several reasons. Bulldozers, for example, are not able to distinguish between oil debris and eggs laid by endangered sea turtles and shore birds. BP officials also say thick tar clogs mechanical rakes. The machinery that is being used is largely out on the water, in the form of skimming vessels, that scoop up the thick mats of oil that have formed on the surface of the water. There are currently five state-leased skimming vessels working off the Florida panhandle, but elected officials and Panhandle residents alike have complained, as Rubio does, that more skimmers should have been deployed by BP and the federal government right after the oil rig explosion to keep oil from creeping toward the shoreline in the first place. So while Rubio may have been slightly off when saying paper bags were used in the clean-up effort, there’s plenty of plastic bags and shovels being used to haul off the tar balls. We find his claim True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-07-07T18:34:06	2010-06-26	['None']

pomt-11783	"Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn."	false	/missouri/statements/2017/nov/24/ann-wagner/satanic-temple-has-not-teamed-planned-parenthood-o/	U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., has been circulating a petition, encouraging constituents to add their names to "Stand for Life" against Satanists, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. She’s posted on Twitter and Facebook, linking to a petition on her campaign website, that says "Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn." She went into more detail in an Oct. 25 Facebook post, Wagner wrote, "As Planned Parenthood continues its march through Missouri to expand abortion practices, an organization called the Satanic Temple has emerged as their ally, pressuring legislators and filing state and federal lawsuits in an attempt to erase protections for the unborn. I refuse to stand by as unabashed Satanists challenge our respect for life in Missouri. Add your name to stand in support of life." In her social media posts, Wagner also includes a graphic that shows a red pentacle next to the text, "Stand Against Planned Parenthood and The Church of Satan." We reached out to Wagner to see where she was getting this information. Her campaign manager, Brecht Mulvihill, sent us a link to a statement from The Satanic Temple, and linked to articles from The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Newsweek, Slate and Huffington Post. We wanted to know, has The Satanic Temple "teamed up" with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri as Wagner claims on her website? Separate cases Planned Parenthood and The Satanic Temple have taken separate court cases seeking to lower restrictions on abortion in Missouri. In November 2016, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging a Missouri statute that required abortion clinics to be licensed as "ambulatory surgical centers." The lawsuit also challenged requirements that stipulated that physicians who provide abortions must have admitting privileges from a nearby hospital. After a judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and Director of Department of Health and Senior Services Randall Williams appealed the case. Most recently, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri lost a separate lawsuit that challenged the state’s 72-hour waiting period requirement. The Satanic Temple has filed its own lawsuits at both a state and federal level challenging the state’s informed consent materials, ultrasound and 72-hour waiting period requirements. The organization is claiming the requirements violated a Satanic Temple member’s First Amendment rights. One of the first outlets to report the simultaneous court cases was a Slate article published on Sept. 12. The author suggests a recent increase in abortion access in the state may be because of The Satanic Temple’s lawsuit, writing, "Missouri’s recent stroke of good fortune in the reproductive rights realm may have to do with intervention from the fiery underworld." The Slate article was picked up by other sites and is referenced in other articles from outlets such as The Kansas City Star and Patheos. Brietbart also wrote about the recent efforts by Planned Parenthood and The Satanic Temple. However, the Brietbart article took the story a bit further and claimed in its headline that the two organizations teamed up and that, "The Satanic Temple has often lent its muscle to pro-abortion efforts alongside Planned Parenthood." The fact-checking website Snopes debunked this and rated this claim false in a fact-check published on Sept. 14. The Satanic Temple also tweeted about their independence: "Teaming up" Wagner not only claimed that The Satanic Temple was "teaming up" with Planned Parenthood, but also the ACLU. Spokespersons from both organizations said there was no relationship with the temple. Lucien Greaves, co-founder and spokesman for The Satanic Temple, said early attempts to get the ACLU’s help didn’t work. "We are not collaborating nor competing with Planned Parenthood and we have no formal relationship with the organization," Greaves said. "We contacted the ACLU of Missouri when we were initially seeking legal counsel for the case we’re now litigating. After a few enthusiastic calls wherein we were led to believe they were interested in taking our case they soon stopped responding to our messages and we never heard from them again." Laurie F. Maffly-Kipp, a professor in the humanities and religious studies program at Washington University in St. Louis, observed that Wagner may be drawing connections between the two groups for political reasons. "It looks like a scare tactic to me," Maffly-Kipp said. "My observation is that many conservative Christians use the specter of Satanism as a way to rally support behind their cause." Church of Satan So what does The Church of Satan have to do with all of this? In Wagner’s Facebook post, she names The Satanic Temple in the text but also names The Church of Satan in the accompanying graphic. Those are two separate organizations. The Church of Satan pointed this out to Wagner by replying to her tweet with the incorrect graphic on Oct. 25, writing, "We have nothing to do with this," and linking to a statement on its website. We reached out to The Church of Satan, which confirmed that Wagner seems to have its organization confused with The Satanic Temple. The Church of Satan said it has not received a response from Wagner to its tweet, and said it believes the confusion began with "a mix of ignorance, laziness, and intentional misinformation." Our ruling Rep. Ann Wagner claimed on her campaign website that "Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn." The Satanic Temple, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have all disputed the notion that the organizations are collaborating, teaming up or acting as allies. Furthermore, Wagner has incorrectly lumped the Church of Satan with The Satanic Temple. To hell with this claim. We rate it False.

pomt-04725	Barack Obama began his presidency "with an apology tour."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-barack-obama-began-his-presidency/	In his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president, Mitt Romney repeated a charge he’s made before: that Obama has traveled the world apologizing for America. "I will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators," Romney said. We first fact-checked this claim back in 2010, when Romney published a book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. Obama’s apology tour, Romney wrote, "is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." It’s a common theme for some anti-Obama websites and commentators. But is it accurate? Obama’s early travels and remarks We looked at the seven separate speeches Romney mentioned in his book as apologies. (We've compiled those passages in a separate document.) At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he talks about two sides coming together. At a town hall meeting in France in 2009, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. At a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Looking back at those 2009 speeches, we noticed that Obama was most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." Apologies -- or diplomatic language? In 2010, we quizzed several experts about whether Obama had apologized. Here’s a brief recap of what they had to say (read more here): • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing. He co-wrote an analysis on the topic: "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama used conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology." • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks were really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • We spoke with Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who tracked international human rights issues via the website Political Apologies and Reparations. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Actual apologies In the years since we first looked into this matter, Obama or someone in his administration has formally apologized for U.S. actions. In 2012, Obama apologized for the accidental burning of copies of the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Obama sent the apology in a letter to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Officials hoped the formal apology would quell violent reactions against U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A few months later, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized to Pakistan for a Nov. 26, 2011, incident involving the death of Pakistani troops. The apology was made as part of an effort to re-open supply routes to U.S. troops in Afghanistan. We should note that these apologies came toward the end of Obama’s first term, while Romney said Obama "began" his presidency with an apology tour. Our ruling Romney said Obama began his presidency "with an apology tour." But a review of Obama’s foreign travels and remarks during his early presidency showed no evidence to support such a blunt and disparaging claim. (In later years, we found two formal apologies, but they were not at the start of his presidency and not part of a tour.) While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, he typically combined those passages with praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries had erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch. Calling those remarks "an apology tour" is a ridiculous charge. So we rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12393	"I think if you look at the entire federal government and the president’s commitment to (fighting opioid addiction), you’ll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/may/26/tom-price/dhhs-secretary-tom-price-says-hundreds-millions-mo/	President Donald Trump has made a lot of promises to solve the country’s opioid crisis, which killed over 33,000 people in 2015 alone. They included the pledge to build a wall on the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico and Latin America and more money to accelerate new treatment and prevention programs. Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway reiterated Trump’s commitment to end the opioid crisis this month, as they visited New Hampshire - a state that has been one of the hardest hit by drug deaths. Their visit came a week after it was announced that the Trump administration had been planning to gut the Office of National Drug Control Policy, slashing the long-running agency's budget by $364 million, or about 95 percent, in its proposed budget. As it turned out, they did not go through with such a steep cut in Trump’s final budget. Asked about the proposed cuts, Price said, "I think if you look at the entire federal government and the president’s commitment to this challenge, you’ll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue." But do Trump’s proposals mesh with Price’s statements about increasing money for treatment, prevention and recovery? Crunching the numbers To get some clarity, we reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services to get a numbers breakdown. A spokesman for HHS responded, pointing to funding in the Congressional omnibus bill, the temporary spending measure to keep the government running that was passed in early May. "At minimum, the Omnibus provides $213 million in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic across the federal government," Alleigh Marre said. "With all that in mind, the Secretary’s comment that there is a ‘hundreds of millions of dollars increase’ across the federal government, is true." However, that number includes money that was passed by Congress in 2016, before Trump was president, and doesn’t account for the president’s proposed federal budget. Here’s the breakdown of what’s in that number: $500 million in 21st Century Cures Act grant money, which was passed by Congress under President Obama. $150 million as part of the 2017 omnibus, which includes money for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Health Resources and Services Administration to fight addiction. Marre also highlighted $12.5 million in funding for four new heroin enforcement groups within the DEA and $50 million to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to fund opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. But since Price cited Trump’s commitment to combat the opioid crisis, it’s important to note what money was approved before he took office. Budget and health care bill Beyond these budget increases, however, experts on addiction and recovery say that other proposals by Trump won’t help ease the opioid crisis and could actually make it worse. His budget is asking for almost $400 million in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which could result in fewer mental health block grants being distributed. And the recently proposed Republican health care bill, which Trump supports, proposes drastic cuts to Medicaid. The House bill calls for $800 billion of cuts to Medicaid in 10 years, on top of the $610 billion cut to Medicaid benefits sought in Trump’s budget. That means Medicaid spending could be cut by 45 percent in 10 years. This has serious implications for people who get health insurance through expanded Medicaid in New Hampshire and elsewhere, many of whom get mental health treatment and substance abuse coverage paid. And that has many treatment advocates in New Hampshire worried. "We need a system of response that includes access to treatment, recovery, and also, we have to address the supply side through supporting law enforcement in their work. I’m not seeing evidence that that’s actually happening," said Linda Saunders Paquette, director of treatment advocacy organization New Futures. It’s worth noting that the president’s budget is just a blueprint; members of Congress have said they are unlikely to approve the spending plan as written. Our Ruling Citing Trump’s commitment to fight the country’s opioid crisis, Price said the government is already spending "hundreds of millions of dollars" more to that end. More funding was approved in the recent Congressional omnibus bill to keep the government running, but other policies he’s seeking to pursue -- notably cuts to Medicaid -- could wipe out that increase and then some. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Tom Price	None	None	None	2017-05-26T17:29:05	2017-05-10	['None']
pomt-08967	"Have the suburbs been inundated with former residents of Atlanta housing projects? Absolutely not."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/20/barney-simms/are-former-atlanta-tenants-flooding-suburbs/	It's been a constant refrain in Atlanta's suburbs when there is a rise in crime. Those crime spikes are often blamed on people who used to live in the Atlanta projects. A frustrated Atlanta Housing Authority official addressed the claims in an open letter last month. "Have the suburbs been inundated with former residents of Atlanta housing projects? Absolutely not," said Barney Simms, the authority's chief external affairs officer. We decided to look into the matter. Have former housing project residents relocated to the suburbs? Or have they stayed within the city of Atlanta? The AHA built what's widely believed to be the first public housing complex in the nation, Techwood Homes in 1936. By the 1970s, many AHA developments developed reputations as high-crime areas. One apartment complex, East Lake Meadows, was so dangerous that residents called it "Little Vietnam" because of the constant shootings there. City leaders and police tried many efforts to improve public safety inside and around some of the projects. In one five-month stretch in 2007, five men were shot and killed in one AHA development, Bowen Homes. In 1994, Renee Glover became the AHA's executive director and embarked on a new strategy to transform its older developments into mixed-income communities, thinking, in part, that it would reduce crime. Some tenants moved elsewhere, using rent subsidy vouchers called Section 8. Others returned to AHA properties once they've been redeveloped. The latest round of redevelopment began in 2007. The Quality of Life Initiative, as the most recent effort was called, included the demolition and redevelopment of 10 apartment complexes and two senior citizen high-rises. In August 2007, Clayton County officials considered a plan that would require they have a copy of all residential lease agreements. The idea, Commission Chairman Eldrin Bell said at the time, was to know who was in the county and better respond to any problems unruly renters cause. Some Clayton officials worried former Atlanta Housing Authority tenants were moving into apartment complexes in north Clayton and largely responsible for a spike in violence. Former state Sen. Steen Miles made a similar claim about former AHA tenants in DeKalb County in an April newspaper editorial and in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "The people dumped from the Atlanta housing projects went to Clayton and DeKalb counties," she told the AJC. Did they come to Clayton and DeKalb? We reached out to the AHA. Its Housing Choice division tracks where its former tenants have moved. Longtime journalist John Sugg, a former senior editor of Creative Loafing, is using their data and additional research to write a book on the authority. He presented PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet from the AHA that tracks the whereabouts of about 2,600 households since the Quality of Life Initiative began. The AHA data show 2,251 households stayed inside Atlanta city limits. It shows 344 households, 13 percent, moved to other parts of metro Atlanta. The bulk of those people moved to Decatur, College Park and East Point. Since those figures come from the AHA, we looked to see if anyone else is tracking such data. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department does not track where former AHA tenants are using Section 8 vouchers, a HUD spokesman said. We did find one group that has done its own research. Georgia State University's Urban Health Initiative has been tracking the progress of tenants who lived in six AHA developments since 2008: Bankhead Courts, Bowen Homes, Herndon Homes, Hollywood Courts, Palmer House and Roosevelt House. The latter two developments are senior citizen high-rises. Their research showed 15 percent of those 330 households now live outside the city, said Deirdre Oakley, an associate professor of sociology at the university. Oakley said there's been no evidence from their group's research that shows a spike in crime in neighborhoods where these former tenants have moved. "It's easy because of the publicity that AHA has gotten to say, 'Oh, look! It's public housing from Atlanta moving into our neighborhoods,' " she said. Since an average of four people live in each AHA apartment, we multiplied that number by 344 households that AHA says has moved to other parts of metro Atlanta. That's about 1,400 people. Clayton County's population is nearly 276,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. DeKalb County's population is slightly more than 747,000, the Census Bureau data show. Even if all 1,400 of those people moved to one of those counties, is it fair to say one of those places has been "inundated" with former AHA tenants? We don't think so. The data from the AHA and Georgia State both reach similar conclusions that the percentage of tenants moving out of the city has been small. Therefore, we rate Simms' statement as True.

pomt-01020	More "than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/30/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-more-80-percent-us-sexual-traffic/	Sex trafficking, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn declared, isn’t confined to other countries. The Texas Republican said in a Jan. 27, 2015, floor speech: "You might envision brothels in foreign cities or girls being smuggled across other borders, but the sad reality is human trafficking is a problem all across the United States and at all times of the year. "But it's especially a problem surrounding big public events like the Super Bowl," Cornyn said, a theme that drew the attention of PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. "Yes, human trafficking is happening right in our own backyard, and more than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens." Sex trafficking is -- as defined by the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000 -- a circumstance "in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age." We were curious about citizens accounting for most U.S. sex trafficking victims. Cornyn relied on 2011 government report To our query, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out an April 2011 report from the Bureau of Statistics in the Department of Justice. "This is the latest national study available that examines the citizenship status of trafficking victims," Brandewie said by email. That report says that from January 2008 through June 2010, 83 percent of confirmed U.S. victims in incidents opened for investigation of sex trafficking (including of prostitution or sexual exploitation of a child) identified by federally funded task forces were U.S. citizens. Confusingly to us, though, a chart in the report indicates 345 of 460 confirmed sex trafficking victims, or 75 percent, were U.S. citizens; the next-most-prevalent identities were undocumented (64) and of unknown citizenship (41). By email, bureau statistician Tracey Kyckelhahn, who contributed to the research, told us the report’s declared 83 percent figure was reached by setting aside (not considering) the victims of unknown citizenship in its calculation. "If you don’t know whether a victim is a citizen or not, they cannot be included because you don’t know where to put them. You would have to make an assumption about their citizen status," Kyckelhahn wrote. This decision reduced total confirmed sex trafficking victims to 419, elevating the share of U.S. citizens among confirmed victims to 83 percent. More broadly, the bureau cautioned us against reaching national conclusions from its study. That is, Kyckelhahn emailed, the resulting "numbers are not national numbers. They’re based only" on "some task forces." The point: The counted victims were confirmed by 18 of 42 "high quality" federally funded task forces representing law enforcement agencies that regularly recorded new cases; provided individual-level information for at least one suspect or victim; and regularly updated case information, the report said. Asked if there is national research on what Cornyn singled out, Kyckelhahn replied: "I seriously doubt there are national estimates," though there are probably city-specific numbers. Advocates' analyses We sought other expertise, starting with Malika Saada Saar of Rights4Girls, which describes itself as a human rights organization focused on gender-based violence and its impact on the country’s vulnerable young women and girls. Saar, recommended by Brandewie, said by email the idea most victims are citizens is consistent with data she has seen emerging from California, Florida, New York and Connecticut "where many, if not most, of the children identified as trafficked and exploited are U.S. kids." Also, she said, it’s consistent with what her group hears from organizations serving trafficked and exploited children and youth. A web search led us to Carol Smolenski, executive director of Brooklyn-based ECPATUSA, a group whose mission is to "protect every child’s basic human right to grow up free from the threat of sexual exploitation and trafficking." Smolenski, who said she’s worked against child trafficking for nearly a quarter century, said generally, the lack of valid trafficking data "has always been the problem." And, she said by phone, there isn’t comprehensive national research showing the citizenship of U.S. sex trafficking victims. Smolenski said it’s likely the 83 percent figure that Cornyn relied on overstates the prevalence of U.S. citizens among victims. That’s because international victims living here are "hidden within immigrant communities," Smolenski said, and less likely to be noticed by police like ones participating in the task forces cited by the Justice Department. Smolenski guided us to Shared Hope International, a U.S. group that combats sex trafficking. By phone, administrator Jocelyn Bell told us the 83 percent figure is the only known indicator of citizenship--and an incomplete one. "Unfortunately," Bell said by phone, the national "research just isn’t there/hasn’t been funded." So, she said, "we just aren’t sure" what which victims nationally are citizens. By email, Brandewie pointed out the senator relied on a government report that hasn’t been contradicted by other research. Our ruling Cornyn said more "than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens." That’s consistent with the only available figure we spotted. But you can get to 75 percent from the same study and, perhaps more significantly, a statistician involved in the work advises against saying the 83-percent figure, based on information from 18 law enforcement task forces, reflects the share of victims who are citizens across the country. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-09604	"Close to half of the folks in this country illegally entered legally (but) overstayed (their ) visas."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jan/18/marco-rubio/fla-republican-rubio-says-close-half-illegal-immig/	Florida U.S. Senate hopeful Marco Rubio has hit the big time -- Glenn Beck's radio program. During a wide-ranging interview on Jan. 14, 2010, Beck told Rubio that illegal immigration would be the big issue of the fall 2010 election. Rubio responded that he thinks Republicans need to be the party that supports and promotes legal immigration. Then, he added: "Close to half of the folks in this country illegally, entered legally (but) overstayed (their) visas," Rubio said. "So we've got to get a hold of this visa program, too." Rubio, the son of Cuban-born parents, claims people remaining in the United States on expired visas are nearly as big a problem as people illegally crossing the U.S. border. Is he right? The border, of course, continues to be the dominant symbol of the immigration debate (see phrases "secure the border" and "border fence" for proof), but more and more questions are being asked about people who enter the United States legally but fail to leave when they should. At least four of the 9/11 terrorists were in America on expired visas, and the government has been criticized for lacking a system that can track or even count the number of people living in the country on expired visas. To back Rubio's claim, spokesman Alex Burgos directed us to a 2006 National Public Radio report about illegal immigration. The report, filed from the U.S.-Mexico border in Douglas, Ariz., said that "nearly half the 12 million people illegally in the country didn't cross the desert or pay a smuggler ... they crossed legally at a point of entry." The NPR story points to a study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, a group that examines the U.S. Hispanic population. The Pew report, published in May 2006, indeed concludes that 40 to 50 percent of people living in the United States illegally entered the country legally through ports of entry. The percentages are right in line with what Rubio suggested on the Beck program. How did Pew get there? Pew relied on a 1997 Immigration and Naturalization Service report that attempted to quantify the number of people overstaying visas. The INS report tried to match arrival and departure documents of people entering and leaving the United States to calculate how many people were living in the country on expired visas or expired border crossing cards. It concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the country legally. That data became the baseline for future government studies. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the General Accounting Office took the data collected by the INS (now Citizenship and Immigration Services), and tried to extrapolate their own estimates. The Department of Homeland Security released a report in January 2003 that found 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. Trying to make the same estimate, the General Accounting Office produced three percentages using different methodology. In one case, the GAO used a survey of more than 1,000 adult green-card holders finding that of the 300 who admitted once being in the country illegally, 31 percent said they had overstayed their visas. In a second scenario, the GAO used arrest data on a group of 917 illegal immigrants and found that 246, or 27 percent, had been in the United States on expired visas. A second set of arrest data provided a much different result. Of 243 cases of illegal immigrants working at retail chain stores, 138 (57 percent) had been living on outdated visas. The GAO said that the Department of Homeland Security's methodology was "complex, indirect, and marked by potential weaknesses." Back to the Pew estimate. Researchers at Pew say they took the 1997 government report and tried to apply it to 2005, with a few minor modifications. Pew concluded that of the then 11.5 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States, 4.5 million to 6 million entered the country legally. Researchers admit it's an estimate. (The overall number of illegal residents also is an estimate, it's worth noting. According to USA Today, the department estimates the number of illegal residents by subtracting the number of foreign-born people who are in the United States legally from the Census estimate of the total foreign-born population. The most recent estimate, from January 2009, puts the number of illegal residents at about 11.6 million.) "The government has a pretty good idea of how many people come into the country if they fill out one of the forms, but it does not have a full count of how many leave," the Pew report said. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which now includes Citizenship and Immigration Services, told PolitiFact he is unaware of any other government studies attempting to quantify the number of people overstaying their visas. Pew also says the government has not published any new estimates. We couldn't find any, either. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in December that while the government is working on a way to document, and ultimately apprehend, people overstaying their visas, one doesn't exist yet. "I don't think that we can say with precision what percentage of visa holders are stay over," Napolitano told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "But I think we can say that the issue of the visa overstays has been one of the kind of most difficult but top priority problems that we've been working on this last 10 months." What we're left with then is a series of numbers -- all different, all educated guesses. Rubio says close to half of all illegal immigrants entered this country legally but overstayed their visas. Some estimates, by Pew and one by the GAO, support that. But others put the number lower, closer to one-third. The difference between the estimates represents about 2 million people, not an insignificant number. We can't fault Rubio for using the numbers he did. But it seems like adding a little context would be appropriate. We rate Rubio's claim Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-01-18T17:27:13	2010-01-14	['None']

And that’s how it’s working right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-construction-workers-pay-higher-/	In several appearances recently, President Barack Obama has emphasized tax fairness across the income spectrum. In remarks in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sept. 22, 2011, Obama sought to promote his American Jobs Act by visiting a "functionally obsolete" bridge spanning the Ohio River. The bill, he said, "would put people back to work rebuilding America -- repairing our roads, repairing our bridges, repairing our schools." During the speech, Obama said that "a construction worker who’s making $50 or $60 grand a year shouldn’t be paying higher tax rates than the guy who’s making $50 million a year. And that’s how it’s working right now. Because they get all these loopholes and tax breaks that you don’t get." A few days before Obama’s visit to the bridge, we published a story analyzing a similar comment Obama made in a speech on the economy. "Middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires," Obama said in the earlier speech. "That’s pretty straightforward. It’s hard to argue against that. Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett. There is no justification for it. It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in $50 million. Anybody who says we can’t change the tax code to correct that, anyone who has signed some pledge to protect every single tax loophole so long as they live, they should be called out. They should have to defend that unfairness -- explain why somebody who's making $50 million a year in the financial markets should be paying 15 percent on their taxes, when a teacher making $50,000 a year is paying a higher rate." We received many requests from readers to fact-check this comparison. But we decided we weren’t able to rate Obama’s claims on the Truth-O-Meter because we don't do Truth-O-Meter items on "shoulds" or "shouldn'ts." Those are opinions, not facts. However, in his Cincinnati speech, Obama did make a comment that was Truth-O-Meter-ready. By saying "and that’s how it’s working now," Obama is saying this pattern of taxation is a common practice. Is it? We found an IRS chart for tax year 2008 that shows a variety of tax information broken down into 18 ranges of adjusted gross income for the filer. This chart lists three types of tax returns -- filers who have income for a child who earns more than $1,900 (meaning the child’s income is taxed at the parent’s rate); those who have income reported on Schedule D (primarily capital gains); and those without either of these types of income. For the purposes of our calculations, we are combining data for all three types of returns. According to this chart, slightly fewer than 19 million filers reported adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $75,000. (This income range stretches slightly higher than what the president mentioned, but it’s as close as we can get with available statistics.) The average income tax rate for these returns was 8.3 percent for those with Schedule D income and 7.8 percent for filers with neither Schedule D nor child income. The rate was higher for those with child income -- 20.4 percent -- but this group included only 4,543 returns, or two-tenths of one percent of all returns in that income range, which is small enough to be negligible for our purposes. The bottom line is that taxpayers in Obama’s construction-worker income range tended to pay an effective federal income tax rate of 7 percent to 8 percent. Calculating the comparable figure for those earning $50 million was trickier. The same chart provides a figure for returns with at least $10 million in adjusted gross income. There were 11,050 returns in this category, and their effective federal income tax rate ranged from 17.9 percent to 28.5 percent, depending on which of the three filing categories they fell into. Clearly, then, the $10 million plus crowd is paying a higher average tax rate than the $50,000 to $75,000 crowd. But remember that Obama said $50 million, not $10 million. Does the math change for those who are even richer? The best data we could find addresses the 400 highest-income taxpayers in the nation. In 2008, the cutoff to make it into this rarefied group was an income of $109.7 million -- which is above Obama’s $50 million threshold. These taxpayers had an average federal income tax rate of 18.1 percent, which is also higher than the rate paid by the $50,000 to $75,000 crowd. So by these calculations, Obama would be incorrect in most cases. But that’s not the end of the story. These figures are for federal income taxes only. There are also a bunch of other federal taxes that could, and probably should, be included in the calculation. The burden for some some taxes, including corporate taxes, excise taxes and estate taxes, are hard to attribute to individual returns, so we’ll set those aside. But one federal tax is straightforward to throw into our calculations: payroll taxes. Payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare. In general, payroll taxes hit lower-to-middle-income taxpayers harder than high-income taxpayers, for two reasons. First, workers with low to moderate incomes are more likely than rich taxpayers to make the bulk of their income from salaries and wages, which are subject to the payroll tax, rather than capital gains or other types of investment income, which are not subject to payroll taxes. For the very rich, that pattern is reversed. Second, Social Security tax is levied only on the first $108,600 of one’s salary, meaning that virtually all of the earnings of someone making $50,000 a year is subject to it. That wouldn’t be the case for someone who’s very rich. We asked two researchers at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institute Tax Policy Center, Roberton Williams and Rachel Johnson, for their advice on how to factor in payroll taxes. They estimated that combining the workers’ share of the payroll tax with the employer’s share -- the usual practice among economists -- would mean an extra 15 percentage points for our hypothetical middle-class worker, and less than 2 additional percentage points for the high-income taxpayer. Adding these to the percentages we previously found for the income tax alone produces a new, "final" rate of 22 to 23 percent for the construction worker and 20 to 30 percent for the $50 million earner. So it’s certainly possible that a given construction worker pays a higher effective tax rate than a given $50 million earner -- but it’s also not a guarantee. There is a lot of variation for taxpayers in both categories -- especially when you consider that we have been using average tax rates rather than median tax rates, which means that a small number of very high incomes can throw off the average. Our ruling Obama has made a sweeping statement that it’s common, even typical, for a $50,000-a-year construction worker to pay a higher tax rate than someone earning $50 million a year. The reality is that it’s hard to know for sure. We found that a typical taxpayer with $50,000 in income pays 22 to 23 percent in income and payroll taxes, while the comparable rates for very, very wealthy taxpayers are in the 20 to 30 percent range. The data isn’t specific enough for us to be able to say if a majority of $50 million earners pay tax rates at the low or high end of that 20 to 30 percent range. We do think it’s safe to say that some of those very high earners pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than workers who earn $50,000, and some don’t. So, on balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-09-27T17:36:02	2011-09-22	['None']

pomt-12164	"More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/aug/03/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-more-texans-have-jobs-ever/	Texas Gov. Greg Abbott drew cheers from supporters in San Antonio as he vowed to keep the Texas economy rocking and laid a claim to history. The Republican governor, kicking off his re-election campaign, said in July 2017: "And since I took office, in just the last two and a half years, in Texas, we’ve added more than 450,000 new jobs. More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state." That jobs-gained number sounded a little low. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures we drew from a bureau economist, Cheryl Abbot, when Abbott took office in January 2015, the state was home to nearly 11.8 million non-farm jobs. As of June 2017, that count was up by about 507,500, exceeding 12.3 million. We decided to check whether more Texas residents have jobs than ever before. Abbott’s campaign didn’t answer requests for the basis of the claim. Meantime, economists concurred that according to bureau figures drawing on U.S. Census Bureau surveys, more than 12.8 million Texas residents had jobs from April 2017 through June 2017--with the April 2017 count of 12,872,506 employed people setting a record, though the tally subsequently slid marginally, reaching 12,848,980 in June 2017. A bureau-provided chart shows the dip in employment after that count had mostly steadily increased since January 2015: SOURCE: Chart showing Texas Local Area Unemployment Statistics, BLS (received by email from Cheryl Abbot, regional economist, BLS, July 21, 2017) The economists we queried noted that because Texas continues to grow in population, it makes sense, barring economic disaster, that you’d see more people having jobs year after year. "Status quo in Texas," Mark J. Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint, told us by email, "it’s always had steady job growth." Perry passed along a chart showing the nearly uniform annual upticks in employed Texas since 1939: SOURCE: Chart based on data posted by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (provided by email from Mark J. Perry, Ph.D., scholar at The American Enterprise Institute, professor of Finance and Business Economics, School of Management, University of Michigan-Flint, July 28, 2017) So, Abbott was mostly right about the record count of Texans with jobs at the time he spoke. Jobless rate, employment-population ratio Other indicators provide context, however. For instance, the month before Abbott kicked off his re-election effort, the state’s unemployment rate of 4.6 percent--as in the share of able workers unsuccessfully seeking employment--was not a record low. We counted 59 months since 1976 when the Texas jobless rate was lower, per an Abbot-provided chart. Also, a ratio that compares the number of people with jobs to the population as a whole was higher for Texas and other states in the 1990s, a facet explored by PolitiFact in Washington in July 2016. That story also noted that nationally since the end of the Great Recession, the U.S. employment-to-population ratio had climbed, slowly but fairly steadily. When we asked, Abbot shared bureau figures rooted in Census Bureau survey findings to represent changes in the Texas employment-population ratio. Similarly, economist Tara Sinclair, an associate professor at George Washington University, drew on bureau figures showing that the state’s employment-population ratio exceeded 65 percent from 1995 through 2000 but fell to 61.5 percent in 2014 and to to 60.9 percent and 60.7 percent, respectively, in 2015 and 2016. In the latter year, the bureau says, that ratio reflected 12,671,801 Texans with jobs out of 20,861,611 residents. By email, Sinclair wrote that similar "to the national pattern for the employment-population ratio, Texas is still low relative to its historical peak (although doing a bit better than the national ratio)." SOURCE: Chart drawing on BLS annual data for Texas (received by email from Tara Sinclair, associate professor of Economics and International Affairs, Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, George Washington University, July 21, 2017) Our ruling Abbott said: "More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state." By raw numbers, the more than 12.87 million employed Texans in April 2017 set a record though that count had dipped to 12.85 million by the time Abbott spoke. Also, the state’s June 2017 jobless rate, 4.6 percent, exceeded the rate in more than 50 months since 1976 while Texas in 2016 (like the nation) had an employment-population ratio trailing what it used to be.

pomt-03105	Tuition at Rutgers has increased 10 percent since Gov. Chris Christie took office because he "cut funding for higher education."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/sep/22/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-rutgers-tuition-has-spiked-10/	Death and taxes aren’t the only sure things in New Jersey. Increasing college tuition costs are pretty much a given, too – especially on Gov. Chris Christie’s watch, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie, a Republican, in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest. Rutgers tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he "cut funding for higher education," Buono told students during a recent stop at the university's New Brunswick campus. While the cost of an education at Rutgers and other schools in New Jersey has certainly risen in recent years, we were a bit stunned by this Rutgers Law School alumna’s claim: not only has tuition at the state university climbed by less than 10 percent from the time Christie became governor in January 2010 to present, Buono’s putting blame where it doesn’t belong. Let’s start by reviewing tuition costs for Rutgers since Christie’s been in office. Tuition for in-state residents at Rutgers was $9,926 for the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first year that a Rutgers budget was crafted during Christie’s tenure as governor. Tuition is $10,718 for the current 2013-2014 academic calendar. That’s an increase of 7.97 percent, not 10 percent. David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, told us it would be more appropriate to compare tuition and fees from 2009-2010 – before Christie took office – to 2013-2014. So we looked at those numbers, too. Tuition and fees for 2009-2010 was $11,886, compared with $13,499 for the current academic year. That’s an increase of 13.57 percent, which is in line with Buono’s claim. But there’s a key difference: Buono specifically referenced a tuition increase so we removed fees from the equation and compared tuition from 2009-2010 ($9,546) with 2013-2014 ($10,718). The difference is an increase of 12.27 percent. That brings us to another critical point: Buono claims the increase has occurred "since Christie took office." Turner said Christie's cuts to education had long-reaching effects on students. "One of the Governor's first major acts was to slash New Jersey's higher education budget by more than $170 million," he said in an e-mail. "By cutting the budget, the costs fell on to students who are now shouldering a 13% increase in tuition at our flagship university. These cuts unfairly place the burden on students and make it harder for them to get the skills they need to compete in the workforce of tomorrow." Christie in 2010 proposed cutting $173 million from higher education funding as the state faced a variety of deficits at the height of the recession. But is he solely to blame for tuition hikes at Rutgers? No. In fact, the governor of New Jersey has nothing to do with setting tuition costs at colleges and universities. Under state law, the Rutgers Board of Governors sets tuition and determines the rates of tuition for the institution as part of the university’s annual budget, a spokesman told us. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak agreed. "Governors have no role in setting tuition, room/board and various fees at Rutgers," Drewniak explained in an e-mail. "The Board of Governors votes annually to set those rates based on recommendations from the school’s administrators. Surely, the Senator knows this given her vast experience in the legislature." It’s worth noting that impacts from the recession also were being felt statewide at that time, even in education. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009. Our ruling Buono said during a recent visit to Rutgers that the university's tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he "cut funding for higher education." When looking strictly at tuition costs, Rutgers tuition has increased 7.97 percent from the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first Rutgers budget done after Christie became governor -- to the current 2013-2014. The increase, however, is 12.27 percent if measured from the year before Christie became governor. As for blame, state law makes clear that the Rutgers Board of Governors -- not the governor himself -- sets tuition rates for the university. And while it's true that Christie did cut education funding, he doesn't bare the bulk of the blame for the tuition hikes. Many factors were involved. As a result, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09058	"I have a record on the environment of creating green energy ... taking trash and turning it into cash."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/30/vernon-jones/jones-says-he-helped-turn-trash-cash/	This one had us wondering. Vernon Jones, a Democratic candidate for Georgia's 4th Congressional District, discussed his environmental credentials at a recent candidate forum. He pointed to a program created during his days as DeKalb County's chief executive officer. In July 2005, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners approved Jones' plan to convert methane gas into electricity from one of its landfills and sell it to Georgia Power. "I have a record on the environment of creating green energy by capturing methane gas at our landfills and selling it to Georgia Power and they in return selling it back as green energy -- taking trash and turning it into cash," Jones told the audience at the June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta. It's been five years since the county government signed on with Georgia Power. So we decided to take a look at the initiative and see how it's working out. Is DeKalb, as Jones claimed, "taking trash and turning it into cash"? First, a brief explanation on how this works. Landfill gas is largely composed of methane and carbon dioxide. By burning gas in boilers, Georgia Power can produce steam for power generation, according to its Web site. The company said the landfills can produce as many as 8 megawatts of electric power, enough to power eight Super Wal-Marts. More than 500 agencies across the nation have similar programs. DeKalb is doing it at the Seminole landfill, located near the county's southern edge. The environment is a big issue for Jones, who was CEO from 2001 through 2008. Jones won several awards for his efforts to preserve more green space in the county, primarily through a $125 million bond referendum that voters approved in 2001. Jones is also hoping to capitalize on a major concern in Georgia -- unemployment. His campaign slogan is "Jobs First," and Jones is trying to convince voters that some of his economic development efforts, like the gas to energy program, are reasons why they should give him a shot in Washington. The state's unemployment rate in May was 10.2 percent. It was 9.5 percent a year earlier. In 2006, the county built a facility to convert the gas to electricity at a cost of $5.3 million. DeKalb has since spent $1.6 million on maintenance and operations, county spokeswoman Angela Walton said. And how much has DeKalb collected from the program? Walton said $3.9 million thus far. DeKalb projects it will collect nearly $1.1 million this year and slightly more in 2011. Some environmental protection groups, such as the Sierra Club, dispute the potential profit margin for DeKalb and other facilities that convert gas to electricity. They said the operating costs will eventually exceed profits when governments spend more money to pay for the environmental impact of methane -- which has high global warming potential -- leaking during the conversion process. (The Sierra Club said a higher percentage of methane leaks into the atmosphere when you convert gas to electricity.) The Sierra Club's board of directors voted last year to oppose the creation of any new landfill gas-to-energy facilities. "Methane is a dangerous gas that needs to be controlled," said Mark Woodall, the Sierra Club's Georgia chapter chairman. "It doesn't need to be regarded as the answer to all renewable energy needs." For the record, the Sierra Club has endorsed the incumbent congressman, Hank Johnson, in this race. Since 2006, DeKalb has spent about $6.9 million on the gas-to-electricity program. It has collected $3.9 million in revenue in that time span, with an estimated $2.1 million on the way in the next two years. Most business ventures have start-up costs, and DeKalb had some in this project. The revenue is on pace to soon exceed the start-up costs and expenses. DeKalb is, Jones said, converting "trash into cash." We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Vernon Jones	None	None	None	2010-06-30T06:00:00	2010-06-03	['None']

pomt-13294	"ICE just endorsed me."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-says-ice-endorsed-him/	Donald Trump boasted during the second presidential debate about support he’s received from agents who patrol U.S. borders and enforce immigration laws. "ICE just endorsed me," the Republican nominee said Monday at the debate in St. Louis, Mo. "They've never endorsed a presidential candidate." Did a federal agency endorse Trump? No. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws and has more than 20,000 employees, according to its website. But Trump does have the support of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a union that represents 5,000 federal immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. Trump posted a statement about the union’s endorsement on his campaign website Sept. 26. The first-ever endorsement was voted on by the membership, with Hillary Clinton receiving only 5 percent of the vote, said Chris Crane, president of the National ICE Council, in the statement posted on Trump’s website. "America has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the United States," Crane said in the statement. "We can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors America’s legacy as a land of immigrants, but Donald Trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal. We hereby endorse Donald J. Trump, and urge all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives." The National Border Patrol Council, which represents 16,500 agents, has also backed Trump. But that was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the Los Angeles Times. Our ruling Trump said, "ICE just endorsed me." He made it sound like a federal agency had taken the remarkable step of formally supporting him. But ICE, which enforces federal immigration laws and employs more than 20,000 people, cannot do that. He has the support of employee groups, but that’s vastly different than what he said at the debate.

pomt-05983	"More than one in five of veterans aged 20 to 24 can’t find a job to support their family or to ease the transition to civilian life."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/23/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-unemployment-among-young-vets-t/	Hiring armed forces veterans is nothing new for GrafTech International, a high-tech manufacturer based in Cleveland for 125 years. The practice has been beneficial, the company says, because veterans have the traits of leadership, teamwork and dedication it seeks. Now looking to hire more veterans for up to 45 jobs at its Lakewood and Parma, Ohio, facilities, GrafTech has found an added benefit: tax incentives. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides job training for service members making the transition to civilian life, also provides tax credit of up to $9,600 to companies hiring unemployed veterans. (VOW stands for Veterans Opportunity to Work.) The legislation was signed into law in November. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who co-sponsored the act, visited GrafTech to highlight the need for it. "Today, many veterans -— including our young veterans -— face an unacceptably high unemployment rate," the Democrat said. "More than one in five of veterans aged 20 to 24 can’t find a job to support their family or to ease the transition to civilian life." More than one in five means an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent among young veterans. That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. It's considerably higher than the national jobless rate. We asked Brown's office where the figure came from. They referred us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose monthly Current Population Survey provides official statistics on employment and unemployment in the United States. The bureau collects data about veterans, in tracking various segments of the workforce, and last October it updated a detailed report on the employment situation of veterans in 2010, the latest figures available. Among the findings: The jobless rate for veterans of all eras combined was 8.7 percent in 2010, slightly lower than the 9.4 percent for non-veterans. The unemployment rate for veterans who served in the military at any time since September 2001 -- a group referred to as Gulf War-era II veterans -- was 11.5 percent. Young male veterans, or those ages 18 to 24, had an unemployment rate of 21.9 percent. It’s worth noting that the BLS considered that 21.9 percent rate as "not statistically different from the jobless rate of young male non-veterans," which was 19.7 percent. But Brown wasn’t citing the statistic to contrast it with the unemployment of non veterans. Rather, he used the GrafTech appearance and the statistic to argue that the country owes it to service members to help them transition back to civilian life. "Service members who risk their lives protecting our nation shouldn’t have to wonder whether or not they’ll be able to find a job when they leave the service," Brown said. "Just as we invest in our service members while they’re on the battlefield, we should do the same when they return home." Brown accurately cited the jobless rate for younger veterans. That the non-veteran rate is also high is a piece of additional information that helps provide a clearer picture of the unemployment rate for all younger men.

pomt-03499	Says Texas lawmakers agreed to cut state's rainy day fund in half, spending "$4 billion from current $8 billion."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/07/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-legislators-spending-4-billi/	As Texas lawmakers edged toward agreement on future spending, a conservative advocate warned that the GOP-majority Legislature was halving state reserves. In a May 22, 2013, Twitter post, Michael Sullivan, president of Empower Texans, which advocates less government, wrote: "#txlege will be drawing current Economic Stabilization Fund down by half: $4 billion from current $8 billion." Sullivan was referring to the kitty informally known as the state’s rainy day fund. As authorized by voters in 1988, the fund accumulates money from portions of oil and/or gas production taxes. In the latest state revenue forecast, issued Jan. 7, 2013, state Comptroller Susan Combs said the fund’s balance would be $8.1 billion by the end of August 2013, assuming lawmakers did not take money out. Due to additional oil-and-gas tax revenue transfers, Combs projected the fund to grow to $9.83 billion at the end of August 2014 and to $11.76 billion a year later. So, were lawmakers cutting the fund from $8 billion to $4 billion as Sullivan said? To our inquiry, Sullivan noted the fund’s 2013 balance of $8.1 billion. And, he said by email, taking "out $4 billion is taking out half of the money." He also said he has doubts about the fund’s future projected balances of greater than $8 billion. "That is a forecast," he said. "By definition, it is NOT money currently in the bank, or even an asset. In the bank is $8.1 billion. People hope that it will have $12 billion by late-ish 2015." "I know legislators want us focused on the pre-hatched chicks," Sullivan said, but "I prefer to count the chickens that have already emerged from the eggs. That is, the current fund balance IS $8 billion. Every other number about the" fund balance "is a forecast. Indeed, looking out to 2015 is not even pre-hatched eggs, it's pre-conceived chickens." His analysis made us hungry to learn what lawmakers were voting to take from the fund when he tweeted. John Barton, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on fiscal matters, told us by telephone that lawmakers approved two measures with a bearing on transfers from the fund. A proposed constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, would launch water infrastructure funds starting with $2 billion from the fund, if voters approve the proposition on the November 2013 ballot. Lawmakers also approved House Bill 1025, which awaited the review of Gov. Rick Perry as of June 6, 2013. This measure provides for the $2 billion transfer that would be touched off if voters agree to the proposed amendment. In addition, according to the legislation’s fiscal note, $1.94 billion would be transferred from the rainy day fund by the end of August 2013, with $1.75 billion of that making up for a payment to school districts that was postponed by the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature. Lesser amounts would be spread among programs overseen by the governor, the Department of Public Safety, the Parks & Wildlife Department and firefighting agencies based at Texas A&M University. By our read, this shakes out to $1.94 billion in spending from the rainy day fund through August 2013 and, if voters approve, $2 billion more by the end of August 2015, for $3.94 billion in total. It seems, too, that the rainy day fund stands to be reduced by about 25 percent as of the end of August 2013--from a balance of $8.1 billion to a little more than $6.1 billion. And the fund could shrink from an Aug. 31, 2015, projected balance of about $12 billion to about $8 billion, down 33 percent. These calculations assume HB 1025 making it into law and SJR 1 winning voter approval. We ran this thinking by Sullivan, who replied by email that we were adding layers to his tweet, in that the $3.94 billion in intended spending accounts for half of the fund’s 2013 balance of about $8 billion. "Some of this spending could be vetoed by the governor or the voters, but the bottom line is that the Legislature did authorize spending half of the current balance," Sullivan said. "The comptroller has projected a higher balance through the end of fiscal year 2015 – but that’s a projection vs. what’s actually in the account today." We also shared our 25 percent/33 percent analysis with fiscal experts who track legislative deliberations. By email, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, and Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, said our breakdown seemed accurate. Talmadge Heflin, director of the Center for Fiscal Policy at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said Sullivan got it right. Craymer wrote: "If all of the (legislated) appropriations would take effect in 2013," Sullivan’s "Twitter statement would be correct as of the end of 2013; however, all of the appropriations don’t take effect in 2013. The water appropriation won’t happen until and unless voters approve, with the election in November 2013, which falls in the 2014 fiscal year." Craymer, who is a former chief revenue estimator for the state, also noted that about the time of that election, Combs plans to deposit more money into the fund thanks to "excess oil and gas severance taxes collected in 2013. That deposit is currently estimated at $1.7 billion," Craymer wrote, "but will probably be higher. In 2015, another deposit currently estimated at $1.8 billion will be made," Craymer said, "so essentially the fund is rapidly replenishing itself." If all the legislated spending takes effect, he said, and money gets put into the fund as projected, its balance will go from $6.1 billion at the end of August 2013 to $5.9 billion a year later and $7.8 billion in August 2015. "While there will certainly be less money in the fund compared to what could be there, the actual balance itself will remain somewhat flat," Craymer said. DeLuna Castro summed up by email that if expectations hold, the fund’s balance will not drop to $4 billion at all. Heflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, described the "ifs" of legislation becoming law or voters approving the proposed amendment or the comptroller depositing more money into the fund as matters of speculation. The nearly $4 billion is nearly half the fund’s 2013 balance, Heflin emailed, so "it looks like the Legislature authorized the fund to be drawn down by half of the current balance." Our ruling Sullivan tweeted that lawmakers "will be drawing current Economic Stabilization Fund down by half: $4 billion from current $8 billion." The $4 billion figure approximates legislated withdrawals from the rainy day fund over more than two years, assuming one measure makes it into law and another wins voter approval. However, it’s not correct that the fund will be halved. Its expected August 2013 balance of $8.1 billion could be cut by nearly $2 billion, or 25 percent. Down the road, the fund’s projected balance of nearly $12 billion at the end of August 2015 could shrink by 33 percent. This statement skews these facts by counting current and future expenditures solely against the fund’s current balance. Put another way, it assumes all the legislated spending will occur while disregarding expectations that the fund will also accumulate more revenue. The claim has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07215	Says public education will get more money in 2012-13 though lawmakers cut $15 billion in overall spending.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/04/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-lawmakers-increased-public-s/	Michael Sullivan, who exhorted legislators to hold the line on the 2012-13 state budget, suggests things aren’t as terrible as critics say. Specifically, Sullivan said in a May 26 tweet: "State budget being cut $15bil by #TxLege, but public education is getting more money than last biennium." Is that the deal? Some background: The Republican-steered Legislature dealt with a $20 billion-plus shortfall by writing a budget that appropriates $172 billion, which is down $15 billion from what the 2009 Legislature appropriated for 2010-11, as Sullivan says. Gov. Rick Perry and others have noted the new budget doesn’t require tax increases and also doesn’t tap the rainy day fund, which is projected to hold more than $6 billion by the end of August 2013. The same budget whittles programs, though. It’s $4.8 billion shy of covering projected Medicaid costs--a gap that leaders hope the economy closes before the 2013 Legislature confronts budgetary issues. The budget also gives school districts $4 billion less than what they would have gotten under existing funding formulas intended to cover enrollment growth. All told, the budgeted $53.83 billion in public education spending tops--by .2 percent--the $53.7 billion budgeted for public education the previous two years, according to Legislative Budget Board summaries. That $125.2 million increase derives from a $3 billion increase in state spending on public education minus a nearly $2.8 billion decrease in federal spending. So, total spending is going down $15 billion and public education spending is (narrowly) up. Anything missing from this picture? Lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include an alliance of big school districts, told us that while Sullivan’s figures hold up, the implication that schools stand to gain from this budget is incorrect, given that districts will get $4 billion less than they were due under existing law. We asked Sullivan, president of Empower Texans, a group advocating limited government and less taxation, how he characterizes that $4 billion difference. He replied by email: "So many numbers tossed around by so many folks about so many things, I could not possibly characterize something so vague . . . How one might wish to characterize those (not enough, too much, just right) is outside this discussion about my tweet noting that the new budget DOES have more dollars in it than the last for public education at the same time over all spending is being cut." Historical note: Four of the five previous budgets signed into law by Perry included increases in public school funding. And unlike the 2012-13 budget awaiting his consideration, all five budgets gave schools the aid due them based on state funding formulas. According to the budget board, the overall public education two-year funding increases were 2 percent in 2002-03, 3.3 percent in 2004-05, 7.5 percent in 2006-07 and 34 percent in 2008-09. Funding dipped .9 percent in 2010-11. Spending on public education is higher in the pending budget than the current one. But Sullivan’s implication--that Texas schools are sitting pretty--obscures reality. The new budget doesn’t cover projected enrollment growth. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-04652	Says he and Mitt Romney "always said that we agree with the 2014 deadline" for leaving Afghanistan.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-romney-has-always-supported-2014-af/	With Mitt Romney taking heat for not mentioning Afghanistan in his convention speech, vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan sought to clarify the Republican plan for ending America’s longest war. President Barack Obama increased troops there in 2010 in order to overwhelm al-Qaida and strengthen and train Afghan security forces. The drawdown of that troop surge began this summer. Obama plans a full withdrawal -- and an end to the war -- in 2014. That’s one point where Ryan said the Republican ticket agrees with Obama. "We've always said that we agree with the 2014 deadline. We've always agreed with where we are headed on Afghanistan on 2014," Ryan said on ABC’s This Week on Sept. 9, 2012. "But where we've taken issue is making sure that the generals on the ground get the resources they need throughout the entire fighting season so that they can keep our soldiers safe and operating counterinsurgency strategy. And I fear that this is not what's happening. I fear that there have been more political decisions made in troop strengths during this fighting season. "And so we beg to differ with the president on parts of his Afghanistan policy. But we support the 2014 deadline." The end of the decade long conflict is a key point in the fight against terrorism, and Democrats have criticized Romney for waffling on Afghanistan. We thought we’d check Romney's past statements and see if he’s consistently agreed with the timetable set by his opponent. What he said One of last year’s Republican primary debates focused on national security. There, Romney expressed clear support for the 2014 deadline. "The timetable by the end of 2014 is the right timetable for us to be completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, other than a small footprint of support forces," he said in the Nov. 13, 2011, debate. More recently, at a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, Romney again said it’s his goal "to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014." But he also added, as he has numerous other times, that he would "evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders" when making decisions about American troops. A few days later, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked if that was a shift in position. "No, it's the same posture I've had all along," Romney said, "which is that I believe that the right target for us is to withdraw our troops by the end of 2014. At the same time in the speech I gave at the VFW, I said I would however also want to consult with commanders on the ground to make sure that that time line was still the appropriate time line and that is something, which I will continue to point out." An interview he gave on PBS NewsHour in October 2011 also indicated a soft commitment to the 2014 timetable. Host Judy Woodruff said, "There is an agreement between NATO, the United States and Afghanistan that all foreign troops would be out by 2014. If you're president, would you abide by that agreement?" Romney answered: "I would listen to the generals. And if that continues to be the view of the ... commanders in the field as they assess the capabilities of the Afghan military, then of course I would pursue that course." It's clear that Ryan was speaking for the Romney/Ryan ticket in his This Week interview. But we also looked for his own comments on the war. An op-ed, written shortly after he visited Afghanistan, reflected general support for the 2014 timetable while leaving open the possibility of a longer-term commitment: "A transition plan is in place for Afghan forces to take control of the country's security in 2014," Ryan wrote. "Even as we work toward that point, it is important to remember that our nation's commitment to Afghanistan isn't likely to end there. Our nation's troops and resources will continue to support the Afghan people for years to come - not to engage in nation-building, but to mitigate the risk posed by the region's extremists to our own national security." An even earlier withdrawal? At times, Romney has suggested a pullout might be possible before 2014. At a June debate in New Hampshire: "It's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can, consistent with the word that comes to our generals that we can hand the country over to the ... Afghan military to defend themselves from the Taliban." And at an August town hall, also in New Hampshire: "I will do everything in my power to transition from our military to their military as soon as possible, bring our men and women home and do so in a way consistent with our mission, which is to keep Afghanistan from being overrun by a new entity that would allow Afghanistan to be a launching point for terror again like it was on 9/11." Criticizing Obama Romney has offered scant agreement with anything else Obama has done on the war front. His most pointed criticism centered on the 2014 deadline, but Romney objected to Obama’s public announcement of the withdrawal date, not the date itself. In his speech announcing his current White House run, Romney said it was "wrong" to announce a withdrawal date. When Defense Secretary Leon Panetta laid out a plan in early 2012 for the transition of U.S. troops from a combat role to a support role, Romney’s condemnation was harsh. "He announced that. So the Taliban hears it, the Pakistanis hear it, the Afghan leaders hear it," Romney said. "Why in the world do you go to the people that you’re fighting with and tell them the date you’re pulling out your troops? It makes absolutely no sense." "His naivete is putting in jeopardy the mission of the United States of America and our commitments to freedom," he said. "He is wrong. We need new leadership in Washington." The Obama campaign counters that Romney’s plans for Afghanistan lack specificity, a complaint we noted in several stories, including from some Republicans. Our ruling Ryan claimed that he and Romney have "always agreed" with the 2014 timetable for withdrawing from Afghanistan. We found numerous instances where Romney expressed support for that deadline. His criticism was not of the date itself but the announcement of it, which he said emboldened the Taliban and endangered troops. But Romney also has said a troop withdrawal would be conditional on what the situation on the ground is -- an important caveat that could leave him room to ignore the deadline. Ryan’s statement was accurate but for that one detail. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-09-11T18:09:18	2012-09-09	['Afghanistan']
pomt-09674	A small business receiving a federal tax credit "to provide health care for its employees ... would be barred under the Stupak Amendment from allowing their employees to use ... the health care that they offer them for abortion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/18/ed-rendell/rendell-says-small-businesses-receiving-health-ins/	An amendment to the House health care bill continues to inspire political passions, driving a wedge between abortion-rights supporters who are outraged at what they consider a major loss for women's rights, and Democratic lawmakers who fear seeing their long-awaited health care reform effort stalled due to the debate. The amendment -- a last-minute addition that passed, 240-194, with support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats -- establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the health care bill's insurance "exchanges." These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to feasibly offer health coverage to their employees. Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the "public option," which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. However, the amendment does allow people in the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still purchase an abortion "rider" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. But in a Nov. 12 appearance on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show , Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, added a new layer of concern for abortion-rights advocates. Rendell said that in addition to erecting hurdles for individuals who receive federal subsidies, the amendment would also make it harder to secure abortion coverage if you happen to work for a company that gets federal subsidies. "Take a small business that's receiving a tax credit, a federal tax credit, to provide health care for its employees," Rendell said. "They would be barred under the Stupak Amendment from allowing their employees to use their -- the health care that they offer them for abortion. They would be absolutely disallowed from doing that." Let's start by looking at the small-business subsidy Rendell is referring to. According to Section 521 of the House health care bill, small businesses can receive federal tax credits for providing employees with health coverage. The tax credit would be equal to half the amount paid by the employer for health coverage, though the law also sets limits based on the size of the company and the average wages. It also says that companies can only receive the credit for two years. The amendment clearly states that government funds cannot be used to pay for abortion coverage. So it seems to us -- and experts we spoke to agreed -- that just as subsidized individuals cannot buy a full plan that covers abortion, a small business receiving the credits could not purchase a plan that includes abortion coverage. To a degree, then, Rendell is right: The amendment would affect people on the exchange if their company received health care subsidies, even if they paid their share of the premium entirely out of their own pocket and they did not personally receive subsidies from the government. However, Rendell left out an important factor. Just as individuals who receive subsidies can still purchase abortion riders on the exchange, so too can individuals who work for a small business that receives tax credits. In addition, our experts said that nothing in the legislation would stop companies from offering abortion riders for their employees; the funds would need to be paid out of the employees' pockets, not the company's. Such a process already occurs in some of the states that have laws on the books that are similar to the Stupak amendment. We give Rendell credit for noting the often overlooked impact the amendment would have on abortion options for employees of subsidized small businesses. He's right that the company cannot simply offer a single, comprehensive health care plan that includes abortion. But both the individuals and the companies in question can purchase separate riders that cover abortion, which suggests that the term "absolutely disallowed" is inaccurate. This may be cold comfort to abortion-rights advocates, who are generally skeptical of the value of riders, saying that companies may not offer them and that individuals may not purchase them. But it earns Rendell a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03291	"The fact is that red light cameras change driver behavior and cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/01/rick-kriseman/rick-kriseman-says-red-light-cameras-change-driver/	Hopefuls for St. Petersburg mayor are divided on the city’s red light camera program. Mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford argued in her response to a Tampa Bay Times questionnaire that the city’s technology is flawed, the cost to appeal is "prohibitively high" and unfair, and the program should be stopped. Mayor Bill Foster, who pushed for the cameras, still supports them. Mayoral candidate Rick Kriseman aligns with Foster. "I support them for the purposes of public safety, not as a revenue generator. ... The fact is that red light cameras change driver behavior and cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents," Kriseman wrote. We wanted to know if Kriseman’s point is accurate. St. Petersburg’s program The cameras seem to be just about everywhere. St. Petersburg is one of about 70 municipalities in Florida with red light cameras, along with five other cities in Pinellas County, Tampa, Miami, Clearwater and Orlando. About half of U.S. states have authorized the technology in the past two decades. The St. Petersburg program started in fall 2011 with cameras at 10 intersections. Tickets for running a red light are $158. (Locations here.) Already the cameras have been at the brink of wipeout, having survived a few City Council votes that would effectively end the program. A number of municipalities have had buyer’s remorse. In Houston, a voter referendum killed the program. Collier County (Fla.) commissioners voted to kill their program in December 2012 because they did not find evidence that the cameras reduced accidents. Los Angeles officials ended the program there after realizing it was difficult to pursue violators who ignored their tickets. An audit found the cameras did not improve public safety. Still, other cities tout benefits. More than a year in, the question remains for St. Pete: Are the cameras reducing the most dangerous crashes? A consultant’s performance report in December 2012 concluded that the red light crash rate fell by 31 percent at St. Petersburg traffic approaches with cameras from November 2011 to October 2012, compared to the three-year average preceding it. Crashes from red light running resulting in injury fell by 47 percent compared to the three-year average preceding the program, the consultants found. But the lengthy report omitted facts later reported by the Tampa Bay Times, such as the fact that rear-end wrecks at intersections with red light cameras jumped 44 percent and overall crashes at those intersections increased 10 percent compared to the previous year. Interpretations all depend on how you dice the data, said Michael Frederick, the city’s transportation manager. The consultant compared the first year of traffic data with a three-year average instead of data just for the year before. A more in-depth review is expected after three years with the cameras, he said. Not included in the report? Fatal crashes. Frederick said that’s because there were none in the year examined. University of South Florida researchers found that St. Pete averaged about one fatal crash a year in the years before the cameras went up. Many studies, many findings Both sides of the camera debate tout a plethora of research espousing their opinions. Kriseman’s campaign manager said he was talking about the effect of red light cameras in general on motorist behavior and dangerous crashes. The campaign sent materials from national pro-camera groups, the National Coalition for Safer Roads and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (funded by auto insurance companies), in addition to a study that appeared in The Journal of Trauma in 2010. We’ll sum up that research, as well as a couple others. • The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety asserts red light cameras reduce the most dangerous crashes, pointing to 2011 in-house research that found large cities with red light cameras between 2004-08 saw a 24 percent reduction in fatal red light running crashes compared to those without. The institute also points to a 2002 study in California, showing significant declines in injury crashes and right-angle injury crashes across the city after some intersections got cameras. • The Journal of Trauma study examined driver behavior for nine months at a dangerous intersection in a New Orleans suburb. The report concluded the cameras decreased the rate of red-light running and had a "lasting effect on driver behavior." The study, however, said the cameras did not seem to prevent collisions at the intersection, recommending more studies over more time. • The Texas Transportation Institute of Texas A&M University examined crash records at 275 intersections in Texas cities with red light cameras. The researchers concluded that the most severe crashes, those at right angles, dropped 32 percent. Another study is planned this fall to examine what happened to crashes in cities that took down their red light cameras. • A 2004 study by the Urban Transit Institute at North Carolina A&T State University concluded no demonstrable safety benefit from red light cameras. "There isn’t a conclusive study that would say that in all circumstances that red light cameras are going to provide the safety benefits that they’re looking at," said Jason Bittner, director of USF’s Center for Urban Transportation Research. "It’s kind of on a case-by-case basis." More research Three USF researchers reviewed seven red light camera studies held up by the federal government as the best designed studies and found none concluded a statistical safety benefit from the cameras. They noted several government-funded studies actually stated injury or severe crashes increased with the cameras, according to their 2011 paper in Florida Public Health Review. The professors, who became interested in the cameras years ago because a portion of the revenue goes to trauma center hospitals, pointed out in 2011 that red light cameras often have a "double effect" on motorists: They are put at higher risk for fines and rear-end crashes. The researchers objected to the IIHS California study and others for not using scientific research methods, and have faulted other research for not taking into account traffic trends, such as the fact that the state has been seeing a decrease in red light running, said Barbara Langland Orban, a USF health policy professor. The professors agree that red light cameras influence driver behavior -- just not for the better (though they had not seen studies of psychological effects of the cameras on drivers). "There’s a difference between a driver being more aware and a driver being more skittish," said Etienne Pracht, a USF professor of health care economics. We turned to another local camera critic. Matt Florell, who runs StPeteCameras.org, analyzed more than 20 North American red light camera studies published in academic journals or cited by government agencies and determined most of them showed an increase in total crashes with red light cameras installed. In the 15 studies that measured crashes with injury, there was an increase of 21 percent, Florell found. Florell is highly critical of the city’s one-year report, saying it cherry-picks statistics, lacks raw numbers and makes unproven assumptions. Our ruling Kriseman’s point is not new: Many supporters of red light cameras tout, as he did, that benefits include changed motorist behavior and reducing the most dangerous kind of crashes. We found some studies that say cameras changed motorist behavior -- by either putting them on high alert or teaching them a lesson. But whether they truly "cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents" remains a matter of much debate. We rate his claim Half True.

Rick Scott is painting fellow Republicans as job-killers for their support of a bill that would decimate the state’s agencies for tourism promotion and business incentives. Scott has escalated his feud with House Speaker Richard Corcoran by calling out legislators on their own turf for votes in committee to dismantle Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida. Scott credits these two groups for helping usher 1.2 million private-sector jobs into the state since he was elected. In his view, a vote to eliminate the agencies is a vote against jobs. At a stop of the "Fighting for Florida’s Jobs" tour in Flagler Beach, Scott targeted the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast. "Your politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs," Scott said Feb. 13 to business leaders and constituents at Vessel Sandwich Co. "That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said." Scott continued, "He said, 'I will sponsor the bill to eliminate marketing for tourists.' He sponsored the bill to do that and to get rid of Visit Florida." Scott is using the jobs argument a lot lately (though not for the employees who work at the agencies). • "When they want to say we don’t want to do any more marketing for Visit Florida, what they are saying is that we don’t need any more jobs in tourism." (Miami Herald) • "It’s pretty clear, if you’re not caring about people’s jobs you must be caring about something else," he said. "I care about people’s jobs. What else can it be?" (Miami Herald) • "How can anybody say they don’t want to help a poor family get a job?" (Miami Herald) His attack against Renner misrepresents Renner's view. There is no record of Renner saying exactly that his area doesn't need more jobs. Scott press secretary Kerri Wyland said Scott’s point is focused on the effect of Renner’s proposal. "By choosing to sponsor this job-killing legislation, Rep. Renner is telling families in the counties he serves that the area does not need more jobs," she said. Renner doesn’t see the legislation as a crusade against jobs. He jokingly offered $100 to anyone who heard those words come out of his mouth. When he introduced the bill, Renner brought up a philosophical difference with Scott about the fairness of economic incentives, arguing the money could be better spent to benefit more people. "We should be taking the hundreds of millions of dollars we’re spending on the privileged few — those few companies that are able to navigate the system — for broad-based tax reform," Renner said Feb. 8 at the House Careers and Competition Subcommittee meeting. "Tax reform that benefits all businesses, small, medium and large, and if we do that we will continue to be one of the leading states in the country for job growth." In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Renner said he prefers tax money to be invested in public safety, infrastructure and education — not marketing campaigns (see "Sexy Beaches") or incentives. He’s also disappointed in executives for awarding bonuses and increasing salaries of executives with state dollars. As for the jobs situation in Renner's area, the unemployment rate for Flagler County (home to Flagler Beach and Renner's Palm Coast) has been slightly higher than the state average but not alarmingly so. In December 2016, the Florida rate was 4.9 percent, compared with 5.4 percent (preliminary) in Flagler. That's down from the county's 12.3 percent rate in December 2010, before Scott took office. Scott may be hoping the legislation is a turnoff in Renner’s district, but he has some competition from the other side. Americans For Prosperity Florida started mailing fliers to Renner’s constituents, urging them to continue to support Renner’s efforts to dismantle a "rigged" system. And on Feb. 15, a video was posted on the Florida House of Representatives YouTube page. It uses clips of news reports about failed projects and ends with President Ronald Reagan. "I am sure he was speaking figuratively when he said that we're not in favor of jobs," Renner said of Scott. "The Florida House is full of people who believe in jobs and prosperity for everyone." Our ruling Scott said, "Politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs. That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said." That is not exactly what Renner said, and it misleads voters about the issue. Renner supports legislation to eliminate funding for Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida, which Scott says will cost Florida jobs -- ergo, Renner supports losing jobs. Renner, naturally, sees it differently. He thinks the money would be better devoted to tax cuts. The picture is far more complex than the broad brush Scott paints.

pomt-04443	Says Obama was in New York City the same day as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but went on a TV show instead of meeting with him.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-obama-was-nyc-same-say-bibi-dissed-/	President Barack Obama couldn’t manage to squeeze in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while they were in New York on the same day, but Obama did find time to go on a TV talk show, charged vice presidential candidate U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., during a debate on Oct. 11. Here is what Ryan said: "Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see? They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over two years. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. They're spinning the centrifuges faster. "They see us saying when we come into the administration, when they're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. They see President Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is and he, instead of meeting with him, goes on a daily talk show." Ryan was referring to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York that occurred the last week of September; both Obama and Netanyahu attended. But were Obama and Netanyahu at the U.N. meeting the same day, and did Obama ditch the prime minister for a TV talk show instead? Scheduling problems First, some background on the much talked about a meeting that didn’t happen between the two leaders. The controversy over the allegedly missed meeting started Sept. 11, 2012, when the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the White House declined Israel’s request for a meeting during the U.N. conference. "An official in Jerusalem said that the Prime Minister's Office sent the White House a message stating that although Netanyahu will spend only two and a half days on U.S. soil, he is interested in meeting Obama and is willing to travel to the U.S. capital specifically for that purpose. The official added that the White House rejected the request and said that at this time Obama's schedule does not allow for a meeting." We fact-checked a claim by a Romney campaign surrogate, South Florida congressional candidate Adam Hasner, that "President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York." We ruled that claim Mostly True. We found several news stories -- based on anonymous sources -- that said Netanyahu’s team asked for a meeting between the two leaders and was rejected. The White House responded on the record that the leaders couldn’t meet due to scheduling conflicts. The controversy led the two men to speak by telephone for an hour the night of Sept. 11. Let’s look at when the two leaders were in New York during the week of Sept. 24. Obama was in the city on Monday and Tuesday. He taped the interview with The View on Monday and addressed the U.N. on Tuesday Wednesday was the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Netanyahu planned to be in New York on Thursday and Friday. When Netanyahu spoke to the U.N. on Thursday, Sept. 27, he asked the U.N. to draw "a clear red line" to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The New York Times wrote: "In a theatrical gesture, Netanyahu held up a cartoon-like drawing of a spherical bomb and drew a red line below the fuse, "before Iran completes the second stage of nuclear enrichment to make a bomb," he said. Netanyahu met with Hillary Clinton on Thursday. On Friday, he spoke with both Obama and Romney by telephone, the Jerusalem Post reported. Netanyahu left New York on Saturday. The Los Angeles Times reported that "the absence of face time with world leaders was glaring. Obama held 13 meetings with leaders at last year’s meeting, according to CBS Radio’s Mark Knoller, the unofficial White House stat keeper." The article stated that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was slated to handle the one-on-one diplomacy including a meeting with Netanyahu. The View Obama and first lady Michelle Obama taped an appearance on ABC’s The View at studios in Manhattan on the afternoon of Monday, Sept. 24, and it aired Sept. 25, according to a pool press report that day. Much of the interview was light-hearted -- some questions about the Obamas’ marriage, a mention of one of his daughters playing tennis. They discussed that they would celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary on Oct. 3, the night of the first debate and held hands during most of the taping, according to the pool report. But Obama also touched on serious topics including his campaign, the economy and Libya. Obama’s critics attacked him for going on the show. Fox News’ headline on commentary by a Republican strategist was: "Obama picks ‘The View’ over foreign policy." "As world leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, President Obama and the first lady gathered with the women of the daytime talk show,’The View,’ sadly choosing show business over the business of foreign relations. Leadership is about priorities, what does this say about the priorities of our president?" stated the column by Alice Stewart, a Romney and Republican National Committee surrogate. To be clear, though, Netanyahu was not in New York on Monday, the day Obama taped The View. News reports indicate he left Israel on Wednesday, after Yom Kippur. Our ruling During the debate Ryan said that Obama was in New York City the same day as Netanyahu and "instead of meeting with him, goes on a daily talk show." The two leaders were not there on the same day: Obama was there Monday and Tuesday, and Netanyahu was there later in the week, on Thursday and Friday. Obama taped The View on Monday.

pomt-12624	"...the earth moves closer to the sun every year – you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/31/scott-wagner/pa-gopers-climate-change-theory-debunked-nope-not-/	Republican Pa. Sen. Scott Wagner believes that climate change is probably happening. He also says he believes some of that change is "manmade," too. But Wagner, a state senator from York in the midst of a run for governor, seemed this week to cite a more celestial reason why things are getting a little warmer while he was laying out policy proposals related to natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania. In a talk with natural gas advocates in Harrisburg, Wagner said climate change is probably happening, but the government should nevertheless pare down restrictive regulations on the natural gas drilling industry. "I haven’t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth," Wagner said, according to State Impact, an NPR affiliate. "We’re moving closer to the sun." He added, "We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can." The Pennsylvania Democratic party publicly chastised Wagner for the suggestion and the senator was slammed in comments sections for the statement. So we decided to check his claim: Is the Earth really moving closer to the sun? And has body heat contributed to global climate change? Let’s start with the, er, "manmade" option first: Despite Wagner’s question, there is no evidence to suggest human body heat is causing global climate change. As PolitiFact has pointed out time and time again, the overwhelming majority of experts agree that climate change is happening and humans are causing it largely through producing carbon dioxide that exacerbates the Earth’s greenhouse effect. Dave Goldberg, an associate department head for undergraduate studies and a professor in Drexel University’s Department of Physics, said the idea that human body heat is changing the temperature is "absurd." He said the regular energy collected from the sun is about a million times larger than the energy humans emit through body heat, so Wagner was "off by literally a factor of a million." Wagner did say with more confidence though that the Earth "moves closer to the sun every year," but that claim -- and the way he used it -- also has little root in scientific evidence. Donald Schneider, a distinguished professor and head of Penn State’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said "on average, we aren’t changing our distance and the Earth is not spiraling into the sun continuously." Technically, the Earth does move closer to the sun every year -- and then it moves back, in that same year. That’s because the Earth doesn’t orbit around the sun in a circular motion. Instead, Schneider explained, it maintains an elliptical orbit, so for half the year, the Earth is moving toward the sun and for the other half it’s moving away. Then the process, which Schneider said wouldn’t have an impact on climate change "on human time scales," repeats every year. Schneider also noted that Wagner cited "the rotation of the Earth" when he said the Earth is moving closer to the sun, but he likely meant "the revolution" or the orbit of the Earth. The Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year. "The Earth moves closer to the sun every year, that can be technically true in a narrow definition," Schneider said. "Half the time it is. In the context of the Earth moving closer to the sun causing the temperature to go up, I don’t think is correct." Goldberg agreed, saying he’s "kind of disappointed in [Wagner’s] high school science teacher." "This idea that something that happens on a one-year time scale has anything to do with what we’re seeing in terms of global warming is a ridiculous argument," Goldberg said, adding that it’s "insulting" Wagner would insinuate scientists hadn’t considered the impact of the Earth’s proximity to the sun. PolitiFact Pennsylvania reached out to Wagner’s office in search of evidence of his claim. His office released a statement from Wagner instead, in which he said: "I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that." "However, the real question isn't is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it," he said in the statement. "I believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy." Our Ruling Pennsylvania Sen. Scott Wagner said during a discussion about climate change that "the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun." The Earth technically does move closer to the sun every year as part of its revolution around the sun, but it then moves back. That revolution is not related to the rotation of the Earth, and as experts point out, the Earth isn’t on average moving closer to the sun. That movement closer to the sun, scientists say, wouldn’t have an impact on climate change, and one scientist even called the claim "ridiculous." Also, there’s no evidence to suggest human body heat is at all related to global climate change. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08375	Says PolitiFact says Amendment 4 "will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/oct/25/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/anti-amendment-4-group-cites-politifact-newspaper-/	The group opposing Amendment 4, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, placed a full page ad in the Oct. 17, 2010, Orlando Sentinel urging voters to vote no on the amendment based on information from, well, us. The full page ad ran with the headline "What does Amendment 4 really mean for Florida?" Included in the ad was an allegation that listed PolitiFact as the source. The ad says Amendment 4 "will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees." The footnote attached to the claim points back to a PolitiFact Florida article from March 16, 2010. We love the publicity and notoriety that comes with being quoted in a full page advertisement running in one of the state's largest newspapers. But we love being quoted accurately more. In this case, we weren't. First, in case you don't know, here's some background on Amendment 4. Amendment 4 was placed on the November ballot after Hometown Democracy was able to collect 676,811 petition signatures statewide, more than the state requirement to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal is summarized as follows on the election ballot: "Establishes that before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, the proposed plan or amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body and notice." Essentially the proposal would allow voters to decide on changes to local land use plans, rather than having the decision rest in the hands of city councils, county commissions or appointed local planning agencies. Supporters argue that the measure will give more power to local residents by allowing them to make decisions regarding development plans in their communities. Opponents argue Amendment 4 will stall existing projects and drive away prospective developers from investing money in Florida. We've rated several claims on both sides of Amendment 4, which you can see here. The claim we're analyzing in this case stems from a statement we examined in the spring. Back in March, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy claimed that the tiny Pinellas community of St. Pete Beach had terrible experiences with its own version of Amendment 4, resulting in "seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate." We found two half truths in the statement back then. 1). We didn't agree that Amendment 4 and St. Pete Beach's version of hometown democracy were the same thing. Here's what we wrote about the comparison then: "A group of St. Pete Beach residents, unhappy with the direction of their city government, successfully wrestled certain land use decisions out of the hands of elected leaders. The movement produced a backlash from both the government and pro-development forces, who then mounted their own political campaign to wrestle power back. The power struggle has continued for close to four years. "That's a different storyline than what is envisioned under Amendment 4, where voters would act as a check on the decisions of local government. The amendment itself isn't designed to go around government the way the situation in St. Pete Beach played out. And it has nothing to do with citizens proposing amendments to the local comprehensive plan, like what has happened in St. Pete Beach. Now, are the same lawsuits and political maneuvering possible? Absolutely. And maybe that's enough to make the analogy valid. "But voters should be wary in blindly believing that St. Pete Beach's experiences would be duplicated statewide should Amendment 4 pass." 2). We didn't think St. Pete Beach's hometown democracy rule generated lawsuits that forced the city to raise its property tax rate. Declining property values, more than anything else, forced the tax rate increase in 2009. Here's what we wrote then: "Yes, there were lawsuits, but they weren't the only costs mentioned for the city legal department (during budget talks). Yes, the city slightly raised its rate in 2009 -- although the net result still was a decrease on most homeowners because of sharply falling property values. But the discussion at a town meeting indicates that the decision was motivated by several factors, most notably the decline in property values, as well as legal fees." Our ruling Let's look at what Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy said again in its ad. Citing PolitiFact, it said Amendment 4 "will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees." Well, we can speak unequivocally about this one. PolitiFact Florida never said that what happened in St. Pete Beach's case will happen in cities and counties across Florida if Amendment 4 is approved. We never said it in any other Truth-O-Meter items either. And even ignoring that, PolitiFact Florida never said St. Pete Beach's local hometown democracy rules forced the city to raise its tax rate. No doubt about it: Pants on Fire! (And no footnote required). UPDATE: Ryan Houck, a spokesman for Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, said the line in the Sentinel ad was mistakenly sourced to PolitiFact. "Over the course of this campaign, we’ve generated literally thousands of documents containing accurate claims and citations — we’ve always prided ourselves on an attention to detail and a focus on the facts," he said. "However, sometimes mistakes happen and I’m sorry to say that one has happened here." Houck said that the ad should have referenced Florida TaxWatch as the source for the ad’s claim.

pomt-01012	"Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/02/phil-kerpen/claim-mitch-mcconnell-has-already-allowed-more-ame/	There’s a new sheriff in charge of the U.S. Senate, and he’s eager to show how he’s shaking up the law of the land. We’re talking, of course, about new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who took over the Senate’s top slot after the midterm elections bounced Democrats from power. And in this new world, Republicans are touting an eye-catching factoid as evidence of a functional Senate, one they say runs on fairness and order under GOP control. "Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year," tweeted Phil Kerpen, opinion-writer and president of conservative 501(c)(4) American Commitment, on Jan. 22, 2015. Kerpen, formerly of Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth and the libertarian Cato Institute, told us he heard the statistic from McConnell himself. We wanted to know if it was true that the Senate has already allowed more votes on amendments in less than one month than all of 2014. And why? On Senate stoppage and filled ‘trees’ The simple answer on the number of votes is that Kerpen is correct. But the reason behind it varies depending on your particular political lens. A simple search of Senate roll call votes on amendments in 2014 and 2015 backs up Kerpen’s statement. In 2014, there were 15 roll call votes on amendments. As of Jan. 22, 2015, the date of Kerpen's tweet, there were 16 roll call votes on amendments. There have since been 17 more votes on amendments to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which passed a week later but will likely face President Barack Obama’s veto pen. Kerpen came at the tally a different way, counting "real" votes on amendments, a distinction that also includes roll call votes on motions to table amendments, which effectively kills them. By his math, there were 16 votes allowed on amendments in 2014 and 26 so far in 2015. By either count, the numbers work. What changed? In 2014, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., relied on a funny-sounding procedure called "filling the amendment tree." Basically, Reid filled the docket allowed for amendments by adding amendments with inconsequential changes that no one else could override. The procedural tactic prevented Republican-sponsored amendments from being heard on the floor. "He did that more than any of his predecessors," Donald Ritchie, Senate historian, told PunditFact. Reid wasn’t doing this just to be a not-so-nice guy. To Democrats, it was to counter Republican tactics. Unlike the House, the Senate does not have strict rules for the substance of amendments that can be attached to bills (i.e., you could add a health care amendment onto a defense spending bill). And that’s exactly what happened in years past. Republicans began introducing off-topic amendments that, for example, cut off U.S. aid to Egypt or, a favorite of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to eliminate health care subsidies for Senate staffers. No matter what the topic of the bill. Sometimes this was in effort to force difficult votes for Democrats back home. To Republicans, Reid’s style of blocking amendments emulated an uncooperative and off-the-rails leadership style -- one that is tremendously well-documented -- that stymied policymaking. To Democrats, it was necessary to get anything accomplished. Republicans were filibustering votes on the underlying bills and not committing to a vote in exchange for allowing some amendments, said Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Reid saw they were filibustering everything, bringing the place to a standstill," Smith told us. "So he wondered why he should give them votes at all." Reid’s office does not dispute the number of votes on amendments, but they do take issue with what they deem an "empty talking point" that neglects Republican responsibility for the gridlock. His spokesman argues that Republicans blocked their own share of amendments by not compromising on potential amendments to be heard on the floor and refusing to come to an agreement about when a bill should come to a vote. "(Reid) makes no apologies for blocking what we all consider to be extremely pointless political amendments that were just designed not to improve the bills we were working on but to run 30-second political ads against Democratic senators," said spokesman Adam Jentleson. "Republicans are entirely culpable in that number being what it is." Reid’s style of blocking amendments irritated Republicans, sure, but it also flared up during the 2014 midterms with Republicans using it to attack Democrats. The GOP pounced on Alaska Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, for instance, for his lack of roll-call votes on his amendments. McConnell, conversely, said he would allow open amendments on the Keystone XL bill, hence the GOP celebrating its "new management" style. As political experts told us to expect, there have already been clashes with McConnell’s methods a few days after the initial celebration. During the Keystone debate, Democrats objected to McConnell tabling Democratic amendments and not letting Democrats debate their amendments for a minute. Reid, perhaps ironically, tweeted, "I've never seen debate shut down as aggressively as when Sen. McConnell refused to allow Dems to debate their own amendments for just 1 min. ... and that’s saying something." What the experts tell us Bottom line, experts said, voters shouldn’t take the new tactics as evidence that McConnell’s "return to normal order" will give the Democrats an easy path to voting on the amendments of their choice. "It’s not going to happen," said Roy Meyers, University of Maryland, Baltimore County affiliate professor of public policy. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis agreed, saying, "The overall idea isn’t trivial (‘regular order’), but the exact number isn’t very significant, especially if McConnell, as expected, runs the Senate almost completely to the (Republicans’) advantage." It’s too early to know whether we have a "sea change" of order on our hands in the Senate, said Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor. "In other words, the intense partisanship of the Senate that led Sen. Reid to all-but shut down the amendment process last year has not dissipated," Binder said. "I think the question going forward is whether McConnell can find a way to conduct the Senate such that senators from both parties believe their legislative needs are being met." Our ruling Kerpen, among others, tweeted, "Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than (Harry) Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year." On the numbers, that is right. But experts cautioned us that the claim falls more in the interesting factoid category than a sign of a different or more cooperative Senate leadership. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check incorrectly described Sen. David Vitter's amendment.	None	Phil Kerpen	None	None	None	2015-02-02T17:07:41	2015-01-22	['None']

pomt-05895	"Illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion... every year."	false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/06/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-online-piracy-and-counterfeiting-/	U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, declared in an opinion column on CNN.com: "The growing number of foreign websites that offer counterfeit or stolen goods continues to threaten American technology, products and jobs." His Jan. 20, 2012, post continues: "Illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion and thousands of jobs every year. Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while some of America's most profitable and productive industries are under attack." Say what costs that much? A reader asked. Smith’s $100 billion statement has weaknesses, we learned, partly because estimates of the impact of online vending of counterfeit or pirated (as in stolen) software, movies, recordings and other rip-off products ranging from handbags to shoes are hard to corral. We’ll dip into Smith’s backup after some background. Smith is a chief sponsor of the stalled Stop Online Piracy Act, which he described in a November 2011 Austin American-Statesman oped column as an attempt to rein in "a vast virtual market online run by criminals who steal and sell America's intellectual property and keep the profits for themselves." "Movies and music are not the only stolen products that are offered by rogue sites," Smith’s column says. "Counterfeit medicine, automotive parts and even baby food are a big part of the counterfeiting business and pose a serious threat to the health of American consumers." Smith’s November column says too that the act is intended to target such illegal activity by permitting the attorney general to seek an injunction against a foreign website dedicated to it. Congressional action on Smith’s proposal, and a Senate approach pitched as protecting intellectual property, stalled out in the wake of a public outcry in January. Now let’s get back to Smith’s claim that counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion a year. His spokeswoman, Sally-Shannon Birkel, told us Smith’s figure originated in a February 2011 report commissioned by the France-based Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy, an initiative of the International Chamber of Commerce, whose declared mission is to promote trade and investment, open markets and the free flow of capital. The report says: "We find that the U.S. consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods is between $66 billion and $100 billion (based on 2008 data)." So that’s the origin of Smith’s $100 billion figure. It’s the high-end part of this finding. Globally, the same report says, such goods had a 2008 value of up to $650 billion. But Smith’s statement refers to how much counterfeiting and online piracy costs the U.S. economy. Is the country’s "consumption-based share" of such goods -- which the report calls relevant to U.S. businesses -- the same as their cost to the economy? It’s unlikely. A portion of the report pointed out to us by Sanjay Jain, a Texas A&M University professor of marketing, states that the "study has not attempted to estimate business losses associated with counterfeiting and piracy. This is primarily because the likely variations and other difficulties associated with estimating substitution effects across substantially different countries and industries introduces an additional level/degree of variables which could undermine our aim to as accurately as possible characterize the magnitude of counterfeiting and piracy." After presenting the $66 billion to $100 billion range, the report says this represents "international trade in counterfeit and pirated goods, domestically produced and consumed goods and digitally pirated products." Broken down, the report says, this includes consumption of $45 billion to $60 billion of internationally traded counterfeit and pirated products, $12 billion to $14 billion in domestically produced counterfeit products and between $9 billion and $25 billion in digitally pirated products. Jain and Julian Sanchez, a fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has urged skepticism about cost estimates for online piracy, each pointed out to us that the presented range questionably assumes that any pirated product would otherwise be purchased at its retail price by the person who obtained it. That’s not always or even often so, they said. Broadly speaking, Jain said, he has seen no convincing studies on the costs of piracy and counterfeiting to the American economy — unsurprisingly so, he said, because it’s not an easy problem. "I don’t know the right number," he said. Sanchez, who told us he considers Smith’s proposal a "bad bill," raised another issue, saying by email that most of the pirated and counterfeited products included in the its $66 billion to $100 billion range have nothing to do with online piracy targeted by Smith’s act. "People were manufacturing fake Nikes long before the Internet became a mass medium," Sanchez wrote, "so while it might be an interesting factoid to know the size of that market, it’s a red herring if we’re talking about a ‘Stop Online Piracy Act.’" This "whole debate," Sanchez said, "has tended to lump together ‘counterfeiting’ (trademark infringement, usually involving physical goods) and ‘piracy’ (copyright infringement, encompassing both physical media sales and online digital transfers). From a policy perspective, this is misleading, if not outright deceptive. Whatever amount is spent globally on fake Nikes imported in bulk by retailers, it has very little to do with the debate over policy aimed at shutting down cyberlockers to reduce illicit downloads by individual consumers. You might as well cite an estimate of the total economic cost of ‘crime.’ " The debate aside, we asked Jeffrey Hardy, director of the international chamber’s initiative, if its report’s $66 billion to $100 billion estimate for the United States’ "consumption-based share" for counterfeit and pirated goods is the same as the economic impact of such activities on the country’s economy. It’s not, Hardy said, though he said the cost to the economy would be a percentage of the $66 billion to $100 billion "share." He also stressed that the report’s figures reflected the situation in 2008 and costs have increased since then. His speculation: "We may already be to $166 billion" for the U.S. share of consumed counterfeit and pirated goods, which could even turn out to be the current annual cost to the economy. Hardy also confirmed that the range presented in the report is tied to the retail value of goods though, he agreed, it’s incorrect to assume that in all cases someone who purchases a pirated or counterfeit good would otherwise buy the product at market cost. All told, Hardy acknowledged, there was no way to pinpoint costs to the economy. The main point was to show that counterfeiting and digital piracy are big problems. "There is a balance between overhyping or overcooking the pie … and trying to present the fact that the magnitudes are enormous and getting bigger, especially on the digital side of things," Hardy said. "It’s a very complicated process when there’s not a lot of information and (there is) a lot of educated guesses. That’s what economists do." Hardy said the international chamber has taken no position on SOPA. Separately, Sanchez said he agrees with an April 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which states that while counterfeiting and online piracy may pose sizeable negative economic effects, they are hard to quantify. A GAO summary of the report, "Intellectual Property, Observations on Efforts to Quantify the Economic Effects of Counterfeit and Pirated Goods," says: "Generally, the illicit nature of counterfeiting and piracy makes estimating the economic impact of (intellectual property) infringements extremely difficult, so assumptions must be used to offset the lack of data. Efforts to estimate losses involve assumptions such as the rate at which consumers would substitute counterfeit for legitimate products, which can have enormous impacts on the resulting estimates. Because of the significant differences in types of counterfeited and pirated goods and industries involved, no single method can be used to develop estimates. Each method has limitations, and most experts observed that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the economy-wide impacts." After we summarized much of this research, Smith objected to Sanchez as an expert, saying in an email that because Sanchez is opposed to the anti-online-piracy act, he "cannot provide an objective or unbiased analysis." He stood by his CNN.com statement, telling us: "Since the U.S. is the largest producer of (intellectual property) that is consumed around the world, one can surmise that a significant amount of that total value is taken from the U.S. economy." Our ruling Smith’s statement draws on a high-end estimate also based on flawed assumptions for the U.S. "consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods" in 2008. The cited $100 billion figure doesn’t reflect the costs to the economy, contrary to Smith’s claim; the 2011 study did not assess such costs, which are understandably slippery. Maybe there is no solid estimate of the cost to the economy. Smith’s CNN.com statement rates False.	None	Lamar Smith	None	None	None	2012-02-06T14:39:29	2012-01-20	['United_States']
pomt-08408	Tom Ganley has "two F's from the Better Business Bureau" and "over 160 complaints in just three years."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/21/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-target-tom-ganley-citing-better-business/	Republican congressional candidate Tom Ganley is an auto giant and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation and finance companies. His success enhanced his stature as a candidate. And, it made him rich enough to help finance his campaign against Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio’s 13th Congressional District. Sutton, with help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has countered by questioning the practices that Ganley used to build his wealth and automotive empire. Sutton's TV advertising has cited lawsuits filed against Ganley dealerships. PolitiFact Ohio examined those claims and noted that while her numbers were correct, the information was presented without context. Specifically, the ad cited large numbers of lawsuits filed against Ganley without noting that he’s been in business four decades and is Ohio’s largest car dealer. "Buyer Beware," a TV ad from the DCCC, added the claims that Ganley has "two F's from the Better Business Bureau" and "over 160 complaints in just three years." PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine these assertions and, again, tried to put them in perspective. We started with the letter grades from the Better Business Bureau. The BBB called them "another tool to use" in choosing a business, and said that the grades are based on 17 different factors that include the time a business has been in operation and how it has handled complaints. An especially important factor is a business's responsive to complaints cited by the BBB. The BBB did give F ratings to two Ganley dealerships, primarily for failing to respond to six complaints filed against them during the bureau's "standard reporting period" of three years, and for false claims in advertising. But in the BBB’s online listings, the average grade for the 20 Ganley dealerships was a B+. That rating compared favorably to the per-store average of four other dealer groups we surveyed (Spitzer, Classic, Liberty and Cincinnati-based Joseph). The grades undergo continuing review and revision, and they have changed since the DCCC's ad. One F grade was upgraded to a B-. The second was withdrawn, replaced with "no rating" and is listed as under review. A third dealership, not rated earlier, was given an F. As for complaints, the BBB says, "There is no known industry standard for the number of complaints a business can expect. The volume of business and number of transactions may have a bearing on the number of complaints received by the BBB." Over 42 years in business, Ganley has sold 585,211 cars and served 1,501,715 service, parts and body customers, said Meghan Snyder, a spokeswoman for Ganley's campaign. "He stands proudly behind his record of serving and employing Northeast Ohioans over the past six decades." We found that its average of almost nine complaints per store, about three per year, was slightly higher than the average for the four other groups we looked at, and that a larger number of complaints involved "selling practices." Warning consumers about one practice, the BBB's website says that several of the dealerships may offer a "conditional delivery agreement" or "spot delivery agreement" to car buyers. Signing such an agreement permits the consumer to take the new vehicle home before financing has been approved," the BBB warns. "Although offered as a 'convenience' to consumers, these agreements can often create problems if the consumer interprets them to mean the final terms of the car purchase will be as originally promised." Those agreements led to several of the lawsuits against Ganley dealerships, such as one filed by a couple who said they took a new car home after being told they were approved for zero percent financing. More than a month later, the couple said, they were told the rate was being moved to 9.44 percent. So let’s check the scorecard. The DCCC's claim that Ganley has "two F's from the Better Business Bureau" checked out. But the ad fails to note that those two grades later changed. The claim of "over 160 complaints in just three years" is accurate. Recognizing that Ganley is Ohio's largest car dealer with 20 dealerships is information not in the ad that lends it some perspective. And that the average grade for all those dealerships is a B plus is an important detail that also is missing. We rate the ad claim as Half True.

pomt-13202	Says Hillary Clinton takes "tens of millions of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/23/kellyanne-conway/do-clinton-donors-throw-gays-buildings/	Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scolded "chest beaters" for criticizing Trump’s (false) claims of voter fraud while ignoring worrying donations to Hillary Clinton’s foundation. "We respect the principles of American democracy," Conway said on Meet the Press Oct. 23, 2016. But, "if we’re so concerned about the principles of American democracy, as so many chest beaters were this week, ask Hillary Clinton why she takes tens of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings?" We wanted to fact-check Conway’s claim. We found Conway is confusing a few points. First, Clinton herself hasn’t taken donations from foreign countries, which is illegal for political candidates. The Clinton Foundation, however, has taken donations from countries that have poor records when it comes to their treatment of women and the LGBT community (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman). Second, Conway’s use of the present tense implies the Clinton Foundation continues to accept these donations, while the latest gifts came in 2014. The foundation has agreed to cease accepting foreign donations should Clinton win the presidency. And finally, same-sex relations in some of these countries is punishable by death, but they do not "throw gays off of buildings." That’s something done by ISIS, which is obviously not a Clinton Foundation donor. The donations As part of a memorandum of understanding between the Obama administration and the Clinton Foundation when Clinton was named secretary of state, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors (reported in broad ranges). The foundation has taken between $1 million and $5 million each from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. Kuwait donated between $5 million and $10 million, and Saudi Arabia between $10 million and $25 million. (Qatar’s 2022 World Cup committee gave between $250,001 and $500,000 while "Friends of Saudi Arabia", a group the New York Times reports was started by a Saudi Prince, donated between $1 million and $5 million.) The Emirati as well as part of the Saudi and Omani gifts came in 2014, according to the Wall Street Journal. Altogether, that’s $18 million to $50 million from these countries. The donations supported the foundation's charitable efforts and the countries are considered allies of the United States. ‘Hate’ and ‘disrespect’ women Adult Saudi women must obtain permission from a male guardian to travel, marry or exit prison and may be required to provide consent to work or access health care, according to Human Rights Watch. They are also not allowed to drive or seek divorce. Women in the UAE also have to seek permission from a male guardian to marry and, once married, the law mandates obedience to her husband. The country does not specifically prohibit domestic violence and allows for punishment with certain conditions. In Qatar, the same provisions for marriage and obedience prevail while marital rape and domestic violence are not criminalized. Kuwait does not prohibit domestic violence, sexual harassment or marital rape. Oman bans gender-based discrimination in theory, but women are discriminated against in divorce, inheritance and child custody cases in practice. ‘Throws gays off buildings’ PolitiFact Arizona has previously reported that extramarital sex, including same-sex intercourse, is punishable by death in the UAE and for Muslims in Qatar. Men engaging in sodomy can be stoned to death and non-married men are subjected to 100 blows of the whip and one-year banishment in Saudi Arabia. They face up to seven years in prison in Kuwait. Kuwaiti law also prohibits "imitating the opposite sex in any way." Same-sex relations carry a penalty from six months to three years in Oman. But Conway’s description of gay men and women being thrown off of buildings is not accurate for these countries. It is ISIS that throws men suspected of being gay off of buildings. As a terrorist group, they cannot and have not donated to the Clinton Foundation. We asked the Trump campaign if Conway misspoke when she conflated ISIS’ actions with those countries that have donated to the Clinton Foundation. We did not hear back. Our ruling Conway said Clinton "takes tens of millions of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings." Conway is talking about donations the Clinton Foundation has taken from U.S. allies is the Middle East for humanitarian project. Her statement is exaggerated and muddles a few facts. Clinton, as a political candidate, cannot take donations from foreign countries. The Clinton Foundation has accepted $18 million to $40 million from countries that have treated women and gays harshly. The latest gifts came in 2014 and are not current as Conway implies. Furthermore, there’s no evidence that these countries have thrown gays off of buildings. Conway may have been thinking of ISIS, which has not and cannot donate to the Clinton Foundation. We rate her claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c14ef1a9-d846-49f6-91ed-f91803faf001	None	Kellyanne Conway	None	None	None	2016-10-23T16:39:08	2016-10-23	['None']
pomt-01996	Under Wisconsin law, "anyone who knows anything about a John Doe" secret criminal investigation "can't talk about it."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/12/scott-walker/wisconsin-law-prohibits-anyone-who-knows-about-sec/	As questions surfaced about whether Gov. Scott Walker is trying to settle a secret John Doe criminal investigation involving his campaign, he has suggested that state law prohibits him from commenting on the case. That’s what happened on the June 1, 2014 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a weekly public affairs program aired on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee and on five other Wisconsin stations. Gousha asked the Republican governor if an attorney representing Walker and his campaign committee has been negotiating with the John Doe special prosecutor to reach a settlement. Walker gave this response: "As you know, as I've pointed out many times in the past when we've talked about this, the law's pretty clear in this state," Walker said. "Anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it. Anyone who doesn't know anything about it shouldn't talk about it. So, I've not commented on the Doe itself because I've abided by the law." Walker has made similar statements in the past, leading many to ask whether the secrecy part of the law in fact is so broad -- particularly given that others have disclosed details of the ongoing probe in the press and in public court filings. What is a John Doe? Here's a John Doe primer, based on an article for the State Bar of Wisconsin by Madison criminal defense attorney Marcus Berghahn, who has represented clients in John Doe investigations: A John Doe is "intended as an independent, investigatory tool to ascertain whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom." Unlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers, including the power to compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and to issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents. Another key difference is that the judge overseeing a John Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings. The governor has been connected to two John Doe investigations. In May 2010, when Walker was the Milwaukee County executive, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, launched what would become a nearly three-year-long John Doe targeting Walker’s aides and associates. Six people, including three county executive employees, one county appointee and a major campaign contributor, were convicted of a variety of crimes. In August 2012, weeks after Walker won an historic recall election to remain in office, Chisholm opened another secret John Doe. It has focused on whether the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative groups illegally coordinated with Walker's campaign. Eric O'Keefe of Wisconsin Club for Growth has openly defied the secrecy order, going public with the fact that he has been subpoenaed. Now, to Walker's claim, made in connection with the second Doe -- that under Wisconsin law, "anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it." It’s worth noting that Walker’s "anyone who knows anything" phrasing is open to interpretation. At one extreme, a person could know something about a John Doe case by hearing about it in the news. That, of course, is much different than knowing about a Doe by virtue of being a participant in it. What the law says Asked to back up Walker's statement, a spokeswoman for the governor’s office referred our questions to Walker’s campaign, and a campaign spokeswoman declined to offer any information to back Walker’s claim. Walker’s attorney in the John Doe, former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic, didn't return our call. We contacted seven experts, all of whom have handled multiple John Doe cases: Berghahn and Madison defense attorneys Stephen Morgan and Stephen Meyer; Milwaukee defense attorneys Jeremy Levinson, who also handles campaign finance cases for Democrats, and Raymond Dall’Osto; University of Wisconsin Law School professor David Schultz and Marquette University Law School professor Daniel Blinka. Meyer and Berghahn are also adjunct professors at the UW Law School. Morgan and Blinka are former prosecutors. Here's what we learned about the state’s John Doe law, in terms of Doe cases done in secret: 1. Secrecy applies when so ordered As we noted, John Doe investigations can be done in public, but the Doe law allows judges to hold them in secret. And many do. When the secrecy provision is invoked, individuals who are ordered by a John Doe judge not to disclose information about a Doe investigation are prohibited from doing so. At minimum, witnesses, attorneys and others who participate in the secret court proceedings are prohibited from disclosing anything that was said in court, or anything, such as documents or other evidence, shown in the closed court proceeding. Judges have also issued broader secrecy prohibitions. For example, people who receive a subpoena to produce documents might be ordered not to disclose to anyone but their attorney the fact that they were subpoenaed, nor what information the subpoena seeks. 2. Secrecy doesn’t apply to "anyone" There is no blanket prohibition that applies to anyone who has some knowledge about a John Doe. For example, anyone who hears information second-hand about a Doe is not prohibited from talking about it. 3. A gray area Our experts disagreed on whether the John Doe law prohibits a person from commenting on any possible settlement negotiations. Some felt any secrecy order would not apply because settlement negotiations would be done in, for example, a lawyer’s office, apart from the secret proceedings in court. However, other experts said a secrecy order could apply to commenting on the existence of settlement negotiations because such negotiations could be the subject of discussion during the secret courtroom proceedings. Our rating Asked whether his lawyer was in negotiations to settle a John Doe criminal investigation, Walker said that under Wisconsin law, "anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it." A person who knows something about a John Doe by virtue of participating in the secret court proceedings -- if they are individually ordered by a judge not to disclose anything about the proceedings -- is prohibited from revealing such information. But the governor’s statement is overbroad in suggesting that anyone who knows any information about a John Doe can’t talk about it. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Walker a Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-06-12T05:00:00	2014-06-01	['None']
pomt-08823	The United States accounted for 26 percent of worldwide military spending during the Cold War, but now accounts for 41 percent.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/13/barney-frank/barney-frank-says-us-share-global-defense-spending/	UPDATE: We first published this item on Aug. 4, 2010, and rated Frank's claim False. We heard from many readers who said we made the wrong call and urged us to take a second look. We did so, and have concluded that we put too much emphasis on percentage of GDP in reaching our original conclusion. We are now rating the claim Half True. Seeking to build a case that the United States should cut its defense budget, Rep. Barney Frank, D.-Mass., said the U.S. now accounts for a larger share of worldwide military spending than it did during the Cold War. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe, on July 7, 2010, Frank said, "During the Cold War... [the United States accounted for] 26 percent of worldwide military spending. . . We're now 41 percent of worldwide military spending." His comments followed a Huffington Post article he co-authored with an unlikely political ally: Rep. Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas. It said Congress should substantially cut defense spending to reduce the deficit. First we started by checking Frank's percentages. Although he was imprecise in his wording referring to spending during the Cold War, his office told us he was comparing 1986 with 2006, so the percentage Frank used for Cold War spending was a snapshot of a conflict that stretched from roughly 1947 to 1991. Frank’s choice of 1986 might seem arbitrary, but few countries recorded or gathered data on their military resources before the 1960s -- halfway through the conflict. And reports indicate reliable comparisons are only available for the 1980s -- the last decade of the Cold War. We reviewed records of U.S. defense spending, and spending in 1986 was at one of its highest points of the Cold War years, so if Frank is cherry picking, he's at least being fair by picking a year on the high end (picking a year of low spending might have presented an even wider disparity with regard to the growing share of worldwide defense spending shouldered by the United States). The source of Frank's figures was a report by the Project on Defense Alternatives, a group that advocates for the gradual demilitarization of international relations. And the report shows his 1986 number was off slightly, which his office acknowledged when we called. U.S. military expenditures were 28 percent of worldwide military spending in 1986, not 26 percent. His figure for 2006 was accurate. We spoke to the report's author, Carl Conetta, co-director of the Project on defense Alternatives, who said the data was primarily obtained from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's "World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers" reports, as well as from the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Conetta said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan obviously inflated the U.S.'s 2006 defense spending figures. If that war spending was backed out of the equation, he said, the U.S. accounted for about 37 percent of worldwide defense spending in 2006. But he added that in more recent years -- even with war spending taken out of the picture --the number is closer to the 41 percent cited by Frank. When we looked, we found that worldwide military spending dropped precipitously after the Cold War ended in 1991, falling by 40 percent between 1987 -- when it had peaked -- and 1995. Even though worldwide spending has risen consistently since 1995, adjusted for inflation, it’s still significantly below its Cold War highs. In other words, whatever percent of global expenditures the U.S. accounts for today, it’s a piece of a substantially smaller pie. While other countries were cutting their defense spending, the United States increased its spending some over the same period (in dollars adjusted for inflation). There's another way to measure defense spending that we feel is worth noting. A comparison can be drawn between a country’s military expenditures as a percent of gross domestic product, since that figure is not contingent on other countries’ expenditures. We looked at the years Frank cited using that measure. While federal outlays for national defense in the U.S. accounted for 6.2 percent of the GDP in 1986, according to a Historical Tables report by the Office of Budget Management, they accounted for only 4.0 percent of the GDP in 2006. During that period, the GDP in the United States rose by a whopping 45 percent, so military spending would have had to increase significantly to keep pace. Some may assume Frank's statistic means that U.S. spending on military has increased so dramatically that the U.S. share of military spending now comprises a significantly larger percentage of the world's military spending. But as the numbers show, that's not necessarily the case. Rather, other countries essentially cut their military spending while the United States slightly increased its spending. As a result, the United States now comprises a larger share of a smaller worldwide pie. There are lots of ways to evaluate defense spending. It's appropriate to look at spending as a percentage of GDP, said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. But it's also perfectly appropriate to consider what the United States spends compared to the rest of the world. There are differences in those comparisons, but both are valid statistics to consider, he said. "It's a legitimate to ask, 'Why we are spending so much on defense if we are the world's only super power?'" Ellis said. Frank's statistic is not only accurate, said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation, "I think it makes sense for the point (Frank) was trying to make. The others are going down and we're going up. We're at the highest levels since World War II." We were wary of Frank singling out 1986 to speak sweepingly for several decades of the Cold War. Conetta, the author of the report Frank based his comments on, said 1986 was used because it was near the peak of Cold War spending by the United States. U.S. spending as a percentage of worldwide defense spending would certainly change if you were to select different Cold War years, Conetta said, but probably only by a few percentage points (not counting years of armed conflict, like during the Korean War). And yet, there is clearly room for legitimate debate about which types of statistics one chooses to evaluate defense spending and how they should be presented. Frank cited a growing U.S. share of worldwide defense spending without also noting that U.S. defense spending -- as a percentage of GDP -- has actually decreased significantly since the Cold War, or that the growing disparity is largely driven by the fact that many other countries (primarily Russia) decreased their defense spending after the Cold War.

pomt-02354	"Reporters rehearse questions with White House press (secretary)."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/20/drudge-report/drudge-links-report-claiming-white-house-press-bri/	The Drudge Report, a conduit of conservative news, threw a wrench in the daily ritual of the White House press briefing. That’s when reporters pepper White House spokesman Jay Carney with questions. Drudge gave top billing to an item in the Weekly Standard, posted by online editor Daniel Halper. In Halper’s article, the headline said it all: "Reporter: WH press secretary gets questions from reporters before press briefing: It’s just a show." Halper didn’t write too much more. Mainly, he inserted a video of a reporter from an Arizona CBS affiliate talking about what she learned on her visit to the White House. The reporter, Catherine Anaya, said Carney told her that the questions correspondents ask "are provided to him in advance. So then he knows what he's going to be answering and sometimes those correspondents and reporters also have those answers printed in front of them." Drudge’s headline -- at the top of its page -- meant the news quickly spread through other websites and Twitter (likely making for a good traffic day at weeklystandard.com). Then came the rebuttal. Carney tweeted, "Briefings would be a lot easier if this were true! Rest assured, it is not." We got in touch with Anaya, and she let us know in an email that she had confused the matter. Basically, she had a question for President Barack Obama that was of more local than national interest. She had the option to submit it in advance, and she got that muddied with how the usual press briefings take place. "I was attempting to not waste national time on a local question but in my attempt at explaining that I unintentionally made it sound like that experience applied to everyone," Anaya said. "That is my mistake and I own up to it." Anaya’s station, CBS 5 News, also released a statement (from Anaya) saying she didn’t know the process for White House regulars. The statement was removed from the station’s website, but a copy is available here. The station says they are working on reissuing a statement. We’ll update this post when it’s available. Update: Here is the CBS 5 statement, issued by Anaya. "Last night during my live reports from the White House I attempted to describe the highlights of the day. I was speaking off the cuff and unscripted and in the process I made two major mistakes: I reported an off the record conversation and what I reported was not accurate. I took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing. I incorrectly applied the process to everyone. That was wrong and it was bad reporting. But it was not intentional and I would never purposely report inaccurate information. The White House never asked for my questions in advance and never instructed me what to ask. I chose to provide one of my questions in advance of the press briefing because I wanted to make sure it would have broad appeal. I did not attribute or report factually last night and for that I deeply apologize. I pride myself on truth and objectivity. I sincerely regret any harm I've caused and I hope that you will We asked White House reporters if they are ever asked to send in their questions, and get replies, before the actual briefings. In one form or another, they all said, no way. (We also created a video attached to this fact-check that shows some of the interactions between Carney and the press corps.) Steve Thomma, senior White House correspondent for McClatchy and president of the White House Correspondents Association said, "I've never heard of a scripted set up before a briefing." CNN’s Jake Tapper, host of The Lead and veteran of many daily briefings, had a wry response: "The press briefing is not where you go to get clear and candid answers," Tapper said. "In terms of this bizarre meme that was birthed – no, I have never in any way submitted questions ahead of time to anyone at the White House for any reason." NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley was also bemused. "This story has generated some pained smiles today in the White House press room," Horsley said. Horsley explained that reporters ask plenty of questions outside of the briefings and so the press office staff will know what’s on their minds. If a longer term reporting story is in play, Horsley will tell the White House staff what he needs to know. "But as a general rule, the briefings are not scripted that way. If they were, they could be a lot shorter," Horsley said. We emailed the editors of the Weekly Standard but did not hear back. Halper, when confronted on Twitter by Fox News White House correspondent Ed Henry (who called the story "dead wrong"), said he was just reporting what Anaya said. Drudge eventually updated its website, linking to a different article from Daily Mail with the headline, "UPDATE: Reporter retracts story, says Press Sec doesn't get questions in advance..." Our ruling The Drudge Report gave top billing to the claim that the daily White House press briefings are "just a show," with questions submitted and answered in advance. That claim relied on the report of a television anchor in Arizona. But the Drudge Report did all it could to make the statement go viral. Accountability applies as much to spreading information, especially for a website as popular as the Drudge Report, as it does to the journalist who wrote the article. The reporter behind Halper’s article now says she made a mistake and really doesn’t know what happens in the briefings. She was considering asking a question about a local issue and wanted to know if it would be appropriate to ask at the regular press briefing. She opted to save the question for her interview with Obama. According to Carney and the reporters whom he faces daily, this scenario in no way matches up with their experiences. Halper took a shaky report and drew a strong conclusion without proof. Drudge put that claim on steroids. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

Michele Bachmann says President Barack Obama's approval ratings are historically low -- and sinking even lower. During the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Bachmann said, "President Obama has the lowest public approval ratings of any president in modern times. He hasn't gone to the basement yet. It'll be a lot lower than what it is now." We can't explore her prediction, but we can examine if Obama has the lowest ratings of any modern president. Are they really worse than those of Richard "Tricky Dick" Nixon, Jimmy "Malaise" Carter and Lyndon "Hey, Hey, LBJ, How Many Kids Did You Kill Today" Johnson? Not by a long shot. We looked at presidential approval data from Gallup, which goes back to Harry Truman. It’s the longest continuous data set for presidential approval ratings. We looked at two different measurements: Each president’s lowest approval rating for their entire term, and each president’s lowest point for their first 968 days, which is how long Obama has served in office. First, the lows for the presidents' entire terms, listed in descending order from the "highest" low to the "lowest" low: John F. Kennedy: 56 percent Dwight Eisenhower: 48 percent Barack Obama: 40 percent Bill Clinton: 37 percent Gerald Ford: 37 percent Ronald Reagan: 35 percent Lyndon B. Johnson: 35 percent George H.W. Bush: 29 percent Jimmy Carter: 28 percent George W. Bush: 25 percent Richard Nixon: 24 percent Harry Truman: 22 percent By this measure, nine presidents hit lower lows than Obama has. What about comparing only the first 968 days for each president? Bachmann’s closer with this one, but still wrong. Here is a list of each president’s low point during that time frame: John F. Kennedy: 61 percent Dwight Eisenhower: 57 percent George H.W. Bush: 53 percent George W. Bush: 50 percent Richard Nixon: 48 percent Lyndon B. Johnson: 46 percent Barack Obama: 40 percent Bill Clinton: 37 percent Gerald Ford: 37 percent Ronald Reagan: 35 percent Harry Truman: 33 percent Jimmy Carter: 28 percent By this measure, five presidents had lows that were worse than Obama at this point in their presidencies.

pomt-06407	Medicare monthly premiums will go up to $104.20 in 2012 and $247.00 in 2014 due to "provisions incorporated in the Obamacare legislation, purposely delayed so as not to 'confuse' the 2012 re-election campaigns."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/27/chain-email/medicare-premiums-going-due-obamacare-chain-e-mail/	A chain e-mail going around warns of a Medicare premium increase, saying monthly premiums will go up from $96.40 to $247 in 2014. Blame it all on "Obamacare," the e-mail says. Here’s the full text of the copy we received: MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASE For those of you who are on Medicare, read the article below. It's a short but important article that you probably haven't heard about in the mainstream news: The per person Medicare insurance premium will increase from the present monthly fee of $ 96.40, rising to: $104.20 in 2012; $120.20 in 2013; And $247.00 in 2014. These are provisions incorporated in the Obamacare legislation, purposely delayed so as not to 'confuse' the 2012 re-election campaigns. Send this to all seniors that you know, so they will know who's throwing them under the bus. We decided to fact-check this chain e-mail, which we soon found has been floating around the Internet in one version or another since at least 2009. As we researched, we quickly realized two important points. First, the chain e-mail’s numbers are wrong. Second, explaining Medicare premiums is pretty complicated. So let’s start with a few Medicare basics: Medicare is the government-run health insurance program for Americans over age 65. Medicare’s Part A, which all beneficiaries receive, pays for hospitalization, while Part B pays for doctor’s visits and other regular health-care services. Based on the numbers it uses for premiums, it’s clear the chain e-mail is referring to what Medicare beneficiaries pay monthly for Medicare Part B premiums. Medicare calculates those premiums each year based on several factors that change from year to year. So the e-mail’s claim to know what Medicare premiums will be in the future doesn’t hold much water. In addition to that, the chain e-mail gets existing numbers wrong. Part B premiums were $96.40 back in 2009 (likely when the e-mail was first written). In 2011, the official monthly premium is $115.40. And as we were working on this report, the 2012 numbers were formally announced. The premium is $99.90 for 2012, not the $104.20 that the e-mail predicted. Also, "Obamacare" -- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- didn’t make changes to the way that the official monthly rate for Medicare Part B premiums is calculated. There is some fine print here, though, and quite a bit of it. Most Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 still paid the 2009 amount, thanks to rules that say Medicare premiums cannot go up for existing beneficiaries if Social Security payments don’t go up. (This is known as the "hold harmless" provision.) Social Security payments did not go up in 2010 or 2011 because there was no cost-of-living increase due to a lack of inflation. On Oct. 19, the federal government announced there would be a cost-of-living, or COLA, increase in 2012. So even though the official Medicare rate dropped for 2012, most Medicare beneficiaries will see a small increase in rates, from the 2009 rate of $96.40 to the 2012 rate of $99.90. On the other end of the spectrum, some high-earning retirees pay more than the standard monthly premium. In 2011, beneficiaries who report income of more than $85,000 pay higher rates, all the way up to $369.10 for a person with income above $214,000 a year, or couples with income above $428,000. (See this chart for more details.) And the health care law does make changes to these rules affecting high earners -- it stops indexing the income limits for inflation through 2019, said Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s. It means that "more people will hit the threshold that substantially reduces the subsidy received," Wilensky said, and it was not widely noted when the law passed. Here, we should explain a bit more about how basic Medicare premiums are calculated. It’s required by law that Medicare Part B beneficiaries contribute to the cost of their health care via premiums. Right now, the contributions are required to be about 25 percent of total costs. So every year, Medicare figures out what that 25 percent will probably be and then sets rates to meet that target. It’s surprising that the official rate is going down for 2012, given recent trends on escalating health care costs -- U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called it "pretty remarkable" in a conference call on Oct. 27, 2011, announcing the changes. Medicare administrator Donald Berwick said the low premiums were due to two changes. First, because of Social Security going up, more people will be eligible to pay the official rate, rather than remaining at an older rate due to the "hold harmless" provision. So increasing costs will be shared among a larger pool of beneficiaries. Second, he said that health care spending was growing more slowly than projected. (He credited that to increased emphasis on prevention and effective treatments.) Our ruling The chain e-mail claimed that Medicare Part B premiums would increase dramatically in future years because of the health care law supported by President Barack Obama. We couldn’t find evidence to support the e-mail’s numbers. And in fact, most Medicare beneficiaries will only pay $3.50 more a month in 2012. The e-mail’s projection for 2014 seems entirely fabricated. The health care law leaves in place the long-established methods for calculating Medicare Part B premiums. The chain e-mail makes the additional unproved claim that its allegations -- which are false anyway -- were accomplished nefariously and delayed for political purposes.

pomt-09347	"This census is also the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-2010-census-shortest-mo/	In a March 29, 2010, press release, Rep. Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that oversees the census, attempted to rally Republican participation in the 2010 census after he said early early returns of census forms showed Republican counties were lagging behind, perhaps due to discouragement from "otherwise well-meaning conservatives." Back in June 2009, for example, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., complained that "the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that." And on March 3, 2010, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, cast the lone vote in the House against a resolution to encourage participation in the 2010 census to ensure an accurate and complete count. Explaining his vote, Paul said, it was "for the simple, obvious reason that the census, like so many government programs, has grown far beyond what the framers of our Constitution intended. The invasive nature of the current census raises serious questions about how and why government will use the collected information. It also demonstrates how the federal bureaucracy consistently encourages citizens to think of themselves in terms of groups, rather than as individual Americans." McHenry worries that those kinds of comments might lead to lower Republican participation in the census, to the party's own detriment. A Pew Research Center survey in mid-March found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats); and when asked if the census asks for more information than the government really needs, 61 percent of Republicans either responded "yes" or "don't know," as opposed 47 percent of Democrats. Seeking to allay some of those concerns, McHenry said, "This census is also the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history." "Conservatives need to know how important it is to fill out the census," stated McHenry stated. "It is one of the only things our Constitution specifically asks of U.S. citizens and boycotting will just help liberals expand government even further." In a separate item, we explored whether there is credible evidence Republican participation in filling out census forms is lagging behind that of Democrats. Here, we will tackle's McHenry's claim that the 2010 census is the shortest in modern history. The U.S. Census Bureau has long been touting the 2010 questionnaire as "one of the shortest census forms in history," with just 10 questions that take about 10 minutes to complete. And here they are: 1. The number of people living in the residence 2. Any additional people that might be living there as of April 1, 2010 3. Whether the residence is owned or rented 4. Telephone number (in case the Census Bureau has follow-up questions) 5. Name 6. Sex 7. Age and date of birth 8. Whether of Hispanic origin 9. Race 10. Whether that person sometimes lives somewhere else Still, note the "one of the shortest," qualifier in the Census Bureau's statement. That's because the short form for the 2000 census had just 8 questions. So it was shorter. But in 2000, one out of six households would get a long form, which had 53 questions. For the 2010 count, the Census Bureau did away with the long form altogether. Now, instead of asking the more detailed social, economic and housing characteristics questions in the long form once a decade, the Census Bureau now asks them in the annual American Community Survey, which goes out to about 3 million addresses each year, explained U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman Stacy Gimbel Vidal. In the decades prior to 2000, the short forms were all much longer than 10 questions. In 1990, for example, the survey posed seven population and seven housing questions. But samples of the population also got an additional 23 population questions and 19 housing questions. In 1980, the forms included 33 population questions and 7 housing questions (plus, a sampling got 23 more). We looked through an index of survey questions asked in each census through U.S. history and had to go back to 1840 before we found one shorter than 10 questions. But we don't think that counts as "modern history." For the record, in the very first census in 1790, assistant marshals listed the name of each head of household and then asked four questions. Now, "name" counts as one of the 10 questions, so the number of questions has essentially doubled (we also note that one of the questions now asks for your telephone number, to verify information, and back in 1790, the telephone was nearly 100 years away from being invented). We think McHenry can make a credible claim that this year's census is the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history. We'll dock him a bit because the short form of the 2000 census was technically shorter, with eight questions rather than 10. But in 2000, one in six got a long form census, which was much longer. And this year, everyone will get the 10-question form. We rate McHenry's claim Mostly True.	None	Patrick McHenry	None	None	None	2010-04-07T17:20:48	2010-03-29	['None']

Palin joined the ticket at an event in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 29, 2008, delivering a speech discussing her biography and qualifications to be vice president. When she entered public office, she said her goals were "to stop wasteful spending, and cut property taxes, and put the people first." "When oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase, I sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska," Palin said of her accomplishments as governor. We looked into the record and found that Palin did push for a measure to return state surplus revenue back to residents of mineral-rich Alaska. On Aug. 7, 2008, the Alaska Legislature approved a measure she promoted that would send $1,200 to every Alaskan who qualifies. That comes to about $741-million for state residents, out of an estimated $2.7-billion in increased oil taxes and royalties. Purists might argue that the rebates only come to 35 percent of the estimated excess revenue. But still, it seems fair to us to describe a $741-million outlay as "large," and $1,200 per person is a nice windfall. We find Palin's statement True.

pomt-06000	The planned expansion of Savannah’s port is a "jobs creating project."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/20/nathan-deal/savannah-port-jobs-impact-unclear/	Boosters of the stalled plan to deepen Savannah’s port keep a laundry list of reasons why breaking ground is a good idea. You may have heard them before. The project, they say, will make the port more efficient, help the U.S. boost exports, and make Georgia more competitive in the global market. But few grabbed our attention like one by Gov. Nathan Deal about the port’s effect on jobs. The claim appeared in an op-ed in Roll Call, a Washington, D.C., publication with a Capitol Hill readership. Deal’s essay argued that Congress should give the dredging project money, even while the country is counting its pennies. "Updating vital infrastructure that supports jobs and increases U.S. competitiveness is not the place to find cost savings. In this new era of prioritization, this is exactly the type of export-boosting, jobs-creating project that should be at the top of our list," Deal wrote. Politicians often lace their pitches for expensive infrastructure projects with jobs claims, especially now that Georgia’s unemployment is stuck near 10 percent. We wondered if Deal had proof. A Deal spokeswoman suggested we call the Army Corps of Engineers for data and mentioned research by the University of Georgia on the economic impact of the state’s ports. We also looked for jobs forecasts for the port deepening. We found that there’s not much jobs data. Officials from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Georgia Ports Authority and experts we interviewed said they were not aware of any economic impact study that analyzes how a deeper port would impact area jobs once it’s up and running. The Army Corps of Engineers did conduct an economic impact study, but it didn’t focus on jobs. It studied how the project would increase shipping efficiency across the nation, and the economic benefits this would create. The study does mention that if the port were dredged to the depth of 46 feet, construction could create as many as 5,000 "job-equivalents" during 48 to 60 months of construction. But take note. This number does not represent how many additional people would be hired to dredge the port. It includes jobs that would be created to make materials needed to dredge the port, or those that come about when workers spend their salaries. Furthermore, it’s not clear how many of these jobs would be new. The corps would contract with professional dredging companies that already maintain the harbor, said Billy Birdwell, a spokesman for the corps. It’s unclear how many additional people they would hire. Further complicating the matter is that each of these 5,000 job-equivalents amount to one job lasting one year. By this measure, a single full-time job lasting all five years of the project could count as five job-equivalents. Though there are not many specifics on the deepening project’s potential to create jobs, it’s clear that the Savannah port has a profound impact on employment in Georgia. Jeffrey Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia, has conducted studies about the economic impact of the state’s port system. In 2009, workers held 14,131 full- and part-time slots at the Savannah port’s publicly owned facilities, according to a Selig Center study. If you add in the jobs to make the materials those workers used, as well as those to staff the places where those workers spent their pay, these jobs total 21,628, the study said. Because of major changes in the shipping industry, Georgia risks losing jobs if the port isn’t deepened, Humphreys said. An expansion project at the Panama Canal will allow a bigger class of megaships to sail into East Coast harbors. Businesses like using these ships because they can help reduce how much time and money they spend transporting goods. These ships require deeper ports, so major harbors along the Atlantic coastline are racing to update their infrastructure to win their business. If these ports are successful, the rewards could be big. A trade group representing businesses that move big cargo expects that shipments will jump dramatically along the East Coast once the Panama Canal expansion completes in 2014, according to an August 2010 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. If that happens, the Georgia Ports Authority expects to build cranes and rail yards to accommodate more containers, the Journal-Constitution reported in December 2010. Ports that don’t deepen may lose business, analysts told PolitiFact Georgia. "It’s really a matter of making sure the economic impacts that are already existing don’t go away," Humphreys said. How do we rule? Is the proposed Savannah port deepening a "jobs-creating project," as Deal said? The corps estimates that dredging the port will require additional workers, although it’s not clear how many. Evidence and common sense suggest that if megaships flock to a newly deepened Savannah port, the project could keep jobs in Georgia. It may well create them. But existing research offers little clarity. Since Deal’s claim leaves out the crucial fact that the jobs impacts are uncertain, we give him a Half True.

Obamacare is different, Rubio replied. "Well, here’s the distinguishing factor. Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years," he said. "Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability. I’m not saying we should do that." Is Rubio correct about the federal money for expanding Medicaid going away after a few years? Somewhat. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand access to health insurance for the nation’s uninsured residents. The architects of the law envisioned an expansion of Medicaid in each state to cover low-income adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2013 was $15,856 for an individual or $26,951 for a family of three in 2013. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the law as constitutional, but justices struck down the mandatory Medicaid expansion. That left it to state leaders to decide whether to offer more residents coverage through the jointly administered program. Twenty-three states are not expanding Medicaid, including Texas and Florida, states with high uninsured populations, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. On the other side, 26 states including the District of Columbia are implementing the expansion in 2014, and two states will move ahead with an expansion after the first year. For conservative governors in Ohio, Michigan and Arizona, the deal offered by the federal government to expand was too good to pass up. The federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of adding new adult Medicaid beneficiaries from 2014 to 2016. The federal government will scale down its payments to 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The 90 percent level is permanent. States will not have to shoulder more than 10 percent of the cost after that, unless Congress passed a law to change the ratio. Our ruling Rubio said, "Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years. Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability." His office did not respond to us. The federal government will only pay 100 percent of the costs of expanding Medicaid for three years starting in 2014. But Rubio leaves a misleading impression with viewers that all of the money just goes away. The federal government plans to bring down its share to a permanent funding level of 90 percent. Rubio's statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13077	"Two years ago, the longest serving leader of the California republic, Jerry Brown, boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/nov/11/louis-marinelli/calexit-group-distorts-jerry-browns-separate-natio/	Following Donald Trump’s upset victory on Election Day, a group in deep blue California gained attention for its calls to create a sovereign Golden State. The Yes California independence campaign hopes to place a referendum on a future state ballot asking voters to decide whether to leave the United States. A Calexit, as the hypothetical separation has been called, would require two-thirds approval of both houses of Congress, and permission from 38 state legislatures. Leaders of the group have made some questionable statements as they pursue this seemingly implausible feat. They claim to draw inspiration from Gov. Jerry Brown, who they allege has already declared California "a separate nation." "Two years ago, the longest serving leader of the California republic, Jerry Brown, boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation," Louis Marinelli, president of Yes California, told a conference in Moscow on Sept. 26, 2016. Marinelli makes his claim at the :28 minute mark in the video above. The sovereignty group’s vice-president made a similar claim in a 2015 interview. We wondered what evidence, if any, the group had about Brown declaring California "a separate nation." We set out on a fact-check. Our research Brown visited China on a trade mission in 2013 with the goal of spurring Chinese investment in California. We found no evidence he told the Chinese that California was a "separate nation" on that trip. Reached by email, Marinelli pointed us to a March 2015 Desert Sun news article in which the governor was quoted as saying California is, indeed, "a separate nation." The article says Brown made that comment, however, at an event in San Francisco marking the release of a report on California’s collaboration with China to combat climate change, not on his trip to China. Here are Brown’s comments from the article: "It is a little bold to talk about the China-California partnership as though we were a separate nation, but we are a separate nation. We're a state of mind. I include Silicon Valley, I include the environmental activism, the biotech industry, agriculture. This is a place of great investment in innovation." A video from the event shows Brown added a bit more context than was captured in the article. Immediately after saying "we are a separate nation ..." the governor says "... in our own minds. Or maybe I should put it this way: We're a state of mind." A California independence group has seized on comments made by Gov. Jerry Brown's at the 11:30 minute mark in this video. A spokesman for the governor said in an email that the "Context of (Brown’s) statement is clear: California’s footprint—it’s geography, economy and innovation—gives it as much influence / impact as a nation and that’s the point." The governor released a statement this week reacting to Trump’s election, calling for national unity. "With the deep divisions in our country, it is incumbent on all of us – especially the new leadership in Washington – to take steps that heal those divisions, not deepen them. In California, we will do our part to find common ground whenever possible." Hypothetical comparisons From the governor’s follow-up comment "We’re a state of mind," in the 2015 news article, it seems clear Brown was speaking symbolically about California being a distinct country. For years, the Brown Administration has made hypothetical economic comparisons between California and major nations across the globe. In June, for example, it released GDP figures showing California would be the sixth largest economy on the planet, if it were a nation. With nearly 40 million people, California has a larger population than many countries. Brown has positioned California as an international leader on climate change, working with major countries on the topic at venues such as the Paris climate change conference last year. In doing so, however, he’s never called for California to break away from the U.S. Our ruling Louis Marinelli, president of the sovereignty group Yes California, recently claimed that Gov. Jerry Brown "boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation." There’s no evidence Brown ever declared California’s independence, in China or anywhere else. Instead, Marinelli greatly distorted comments the governor made not in China, but at a San Francisco climate change event. Brown did say California is "a separate nation," but it was hardly a bold declaration. He immediately followed it up saying California "is a state of mind," indicating he was speaking symbolically. Brown has elevated California to an international stage in his climate change fight, and has talked about the state being the sixth largest economy in the world, if it were a nation. Marinelli ignored all context and greatly misconstrued Brown’s comments. We rate his claim Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-08433	The new health care law crushes small businesses "with billions in penalties."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/18/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-says-health-care-law-hammers-small-busi/	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is attacking Betsy Markey, a Colorado House member running for re-election, for supporting major Democratic initiatives. But in making its criticism, the chamber distorts key parts of the proposals. "Colorado is facing economic disaster," the ad says. "We told Betsy Markey we needed jobs. Why didn't she listen? Markey fought for the Obama-Pelosi government take over of health care, crushing small businesses with billions in penalties. Now Markey wants a national energy tax, costing families nearly $2,000 a year. Call Betsy Markey, tell her to listen. Tell her to stop supporting Pelosi and making the economy worse." Markey did vote for the new health care law, a major overhaul of health care regulations, as well as a cap-and-trade law intended to curb carbon emissions and address climate change. But the ad's descriptions of those measures are deceptive. For example, Markey does not favor a national energy tax. She did support a cap-and-trade proposal that limits carbon emissions of polluters by requiring them to buy permits. Companies would more than likely pass on their costs to consumers, but it wouldn't cost nearly $2,000. Nonpartisan agencies estimate it would cost families between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. We wrote a detailed analysis last year when Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said that the Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create "a $1,761 yearly energy tax." We rated the statement False. The $1,761 number was a figure created and promoted by a conservative blogger. Here, we're looking at the ad's claim that the Democratic health care law crushes small businesses "with billions in penalties." We found this claim perplexing, because small businesses can actually qualify for tax credits under the new health care law. Generally speaking, tax credits are available to employers with fewer than 25 employees who are paid average annual wages of less than $50,000. If the employer pays for at least half of the insurance for workers, the employer gets a tax credit for part of the contributions. Those tax credits start for the 2010 tax year, and they increase in 2014 when more provisions of the health care law take effect. During the debate leading up to the health care law, members of Congress considered -- but ultimately rejected -- a straightfoward mandate requiring employers to offer health care to workers and imposing penalties if they didn't. Instead, they came up with a complicated fine for large employers. Starting in 2014, large employers who don't offer health care face a fine, but only if their workers qualify for tax credits from the government to buy health care. It's likely that most large employers who don't offer insurance will have to pay the fine. But again, small employers -- those with 50 employees or fewer -- are exempt from the fine. Still, that's the provision the Chamber pointed to when we asked them for evidence for the claim in the ad. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the fines would come to $52 billion over 10 years. We should note that there's a lot of political mischief to be had around the term "small business." Pollsters tell us that Americans have very positive opinions of small businesses, but people often have different ideas of what size a small business is. In a similar vein, Republicans have made the case this year that most of the wealthiest Americans are actually small business owners, but that's a dubious claim. We looked into a statement to that effect earlier this year and rated it Barely True. And the health care law does impose some new taxes on the wealthiest Americans: It imposes a 3.8 percent tax on the investment income of couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000. The Chamber argued that businesses can have more than 50 employees and still be considered small businesses. Spokesman J.P Fielder pointed to regulations from the Small Business Administration that consider a small business to be anyone with 500 or fewer employees. And it's true that generally speaking, the Small Business Administration does consider a small business to be a firm with 500 employees or less. But there are exceptions for that, depending on the industry. For example, a manufacturing firm with 500 employees is probably a small manufacturer, but an accounting firm with 500 employees is relatively large, said spokesman Hayley Matz. In some cases, the small business designation is determined by the firm's revenues, not the number of employees. We also looked at research the Small Business Administration compiles using data from the U.S. Census. Their research shows that the vast majority of businesses in the United States have fewer than 50 employees. In 2007, 5,814,584 firms had fewer than 50 employees, compared with a total just over 6,049,655 firms. In other words, 96 percent of U.S. small businesses are specifically exempted from fines on employers who don't insure their employees. The Chamber's ad said that the new health care law crushes small businesses "with billions in penalties." But some small businesses will actually get tax credits from the health care law. Meanwhile, almost all small businesses -- those with fewer than 50 employees -- are exempt from penalties, whether they offer insurance or not. Some small businesses are larger than 50 employees and could face fines if they don't offer employees insurance. But a vast majority of U.S. firms are smaller than 50 employees and are exempt from the health insurance requirements. The chamber's ad is sweeping, and doesn't account for any of the positive provisions that don't "crush" small business but actually help them. So we rate the Chamber's statement False.

pomt-04700	Says Mitt Romney told university students in Ohio that to start a business, they should "borrow money if you have to from your parents."	true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-mitt-romney-advised-college-stu/	Making a case for President Barack Obama, Julián Castro said the Republican presidential nominee lacks a common touch. "Mitt Romney, quite simply, doesn’t get it," the San Antonio mayor said in his Sept. 4, 2012, keynote at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. "A few months ago, he visited a university in Ohio and gave the students there a little entrepreneurial advice. ‘Start a business,’ he said. "But how? ‘Borrow money if you have to from your parents.’ "Gee, why didn't I think of that?" Castro said to delegates’ delight. Castro continued: "Some people are lucky enough to borrow money from their parents, but that shouldn't determine whether you can pursue your dreams. I don't think Gov. Romney meant any harm. I think he's a good guy. He just has no idea how good he's had it." Did Castro accurately recap Romney’s student advice? According to news accounts, Romney visited Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio (northeast of Columbus) on April 27, 2012. And, as reported at the time by The Washington Post and other news organizations, the candidate told an auditorium full of students and faculty that Obama’s policies had amounted to an attack on success and on those who aspire to be successful. "This kind of divisiveness, this attack on success," Romney was reported as saying, "is very different than what we’ve seen in our country’s history. We’ve always encouraged young people, take — take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business." We checked his quoted comments against a video taken of his 35-minute speech by Marc Kovac, an Ohio reporter for Dix Newspapers. It shows his exhortation occurred toward the end of a presentation otherwise lacing Romney's criticism of Obama’s stewardship of the economy with vows to spur the economy and unite the country. But was Romney recommending borrowing money from parents to start a business or to pay for an education or both? His wording and delivery didn’t make it clear. In fact, the National Journal’s report on the speech said that Romney reported that Romney "offered a group of college students this advice: If you want to get an education or start a business, borrow money from your parents." An aide to Romney clarified later that Romney said he was referring to business loans when he suggested students borrow money from their parents," and not, the wording indicates, borrowing to go to college. The National Journal amended its story. In any event, Romney followed his remark at Otterbein U. by citing the example of sandwich chain Jimmy John’s, which owner Jimmy John Liautaud launched by borrowing $20,000 from his father (in return for 48 percent of the business) to start the shop, the Post and New York Daily News reported. The Post account says: "Liautaud’s father had made the loan on the condition that if his son wasn’t able to return the money, with interest, within a year, he would have to join the Army." Romney told the audience that Liautaud’s "sandwiches are doing pretty well. He’s got shops all over the country and thousands of people who work with him. This is kind of an American experience." Asked about Castro’s claim, Romney campaign spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that cherry-picking one statement from one speech, "a national policy does not make." Romney, Walker said, has laid out his desires to create more jobs and increase take-home pay. Separately, we searched the Nexis database of news coverage and did not unearth other instances of Romney lofting the borrow-from-your-parents' idea. Our ruling Castro told his fellow Democrats that Romney urged students at an Ohio university that if they have to, they should borrow money from their parents to start a business. Romney, in fact, said that. Castro’s claim rates True.	None	Julián Castro	None	None	None	2012-09-05T16:25:24	2012-09-04	['Ohio']

pomt-11852	"Coal production up 7.8% in past year. Down 31.5% last 10 years. #endingwaroncoal."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/donald-trump/trump-pairs-recent-rise-coal-output-ending-war-coa/	President Donald Trump has vowed to end what he calls a "war on coal." Recently, Trump tweeted some good news for the industry. "Coal production up 7.8% in past year," Trump wrote in his Oct. 31 tweet. "Down 31.5% last 10 years. #endingwaroncoal." Attached to the tweet was a Fox News report that had precisely that figure. The stats played across the screen, and the reporter wrapped up with "the war on coal is over, and good news for coal." Fox News told us they drew on the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Short-term Energy Outlook report for October. There are actually a couple of numbers there. The one Fox News used was a forecast for 2017. It predicted that coal production would go from 728 million short tons in 2016 up to 785 million in 2017. That amounts to a 7.8 percent rise. Fox News could have gone with a higher number based on actual rather than predicted output. The government report said that in the first nine months of the year, production was 12 percent higher than at the same point the year before. So if anything, Fox News understated the increase. As for the drop over the past 10 years, that might be an understatement, too. The government numbers show a decline closer to 33 percent. There are a few other things to know. Perhaps most important, the government doesn’t expect the increase to continue. The same energy outlook said "coal production is expected to increase by 8 percent in 2017 and by less than 1 percent in 2018." That’s in line with a couple of independent assessments. A 2017 report from the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University, focused only on West Virginia coal, anticipated growth in 2017 followed by modest increases until 2020. But "after 2020, statewide coal production is expected to fall," the report said. The forecast is the same at the national level. A Columbia University analysis also anticipated a rise, but its best-case scenario showed a "modest recovery" that in the middle of the next decade would level off at 2013 levels. The rise also needs to be seen in historic context. One reason 2017 looked good is that 2016 was particularly bad, as this chart from West Virginia University makes clear: Coal had been been falling for years, as a result of several factors. The market for coal mainly depends on the price of natural gas, foreign demand and, to a lesser extent, the impact of government policy on domestic demand. At the top of the list, coal competes with natural gas as a fuel to produce electricity. Natural gas prices tumbled with a flood of natural gas largely due to technology called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Utility companies went for the cheaper option. Brian Lego, co-author of the West Virginia University study, said that coal producers in the southern part of West Virginia faced another challenge, a collapse in demand in China for the sort of coal used in making steel. "There was over capacity in global steel production," Lego said. "When the Chinese pulled back on producing that steel, there was less need for metallurgical coal." On top of that, as economic growth cooled off a bit in China, so did the country’s need for power. It cancelled 85 coal-fired plants that had been in the works. India had a similar story, which further reduced the demand for coal. The turnaround in 2017 came from a slight rise in the price of natural gas, which made coal more competitive on the domestic front. An uptick in demand for coal from China’s steelmakers raised prices for metallurgical coal, which allowed smaller mines that had been idled to come back online, Lego said. Clean air regulations put coal at a disadvantage compared to natural gas, he said, as electric utilities increasingly opted for natural gas as a cleaner fuel. "Those rules were fully implemented in 2015," Lego said. "That’s when you saw the old coal-fired plants retired." Lego said he’s seen no impact so far from the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce regulatory pressures on coal. The one change championed by the White House that holds the most promise, he said, would require utilities to keep larger stocks of fuel on hand. Administration policies could have a larger impact down the line. The Columbia University research group estimated that if fully implemented, the White House policies could increase production by 37 percent over what might have been under Obama administration policies. Our ruling Trump said that coal production rose 7.8 percent since 2016. The number tracks back to a government forecast, which is less certain than actual production figures. But based on data for the first nine months of 2017, the increase was even higher -- 12 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Trump tied the increase to the theme of "ending the war on coal." The research we found said shifts in the price of natural gas and foreign demand are the primary drivers, not government regulation.

pomt-11280	"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption"	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/24/newstarget/no-government-has-not-approved-human-consumption-h/	An old story has reappeared on social media claiming that the U.S. government has approved the sale of horse meat from slaughterhouses for food. "USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption," read the headline on Newstarget, a website providing information for "educational and entertainment purposes." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Here’s the real story: In 2006, Congress effectively banned horsemeat by forbidding the U.S. Department of Agriculture to spend money on inspecting slaughterhouses. Meat plants can’t operate without USDA inspection. The last three slaughterhouses in the United States (two in Texas and one in Illinois) closed in 2007, one year after the ban. The ban was part of the annual USDA funding bill and was renewed a year at a time until it expired in 2011. In 2011, Congress lifted the five-year-old ban on funding horse meat inspections in a spending bill that former President Barack Obama signed into law. The bill didn’t allocate any new money for inspections, but activists worried that it might eventually lead to sales of horse meat. The Newstarget story’s origin is likely from an actual 2012 incident when a New Mexico meat plant received federal approval to slaughter horses for meat, which was met with opposition from many animal rights groups. The USDA stated that it was required by law to issue a "grant of inspection" to Valley Meat Co. of New Mexico, because it had met all federal requirements. While Valley Meat Co. planned to process horse meat for human consumption in Europe and other export markets, as well as sell it for animal feed at U.S. zoos, there is no evidence that they sold the meat for consumption in the United States. More recently, a bipartisan ban on slaughtering horses for meat has been included in a spending bill that President Donald Trump signed in March of this year. The renewed ban on will continue at least until Oct. 1 when the funding bill expires. Our ruling An article said that the USDA approved slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption. That still hasn’t happened. We rate this Mostly False.	None	Newstarget	None	None	None	2018-04-24T17:22:36	2016-02-23	['United_States_Department_of_Agriculture']

McCain said that Massachusetts now has "a $245-million debt because of the big government-mandated health care system" that Romney helped establish.

However, the legislature and now the new Democratic governor have added some bells and whistles, and they're willing to pay for them. "I wouldn't do that if I were governor. I would veto the items they put in place there, but they're entitled to make changes if they want to. "They're still running a balanced budget. I wouldn't have added the money they did. And by the way, no debt was left. I left a rainy day fund of over $2-billion. "Facts are stubborn things. I'm proud of my record." Well, let's get to those stubborn facts. When Romney was governor of Massachusetts in 2006, the state initiated an ambitious health care reform package aimed at drastically reducing the number of people without health insurance. At the time, the state estimated there were about 400,000 uninsured residents (though the U.S. Census put the figure closer to 600,000). At issue is the Commonwealth Care program in which taxpayers subsidize free or low-cost health services to low- or moderate-income residents who are uninsured. Let's be clear that Romney did not leave the state in debt. McCain seems to be speaking of a projection on rising costs of the program in the current fiscal year. To that point, the state anticipated there would be 135,000 people participating in the Commonwealth Care program in fiscal year 2008 ending June 30. As of the first of the year, there were 169,000 people participating (and they anticipate it will rise to 172,000 by the end of this fiscal year). Bottom line, the program is going to cost more than expected. While the cost is higher than expected, the numbers are actually a source of pride for many involved with the program. Dick Powers, a spokesman for the authority that oversees Commonwealth Care attributed the higher than expected participation to an "extremely aggressive and successful public education and outreach effort to enroll people." The state budgeted $472-million for the Commonwealth Care program, but because of higher participation rates, it is now projected to cost $618-million this year. That comes to $146-million more than anticipated. So where does McCain come up with $245-million? McCain's campaign did not respond to several requests for backup information, but in one speech where he made the same quote, McCain cited a Boston Globe article. The article noted that the state is expected to exceed the initial budget for the health insurance initiative by about $245-million this year. In addition to costs from higher than anticipated participation, that number includes negotiated increases in supplemental payments to hospitals that offer free health care to uninsured people ($113-million more than was budgeted). In addition, after Romney left office, the legislature changed its formula so that as of July 2007, people making 150 percent of the poverty level would be eligible for free health services through Commonwealth Care (the threshold used to be people making under 100 percent of poverty level). That's some of the "bells and whistles" Romney was referring to. It raised costs about $13-million, Powers said. As for the claim that Romney saddled the state with $245-million in debt from the health care program, the fact is the program is fully funded, said Cyndi Roy, deputy press secretary for Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a Democrat. Patrick will submit a supplemental budget later this year to reflect the increased costs, Roy said. "It is certainly more than anticipated," Roy said. "But it'll be covered. It's not in the red." And here's another thing. The same report that projects the $245 million in over-budget spending for the Commonwealth Care program also has some numbers McCain didn't note: free health care provided to the uninsured — which cost $600-million in 2007 — is expected to drop 12.5 percent this year, 25 percent by 2009. McCain said Romney's program left Massachusetts with $245-million in debt. That's misleading. It did not leave the state in debt. Yes, the program is costing more than expected. Some might call it a victim of its own success. And in noting how much more the program is expected to cost, McCain fails to note how much the program is projected to save. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13082	Says "thousands" at a Manhattan rally for Donald Trump were chanting "We hate Muslims, we hate blacks, we want our great country back."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/09/social-media/no-evidence-support-rumors-we-hate-muslims-chant-t/	A viral tweet allegedly sent from the ground of an election night rally for President-elect Donald Trump said that "thousands" of his supporters were chanting a racist message. The claim was fake. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As Buzzfeed and others have reported, the tweet was sent from the account of a fake British sports journalist who has a history of making allegations about racist chants in mass crowds. Another "Simon Rowntree" account was suspended over the summer, but Buzzfeed managed to screenshot his Twitter bio, which said he was a soccer writer for Forest Echo News. The site‘s account has also been suspended but it declared itself to be a parody in its bio, per Buzzfeed’s screenshot. The parody news site was the creation of a group of friends who set up fake sports journalist accounts, a person who responded on behalf of Forest Echo News told Buzzfeed. Rowntree is likely a Forest Echo fan jumping on the bandwagon. Here are some examples of Rowntree tweets alleging chants of racial epithets at British soccer games from his current account. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Racist chants are not uncommon at British soccer matches, so Rowntree’s tweets are believable though unverified and likely satirical (see Poe’s law for internet parodies). As for Rowntree’s allegation about the Trump rally, we have not found video footage or other evidence supporting it. Trump held his victory party at the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan, which can accommodate 3,300 in its grand ballroom. Rowntree claimed the chant began at 7:04 p.m., about 30 minutes after the event had began. According to videos, the crowds were rather subdued around that time. News reports indicate Trump supporters inside and outside the Hilton did not get rowdy until about 10 p.m., when projections began favoring Trump as the winner. A few dozen — not "thousands" — supporters roaming Midtown shouted "T-R-U-M-P, we will beat Hill-ar-y," "U-S-A" and "CNN sucks" at about 10:25 p.m., according to Patch New York. And Trump supporters inside the Hilton began to chant "lock her up" around 2 a.m., CBS’ Sopan Deb and NBC’s Katy Tur both reported. Our ruling A viral tweet said, "thousands" of people at a Manhattan rally for Trump chanted, "We hate Muslims, we hate blacks, we want our great country back." The widely shared claim is baseless, sent from a fake account tied to a parody British soccer news site. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-05638	Says Romney flip-flopped on abortion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/22/american-bridge-21st-century/pac-ad-sketches-romney-abortion-flip-flopper/	Fresh off a resounding primary win in Illinois, the Romney campaign used the momentum to make the case that the Republican primary contest was all but wrapped up and the former Massachusetts governor would inevitably be the nominee. Then the Etch A Sketch remark happened. On March 21, 2012, Mitt Romney’s senior communications director, Eric Fehrnstrom, gave an interview on CNN about the strategy for the general election. Fehrnstrom was asked why Romney’s opponents, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, haven’t endorsed him yet and how their far-right pressure on Romney will resonate with independent voters. "It's fair to say that John McCain was considerably a more moderate candidate than the ones that Gov. Romney faces now," said political comedian John Fugelsang. "Is there a concern that the pressure from Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tack so far to right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election?" Fehrnstrom answered, "Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again." As expected, Romney’s opponents pounced. Gingrich and Santorum both held up the perennial children’s toy as props at campaign appearances. Democrats cranked out ads capitalizing on the line, which provided an almost too-easy inroad to raising questions -- again -- about Romney’s firmness on issues. Here we’ll check one such ad, put out by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, which suggests that Romney has flip-flopped on abortion. First, the toy In case you skipped childhood, we’ll tell you a bit about the Etch A Sketch. First manufactured in the 1950s, the Etch A Sketch is a flat tablet with a red frame, gray face and two white knobs for drawing -- like an iPad from the paleolithic period. The two knobs draw vertical and horizontal lines on the screen as they’re turned, and those with superior hand-eye coordination are said to be able to make curving lines. For most Etch A Sketchers, though, a side view of a staircase qualifies as a masterpiece. The feature Fehrnstrom analogized was its reusability. When you’re done drawing, you flip it over and shake it up. Little beads rattle around inside to clear the screen, and Voila! You once again have a blank canvas. Now, the ad The ad was produced by American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. In the ad, released the same day as Fehrnstrom’s comment, a clip of his interview plays, including the Etch A Sketch comment. Then the toy appears, with the words "Romney on the issues" above it. Music that sounds like it’s coming from a jack-in-the-box plays in the background. The first quote attributed to Romney appears on the Etch A Sketch screen: "I support a woman’s right to choose." Then the Etch A Sketch shakes, the words vanish and the next quote appears. "I believe strongly in protecting life." The ad goes on to portray Romney’s apparent flip flops on the NRA and his loyalty to Ronald Reagan. (PolitiFact has looked into similar accusations before. See our checks here on the NRA and here on Reagan.) For this fact-check, we’ll see if the two abortion quotes are accurate. We found a Boston Globe story from May, 1994, when Romney was in a primary battle for U.S. Senate. At the time, he said he supported abortion rights and the right to privacy established by Roe v. Wade. But even then, opponents accused him of being a pro-choice pretender. Following a debate with opponent John Lakian, Romney defended an endorsement he had received from Massachusetts’ state treasurer Joe Malone, an abortion opponent. Lakian had said Malone backed him "to reward the pro-life contingent that was very much in Mitt's camp at the convention," according to the Globe. Romney responded: "The idea that somehow Joe Malone endorsed me because he's pro-life despite the fact that I support a woman's right to choose doesn't follow very well." That’s the only quote from Romney we found that matches American Bridge’s ad verbatim. Numerous other statements he’s made, however, express the same sentiment. For one, in a debate later in the 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." And, "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." For another, in his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." The second Romney quote in American Bridge’s ad reflects his changed stance on the issue. "I believe strongly in protecting life," the ad says. We could find no instance of Romney saying those exact words. American Bridge’s spokesman Chris Harris told us the quotes "were paraphrased so they fit on a small Etch A Sketch screen. We ensured they were airtight, accurate portrayals of his positions, both past and present." It’s well-documented that Romney’s past and present positions on abortion differ from each other. In a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review Romney laid out his views: "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services." "I believe people understand that I'm firmly pro-life," he said in a debate that same month. In October 2011 he told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Fox News, "I'd make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed." Finally, we have examined Romney’s shifting position on abortion when others have made the accusation. In each case, we rated the charge True. (Please see our source list.) Our ruling American Bridge’s ad suggests that Romney has been both an abortion rights supporter and an opponent. Using statements on an Etch A Sketch screen, the ad first portrays Romney as supporting abortion rights, then as opposing them. In other words, a flip flop. The quotes in the ad accurately portray Romney’s past and present stances, but the punctuation suggests they are his actual words. The second statement was not a literal quote, and that’s worth noting, but it was a true reflection of Romney's position. According to our Truth-O-Meter, this ad passes muster. It’s accurate and doesn’t leave out anything important. We rate it True.	None	American Bridge 21st Century	None	None	None	2012-03-22T18:16:40	2012-03-21	['None']

pomt-04655	"We've doubled our use of renewable energy."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-weve-doubled-our-use-renewable-e/	During an appearance in Seminole, Fla., on Sept. 8, 2012, President Barack Obama touted the nation’s achievements in expanding the use of renewable energy. "I’ve got a plan to control more of our own energy," Obama said. "After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. That will save you money. It will help the environment. We’ve doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans now have jobs building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries." The line about renewable energy was identical to a line in Obama’s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. We wondered whether Obama was correct that we’ve "doubled our use of renewable energy." We began by asking the Obama campaign to back up the claim. A spokeswoman cited three statistics from the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that collects energy data. • Net electricity generation from wind, which more than doubled between 2008 and 2011. • Net electricity generation from solar has more than doubled over the same period. • During the first five months of 2012, the United States has produced more electricity from wind than it did in all of 2008. We checked the data and found out that all of these comparisons are accurate. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The problem for Obama is not that the trend is inaccurate, but that he used the wrong words to describe it. Solar and wind are not the only types of renewables The agency's tables include several additional categories of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, geothermal and various types of biomass energy. If you put them all together by BTUs, wind energy in 2011 accounted for 11 percent of all renewable-energy production. That’s not 11 percent of all energy production, including coal, oil and natural gas -- that’s 11 percent of just the production from renewable sources. Solar, meanwhile, was even smaller. It accounted for about 1 percent of all renewable energy production. If you look at all types of electricity generation from renewables, the increase isn’t double between 2008 and 2011 -- it’s 55 percent. "Energy" and "electricity" are not the same thing Not all renewable energy is used to create electricity. For instance, some renewable energy is used for transportation, primarily ethanol in gasoline. This ethanol is counted in the "energy" category but not in the "electricity" category. Much smaller amounts of biomass are used for heating in colder locales or in industrial facilities like paper mills. So, to use Obama’s words, did renewable energy -- not just electricity -- double between 2008 and 2011? No. The increase in megawatt hours was about 25 percent, according to EIA data and estimates. "Taken literally, the quoted statement is imprecise and probably misleading," said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, an energy-policy think tank. Our ruling In his two speeches, Obama said, "We've doubled our use of renewable energy." But while the nation has made strides in expanding electricity generated by wind and solar -- the most high-profile part of the administration’s policies -- the increase for all kinds of energy, and for all types of renewables, was about 25 percent. That’s far short of doubling, so we rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-11T10:53:43	2012-09-08	['None']

pomt-02619	"Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/23/florida-all/florida-spent-over-100000-noncitizen-voter-purge-2/	At the start of a statewide election year, Democrats and the NAACP launched new attacks on the state’s plan for a new round of searching for noncitizens who registered to vote. House Democratic leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach and the NAACP held a press conference Jan. 13 to criticize Florida’s Republican administration for preparing to send a new batch of names of potential noncitizens to county election supervisors. Secretary of State Ken Detzner, an appointee of Gov. Rick Scott, is leading the project. In a press release, the left-leaning group Florida for All criticized the state’s spending on the effort in 2012: "Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012, producing lists with hundreds and hundreds of citizens that local Supervisors of Elections proved were legally registered voters. Over 80 percent of those on the purge lists were people of color and more than 6 in 10 were Hispanic. It was a costly embarrassment that Floridians fear will be repeated." Florida for All is a political action committee that is at least in part funded by the Democratic Governors Association. The group’s main target appears to be Scott, who faces a re-election this year and could face his predecessor, former Gov. Charlie Crist who is now a Democrat. At PolitiFact Florida we have fact-checked multiple claims about the state’s 2012 effort to search for noncitizens who registered to vote. But we had never researched the total dollar figure attached to that effort: Did Florida spend "over $100,000" for that initiative? Origin of $100,000 claim related to SAVE data In 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. The state later reduced that list to 2,600 -- and then again to about 200. As county election supervisors found multiple errors, later criticizing the effort as "sloppy" and "embarrassing," the project was scrapped as presidential election day approached. In the end, about 85 registered voters were removed from the list. Detzner later apologized and vowed a better process this time using a federal data source called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government programs and licensing, such as welfare, driver’s licenses, unemployment compensation and other benefits. We asked Neal Waltmire, a spokesman for Florida for All, to explain how it concluded that the state spent "over $100,000" in 2012. Waltmire directed us to a May 2012 story by NPR Miami correspondent Greg Allen. The story included this sentence: "Chris Cate, a spokesman for Ken Detzner, the secretary of state, says his office is working to improve the process — spending about $100,000 to update its records." The story did not explain what that cost included. Cate, who is now a spokesman for Florida’s CFO Jeff Atwater, told PolitiFact he didn’t recall placing a total dollar amount on the project. "It’s regular staff time -- there wouldn’t be a way to quantify the value," Cate said. "It is people who would be working anyway." It costs the state 50 cents each time it checks a name in SAVE. So at the time of the NPR story, it was possible that the state would process 180,000 names -- so at 50 cents a hit that would equal $90,000, or close to that $100,000 figure. But ultimately the state scrapped the effort and never checked all those names using SAVE data. What the state actually spent So how much did the state end up spending on the 2012 project? We can’t put a total dollar value on that because it would be difficult to account for the time spent by state elections’ staff. However we were able to nail down some costs by interviewing Detzner’s spokeswoman Brittany Lesser: • The total litigation costs for Florida’s case against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in it’s quest to gain access to SAVE was $50,705 in August 2012. The state used outside counsel. • The Secretary of State must pay DHS $300 a year to access SAVE. "There were no other upfront costs," Lesser said. * In 2012, the state spent about $1,287.50 checking names using SAVE data. (It’s unclear how many names were checked, in part because some names checked more than once.) County election supervisors also had expenses though we didn’t attempt to quantify the amount. "County expenses would basically be staff time which would not be broken out usually and any postage and notice publication costs for individuals notified," said Ronald Labasky, attorney for the statewide association of election supervisors. "Since there weren’t very many before it stopped, it probably wasn’t very much." Our ruling Florida for All said in a press release, "Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012." The number comes from a May 2012 news story. The amount based on 50 cent charge per search for using SAVE and multiplied times 180,000 names on a list of potential noncitizens. But months later the state abandoned its effort long before it got to checking all of those names. We can’t fully account for the state’s costs; for example, we can’t account for the time that government employees worked on the project. But we do know the state spent a total of about $52,000, largely for litigation and to use SAVE data. The group wrongly used a source that was based on initial information about the state’s project and did not reflect the total cost months later, resulting in a total that was about double the best number we could nail down. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Florida for All	None	None	None	2014-01-23T10:00:00	2014-01-20	['None']

pomt-08716	Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett "has held the line on property taxes."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/barack-obama/obama-says-tom-barrett-has-held-line-property-taxe/	President Barack Obama, in Milwaukee on Aug. 16 to attend a fund-raising luncheon for Tom Barrett’s gubernatorial campaign, praised the Milwaukee mayor for intervening in a domestic dispute outside of State Fair Park last year - and cast his fellow Democrat as something of a hero to taxpayers, saying in his remarks: "Under his watch, this city has held the line on property taxes, it’s expanded opportunity, it’s put more cops on the street and reduced crime as a result." The part about property taxes caught our attention. Barrett isn’t widely regarded as a tax hawk -- at least not in comparison with Scott Walker and Mark Neumann, the Republican candidates for governor. "Held the line," of course, may mean one thing in the eye of the holder and another in the eye of the beholder, so let’s take a look. We’ll start with a definition. To hold the line, according to Merriam-Webster’s definition, is to "maintain the current position or situation." So, if you don’t increase property taxes at all, that certainly fits. Or if an increase is within inflation -- and does not come with any hidden costs -- that may fill the bill as well. When we asked the White House to elaborate on Obama’s "held the line" comment, a spokesman referred us to the Democratic National Committee. The DNC e-mailed PolitiFact Wisconsin a statement that made four points. One point spoke of why Barrett raised the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected -- and another told how he has worked to cut pension costs. Neither of these points addresses how much property taxes have risen under Barrett. The DNC’s other two assertions were more on point - but not very persuasive: First, in Barrett’s six years in office, the DNC said, property taxes have risen less than inflation in three of those years. Even that part of the DNC statement was confusing and included an error. It used "taxes" and "tax rates" interchangeably, when DNC spokesman Derrick Plummer later told PolitiFact Wisconsin it should have said "tax levy." Additionally, Plummer said the increase was below inflation in two years and near inflation in a third. So, the levy increase was higher than inflation in four of six years. Second, Barrett’s proposed levies, the DNC said, were higher than the levies ultimately adopted by the Common Council in four of the six years -- but less than 1 percent higher. That sounds like the council, not the mayor, was more closely watching the bottom line. Moreover, highlighting the difference between the executive and legislative branches says nothing about how high taxes actually went up. Beyond that, revenue collected from fees has more than doubled under Barrett. That means property owners are paying higher fees -- for services that used to be covered by property taxes -- as well as higher property taxes. The newest fee -- for storm water management -- was created under Barrett; he proposed it and the Common Council approved it in 2006. When you add revenue from the storm water fee to revenue from the three other major fees -- for solid waste disposal, snow and ice removal, and sewer -- the fee collection total is projected to hit $89.6 million in 2010 -- more than double the $40.1 million that was collected when Barrett took office in 2004. Shifting the cost of a city service from the property tax to a fee does spread that cost among more payers; for example, nonprofit organizations that don’t pay property taxes do pay fees. But, the bottom line is that the city is now collecting nearly $50 million per year more in fees under Barrett for services that used to be provided through the property tax levy. So, let’s re-focus strictly on property taxes. We’ll use 2004 as the base line. That was the year Barrett was elected mayor and the year that the tax levy was approved for his first budget, in 2005. Starting with the levy for 2004 of $199,012,386, the levy increased 2 percent for 2005; 4.96 percent for 2006; 3.3 percent for 2007; 3.25 percent for 2008; 4.29 percent for 2009; and 4.12 percent for 2010, when the levy is to hit $246,754,533. The six annual increases total 21.92 percent, which means levy increases under Barrett have averaged 3.65 percent per year. The figure led Dale Knapp, research director of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization in Madison, to disagree with Obama’s characterization of Barrett’s record on property taxes. "I’m not sure if I would call that holding the line on taxes," Knapp said. "They’re (the levies) not growing outlandishly, but then again, they’re not flat or growing at a couple percent either. They seem to be generally very average." Surprisingly, perhaps, Michael Birkley, an advocate for lower property taxes, agreed with Obama’s take on Barrett. Birkley is legislative director of Madison-based Wisconsin Property Taxpayers, a group not as well known as the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. WPT says it works "to reduce the statewide property tax burden and reform Wisconsin’s antiquated and regressive property tax system." "Held the line? You bet he did," Birkley said of Barrett. In his estimation, that means not holding growth below inflation, but using a combination of inflation and an allowance for new construction growth in the city. That was the formula set out under Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature in the years the state put a cap on property tax growth. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the CPI-U -- the consumer price index for urban consumers. Its figures for the Milwaukee-Racine area show an average increase of 2.48 percent per year from 2004 to through the first half of 2010. Meanwhile, figures from the City of Milwaukee assessor’s office show growth from new construction averaged 1.91 percent per year from 2004 through 2010. Together, the two figures tally an average growth of 4.39 percent. That’s more than the 3.65 percent average increase in the property taxes collected. In his assessment, Birkley said he is not including the shift to fees: "Our concern is the property tax," he said. That’s fine. But to the average resident, it’s money from a different pocket. Had the revenue from fees remained on the levy, property taxes would have risen an average of 5.87 percent per year during Barrett’s six years, well above the 4.39 percent increase in inflation plus new growth. So, how does all of this shake out? Property taxes may not have not shot up under Barrett; the increases in levies have been kept below inflation plus new growth in the city. But in some years the city was limited by state-imposed caps on how much property taxes could be increased. And, in some years, the property tax levy was lower than the mayor proposed once the Common Council finished its work. President Obama’s statement ignores the shift of items from the property tax to fees, with total revenue collected from the four main fees more than doubling under Barrett. So city property owners are hit with that increase, on top of the higher property taxes. We rate the president’s remark Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11718	Missouri "is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health. Innovation is happening right here."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/15/roy-blunt/sen-roy-blunt-mostly-right-about-health-care-progr/	Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt has been on a mission to expand access to mental health and behavioral health patients. He believes it should be treated the same way as physical health. Blunt spoke recently in Springfield about the importance of the Excellence in Mental Health Act, which he first introduced in 2014. "After visiting community health centers and certified community behavioral health clinics across Missouri, I’m proud to see firsthand how our state is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health. Innovation is happening right here," Blunt said Oct. 13. Access is improving, but has Missouri become the leader in championing this cause? Steps taken We reached out to Blunt’s office, which referred us to a press release from Missouri Coalition for Community Behavioral Healthcare. Download PDF Missouri was one of the eight states initially selected to participate in the pilot program of the Excellence in Mental Health Act. This is a demonstration program that would implement a Medicaid prospective payment system for community behavioral health services. Being one of the few selected for this pilot program already puts Missouri ahead in the nationwide effort to improve mental and behavioral health services. Debra Walker, director of the Office of Public and Legislative Affairs for the Missouri Department of Mental Health, agrees with Blunt. She believes Missouri has become a national leader in the expansion of mental and behavioral health services, pointing to many of the new initiatives taking place in the state. Others shared this view. "Sen. Blunt has truly been an asset in representing the state of Missouri in areas relating to mental health services and has historically been a strong advocate for our most vulnerable population," said Denise Mills, vice president of corporate relations for Burrell Behavioral Health. Brent McGinty, president of the Missouri Coalition, agrees, stating that Missouri is paving the way in "whole-person" health. "Our health care home program is leading the nation in results around cost reduction and physical health improvement among the 25,000 Missourians we serve," McGinty said. As a representative of all of the Missouri Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, McGinty said Missouri is currently working with law enforcement and developing a statewide system to better address behavioral health crises. "It’s hard to really say which state, if any, is leading the country for providing services for mental and behavioral health," said Ronald Honberg, senior policy advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Honberg points out that there is no system in place for measuring this. "It’s fair to say that Missouri has been innovative," said Honberg, pointing to Senator Blunt and Joe Parks as champions in the cause in improving coordination between mental and behavioral health. Parks is the Medicaid director for the Missouri Department of Social Services and a member of the National Council for Behavioral Health. Some of the innovative work Missouri has been doing is with Emergency Departments and Mental Health First Aid, which are considered cutting edge across the country. Future of mental and behavioral health Currently there are no statistics to show where Missouri stands in improving services for mental and behavioral health as part of the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, but measures are to be reported to the federal government according to McGinty, president of the Missouri Coalition. "Under the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, sponsored by Senator Blunt, we will finally start reporting to the federal government real behavioral health measures," McGinty said. Recently, Sens. Blunt and Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, along with Reps. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, and Doris Matsui, D-California, announced this would be expanded to 11 more states. With the inclusion of more states it will more likely create distinctions in who is and is not leading the nation in regard to improving services for mental and behavioral health. As of now, Missouri is implementing new measures to address whole-person care. Some of these initiatives include a partnership for Hope Waiver for Developmental Disabilities and the construction of a new, state-of-the-art, high security facility at Fulton State Hospital. "The state that actually is moving ahead fastest, gets the most done, where access and quality are both being addressed, the state that not only comes to my mind but everyone in the field’s mind, is Missouri," said Linda Rosenberg, CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health in a 2016 press release. Our ruling Blunt said Missouri "is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health." Under the demonstration program sponsored by Blunt, Missouri will start reporting real behavioral health measures to the federal government. The reports will include information regarding time between request for treatment and treatment, hospital follow-up and medication adherence. Experts agree that Missouri has started several new initiatives to improve and innovate when it comes to services for mental and behavioral health. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14738	Says President Barack Obama’s homeland security budget had "$16 million to fight climate change" but "didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/18/sean-duffy/barack-obama-gives-homeland-security-millions-clim/	A remark by U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy about President Barack Obama, climate change and violent extremism was so startling that an interviewer made a point to repeat it. And it made us wonder: Does the Department of Homeland Security really spend a bunch of money on climate change but doesn’t make it a priority to fight "violent extremism?" The Wisconsin Republican made his claim Dec. 9, 2015 after being asked about the terrorism in San Bernardino and how to fight such domestic threats. "When the president sent over his budget to the House of Representatives, he had a homeland security budget," Duffy said on "Varney & Co.," a talk show on Fox Business Network. "He put $16 million to fight climate change in Homeland Security, and didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism. The president doesn’t take this seriously." The claim surprised host Stuart Varney. "That’s very important, Sean," Varney replied. Obama's budget for the Department of Homeland Security had $16 million for climate change "but nothing extra, that we know about, to fight and find these guys who are already here? That's the situation?" Varney asked. "That is the situation," Duffy said. Well, not really. There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremists -- defined by the department as "individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals." A line item can signify whether something is a priority, as Duffy argues. But his claim is misleading in that DHS, as well as other federal departments, spend money to fight violent extremism. Climate change To back the claim, Duffy’s office cited PolitiFact National’s May 2015 fact check of U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. McCaul had said more money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than what's spent combating "Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America." Our colleagues rated the statement Mostly True. But Duffy’s claim is much broader -- about fighting violent extremism generally, rather than spending specifically to fight Islamist terrorists over the Internet. Our colleagues found that the Department of Homeland Security’s budget for fiscal 2016 arguably included $16 million for climate change. That figure was part of Duffy’s claim. There is $10 million "for analyses of climate change impacts on infrastructure critical to national and economic security, and national public health and safety." And $6 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of homeland security, for "climate workshops and regional resilience coordination" done by FEMA. And while the Department of Homeland Security has a senior-level official who serves as the coordinator of Countering Violent Extremism, that office has no separate line item in the budget. But just because there isn’t a line in a budget doesn’t mean the department is ignoring violent extremism. A few examples from the Department of Homeland Security’s budget: Four to eight full-time staff assigned to countering violent extremism. $1 million for a database to analyze past violent extremist incidents and see what sort of programs work best to head off attacks. Part of the department’s $1 billion National Preparedness Grant Program to state and local governments can be spent on projects to spot early signs of terrorist planning. Said Duffy spokeswoman Cassie Smedile: Four to eight staffers isn’t a sign of a high priority to "when you consider that DHS employs more than 240,000 people." Fair point. But does the average citizen necessarily care which department’s federal employees are involved in fighting violent extremism? The Department of Homeland Security works with federal and local agencies on countering violent extremism. And the Justice Department has a $15 million line item for countering violent extremism, including $4 million for "domestic radicalization research." Our rating Duffy said Obama’s homeland security budget had "$16 million to fight climate change" but "didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism." There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremism. But that ignores the fact that millions of dollars are allocated, inside and outside the Department of Homeland Security, to counter violent extremists. Duffy’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-14343	"To this day, (the Cuban government) is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-cuba-safe-harbor-fugitives-and-terr/	As President Barack Obama works to restore relations with Cuba, opponents of the policy shift cite Cuban practices that they see as contradictory to U.S. interests. "To this day, this is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives," said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., in a March 17 news conference. We were curious about Ryan’s claim, particularly because last year the Obama administration removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba first made the list in 1982, when the country was actively supporting communist revolutions in the thick of the Cold War. There are some U.S. fugitives and a handful of terrorists living in Cuba, but experts told us these are more remnants of the Cold War rather than a staple of modern Cuban policy. Ryan’s statement is "accurate but outdated," said Ted Piccone, senior fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Project on International Order and Strategy and Latin America Initiative. Fugitives We weren’t able to pin down a more recent number, but the State Department said in a 2008 report that more than 70 U.S. fugitives lived in Cuba, some receiving protection and resources from the Cuban government. The list includes individuals accused of murder, hijacking and even insurance fraud. Piccone said it’s fair to say these fugitives are under "safe harbor" in Cuba. Joanne Chesimard might be the most high-profile U.S. fugitive living in Cuba. Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army, was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973. She escaped prison and fled to Cuba in 1984. There’s also William "Guillermo" Morales, a member of Puerto Rican militant group Armed Forces of National Liberation, who was convicted on weapons charges in New York in 1979. A State Department report published in 2015 said Cuba has been more cooperative with the United States on this front in recent years, and the two countries have engaged in talks about returning some of these fugitives. While Cuba has been returning wanted criminals to the United States on a case-by-case basis, the Cuban government generally has declined to return fugitives they perceive as political, according to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The Cuban government also believes the United States harbors Cuban fugitives, like Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile convicted of bombing a Cuban airliner in 1976, who now lives in Miami. And if fugitive exchange talks are to move forward between the two countries, Cuba will want its fugitives to be on the table, Piccone said. Terrorists Who are the "terrorists" who live in Cuba? About two dozen members of Spanish separatist group Basque Fatherland and Liberty, designated by the State Department as a foreign terrorist group, live in Cuba with permission from the Cuban government. There’s no evidence to show that Cuba has allowed these individuals to conduct terrorist activity while in Cuba, according to the State Department. In his statement, Ryan was referring to this group, a spokesperson said. Cuba has significantly ratcheted back its support for U.S.-designated terrorist groups since the early 1990s, said Frank Mora, a professor at Florida International University and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere under Obama. During the Cold War, when Cuba sided with the Soviet Union, Cuba supported what it perceived as liberation movements around the world. But the United States viewed many of those communist groups as terrorist organizations, like the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. When the Cold War ended in 1991, however, Cuba recalculated, Mora said. Cuba pulled out of these movements in order to focus on internal economic problems and, in part, to not give the United States any reason to amp up its anti-Cuba policies. "In recent years, Cuba has taken a number of steps to fully distance itself from international terrorism and has taken steps to strengthen its counterterrorism laws," the State Department found. For example, Cuba has enacted policies to criminalize terrorist financing. And Cuba has shared counterterrorism intelligence with the Obama administration and condemned various recent terrorist attacks, according to the CRS report. "Cuba has not been identified for several years for supporting international terrorism," Piccone said. While Ryan’s statement is technically correct — as there are U.S. fugitives and some members of a U.S.-designated terrorist group living on Cuban soil — his phrasing doesn’t capture the positive change in this arena that has happened in Cuba over the past quarter century, Mora said. "He’s implicitly suggesting there’s a flow of fugitives and terrorists coming to Cuba, and that’s not true," Mora said. Our ruling Ryan said, "To this day, (the Cuban government) is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives." There are some U.S. fugitives and members of a Spanish separatist group living in Cuba with the Cuban government’s permission. But Ryan’s statement misses an important nuance: In the past couple decades, Cuba has been more cooperative with the United States in terms of returning fugitives, and the country has cut ties with foreign organizations designated by the United States as terrorist groups. Significantly, the United States recently removed Cuba’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. Ryan’s statement is accurate but could use that additional clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-03-24T10:52:26	2016-03-17	['Cuba']
pomt-03497	Says "At age 76 when you most need it, you are not eligible for cancer treatment" under Affordable Care Act.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/08/chain-email/will-seniors-be-denied-cancer-treatment-under-obam/	According to a chain email making the rounds, people over 75 years old will be denied cancer treatment under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, after President Barack Obama. The email also states that vitamin B12 shots won’t be covered under Medicare because of Obamacare. Also, your primary care physician will have to admit you into a hospital -- as opposed to, oh let’s say, an emergency care doctor -- or Medicare won’t pay for it, again, because of Obamacare. Here’s a portion of the chain email, which a reader in Northeast Portland forwarded to PolitiFact Oregon, with a plea for more information. She said it came from a friend: "Your hospital Medicare admittance has just changed under Obama Care. You must be admitted by your primary Physician in order for Medicare to pay for it! If you are admitted by an emergency room doctor it is treated as outpatient care where hospital costs are not covered. This is only the tip of the iceberg for Obama Care. Just wait to see what happens in 2013 & 2014! … (ellipses) Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on. We all need to be informed. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS... At age 76 when you most need it, you are not eligible for cancer treatment page 272." The email goes on with a long list of other claims as assessed by a Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. PolitiFact Oregon hopped to it. And we learned very quickly -- through the power of the Internet -- that a version of this chain email has been kicking around since 2009, based on H.R. 3200, a 2009 bill that did not become law. Many of the claims have been debunked. In fact, FactCheck.org found just four of the 48 claims in the original email to be accurate. PolitiFact ruled two statements to be Pants on Fire. The chain email has morphed over the years, with new assertions added. As for the cancer-related statement, the email cites page 272 of H.R. 3200 to back up its assertion that seniors at 76 are not eligible for cancer treatment. Later, the email specifies that under Section 1145 of H.R. 3200, "cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." Neither statement is accurate. There is no rationing, based on age or otherwise, on cancer treatment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in March 2010. Likewise, there is no rationing or cut-off age in 2009’s H.R. 3200. H.R. 3200 contained a section on "treatment of certain cancer hospitals." But the American Nurses Association described the section as "the opposite of rationing. The section allows Medicare to pay cancer hospitals more if they are incurring higher costs." FactCheck.org agrees with the nurses group. And again, the bill never became law. "All medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age," said Katherine Fitzpatrick with the Medicare Rights Center in Washington, D.C. and in New York. Yet, none of the debunking seems to matter, because four years later, the email lives on via the forward button. The Internet is unstoppable. What, we wondered, did the Texas judge think of his undying notoriety? "I wish it would die. I can’t control it," David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon. "I don’t know how something like that goes viral like that." The former judge said he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune, circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, the letter was republished online. Kithil wants readers to disregard his letter as it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. "I’ve had calls from all over the country, 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this," he said. He pleads with the callers, "Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it." He says he still has problems with the Affordable Care Act, but that’s neither here nor there. Both the Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the national organization for seniors, verified that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare, the government health plan for seniors 65 and older. The Affordable Care Act reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with readmissions within 30 days for certain conditions, such as pneumonia, but that’s not based on who admits the patient. Also, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid says Medicare has never covered vitamin B12 shots as a preventive benefit. Again, this isn’t related to the Affordable Care Act. Older patients diagnosed with cancer need not worry that treatment will be rationed or denied under the Affordable Care Act. The claim is based on an inaccurate reading of a bill that went nowhere. We don’t know where or how the specific age of 76 was added -- Kithil said he doesn’t remember including a specific age in his letter. But we do know enough to rule this widely debunked and ridiculous-on-its-face statement a Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-06-08T06:00:00	2013-06-03	['None']

pomt-09708	Page 92 of the House health care bill "says specifically that people can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/03/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-page-92-prohibits-private-/	House Democratic leaders last week released the health care bill they plan to bring to the floor, and it didn't take long for the Republicans to publish a laundry list of complaints about it. We'll be exploring those complaints with a story we'll publish later today or tomorrow, but in the meantime, we'd like to explore one of the points made by Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota. She made the statement on Oct. 30, 2009, on Sean Hannity's show on the Fox News Channel. She said that on Page 92 of the new bill, "it says specifically that people can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain, which means people will ultimately go into a single-payer plan where it is government providing health care and only one single government system. That's why this is so bad, Sean. This is socialized medicine ... This is, as I said, the crown jewel of socialism. It's what Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid have wanted from the very beginning." (See her comments starting about the 2:15 mark in this video .) We won't rate her opinion that Democrats are proposing the "crown jewel" of socialized medicine, or her prediction that it will ultimately lead to a single-payer system. Instead, we're interested in Bachmann's claim that Page 92 of the bill prevents people from buying private health insurance after a certain date. We not only find that she is misinterpreting that one page, but that she's also distorting the other 1,989 pages of a bill that would construct a system largely based on private health insurance. Her claim is a serious misrepresentation of a plan that relies on a marketplace of private coverage. Bachmann's office did not respond to our call or an e-mail, but we found the language that she seemed to be referring to on Page 91 of the new bill: "The individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1." To decipher it, we called Karen Pollitz, project director for the Health Policy Institute at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. She said it was a clause that allows people who would be eligible for coverage in the new health care exchange to keep an old policy they like. "If you have a plan that's in effect prior to the effective date (of the exchange) and you like it, you can keep it," she said. (This is similar to a claim we checked back in July when the editorial page of Investor's Business Daily said the bill would outlaw private insurance . We rated that Pants on Fire.) Here's how the exchange would work: Under the House bill, insurance companies would sell individual policies through a government-run health care exchange, and the government would set minimum standards for coverage. For example, the government would require companies to cover people even if they have pre-existing conditions such as serious illnesses or pregnancy. The government would also set levels for minimum coverage for services such as mental health coverage. But if someone liked a plan they owned before the new law kicks in, they'd be able to keep the policy, no matter the level of coverage. The rules would largely prevent insurance companies from changing benefits in these grandfathered plans or altering the premiums. So Bachmann is referring to language that prevents the health insurance companies from enrolling new people in old plans that don't meet the new standards, Pollitz said. Any plan sold after the new law is enacted must provide better coverage. Bachmann is incorrect that people "can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain." To the contrary, a key principle of the bill is to create a new marketplace for people to buy private insurance. People who already get private coverage from their employer would continue to do so and should be able to shop for new plans with different coverage. People who are self-employed or work for small businesses will be able to buy private insurance through the new exchange. In fact, the bill requires that everyone have some form of coverage, Pollitz said. "Not only do you have to [buy insurance], but you can" buy it after the bill goes into effect, she said. "There's no reasonable way to look at Page (91) and say that you couldn't." Bachmann isn't just guilty of misinterpreting the language from one page of the bill.

pomt-09538	"The governor’s not taking his own fiscal advice. ... In the first fiscal quarter of this year, we’ve seen a 13.5 percent increase in spending, double-digit spending out of the executive branch in the State of Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/08/debra-medina/Me/	For the next governor of Texas, one task will overshadow all the others on the to-do list: closing a state budget shortfall that some projections put as high as $15 billion. During the second Republican gubernatorial debate Jan. 29, candidates were asked to detail what programs they would cut or taxes they would raise to balance the budget. Debra Medina, who is in the three-way race for the GOP nomination with Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, took the opportunity to criticize the incumbent’s fiscal record. "You know, it’s unfortunate that the governor’s not taking his own fiscal advice," Medina said. "The 'Fiscal Notes' just released by the (state) comptroller last week shows in the executive department in the first fiscal quarter of this year, we’ve seen a 13.5 percent increase in spending, double-digit spending out of the executive branch in the state of Texas, when everyone here has been tightening their belts for a year." Has Perry become a heavy-spending governor? We wondered whether Medina's statement was on the money. The "Fiscal Notes" that Medina cited is a newsletter produced by the state comptroller’s office. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010 — that’s September through November 2009 — it reported that expenditures went up 13.5 percent for the "executive" segment of general government compared with spending by that segment in the same quarter the previous year. But what falls under the "executive" category? We put that question to the state comptroller’s office, which answered with a list of 25 agencies categorized as executive and administrative. That's not to say that the governor is directly responsible for all of those. In Texas, executive powers are spread among elected officials, including the governor, the attorney general and the comptroller. At least five agencies on the list are the responsibility of either the attorney general’s office or the comptroller’s office. Most of the other so-called executive agencies are commissions, offices or departments led by administrators appointed by the governor or whose governing boards include gubernatorial appointees. The governor's office is directly responsible for only three line items on the comptroller's list, including the Office of State-Federal Relations. Now, let’s look at the money. The 13.5 percent jump in spending that Medina referenced reflects a $196.5 million net increase for all the agencies. (The "net" part is important because some of the agencies saw their expeditures decline in the first quarter.) By far the largest spending jump ($87.3 million) occurred in the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, whose board is made up of gubernatorial appointees. However, almost all those dollars came from the federal government, not the state. They were spent on recovery costs related to Hurricane Rita, which hit in 2005; on utility payments for low-income people; and on a homelessness prevention program and other initiatives that were part of the federal stimulus package approved by Congress last year. The attorney general’s office is No. 2 on the published spending list. Most of its $36 million increase — about $32 million — was attributable to higher collections of child-support payments. The comptroller’s office also accounts for a significant chunk of the spending increase, about $36.8 million. All told, these free-standing agencies — Housing and Community Affairs, the attorney general’s office and the comptroller’s office — account for about 80 percent of the net increase in first-quarter expenditures cited by Medina. So where does spending controlled by the governor fit in? Of the three entities on the list that are directly tied to his office, two spent less during the first quarter compared to the year before. The third line item, "Governor -- Fiscal," showed a $15 million net increase in the quarter. According to Perry’s office, a small portion, about $800,000, was federal stimulus money. The biggest expenditure of state funds, $10 million, consisted of disaster relief related to hurricane damage. The rest went to the governor’s economic development initiatives, the Emerging Technology Fund and the Texas Enterprise Fund, as well as incentives to attract film projects. Summing up: The governor's office was directly responsible for about $14 million in increased state spending, or 7 percent of the $196 million spending increase that caught Medina's attention. One caution: Virtually every agency official and government watcher we spoke with warned against drawing conclusions about spending or budget trends by solely looking at one quarter of activity, partly because spending can fluctuate based on when various grants and loans are passed through. Finally: Medina is correct that overall spending by agencies in the executive portion of state government went up 13.5 percent in the first quarter. But placing the responsibility at Perry’s feet isn't justified. The largest chunk of the spent money came from the federal government, and the bulk of the remaining "executive branch" expenditures took place in agencies run by other elected officials. We rate Medina's statement as Half True.	None	Debra Medina	None	None	None	2010-02-08T12:25:22	2010-01-29	['Texas']
pomt-11385	Says Rebecca Dallet is a "hypocrite" because she "took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/28/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-attack-supreme-court-candidate-rebec/	In what is nominally a nonpartisan state Supreme Court campaign, the Wisconsin Republican Party is supporting Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, who is backed by conservatives. With the April 3, 2018, election drawing near, the party attacked Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is supported by liberals. On billboards in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Eau Claire that were announced March 12, 2018, the GOP claimed: "Hypocrite Rebecca Dallet took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her." Dallet has taken campaign contributions from lawyers who have cases before her -- which is not uncommon and is not prohibited by the state Judicial Commission. But the thrust of the GOP’s claim -- that Dallet is a "hypocrite" because she took the contributions -- misfires. The money The billboards refer to more than 100 cases, with roughly three-quarters of them that were pending when Dallet received campaign donations from lawyers on those cases. Other cases cited either had not yet been filed or had been closed. The largest donation was $2,500 from attorney Howard Sicula in June 2017. He had a wrongful death case pending in Dallet’s court at the time. Now to the thrust of the GOP’s claim. Dallet a ‘hypocrite’? The billboard refers viewers to an anti-Dallet state GOP website. It cites comments Dallet made at a Jan. 22, 2018 Federalist Society Supreme Court debate. Dallet began by saying: "So, I do recuse myself when there is any appearance that it’s not going to be fair." The GOP contends that statement means Dallet is a hypocrite because she took campaign contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. But the rest of Dallet’s statement makes it clear she didn’t pledge not to take campaign contributions from lawyers, but rather that she would recuse herself from cases in which her husband’s law firm was involved. She also drew a contrast with the first campaign of state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who decided not to seek reelection. Here’s the rest of Dallet’s statement during the debate: My husband works for Husch Blackwell, a larger firm, and I made the decision to remove myself from any case that they handle. That is not required by our ethics rules … but I decided that the better course of action, so that it is fair to everyone involved, is to just recuse myself from all those cases …. This is not about contributions from attorneys to our campaigns; that is allowed by our ethics rules. And certainly if it was an extreme amount, that would be something that the judge would have to look at. What we’re talking about with our recusal rules, that is the issue that I’ve been talking about, is the fact that when a party is in front of the case (judge) and that party has spent money -- significant amount of money, massive amounts of money, like the $2.25 million spent on Justice Gableman’s campaign -- how can anyone look at that and think that that’s fair? Dallet also referred to recusing herself from cases involving her husband’s firm in January 2018 at a candidates event and in an interview. Although it does not bear on the rating of this fact check, it’s worth noting that the Wisconsin State Journal reported in early March 2018 that Dallet presided over at least one case involving attorneys from her husband’s law firm; and that Dallet recused herself from three recent cases on her docket involving attorneys from the firm after being asked about them by the newspaper. Our rating The state Republican Party says Dallet is a "hypocrite" because she "took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her." Dallet has received campaign donations from lawyers who had cases in her court -- something that is common in judicial campaigns and allowed by state judicial ethics rules. But on the hypocrite part of the GOP’s statement, Dallet did not pledge that she would not accept contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. Rather, her pledge was to recuse herself from cases in which her husband’s law firm was involved. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-03506	"Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times. Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/06/republican-governors-association/barbara-buonos-record-tax-debt-hikes-targeted-gop-/	In much the same way that a woodpecker keeps at its target, Republicans continue hammering Democrat Barbara Buono on her political record when it comes to taxes and debt. The latest salvo in the increasingly testy gubernatorial campaign comes from the Republican Governors Association, which last week released a TV ad about Buono’s record on those issues. The group backs Chris Christie, who was the RGA’s vice chairman last year. "Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times," a narrator states during the ad. "Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards." Similar to other gubernatorial campaign ads from both Christie and Buono, claims in this ad ignore context and misplace blame. Let’s start with the claim of 154 votes in favor of tax increases and then look at the others. We have previously rated this claim True. Between 1996 and 2010, Buono voted in favor of various measures that raised either taxes or fees on things ranging from tanning and limousine rides to higher gross income tax rates on New Jerseyans earning six-figure incomes, or she supported tax policy changes resulting in higher costs for individuals and businesses. And the ad is correct that those increases affected utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins and more, according to a list of votes provided by Republicans to PolitiFact New Jersey for the years that Buono has served in the Legislature. We confirmed every vote on the list, but Buono obviously wasn’t the only legislator to support the increases. Next up, property taxes climbing 70 percent under Buono. Property taxes did increase 70 percent in New Jersey in the 10 years before Chris Christie became governor, when the state was overseen by Democratic administrations. Buono was a member of the Legislature during those years but that doesn't make her responsible for the hikes. Property taxes are voted on at the local level. As for a sales tax increase, Buono voted to raise the tax, but also supported earmarking part of the resulting revenue for property tax relief, according to a statement from her campaign. Now let’s look at whether she drove New Jersey into $2 billion worth of debt. The RGA claims Buono was the "architect" of Corzine’s budget when she chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in 2008 and 2009, working on the fiscal year 2010 budget. But the governor – not the committee chair – has the final say on the budget. Still, by the time Christie came into office on Jan. 19, 2010, the state had a $2.2 billion shortfall. Christie fixed it by cutting more than 300 line items in the budget, including $475 million in school aid. Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, has told us that a variety of factors – including the recession -- led to that deficit. The recession, for example, was a main reason why the state fell short on anticipated revenues. "I think it’s probably a little over the top to say that Senator Buono was responsible for the $2 billion shortfall," Caprio told us in a previous fact-check about this deficit. As for the entirety of the ad, Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said in a statement, "Governor Christie and his national Republican sponsors’ false attacks on Senator Buono’s record are attempts to distract from the truth: they have made careers off defending millionaires over working and middle class families. Senator Buono has consistently fought to make millionaires pay their fair share to provide property tax relief to New Jersey’s middle class." The RGA did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling An ad from the RGA claims, "Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times. Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards." Each claim on its face has a degree of accuracy, but lacks context and places blame squarely on Buono. As we have noted before, she has some responsibility for these increases because she voted for them, but they wouldn’t have happened without approval from either Corzine or a majority vote in the Legislature. We rate the ad Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Buono did not vote for a 70 percent hike in property taxes during the decade before Chris Christie became governor.

pomt-12556	El Paso is the "safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/apr/14/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-relies-disputed-rankings-calling-el-p/	Democrat Beto O’Rourke closed out March 2017 by declaring his longshot 2018 bid to deny Republican Ted Cruz re-election to the U.S. Senate--also repeatedly reviving a flawed claim about his hometown's relative safety. Confirming his candidacy before constituents, the congressman called El Paso "the safest city in Texas, the safest city in the United States." The same day in Dallas, O’Rourke told a crowd: "El Paso, Texas--safest city, safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States. And listen, lest you think that it’s due to walls or drones or aerostat blimps or militarization of the border--we’ve been either the safest or one of the top three safest cities in America since 1997. We are a safe city." O’Rourke made a similar claim in Austin the next day. Hold on, pardner. We’ve identified factual flaws in such proclamations. In 2011, we found Mostly False a claim that El Paso had been named the nation’s safest large city. El Paso had topped a 2010 "Lowest Crime Rate" list for cities of 500,000 residents or more. But only a city press release named El Paso the nation’s "safest" large city--and El Paso’s police department subsequently dropped the label. In 2013, we rated Half True a claim that "El Paso is the safest city of our size in the nation." As in 2011, the statement was tied to calculations by CQ Press linked to crime data published by the FBI that the agency strongly counsels against using to compare communities. In 2011, the FBI said it "strongly discourages" using FBI Unified Crime Reporting statistics to evaluate locales or the effectiveness of police departments. That note also said: "Despite repeated warnings against these practices, some data users continue to challenge and misunderstand this position. Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place. UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale." O’Rourke concedes rankings not perfect When we inquired, a volunteer O’Rourke aide, John Meza, told us O’Rourke relied on the CQ Press lists and related news stories to conclude that El Paso stands out as the nation’s perpetually safest city. Meza offered as O’Rourke’s backup a CQ Press document, "City Crime Rankings 2014," which states that based on its analysis of 2012 FBI-collected statistics, El Paso had the "lowest crime-rate ranking" among cities of 500,000 residents or more (with Austin No. 3 and San Antonio No. 10): SOURCE: Document, "City Crime Rankings 2014," CQ Press, undated (web link received by email from John Meza, volunteer, Beto O’Rourke U.S. Senate campaign, April 3, 2017) By phone, O’Rourke later conceded the CQ Press lists aren’t a "perfect way to assess a city’s relative safety." "There’s got to be a better way to do this," O’Rourke said. "Until there is, I’ve only got what the FBI reports" as interpreted by CQ Press. "If you’ve got a better source, I’m all yours," O’Rourke said. CQ Press sticks with disclaimer CQ Press has warned against using its rankings to talk up any community's relative safety. In our 2013 fact check of the claim about El Paso being named the country’s safest city, CQ Press’s summary didn’t identify the border city as the nation’s safest big city--on purpose, we were told. A CQ Press spokeswoman, Marina Ilishaev, then told us that until 2009, it had used "safest" and "dangerous" to describe cities having the lowest and highest rankings by its analysis. "Even though the rankings are still provided," she said by email, "these terms are no longer used because perceptions of safety and danger are just that—perceptions. The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization." "...We would add, as we do in our methodology section, that we mean by ‘lowest composite reported crime rate’ the largest deviation below the national median in six main crime categories, which are counted equally," she said. Specifically, CQ Press says its crime-rate rankings were derived from totaling each city’s violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault as tallied by the FBI plus the number of property crimes of burglary and motor vehicle theft, all in 2011. Then it follows a "multistep process," CQ Press says, in which each city’s reported crimes in each category are compared to nationally reported crimes per 100,000 population rate and "indexed to create a summary score and ranking across" the six areas of reported violent and property crime. After O’Rourke made his claim, we reached Tiffany Medina of SAGE Publishing, which owns CQ Press, who sent an email reaffirming the company’s previous cautionary note. She also pointed us to just such a disclaimer in its 2015 report based on 2013 UCR data, which also says: "The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization. Thus, the analyses in this book are purely descriptive." CQ Press analysis of 2015 statistics Further, we spotted a 2017 CQ Press web post enabling us to determine, based on its crunch of the FBI’s UCR data for 2015, that El Paso then had the lowest, or best, "crime rate ranking" among the 31 cities of 500,000 residents or more that drew a ranking. After El Paso, the cities of New York, Austin and San Diego had the best rankings with Baltimore ranked last in the group behind Milwaukee and Detroit, according to CQ Press. We noticed too that the CQ Press website newly makes it possible to apply a population density filter to its rankings. That is, you can group cities by how crowded they happen to be. And? El Paso and Austin fall out of the big-city rankings if you require a density of at least 2,720 residents per square mile. This approach leaves New York, San Diego and San Jose with the best "crime rate" rankings among 21 remaining cities of 500,000 residents or more--with San Antonio at No. 6, Dallas at No. 12 and Houston at No. 17. Requiring an even greater density (of 5,360 residents per square mile) leaves 10 cities of 500,000 residents or more in the mix. Summing up, per CQ Press, the nation’s most-crowded big cities with the lowest 2015 "crime rate" rankings were: New York; Boston; Los Angeles; Seattle; San Francisco; Chicago; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Milwaukee; and Baltimore--with Texas cities not making the cut. A 2017 FBI cautionary note Among several news stories noted by Meza, a February 2013 Fox News story said the FBI had no comment on CQ’s rankings, "since the agency does not put out the safest cities report nor does it endorse it." That story led us to spot a new FBI cautionary note in a January 2017 agency press release about the agency’s release of its UCR data for January-June 2016: "When the FBI publishes crime data via its UCR Program, some entities use the information to compile rankings of cities and counties. Such rankings, however, do not provide insight into the numerous variables that shape crime in a given town, city, county, state, tribal area or region. "These rankings," the FBI said, "lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that can create misleading perceptions that adversely affect communities and their residents." Crime experts and the latest FBI statistics For our check of the 2013 claim touting El Paso’s safety, criminologist Alfred Blumstein, now a professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University, told us by phone CQ Press’s approach--especially its weighting each type of crime the same--made its crime-rate rankings "highly suspect as true indicators of safety." By email, Mitchell Chamlin, a Texas State University criminal justice professor, said at the time that city-level crime rate comparisons weren’t particularly meaningful. "Crime is local," Chamlin wrote, and "most criminals work in a very small radius," typically smaller than a city. We then went a step further by looking at FBI statistics for 2011 to compare rates of violent crime, which includes murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, limiting our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population that were listed in the 2013 CQ Press report as having the "lowest crime rate" rankings. In 2011 among the selected cities, the FBI statistics suggested, El Paso had the fourth-lowest violent crime rate; the lowest murder rate; and the second-lowest burglary rate. First six months of 2016 After O’Rourke made his claim, we applied a similar filter to the UCR statistics covering January through June 2016, limiting our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population identified by CQ Press as having the lowest crime rate rankings for 2015 (though we substituted No. 11 Seattle for Boston, which evidently didn’t report crime data to the FBI for the six-month period.) Upshot: Among the cities across 10 types of crime reported to the FBI, El Paso had the lowest rates of violent crime; murder; robbery; burglary; and motor vehicle theft. El Paso had the second-lowest incidence of aggravated assault; property crime; arson; and larceny-theft. Finally, per our sort, El Paso had the third-lowest rate of rape. Our ruling O’Rourke said El Paso is the "safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States." This declaration ties to disputed CQ Press rankings, rooted in FBI-published statistics, that appear annually despite the FBI’s advice against using its data to compare communities. The cited rankings also didn't consider every Texas burg nor did they account for differences in population density. We rate O’Rourke’s claim Half True.

pomt-14995	Pollsters say "don't actually believe our own data" and Gallup stopped primary polling "because they don't trust their methodology."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/12/steve-deace/conservative-steve-deace-says-pollsters-dont-trust/	In the Republican presidential nomination contest, polls have been the outsiders’ best friend. Billionaire Donald Trump and physician Ben Carson gained early momentum and critical debate exposure thanks almost entirely to their high rankings in public opinion surveys. What those poll numbers say about Trump and Carson’s chances in the Iowa caucuses and beyond is far murkier. Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace said the polls are meaningless. "The record of polling in Iowa is a joke," Deace said on MSNBC’s News Nation on Oct. 8, 2015. "You’ve got the pollsters now coming out in numerous articles in recent days saying ‘don’t actually believe our own data.’ You have Gallup yesterday made the announcement, they’re pulling out of polling in this primary. They may not even poll the general election because they don’t trust their methodology." A lot of people wonder about the accuracy of the polls, and it would be a big deal if the pollsters themselves were just as skeptical. We decided to drill down on Deace’s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data, and that Gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn’t trust its methodology. A cluster of articles Deace told us he relied on several stories that came out recently. Bloomberg wrote about systematic flaws in the data. High on the list: -- the rise of cell phone-only households and a growing percentage of people who refuse to answer pollsters’ questions. The best public opinion operations employ banks of callers who are fed randomly picked phone numbers. Cell phones make it tougher to determine where the interviewee actually lives, which matters a lot for state-level polls. Plus, federal rules about calling cell phones mean you must hand-dial each one, rather than use a faster automated dialer. That’s a significant cost factor. And then there’s the response rate. When more people hang up, that raises questions about whether the people who participate are unrepresentative of the public at large. "As response rates have declined, the need to rely on risky mathematical maneuvers has increased," the Bloomberg article said. There was also a report from Politico that carried a warning from pollsters. They said they shouldn’t be the ones "to winnow the GOP field." "Don’t trust polls to detect often-tiny grades of opinion in a giant field," the Politico writer summarized. The point was, news organizations sponsoring debates are counting on polls to decide who to bring on the stage and who to cut. With over a dozen Republican candidates, many of them clustered in the single-digits, the differences between any two are nearly certain to be smaller than the polls’ well-published margin of error. If just 1 percentage point separates Candidate A from Candidate B, and the margin of error is 3.5 percent, you have a problem. But it’s not a problem that stems from the polling itself. As the Politico article noted, it’s a problem with how debate organizers are using the polls. What’s up with Gallup? So those two articles are the grounds for the first part of Deace’s statement. Then there was his comment about Gallup. The bombshell in the polling world, as these things go, was Gallup’s decision to pull back from tracking the presidential primaries. This came out in another Politico article headlined, "Gallup gives up the horse race." "After a bruising 2012 cycle, in which its polls were farther off than most of its competitors, Gallup told Politico it isn't planning any polls for the presidential primary horse race this cycle," Politico wrote. "And, even following an internal probe into what went wrong last time around, Gallup won't commit to tracking the general election next year." Gallup is one of the granddaddies of polling and had done a lot of polls in past elections. It was no small thing for the primaries to lose such a prominent player. Frank Newport, Gallup’s editor-in-chief, told Politico that the polling firm thought it could have more impact by asking people what they think about issues, rather than who they want to see in the White House. While the article drew a connection between Gallup’s move and its polling methods, Newport himself didn’t say that. And afterward, he sent around a statement rebutting the story’s broader implication. "Unlike some critics, we at Gallup remain very strong in our belief in the accuracy of polling today, even with the new challenges that are in front of the industry," Newport said. "Our post-mortem work in 2012/2013 and our experimentation in the 2014 midterms leave us with little doubt that polling, including our own, can be accurate in 2016." Taking Newport’s words at face value, worries about Gallup’s methodology did not drive its decision. Deace told us he had not seen Newport’s statement. Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, told us he thinks this was more a business decision, but the picture is complicated. Gallup does a lot of contract work for businesses, and in that context, political polling comes with a risk. "You can be judged by how you do on the presidential vote in November," Franklin said. "If you have troubles with that, it creates problems for the company." Franklin said he thinks Gallup does as good a job as anybody, but he can see why the firm might decide it makes more sense to pull back from election tracking. Polling in changing times There’s no question that it has become trickier and more expensive to be accurate. It’s also clear that the better financed pollsters adapt. Statistics researchers Ole Forsberg and Mark Payton at Oklahoma State University focused on the cell phone issue. Forsberg told us the pollsters have come up with a variety of approaches. He said while we won’t know which ones work best until this election is over, he’s optimistic. "The current polling methods are most likely more accurate than in 2012," Forsberg said. "They may be more accurate than in 2008. They are most likely worse than in 2004." Polling in 2004 was more reliable because landlines were more common back then, and landlines are inherently easier to work with than cell phones. As for the hurdle of rising refusal rates, Franklin said the survey firms, including his, spend more time getting full interviews. "We have to call many more numbers to get a big enough sample size, but there’s plenty of evidence that we’re reaching enough," he said. Historical trends collected by the National Council on Public Polls, a trade association of pollsters, track the gap between polling and actual voting results in presidential years. In 2012, the average error was 1.46 percentage points. That was slightly higher than in the previous three elections in 2008, 2004 and 2000, but less than the error in 1996 when it was 2.1 percentage points. Jon Krosnick at Stanford University has assessed polls for many years. Krosnick distinguishes between polling organizations that dot their I’s and cross their T’s, and those that don’t. "Our evaluations of survey accuracy indicate that surveys done using best practices, which is expensive, continue to be remarkably accurate," Krosnick said. "If you look at the average of the final pre-election polls done by the neutral news organizations that used high quality methods just before the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, they predicted the national popular vote within one percentage point." Krosnick said the danger lies in the proliferation of firms that do polling on the cheap. Those results, he said, could give the impression that polling in general is less accurate. All that said, Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers University political scientist and former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, warns that no one should underestimate the challenges polling faces today. Zukin said there’s a huge issue of figuring out who will actually vote and all the problems only get worse at the state level where much of the attention is focused during the primaries. "We are less sure how to conduct good survey research now than we were four years ago, and much less than eight years ago," Zukin wrote in an op-ed. A particularly subtle form of error seems to have crept into the picture. Nate Silver, a statistician who grew famous for his accurate election predictions and is now editor-in-chief of 538.com, has written about the "herding" phenomenon. That’s when polling firms fear to publish results that don’t track with other polls. "Pollsters have admitted to suppressing polls they deem to be outliers but that would have turned out to be just right," Silver wrote in 538. "In the U.S. last year, at least two polling firms declined to publish surveys showing a tight Senate race in Virginia, which in the end was decided by only 18,000 votes in what was almost a historic upset." Early polls in a class by themselves From what we found, most research into polling accuracy looks at surveys done in the final weeks of a campaign. Right now, we are nearly four months before the first ballot is cast in Iowa. Deace said he thinks the polls are a joke because he doesn’t think they reflect who will carry the caucuses. Franklin at Marquette University told us for pollsters, that’s the wrong question. "This is very much like midway through the second quarter of a football game," he said. "It is not telling you with great certainty who will win the game. But it is telling you who's playing well and who isn't. And we still have the second half to play." Franklin said, if you don’t think the score at halftime tells the whole story, you shouldn’t expect any more from polls at this stage of the primary process. Our ruling Deace said pollsters are warning people not to trust their results and that Gallup doesn’t trust its methodology. The articles he cited actually were more specific than he suggested. Pollsters did say that surveys can’t be used with surgical precision to separate the wheat from the chaff in the crowded Republican field. But that’s in response to broadcasters who have counted on polls to decide who should appear in debates. As for Gallup, a news article implied that concerns over methodology drove its decision to stop tracking the primaries, but the editor-in-chief at Gallup didn’t say that and in fact, he expressed confidence in the firm’s techniques. It’s costing more and more to do polling well, and state-level polls, which are the ones Deace had in mind, face the biggest challenges. But overall, Deace exaggerated what pollsters have said.

Bulk billing rates for general practitioners have increased by 4 percentage points since Labor was in government, despite a freeze on their rebates in 2013-14 and since July 2015. Specialist bulk billing rates have also increased over that time, despite a longer freeze on their rebates. But experts told Fact Check it was not possible to know why bulk billing rates had increased in spite of the freezes on rebates. They say a range of factors could have increased bulk billing, including that the freeze on GP rebates had not been in place long enough to affect bulk billing rates and that doctors were absorbing rising practice costs themselves instead of passing them on to patients. An increase in ageing patients on pensions who were more likely to be bulk billed could also have contributed to the increase.

pomt-03453	The IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/19/mike-rogers/rep-mike-rogers-says-irs-scandal-clearly-showed-so/	There’s broad bipartisan agreement that Internal Revenue Service targeting of tea party and other conservative groups was wrong. But was it criminal? Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., thinks so. During a June 16, 2013, appearance on CBS’ Face the Nation, Rogers said the IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior that at least we know was back at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave." While this sounds as if Rogers was accusing White House officials directly of perpetrating criminal activities, host Bob Schieffer pressed him on that claim twice, and both times Rogers denied that he was making that argument. Instead, Rogers told Schieffer that the administration has "admitted that people in the White House knew about this behavior." Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have concluded that Rogers’ overall claim is overblown. We wondered, though, whether Rogers was well-grounded on something more specific -- that the IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior." Kelsey Knight, a spokeswoman for Rogers, elaborated on his comments in an interview, saying the congressman "believes the targeting of individuals for their political beliefs at the IRS broke the law. … The ongoing investigations will eventually determine who at IRS was actually guilty of criminal behavior." First, let’s recap what the IRS scandal is all about. As we’ve noted previously, the IRS apologized on May 10, 2013, for singling out tax-exemption applications from groups whose names included "tea party," "patriot" or "9/12." The organizations were seeking exemption from federal taxes either as charitable groups with IRS designation 501(c)3 or as social welfare groups, which are allowed to engage in limited political activity without disclosing donors, under IRS designation 501(c)4. Several factors offer complications for Rogers (and for us) in sorting out what went on inside the IRS. Congressional investigations are still under way, meaning that not all the facts are in evidence yet. In addition, Republicans and Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have been releasing pieces of evidence selectively, in ways that advance their political goals. That said, the inspector general’s report that ignited the scandal doesn’t say anything about criminal behavior. So we checked with experts in criminal and tax law to see if there was something we were missing. Is a criminal case the slam dunk Rogers said it was? The experts we interviewed agreed that there would be a substantial bar to clear before a prosecution could go forward, to say nothing of a guilty verdict being rendered. The experts raised two key issues: The need to prove intent "The key element in any criminal case, in addition to satisfying the statutory requirements, is to establish intent," said Stan Brand, a veteran white-collar lawyer in Washington. "That is typically the most difficult part of any criminal case, because it must be established directly through the acts or statements of the defendant or, more commonly, through circumstantial evidence and inference. … That won't be any easier in the IRS case than any other case." Brand said he hasn’t seen anything yet that is clear evidence of intentional criminal activity, though he added that he’s sure the FBI and Justice Department are looking. What law would have been broken? Finding the right criminal statute to use for prosecuting the targeting of political groups could be harder than it sounds. Elizabeth Kingsley, a Washington attorney who specializes in the tax treatment of exempt organizations, said it’s "a reach to even come up with a statute that applies, much less to find ‘clear’ criminal culpability. I suppose if the facts eventually came out to show that the special scrutiny of those groups was based on an intentional decision to subject certain applicants to harsher scrutiny because of an animus against their racial or religious identity, there might be a case to be made. But it would require evidence to demonstrate such an intent, and we have nothing like that so far." David Weisbach, a University of Chicago law professor who previously worked as associate tax legislative counsel at the Treasury Department, agreed. "I'd be shocked if anything that was done was criminal, because there is no explicit statute on point, and because it appears that the IRS staff actually had quite good reasons for selecting the applications as they did," he said. "Examining the political activity of these groups was their job." Brand said that criminal civil rights violations could come into play "if there was a plan or a plot to intentionally deprive these groups of their tax status based on their political ideas." But it would have to be proven that IRS officials targeted groups for the content of their political beliefs, rather than on the possibility that they would act on those beliefs. Another possibility is the Hatch Act, which limits federal employees from taking part in certain political activities. However, the political activities restricted by the Hatch Act involve partisan politics, and while the tea party groups in question were conservative, they were not officially Republican. Because the key question in the targeting of tea party groups revolves around whether they are primarily "social welfare" organizations, rather than partisan organizations, "it’s hard to see how any delay in processing their applications could be considered partisan political activity," Kingsley said. The laws that could most plausibly support Rogers’ claim are those that address perjury or making false statements to law enforcement, Brand said. But if those laws end up being broken, it would be as part of a cover-up rather than the targeting scandal itself, and in the interview with Schieffer, Rogers referred to criminal activity in the targeting itself. "Clearly, when the government in any way, shape, or form uses its power to intimidate citizens who are donating to whatever their political belief -- Republican or Democrat-- that's a criminal activity," Rogers told Schieffer. Our ruling Rogers said the IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior," but the experts we interviewed were skeptical that such a threshold has been met, at least for now. Proving a civil rights violation would be hard, requiring evidence of officials’ intent to deny someone’s civil rights. More plausibly, prosecutors could go after officials for false statements or perjury, though it would be a stretch to call that part of the original targeting scandal that Rogers referred to on Face the Nation. In all, experts said Rogers’ use of the adverb "clearly" went too far. If anything, they suggested, "murky" might be a more appropriate descriptor. Not all the evidence is in, but Rogers is pushing the envelope well beyond what is publicly known today. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-12082	"As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/aug/30/matt-gaetz/gaetz-misleads-claim-about-immigrants-crime/	Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told his constituents he supports a crackdown on sanctuary cities because immigrants in the country illegally threaten public safety. "State and local governments that do not comply with our immigration laws are putting American citizens at risk. The facts are clear: the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that in 2014, 75 percent of all criminal defendants who were convicted and sentenced for federal drug offenses were illegal aliens," Gaetz said in an Aug. 18 email newsletter. "As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders." The topic of murders committed by immigrants living unlawfully in the country caught our attention. We found that there is no national dataset tracking this information. U.S. Sentencing Commission report In 2014 immigrants unauthorized to live in the country did account for "roughly 3.5 percent" of the population. In recent years the number of immigrants living in the United States illegally has been estimated at around 11 million. The nation’s total population in 2014 was just under 320 million. Was that 3.5 percent responsible for more than 10 percent of murders in 2014, as Gaetz said? There is no conclusive data supporting this claim. Gaetz’s office pointed us to a September 2015 FoxNews.com report by Malia Zimmerman, headlined, "Elusive crime wave data shows frightening toll of illegal immigrant criminals." "Statistics show the estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. account for 13.6 percent of all offenders sentenced for crimes committed in the U.S. Twelve percent of murder sentences, 20 percent of kidnapping sentences and 16 percent of drug trafficking sentences are meted out to illegal immigrants," FoxNews.com reported, though it did not specify to which year those sentences correspond. FoxNews.com reported that there is no federal data presenting a comprehensive picture of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally, and that it reviewed "a patchwork of local, state and federal statistics." Some of the data examined came from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, said the FoxNews.com report. Largely due to a lack of available records, "it is difficult to arrive at any ‘absolute’ or ‘concrete’ rate for crimes committed," Devin Murphy, a legislative correspondent for Gaetz’s office, said via email. He said "more records would be useful in calculating specific crime rates." Gaetz’s newsletter cites U.S. Sentencing Commission findings for 2014, so we took a look at the commission’s data report for fiscal year 2014, which details information on federal sentences including citizenship of offenders per primary offense category. The commission reported that in fiscal year 2014, 75 people were sentenced for murder: 64 of them were U.S. citizens and 11 noncitizen. (The noncitizen category includes "resident alien," "illegal alien," "extradited alien," and "non-U.S. citizen, alien status unknown.") Another, more detailed table provided to PolitiFact by the commission showed that of the 75 people sentenced, 9 of them, or 12 percent, were an "illegal alien." But it’s important to note that murder convictions and sentences are mostly handed at the local and state level, not federal. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects crime information voluntarily provided by local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. It reported an estimated 14,249 murders in 2014. Information is available regarding the age, sex, race and ethnicity of the offenders, but not on their immigration status. A July 2017 Cato Institute post by immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh pointed out flaws in the FoxNews.com article used by Gaetz’s office to back his claim. "Ms. Zimmerman’s claim that 12 percent of murder sentences were meted out to illegal immigrants in 2014 shows just how misleading it is to rely on partial federal data to make a point about nationwide crime," Nowrasteh wrote. The commission’s report "lists only 75 murderers sentenced to federal prison in 2014, a mere 0.5 percent of the 14,249 nationwide murders committed that year in the United States," he added. The commission’s data is "a very small subset," and most of the serious, violent crime convictions happen at the state level, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California-Irvine, who recently examined 51 studies on the relationship between immigration and crime, mainly finding no correlation. "It is misleading to make assumptions, to make inferences (based on the commission’s report) because it’s such unique data," Kubrin said. Our ruling Gaetz said, "As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders." The unauthorized population in 2014 was roughly 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, as Gaetz said, but the rest of his claim is dubious. There is no national, comprehensive report or database tracking the share of murders committed by unauthorized immigrants. A U.S. Sentencing Commission report for fiscal year 2014 attributed more than 10 percent of murders to immigrants living in the country illegally, but that’s for a small subset: federal sentences for 75 people, 9 of whom were classified as an "illegal alien." Murder convictions and sentences are mostly handed at the local and state level, not federal. Gaetz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14780	California has "robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation."	mostly true	/california/statements/2015/dec/07/kevin-de-leon/senator-claims-california-grows-jobs-faster-rest-n/	Top California Democrats like State Senate leader Kevin de León often claim that the state’s economy is humming right along — and not weighed down by their ambitious new clean energy requirements. Critics, particularly the oil industry, consider the state’s clean energy push detrimental to California’s economy and job outlook. So, it’s not a surprise that De León, author of the state’s most recent clean energy law, touted California’s strong job growth during a recent speech abroad about climate change. De León, D-Los Angeles, spoke about California’s role as a leader in the fight against climate change to members of Parliament in the United Kingdom. He told them California has "robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe," according to a November press release from the senator’s office. California’s employment picture has certainly improved from the Great Recession, when it lost more than a million jobs from 2007 to 2009. Economists credit a rebound in housing and construction jobs plus strong tech sector growth for the state’s healthier employment figures. But, we wondered, is the state seeing job growth that truly "outpaces the rest of the nation," as the senator claimed? Or did his statement exaggerate the state’s good job news? We set out on a fact check limited to this question. We did not evaluate the additional question of how the state’s clean energy rules have affected California’s job growth. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Our research Economists we spoke with said De León’s statement, on its face, is correct. They said they took his statement to mean California’s job growth rate was higher than the country’s overall job growth rate. And it is. In 2014, California added jobs at a 3 percent clip compared with the previous year. That was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s overall rate of 1.9 percent during the same period, according to data from Chapman University’s Center for Economic Research. "Overall, the statement is accurate," said Professor Esmael Adibi, the center’s director. "We are outperforming the U.S." And that’s not a new trend, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University. "The state has actually outperformed the country as a whole for 44 consecutive months, which amounts to almost four years," Reaser said. Still, there’s more to the nation’s job picture. Fourteen other states in 2014 had a higher job growth rate than the country overall, according to data provided by the economists. California’s accomplishment was hardly unique. Another interpretation of De León’s claim is that California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states in "the rest of the nation." Asked to clarify the senator’s statement, De León’s office pointed to recent news articles that describe California adding more total jobs than any other state, and adding jobs at a faster pace than the nation overall. Still, the phrase "rest of the nation" is open to different readings, Abibi said. "Is he talking about the U.S. as a whole or is he talking about Texas or North Dakota or Michigan?" the professor asked. That’s significant because five other states had a faster job growth rate than California’s 3 percent last year. They were North Dakota at 3.8 percent; Nevada at 3.5 percent; Colorado at 3.3 percent; Florida at 3.2 percent and Texas with 3.1 percent, according to state and federal data. Senator Kevin De León addresses members of the U.K. Parliament in London. Photo courtesy De León's office. Our ruling State Senator Kevin de León said earlier this month that California has "robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe." We limited our fact check to whether California has grown jobs faster than "the rest of the nation." We did not evaluate the impact the state’s clean energy policies have had on job growth, a question raised by the second part of De León’s statement. Economists we spoke with agree that California’s job growth rate has been higher than the nation’s overall average — for several years. Last year, the state’s job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s. But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state that’s added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat. And there is another way to read the senator’s statement. One could assume the senator meant California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states. Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of "the rest of the nation," and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success. In the end, we rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-02035	"We’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/03/david-frum/david-frum-us-executions-have-dropped-nearly-two-t/	The botched execution of an Oklahoma man has again put a focus on the death penalty in the United States. Bill Maher added his mix of humor and seriousness to the discussion on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher. "Why can’t we just kill people? If you want to kill them, and you want to do it humanely, you can definitely put them out. We’ve all been under," Maher said on his May 23, 2014, show. "Then when you’re under … guillotine, shoot them, leave them in a room with a toddler with a gun, anything. It’s just so easy to take human life. It’s ridiculous." David Frum of The Atlantic tried to bring the conversation back toward seriousness, saying "we’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation." Maher jumped right back in. "We're fifth in the world," Maher said. "Behind China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia." Here, we’re looking at Frum’s claim. (In another fact-check we took up Maher’s retort.) The best information to consider Frum’s claim comes from the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization set up to provide information and statistics about the death penalty. The center tracks the number of executions in the United States each year. The death penalty in the United States was suspended in 1972 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Furman vs. Georgia. The court in that case found that a lack of standards in enforcing the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The death penalty was reinstated four years later after the court approved more specific sentencing guidelines. Executions started slowly after the death penalty was reinstated then climbed steadily in the 1990s. The number of executions peaked in 1999 at 98 and has been generally declining since. In 2013, there were a total of 39 executions. (Death Penalty Information Center) Compared to the peak year of 1999, the number of executions in 2013 were down by 60 percent. That’s not exactly the figure Frum cited, but it’s close, and Frum hedged his statement by adding "nearly." As for the other part of Frum’s claim, he said the drop happened "over the past generation." That’s right in some instances -- namely from 1999 to 2013 -- but wrong in others. A generation is most often defined as a period of time between 20 and 30 years. From 1993-2013, a period of about 20 years, the number of executions have increased by one (or up 2.6 percent). From 1983-2013, about 30 years, the number of executions have increased by 34 (or up 680 percent). Still, the broader trend line appears clear, and that’s what Frum ultimately was getting at. "The overall trend has been consistently downward over the last 15 years," the Death Penalty Information Center said in a statement. What explains the drop? Part of it is that more states are abolishing the death penalty. Six states have abolished the death penalty since 2007 (New York, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, New Mexico and Illinois). Part of it is a drop off in states that use the death penalty most frequently. Texas executed 40 people in 2000 but has averaged less than 15 executions per year in the past three years. Richard Dieter, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, says the drop-off in Texas may be explained by a 2005 change in the law that gave juries the choice of sentencing murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Before, according to the Los Angeles Times, jurors had to sentence a murderer to die to be assured he would never go free. In Florida, the number of executions has swung with the governor. Jeb Bush presided over 21 executions in eight years in office (1999-2007) while Charlie Crist saw five executions in his one four-year term (2007-11). Rick Scott has overseen 17 executions since taking office in January 2011. "Twenty years ago, use of the death penalty was increasing. Now it is declining by almost every measure," said Dieter, who authored a Death Penalty Information Center year-end report. "The recurrent problems of the death penalty have made its application rare, isolated, and often delayed for decades." Our ruling Frum said, "We’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation." Statistics show that executions in the United States have been generally decreasing since 1999 and are down about 60 percent from 1999 to 2013. Frum could have been more specific on his timeframe, but his point is largely on the mark. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-04299	An Obama campaign tactic for rallying voters is to "offer them cell phones."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/31/adam-putnam/putnam-obama-campaign-gives-free-cell-phones-suppo/	An A-team of Florida Republicans packed a Tampa stage Wednesday to welcome Mitt Romney and rally supporters in the final days of the presidential campaign. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio were in the lineup, as well as Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, who warmed up the crowd and encouraged voters to head to the polls early. "Early vote now so that you can wave signs on election day next Tuesday," Putnam said. This is a team sport. This is a team sport. It's fully interactive. We can't just show up and cheer and slap a bumper sticker on the back of our car and think we're done. We've got to drag people to the polls. That's what they're doing. You don't have to offer them cell phones like they're doing." That line about cell phones caught our attention. We decided to investigate. Is the Obama campaign offering cell phones to get voters to the polls? The ‘Obama phone’ myth Way back in 2009, a reader asked us to check out a chain email declaring, "TAX PAYER MONEY IS BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS FOR FREE CELL PHONES." The email called the phones "Obama phones," suggesting the program was an Obama administration creation. The phone program, the email said, threatened "the very foundations that this country was built on," and "the age old concepts of God, family, and hard work." We learned that there is, in fact, a government program that provides discounted phone service to low-income people, depending on where participants live, through Federal Communications Commission programs. Specifically, a program called Lifeline provides discounts on basic monthly phone service, according to the FCC website. Eligible participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance, or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs. Lifeline and programs like it have been around quite a while. Lifeline was created in 1985 and expanded in 2008 during the Bush administration to include cell phone service. An FCC spokeswoman told PolitiFact in 2009 that the 1996 Telecommunications Act required the FCC to create the Universal Service Fund, a pool of money subsidized by small charges on phone bills and redistributed to low-income service programs, as well as programs that bring telecommunications services to rural areas and schools. In early 2012, the FCC implemented changes to Lifeline aimed at modernizing the program and eliminating fraud and waste. One goal: ensuring availability of broadband for all low-income Americans. New life in the campaign Debunking aside, the "Obama phones" myth re-emerged during the presidential race. In September, video of an unidentified woman protesting at a Romney rally in Cleveland made its way onto some conservative websites, including the Drudge Report. The woman claimed to have received a free "Obama phone." "Everybody in Cleveland -- low, minority -- got Obama phones," she tells an interviewer. "Keep Obama in president (sic). He gave us a phone. He’s gonna do more." The interviewer asks how Obama gave her a phone. Her response: "You sign up if you on food stamps, you on Social Security, you got low income, you disability." Radio host Rush Limbaugh reacted by saying, "She may not know who George Washington is or Abraham Lincoln, but she knows how to get an Obama phone." The Obama campaign also responded, posting a story on its Truth Team website swatting down the rumor and explaining the history of the phone program. The "he gave us a phone" video has become an internet meme, yielding remixes and parodies galore. And earlier this month the group Tea Party Victory Fund released a political ad in Ohio featuring the woman’s rant. Putnam’s response We reached out to Putnam’s spokesman at the Florida Department of Agriculture, Sterling Ivey, for backup to the claim. Shortly after our inquiry, Ivey pointed us to Putnam’s Facebook page, where this note was posted: "About those cell phones: I'd heard about the YouTube video, wasn't aware it was disclaimed. Won't happen again," Putnam wrote Wednesday afternoon. Ivey added: "I think it’s one of those myths that’s obviously grown a life of its own. He wasn’t aware there was a disproving of the statements in the video." Our ruling Putnam told Romney supporters that the Obama campaign is offering cell phones to get its voters to the polls. Internet chatter claiming that Obama gave cell phones to welfare recipients contained a tiny grain of truth: The federal government does have a program to subsidize phone service for low-income people. That program, though, existed long before Obama became president. Putnam then squeezed all reality out of the story, twisting it into an allegation of dirty campaigning. He has since acknowledged the statement was wrong -- but not before announcing it at a high-profile presidential campaign rally. We rate his statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-09884	"Doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, (and) AARP" say that health reform "makes sense to do."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/27/barack-obama/obama-says-there-widespread-support-health-care-re/	In his recent speech, President Barack Obama said the time is ripe for health care reform because most health care professionals support a new plan. "The default position is inertia," he said during his July 22, 2009, speech on health care when asked why he was so eager to pass health care reform before the end of the summer. "Because doing something always creates some people who are unhappy... And the fact that we have made so much progress where we've got doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, AARP, saying that this makes sense to do, I think means that the stars are aligned and we need to take advantage of that." Obama was talking about some key industry endorsements he picked up for a health care overhaul. In early May, the hospitals, insurers and the drug industry pledged to save $2 trillion in health care spending over 10 years. That victory was followed by a July 8 announcement that hospitals would contribute $155 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings to cover health care cost reform. So, at first blush it seems that Obama is right that the stars are aligned for health care reform. However, we found that some storm clouds are overshadowing Obama’s starry sky. First, it's important to note that there’s a big difference between supporting a health care overhaul generally and supporting the legislation being considered by the House and the Senate. Nearly all industry sectors believe our health care system needs an overhaul. But they disagree on what to change. Those divisions are best illustrated by industry support or opposition to the House and Senate health care bills. Among many other things, both bills would create a government-run insurance option and would require that most employers extend some sort of health insurance to their employees. People would be required to have some form of coverage, and insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of a person’s medical history. The House bill would tax the wealthiest people to help pay for the legislation, while the Senate hasn't unveiled how it will pay for the overhaul. The American Medical Association — a coalition of doctors and medical societies — endorsed the House bill, because the "legislation includes a broad range of provisions that are key to effective, comprehensive health system reform." However, several of AMA's members, including the Texas Medical Association, have not endorsed the bill because it includes a government-run health insurance option. Another sticking point is an administration proposal that would create an independent group of medical experts to look for inefficiencies in the Medicare system to save money. The American Hospital Association says the plan will hit rural and teaching hospitals hardest because they get extra Medicare payments to help cover their relatively high cost of doing business. AARP supports the House bill, but believes the Senate bill still needs some work. Specifically, the organization, which represents people over 50, is concerned the bill would prevent some less costly generic drugs from entering the market fast enough. The leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, PhRMA, does not support the House bill, but says the Senate bill "marks an important step toward achieving comprehensive health care reform." And the American Nurses Asssociation supports the House bill, but has no clear position on the Senate bill. Those are a lot of details to keep track of, so we've provided you with a handy guide here . But back to Obama's claim. He's correct that most in the health care industry support some sort of reform, but when we're talking about the overhauls that have been put to paper — specifically, the House and Senate bills — there is quite a bit of disagreement among hospitals, nurses, Medicare patients, doctors and the drug industry over which plan is best; industry support isn't as rock-solid as Obama would make it seem. As a result, we give him a Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-07-27T12:40:17	2009-07-22	['None']

pomt-10088	"Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/01/john-mccain/its-not-welfare/	(Published Oct. 21, 2008) A new Web ad from John McCain's campaign features the ubiquitous Joe the Plumber and attacks Barack Obama’s tax plan as "welfare." "Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none," the announcer says. In the background is the phrase "$100-billion to those that pay no taxes." There are a number of misleading things packed into a tight space here. McCain's claim that Obama's plan will translate to higher taxes for seniors and working families is grossly misleading. As we have pointed out many times , that’s only true if a senior or a family is making more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for a single person. Otherwise, it’s generally not the case. Here we will focus on the claim from the ad — repeated by McCain in recent stump speeches — that Obama’s tax plan amounts to welfare. First, McCain is targeting Obama’s plan to enact a number of refundable tax credits. Refundable means the government sends a check if the taxes owed are less than zero. Among the refundable tax credits proposed by Obama: • Under the Making Work Pay plan, a tax credit for wage earners of up to $500. • A mortgage credit equal to 10 percent of mortgage interest for nonitemizers, up to a maximum credit of $800. • A refundable higher education tax credit for the first $4,000 of qualifying higher education expenses. Obama also has proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit for some; as well as the child and dependent care credit. The McCain campaign cites a report from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center as evidence that Obama's tax plan would amount to more government giveaways. The Tax Policy Center analyzed Obama’s tax proposals (as described by his economic advisers) and concluded that in 2009, his plan would, in fact, result in $100-billion in government outlays to people who have no income tax liability. That figure would gradually inch up in ensuing years, to $111-billion in 2018. A couple of major caveats are in order. The government already outlays nearly $53-billion to 57-million people (38 percent of all tax filers) who have a zero or negative income tax under current law. A negative income tax means that refundable tax credits amounted to more than the person’s income tax liability, meaning they got a check from the government. The Tax Policy Center estimates another 15-million people would fall into the "zero or negative income tax" category under Obama’s tax plan. Obama’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center, would add an additional $48-billion in government outlay to those who pay no federal income tax. We think the ad is misleading in that it suggests Obama proposes an additional $100-billion for those who pay no federal income taxes. "There clearly are aspects of the Obama plan that would give to people who pay no federal income tax," said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. But there’s another big hole in the ad’s logic. Obama’s proposed tax credit for wage earners is designed to offset payroll taxes. Those are the taxes withheld from your paycheck for Social Security and Medicare, 6.75 percent of your earnings. All workers pay payroll taxes, even people who pay no income tax. So for McCain to say that Obama’s tax credits would go to people who "pay no taxes" is inaccurate. There are some under Obama’s plan whose tax credits would actually come to more than their income tax liability and their payroll tax liability, but that’s a very small percentage of people, said Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center. And there’s some hypocrisy here: McCain has proposed a refundable tax credit of his own. McCain proposes a $5,000 tax credit for people to buy health insurance. (We should note that the refundable portion of McCain's health care tax credit must go to a special health spending account so that it only pays for health-related expenses.) Inasmuch as the plan is being sold as a way to help make health care affordable to those at the bottom of the income scale, it too would result in payments to those who pay no income tax. "It absolutely is the pot calling the kettle black," Williams said. We also think it's misleading to call Obama’s plan "welfare." Welfare is a loaded word that connotes government aid to those who aren’t working. Obama’s tax credit for wage earners is just that, for wage earners. We also note that the earned-income tax credit has historically enjoyed strong support from Republicans as well. It was designed, in a way, to replace welfare payments to those who don’t work with government subsidies to low-income people who do work. McCain is not proposing elimination, or reduction, of the existing earned income and child care credits. The existing system results in $53-billion to those who pay no income taxes. Is that support for welfare? McCain is technically accurate when he says that under Obama’s plan, refundable tax credits would result in more people getting a check from Uncle Sam, rather than writing one. But we think it’s misleading to call that welfare. So let's review again the McCain ad's claim in its totality. "Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none." The claim that Obama will raise taxes on seniors and hardworking families? Misleading. Using the term "welfare" to describe refundable tax credits? Not by most people's definition. That the plan would give payments to people who pay no taxes? Only if you don't consider payroll taxes as taxes. That all adds up to False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-12-01T00:00:00	2008-10-16	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-01724	Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. advised citizens to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/07/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/group-says-sheriff-david-clarke-said-calling-911-n/	A new TV ad by a liberal group uses Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.’s own words to suggest he’s encouraging gun violence by discouraging use of the 911 emergency response system. "I don’t dial 911," Clarke says in a clip featured in the ad. "I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet.’" The ad ends with another excerpt from that interview: "Point that barrel (at) center mass and pull the trigger." At the top of the spot, a narrator says: "Emergency responders. They risk their lives every day to help save ours. But Sheriff David Clarke says 911 is not our best option." Does the new ad, paid for by the union-backed Greater Wisconsin Committee, accurately reflect Clarke’s views? Specifically, has Clarke advised citizens to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option?" A familiar controversy Clarke faces Milwaukee Police lieutenant Chris Moews in the Democratic primary for sheriff on Aug. 12, 2014. The new ad resurrects a controversy that began in January 2013 when Clarke’s office paid for a radio announcement in which he said: "With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. But are you prepared?" That prompted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story with this online headline: "Sheriff David Clarke’s radio ad says 911 not best option, urges residents to take firearms classes." After Clarke’s radio spot, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett criticized him, saying if there’s an emergency, "I want people to call 911" but Sheriff Clarke is "discouraging people from calling 911, it’s just wrong." About six weeks later, Clarke sat for a long interview with Project Veritas, a conservative group. that posted it online. The snippets of Clarke speaking in the Greater Wisconsin ad are from this interview. In that interview, Clarke said that Barrett had "contorted" the message in his radio spot by suggesting that he was advising that nobody call 911. The sheriff explained that it’s up to individual citizens to decide for themselves what they will do when confronted with possible harm. At the same time, Clarke made it clear not only what he personally would do, but what he would advise as the best course of action for citizens. He spoke in the context of potentially immediate danger, an example being an intruder breaking into your home. Twice he said the "advice" he would give people was based on what he himself would do: "Use cover, because you don’t know if that clown trying to break into your house is armed. Know who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger." He does not mention calling 911 in that sequence. Then he concludes: "You see, the thing is 911 in that situation is not going to help you and that’s why I said it’s not your best option." So the ad, notably, gets the "not your best option" context right. The other Clarke quote in the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad is from a section of the Project Veritas interview in which Clarke talks more about what he personally would do in that situation. Clarke tells the interviewer that a sign hangs on his own home picturing the head of a Rottweiler and a semiautomatic handgun with the message: "We don’t dial 911." "I don’t call 911," Clarke explained. "I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet. And that’s not to sound, you know … that’s just the reality. I’m not going to fool around with that. But that’s the mindset I have but I’ve been a cop for 35 years, so I live with that every day and it becomes second nature..." The sheriff, at that point in the interview, shifts back to what he’d like law abiding residents to consider doing. Government shouldn’t tell them what to do, he said. "I trust them to make those decisions as to what to do," Clarke said. "If they want to blow a whistle, fine, I don’t tell them not to." But he made clear that he feels the best option is not waiting around for the police, or hiding under the bed, or running away. "I don’t think that’s going to be very effective in some of these situations," Clarke said. "So I want people to think about what’s going to be effective. If you want to run out of your house, fine, I’m not running out of my house unless it’s on fire. That’s my house, and I’m not running from it to give the bad guy carte blanche." Ad vs. reality So how does the Greater Wisconsin ad compare to Clarke’s statements? The ad, despite the length limitations, gets Clarke’s message right and places it in the context -- using Clarke’s own words -- of a home invasion situation. Neither Clarke nor the ad is saying the sheriff suggests that calling 911 is never a good idea. (Clarke, in the interview, at one point seems to suggest he wants average citizens to call 911 if they can -- but then take matters into their own hands rather than wait for police to arrive). The other Clarke quote in the ad -- "point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger" -- is in fact Clarke’s advice to citizens. He says a 911 call isn’t always possible and by itself isn’t effective because of long wait times for police. When we asked Clarke to respond to the ad, he said he stands behind what he said to Project Veritas and did not intend to watch the Greater Wisconsin ad. Clarke said he suspected the ad twisted his remarks, but he couldn’t recall the specific context of his comments in the interview cited in the ad, and he offered no specific criticisms. "My position is clear," Clarke said. Our rating A Greater Wisconsin Committee ad said Sheriff David Clarke advised citizens to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option." Clarke did just that in an interview, and made similar comments in an earlier radio spot and in comments to PolitiFact Wisconsin. We rate the claim True.

pomt-08646	"She created the Waste, Fraud and Mismanagement Hotline.... (that) has saved Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/16/julie-lassa/julie-lassa-says-she-created-fraud-hotline-has-sav/	Democrat Julie Lassa says she wants to go to Congress to "clean up Washington" and argues she has a record of fighting wasteful government spending from her 12 years in the state Legislature. Lassa’s website invites visitors to save taxpayer dollars by calling the state fraud hotline with reports of abuse -- and touts her role in its creation. Lassa, a Stevens Point Democrat, is running to succeed Democratic U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, elected to the northwest Wisconsin district in 1969. Lassa has been criticized by Republicans as a "Madison insider." Lassa brags about the hotline to tout her legislative accomplishments and underscore her claim that she saves taxpayers money. On the website, Lassa states: "Julie’s Hotline has saved Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars." So, do her claims ring true? Lassa can claim considerable credit for the hotline. She’s listed as an author of Senate Bill 86 -- along with nine other senators and 11 sponsors in the Assembly. Lassa’s name is first on the list of senators, which indicates she took the lead role in that chamber. The other sponsors (and anyone else who voted for the bill) might have opinions about whether it is "Julie’s hotline." We’ll chalk that up to political puffery but note she’s not the one answering the phone. Now what about the money-saving claim? The campaign said it could not provide a dollar breakdown on the hotline savings and referred us to a Legislative Audit Bureau report on the hotline issued in June. The Fraud, Waste and Mismanagement Hotline (877-372-8317) was created in 2007 and began ringing in the office of the Legislative Audit Bureau in April 2008. A secure e-mail system was added a year later. In 2009, the hotline received 79 reports -- 53 of which came over the phone. In all, the hotline fielded 154 calls between the time it was established and the end of 2009, according to the audit bureau. Some of those calls prompted responses from state bureaucrats and lawmakers. A June 24, 2010 report issued by State Auditor Janice Mueller’s office discusses the 79 reports made during 2009. Some didn’t pan out, many couldn’t be quantified. The one that stirred the most action was about the thickness of concrete used in state road projects. That complaint said a contractor had falsified pavement thickness and smoothness measurements. A similar complaint had been filed in 2004 and investigated by the Department of Justice. That probe was closed in 2008 after the department found "insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges," the audit bureau said. After the report came into the hotline, the audit bureau looked at whether the highway construction program had adequate monitoring safeguards. That led to two legislative hearings and further review from the auditor’s office. Among the findings from the further review: The DOT hired consultants for work that could have been done for $1.2 million less by state workers. The consultants were hired because of a lack of staff. Mueller said in an interview that the call to the hotline "led to significant changes to the concrete program" that will ensure roads last longer. But she said it wasn’t possible to put a dollar figure on the matter. In any case, any savings from the changes will be in the future. Another hotline call identified problems with overtime payments to state workers. One had his overtime cut from 500 to 60 hours after his bosses took a closer look at his work. Such scrutiny appears to have stemmed a trend of increasing overtime payments, Mueller said. Again, however, it wasn’t possible to put a dollar figure on any savings. So we have a two-part claim. One part is clear, the other part is less so. Julie Lassa did lead the effort to create the hotline, which has generated calls that led to changes. For Lassa’s second statement to be accurate, the hotline needs to have saved taxpayers at least $200,000. There’s no accounting of the actual savings, so we’re left to connect the dots. It seems plausible that the changes in the highway concrete program could one day reach -- or exceed -- that level. The savings in overtime seem likely to be smaller, although still possibly substantial. Regardless, any savings from the calls to the hotline will come down the road. We rate Lassa’s statement Half True.	None	Julie Lassa	None	None	None	2010-09-16T09:00:00	2010-09-15	['Wisconsin']
pomt-09086	"Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/24/harry-reid/during-primary-angle-said-social-security-cant-be-/	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is facing a tough re-election campaign back home in Nevada. His opponent is Republican Sharron Angle, a former state legislator who also has the support of Tea Party activists. Soon after Angle secured the Republican nomination, the Reid campaign released an ad attacking her positions on Social Security and prison programs. "Social Security. It means independence, a secure income," the ad's narrator says. "But shockingly, Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security." There's a brief clip of Angle saying, "We need to phase Medicare and Social Security out." "She'd cut benefits for everyone coming into the system," the narrator says. "That's Sharron Angle. First, a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners. Now she wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security. What's next?" We addressed the Scientology angle in a separate report. Here, we're looking at whether Angle "wants to wipe out Social Security." First, we should note the ad's video of Angle is edited from a longer statement she made during a May 19 primary debate with other Republican candidates. "We need to phase Medicare and Social Security out in favor of something privatized," Angle said. "We know that the government never gives ... " At this point the moderator interrupted, saying, "Well, don't fix it? You're saying don't do any of these things?" Angle replied, "I'm saying it can't be fixed. It's broken." We also asked the Reid campaign to back up the claims, and it provided us with several news accounts describing Angle as wanting to end Social Security, the government program that sends senior citizens modest monthly checks after they retire. The most on-point story was one from the Associated Press, dated June 1, 2010, that began, "Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security, shutter the Education Department and return to the days almost a century ago when the federal income tax was unconstitutional. ... "Angle calls Social Security 'a broken system without much to recommend it.' She hasn't offered a detailed plan but says seniors now collecting benefits would not be cut off. Workers over time would be shifted to private retirement accounts, an idea that is similar to what former President George W. Bush proposed six years ago only to see it flop." We checked Angle's campaign website and found the following about Angle's position on Social Security: "Free market alternatives, which offer retirement choices to employees and employers, must be developed and offered to those still in their wage earning years, as the Social Security system is transitioned out. Young workers must be encouraged to investigate personal retirement account options." Angle has been asked several times in recent weeks about her views on Social Security, especially about diverting payroll taxes that pay for the program into private investment accounts. Jon Ralston, a prominent Nevada political reporter, asked her about it on his show, Face to Face. "Privatize social security? People will go crazy about that kind of stuff, won't they?" Ralston asked. "You know, Jon, we all know that Social Security has been broken for years," Angle replied. "The government has been raiding the lockbox and putting in IOUs. We really need to do something that says, going forward -- not right now, because we have some senior citizens that have made a contract with us, we need to be in good faith and complete our contract with them. But going forward, people that are still in the work force right now making their living, they should have a choice between giving that money to the government to take out of that lockbox or keeping the money in a lockbox of their own." Fox News commentator Sean Hannity also asked Angle about the ad on June 14. "Look, Harry Reid is attacking you in this latest ad that he's got out there, saying that you want to phase out Medicare and Social Security. What is your reaction to what he said?" he asked. "Well, it's nonsense. I want to save Medicare and Social Security. I'd like to put some of that money back in the lockbox that he has raided and put an IOU in. He's (had) 20 years to fix Social Security and Medicare. And what we have is an empty lockbox. And what we need is to make our senior citizens feel secure once more with their own Social Security and Medicare. But going forward we need to personalize that program in a way that the government can't go in and raid it any more." Reading all of her public comments, we conclude that Angle supports privatizing Social Security, similar to the plan President George W. Bush put forward in 2005. Bush wanted to allow workers to divert part of the program's payroll taxes to personal investment accounts, typically invested in stocks and bonds. The idea was that private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs without government interference and it would keep the system solvent. Opponents said it was a sneaky way to start dismantling Social Security. But we still have questions about Angle's position on Social Security. Her comments from earlier in the campaign indicate that she thinks Social Security should eventually be ended. Her comments to Hannity and that of her spokesperson imply that private accounts might be optional, as Bush suggested. Reid's ad says Angle wants to "wipe out Social Security" and "cut benefits for everyone coming into the system." During the primary, Angle clearly indicated that she thought Social Security should be phased out, saying, "It can't be fixed. It's broken." Lately, her comments have been less clear, as if she is leaning toward an optional ongoing program. But that was not her position during the primary. Then, she said the program should gradually phase out. So we rate Reid's statement Half True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2010-06-24T18:26:09	2010-06-12	['None']
pomt-01507	Says President Barack Obama is "sending a much larger (force) " to deal with Ebola "than ISIS is getting."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/23/brit-hume/hume-obama-put-more-force-combatting-ebola-isis/	Before President Barack Obama launched a wave of bombers, fighter planes, drones and cruise missiles against Islamic State at its key bases in Syria, some commentators had disparaged the administration’s willingness to take on the extremist group. On Fox News Sunday on Sept. 21, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said Obama is "not putting the full effort into" defeating the group also called ISIS or ISIL. "Consider the difference between the president's response to ISIS and his response to the Ebola outbreak," Hume said. "He's sending a large force, much larger than ISIS is getting, to deal with this Ebola outbreak." Hume’s comment came in the context of a discussion over the approximately 1,600 U.S. military advisers and trainers deployed to Iraq to reverse the territorial gains ISIS made there. Via Twitter, we asked Hume to flesh out his claim that Obama is sending "a much larger" force to deal with Ebola "than ISIS is getting." Hume said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "told Congress (the) U.S. has 1,600 troops in Iraq. Obama announced 3,000 to fight Ebola in Africa." The White House announced Sept. 16 that 3,000 troops would help with logistics and setting up medical facilities to contain the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in five West African nations. Prior to the Sept. 22 attacks on targets in Syria, the Pentagon said about 1,600 American troops were in Iraq. The problem is, Hume's claim applied to Obama's overall military strategy to combat ISIS, which involves far more than the 1,600 military advisers and troops he sent to Iraq. "Boots on the ground is a terrible metric," said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank that supports larger defense budgets. Gunzinger is a retired Air Force colonel and served in the Pentagon during the administration of President George W. Bush. Gunzinger factors in the airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq. Before Sept. 22, there had been over 170 strikes by American fighter jets, bombers and drones. "A single aircraft carrier has a crew and air wing that can run from 5,000 to 6,000 people," Gunzinger said. "I think it's accurate to say that the level of effort for air and ground operations in Iraq ... far exceeds the level of effort now underway for (the Defense Department)'s humanitarian operations in Africa." A senior Defense Department spokesman also noted the number of soldiers needed to launch airstrikes and pointed to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s inventory of military assets in the region. In a 2013 speech in Bahrain, Hagel said there are more than 35,000 military personnel in and around the Persian Gulf, including a carrier strike group and airbases. Those bases support a range of aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, drones and F-22s. We asked Hume about the airstrikes. He said if one were to count the aircraft carrier crew, one would need to include the personnel needed to protect the 3,000 troops in Africa. However, it is possible that the 3,000 includes that protective force. More broadly, we found a 2011 list of active duty military stationed in Africa, posted by CNN. It showed fewer than 700 troops. U.S. Africa Command currently reports that it has about 2,000 assigned personnel, including military, government civilians and contractors. None of these figures seem to reach the level of troops used against ISIS as of Sunday, Sept. 21. Our ruling Hume said the president is sending a much larger force to deal with Ebola than ISIS was getting. Hume’s statement only holds water so long as you limit the tally to the additional ground forces assigned to each mission. But that framework ignores the airstrikes, the main tool the president had used against ISIS as of Sept. 21, before the strikes were expanded to ISIS targets in Syria. If ISIS was "getting" something, what it got came from forces already in the region, and it seems to make little difference if an ISIS position was destroyed by a soldier newly arrived in the theater or one who had been there a while. At the very least, those strikes relied on carrier-based war planes. According to a former Air Force colonel and the Pentagon, the number of soldiers needed to launch those attacks is larger than the 3,000 troops deployed to fight the Ebola outbreak. We rate the claim False.	None	Brit Hume	None	None	None	2014-09-23T15:34:20	2014-09-21	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-10032	"The president's plan, even after the end of its withdrawal timeline is reached, will leave in place up to 50,000 U.S. troops."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/27/john-mccain/mccain-says-obama-will-leave-troops-iraqwishful-th/	On the day President Obama unveiled his strategy for pulling out of Iraq, Sen. John McCain offered tepid support from the Senate floor. "I am cautiously optimistic that the plan as laid out by the president can lead to success," McCain said on Feb. 27. "The American people should be clear: The president's plan, even after the end of its withdrawal timeline is reached, will leave in place up to 50,000 U.S. troops." If true, that would be an important vindication for McCain, who argued during the campaign that the United States should station peacetime troops in Iraq for the long term as it has in other theaters. "Maybe a hundred, make it 100 (years)," is how McCain put it at a campaign appearance in January 2008. "We've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That'd be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed." But did Obama really say he would leave in place 50,000 U.S. troops? In his speech at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, Obama said he would "remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months" and "retain a transitional force ... likely (to) be made up of 35-50,000 U.S. troops." We suppose this is the basis of McCain's claim (though his office did not respond to our inquiry). But Obama went on to offer more detail: "Through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments," he said. "And under the Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011." So McCain's claim is true only if Obama's "withdrawal timeline" ends at the start of the transitional period beginning in September 2010. That is, McCain was accurate only if he was talking exclusively about the withdrawal of combat troops. Clearly, though, Obama laid out a more complete timeline that extends through the end of 2011, when all U.S. troops are to be out of Iraq. And that timeline effectively rebukes McCain's argument for a long-term troop presence. In a background conversation with reporters, a senior Obama administration official said his aides had rejected the idea of a long-term peacetime presence like that in Germany and South Korea. “The path we're on here, the path is not towards any sort of Korea model,” the New York Times quoted the official as saying. “The path is towards reducing, in a fairly substantial way, U.S. forces in 2010 and then down to what's currently anticipated, down to zero, by the end of 2011." (We prefer not to quote anonymous officials, but feel comfortable doing so here because the statement merely reinforces what Obama said in his speech.) So it was inaccurate for McCain to suggest otherwise. McCain may simply have been speaking imprecisely, rather than trying to claim a policy victory he has not won. Still, we thought it important to note that on the question of a long-term troop presence in Iraq — one of the most fundamental areas of disagreement about the war among policymakers — Obama has thus far rejected McCain's vision, despite McCain's claim to the contrary. We find McCain's claim to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2009-02-27T16:22:58	2009-02-27	['United_States']

pomt-13301	"You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-deleted-33000-em/	The FBI concluded that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted over her decision to conduct State Department business exclusively over a private email server, but Donald Trump pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the matter if he becomes president. At the second debate between the two presidential nominees, Trump criticized Clinton for turning over half her emails held on her server to the State Department and deleting the rest. He said Clinton should be "ashamed" of herself for deleting 33,000 emails. "There has never been anything like this," Trump said at the Oct. 9 event in St. Louis. "You get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails." Clinton and her campaign don’t dispute that she deleted these 33,000 emails. They argue that these were personal in nature, rather than work-related, and therefore were not necessary to turn over. However, they have denied that they deleted the emails after receiving a congressional subpoena from the House Select Committee on Benghazi on March 4, 2015. But an August 2016 FBI report on its investigation shows that Trump’s claim has some merit. Let’s take a look at the timeline of relevant events, according to the FBI report. (The most pertinent information is on pages 15-19 of this document.) Feb. 1, 2013: Clinton serves her last day as secretary of state. July 23, 2014: The State Department reaches an agreement with the Benghazi committee about producing records for its investigation into the 2012 attack on a U.S. embassy in the Libyan city. Oct. 28, 2014: The State Department sends an official letter to Clinton’s staff requesting "emails related to their government work." Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, and aide Cheryl Mills oversaw the review of Clinton’s email archives to produce work-related documents to the department. Dec. 5, 2014: Clinton’s team provides 55,000 pages of emails, or about 30,000 individual emails, to the State Department. Mills tells an employee at Platte River Networks, which managed the server, that Clinton does not need to retain any emails older than 60 days. March 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal email account while secretary of state. March 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over all emails from her private server related to the incident in Libya. Between March 25-31, 2015: The Platte River Networks employee has what he calls an "oh s---" moment, realizing he did not delete Clinton’s email archive, per Mills’ December 2014 request. The employee deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit. March 27, 2015: Clinton’s lawyers send a letter to the Benghazi committee saying that the State Department already has the relevant emails, as they were included in the Dec. 5, 2014, turnover. Trump’s timeline is correct. The congressional subpoena came on March 4, 2015, and an employee deleted the emails sometime after March 25, 2015, three weeks later. However, the implication — that Clinton deleted emails relevant to the subpoena in order to avoid scrutiny — is unprovable if not flat wrong. The FBI’s investigation did find several thousand emails among those deleted that were work-related and should have been turned over to the State Department. However, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 2016 statement that the FBI investigation "found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them." Comey added in a later congressional hearing that the FBI learned no one on Clinton’s staff specifically asked the employee to delete the emails following the New York Times story and subpoena. Rather, the employee made that decision on his own. Clinton told the FBI that she did was not involved in deciding whether individual emails should be sent to State Department, nor "did she instruct anyone to delete her emails to avoid complying with FOIA, State or FBI requests for information." Our ruling Trump said, "You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails." Clinton’s staff received a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails March 4. An employee managing her server deleted 33,000 of Clinton’s emails three weeks later. The FBI found no evidence that the emails were deleted deliberately to avoid the subpoena or other requests. Clinton’s team requested for the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena came. They also argued that all the emails that would be relevant to the subpoena had already been turned over to the State Department. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-09941	There are billions of barrels of oil beneath our oceans and in Alaska, and there is ample oil shale in the Rocky Mountain West, but Democrats "say all this American energy is off limits."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/04/john-barrasso/sen-john-barrasso-claims-democrats-against-drillin/	Oil exploration is the subject of a perennial debate in Washington. As gas prices rise during the hotter months, so does the passion to drill for oil in the United States. And once again, Senate Republicans are contending that Democrats oppose domestic drilling. "Even if we double our nation's wind and solar energy, and then double it again, it won't be enough to meet our energy needs," said U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, in the GOP's weekly radio address on May 26. "There are billions of barrels of oil in the outer continental shelf and there's even more in Alaska. There's enough oil shale in the Rocky Mountain West alone to power America for the next 100 years. The Democrats say all this American energy is off limits." We've previously checked claims about the extent of drilling , so in this item we'll be examining whether it is correct to say that Democrats, generally speaking, are against oil drilling in the ocean, in Alaska and in the Western United States. Barrasso's words echo a partisan battle from last summer, when gas prices reached $4 a gallon. House Republicans staged a chamber floor sit-in as a way to pressure Democrats into a debate over offshore drilling, which has been off limits in certain parts of the country. Democrats softened their stance at the end of 2008, when they agreed to let the prohibition expire. It's not the first time Democrats have wavered on energy issues. Around the time that Democrats and Republicans were battling it out over drilling, then-Senator Barack Obama backtracked on his opposition to offshore drilling as well. "My attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise," Obama told the St. Petersburg Times . "If it is part of an overarching package then I am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem." Once in the White House, Obama put the brakes on some Bush-era oil drilling plans, including 77 oil and gas leases in Utah. But the Obama administration nevertheless maintains that drilling will be part of the president's larger plan to expand energy production. And contrary to Barrasso's claim, Democrats have voted to loosen the offshore drilling rules. For example, in 2008, 224 of the 231 House Democrats voted for a bill to fund the government until March 2009 that did not include the drilling moritorium, a ban that has been renewed in annual spending bills since 1982. Only one Senate Democrat, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, voted against the measure. In fact, some Democrats have been advocates for even more domestic drilling. A year ago, Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Kent Conrad — a Republican and a Democrat, respectively — created a bipartisan coalition to advance energy production in the United States. Included in that plan was language that would allow drilling off the Gulf of Mexico, as well as off the coasts of Virginia, North and South Carolina and Georgia so long as their state legislatures agreed. The group included Democrats Evan Bayh, Amy Klobuchar, Blanche Lincoln, Mark Pryor, Ben Nelson, Tom Carper and Ken Salazar. Also among supporters was Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu, a longtime supporter of the oil industry, who said she supported the plan because it would allow the country to "begin to drill for oil and gas on vast tracts of American land using American workers and producing American oil and gas." So, Barrasso is wrong to say that Democrats do not support offshore drilling. Plenty of them have in the past, and still do. In Alaska, the issue is the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, a tract of land that could produce upwards of 16 billion barrels oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Environmentalists fought development in that area, saying oil production would ruin the pristine habitat. Obama has long said he is against drilling in ANWR, and that stance has not changed since he has been in the White House. Democratic lawmakers feel the same, as a 2008 Senate vote on a GOP proposal to open up the refuge to drilling illustrates: Every Democrat except Landrieu voted against the plan. On this point, Barrasso is not so far off. As for oil shale, Democrats have taken a wait-and-see approach. In a 2008 op-ed, then Sen. Ken Salazar summed up an opinion held by many of his fellow Democrats, saying that technology was not nearly advanced enough to exploit the oily rock that lies under Colorado, Utah and other Western states, but that the idea shouldn't be ruled out. "Let's put the horse back in front of the cart and all start pulling in the same direction," wrote Salazar, who is now Obama's Interior Department secretary. "A reckless approach that heightens the risk of an oil shale bust would only set us back." And remember those Bush-era oil shale leases we mentioned earlier? After Obama canceled the former administration's effort to sell off land for oil development, the Interior Department announced that it would issue a new round of leases after getting public comment on the issue. So to review our findings: On offshore drilling, Barrasso is incorrect. Plenty of Democrats have supported finding more oil in our oceans. When it comes to drilling in Alaska, Barrasso is on firmer ground, since it is opposed by all but Landrieu. But on the last point — that Democrats don't support oil shale production — Democrats are cautious but not fully against it. So, all in all, Democrats may not be chanting "drill, baby, drill," but they aren't ruling out the possibility either. Barrasso gets a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05487	"Only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/19/jon-obrien/catholics-choice-president-says-only-14-percent-ca/	On April 11, 2012, the Rhode Island House Judiciary Committee took testimony on several bills focusing on the abortion issue, including one that would require a doctor to show each woman seeking an abortion an ultrasound image of her fetus before the procedure (although the woman wouldn't be required to view it). Jon O'Brien, president of Catholics for Choice, was one of the people who presented written testimony to the committee, which held that bill, and others, for further study. One of the statistics he cited caught our eye: "Only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal." We wondered if the support was really that low. We've looked at public opinion on the abortion question before. On February 12, 2012, we found that in most surveys, more Americans regard themselves as "pro-choice" than "pro-life." But the gap is narrow and has gotten smaller over the years. O'Brien was focusing exclusively on Catholics and only on whether they agree with the Vatican's stance, that abortion should be illegal under any circumstance, not whether they consider themselves "pro-life." The "Respect for Human Life" section of the Catechism of the Catholic Church says, "Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law." When we called O’Brien’s office to ask for his source, Catholics for Choice directed us to its 2009 survey of 923 Catholics who were registered voters, a study conducted by Belden Russonello & Stewart. Only 14 percent said abortion should be illegal in all instances. Another 37 percent said it should be legal in just a few cases, 27 percent said it should be legal in most cases and 21 percent said it should be legal in all cases. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Among the 356 who said they attended Mass frequently, 31 percent said abortion should never be legal. The rate was 6 percent among the 426 who occasionally attend Mass and 3 percent among the 138 who said they never attend. We came across a 2004 Quinnipiac University poll which found that 17 percent of Catholics said abortion should be illegal in all cases while 16 percent said it should be legal in all cases. Quinnipiac asked the same questions in 2009 and found little change among Catholics; 16 percent wanted abortion to be illegal in all instances while 13 percent said it should be legal in all cases. The Pew Research Center has also looked at the question. Its director of survey research, Scott Keeter, sent us the latest survey, of 2,410 adults -- including 532 Catholics -- conducted from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4, 2011. While 16 percent of all respondents said abortion should be illegal in all cases (with a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points), 19 percent of Catholics (with a margin of error of 5 points) felt the same way. And the Knights of Columbus released their own survey, done by Maris in December 2011, in which 14 percent of Catholics said abortion should always be illegal. The same percentage said abortion should be available at any time during a pregnancy. Again, in all the surveys we saw, Catholics split along the same lines as non-Catholics and devout Catholics were more likely to agree with the Vatican stance on the legality of abortion. Here's the summary: Catholics say abortion should be . . . Quinnipiac 2004 Quinnipiac 2009 Catholics for Choice 2009 Pew 2011 Knights of Columbus 2011 Always illegal 17% 16% 14% 19% 14% Mostly illegal 31% 28% 37% 26% N.A. Mostly legal 30% 37% 27% 33% N.A. Always legal 16% 13% 21% 18% 14% Our ruling Jon O'Brien of Catholics for Choice said that "only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal." Two polls, one commissioned by his organization and one commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, support that precise number. Other, independent, polls show a bit more support among Catholics for the church's official position, but not a lot, unless the question is posed to the most devout. O'Brien offered a very specific number, without qualifiers. He is very close, especially when you consider that the margin of error grows when such polls pull out the subset of respondents who are Catholic. But because there is some variation, we rate his statement Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-08914	Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal "explicitly voted to fund abortions ..."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/28/erick-erickson/redstatecom-blogger-said-nathan-deal-voted-fund-ab/	The bickering over which Republican candidate for governor is a stronger foe of abortion just won't stop. Last week, Georgia Right to Life accused Karen Handel of supporting abortion if a fetus tests positive for Down syndrome. We gave that claim our lowest rating, Pants on Fire. Now Handel's opponent, Nathan Deal, stands accused of voting to fund abortions while he was a U.S. congressman in 1993. The Deal-Handel runoff is slated for Aug. 10. The winner will face former governor and Democrat Roy Barnes in November. Erick Erickson, an influential blogger and editor of RedState.com, one of the most popular conservative sites on the Web, was the first to make the claim. It appeared Thursday on RedState.com and Erickson's PeachPundit.com, which focuses on state issues. The Macon city councilman supports former Secretary of State Handel's bid. "In Congress, Nathan Deal Voted for Henry Waxman sponsored legislation to give $500 million to Planned Parenthood to pay for actual abortions," he wrote in identical items on RedState.com and PeachPundit posted after 8 p.m. Deal? The candidate who won the endorsement of Georgia Right to Life? He voted to fund abortion with our tax dollars? We fired off an e-mail to Erickson, who replied that the issue has "nothing to do with Nathan Deal who I don't doubt is pro-life." It's more about GRTL's conduct, he said. So we took a look at his blog posts. The earliest item we located was "Georgia Right To Life Supports Candidate Who Voted For Major Abortion Funding," which was posted on PeachPundit.com at 8:14 p.m. An identical one appeared on RedState.com at 8:24 p.m. "Hypocrisy, thy name is Georgia Right to Life," the post began. It then stated a few paragraphs later that Deal voted for the Waxman legislation. Waxman is a Democratic congressman who represents portions of the Los Angeles area. Planned Parenthood runs family planning clinics, some of which perform abortions. Monday, Erickson wrote a 5 a.m. post that repeated the claim. "Deal explicitly voted to fund abortions," it said. Deal voted for the Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives but not the Senate. It never became law. It was an authorization bill, which is a kind of legislation that establishes or re-establishes a government agency or program. It also recommends how much money should be spent on it. This bill would have re-established the Title X program of the Public Health Service Act, which has funded family planning services such as providing birth control since 1970. The beneficiaries are mostly poor women. A portion of those funds go to Planned Parenthood clinics. Title X was authorized in another bill that passed. Amounts set by authorization bills are not binding. The feds don't cut any checks until another type of legislation, an appropriations bill, passes the House and Senate. So the 1993 bill didn't really fund anything at all, much less abortions. Furthermore, the bill had nothing to do with "actual abortions." Title X explicitly states that "none of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." This has been the rule since the program began. If a clinic that receives Title X funding also performs abortions, it must make sure none of that federal money goes to those services. For instance, if women getting abortions share a waiting room with those who receive federally funded family planning services, the clinic can't bill the government for the entire cost of running the waiting room. It must subtract the proportion that goes to pay for patients waiting for abortion services. Whether the 1993 bill was anti-abortion is debatable, said Mary Harned, staff counsel for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group. That year, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order rescinding what was called the "gag rule," which prohibited clinics from discussing the option of abortion with patients. This bill would have made it more difficult for a subsequent administration to reinstate the rule. Deal received 90 percent and 94 percent ratings from the anti-abortion group National Right to Life during the latter half of the 1990s, which means he supported its agenda almost all the time. It's likely that Deal would not have voted for a similar bill later in his career in Congress, a campaign spokesman said. He has since come to believe that if the federal government provides any funding for Planned Parenthood, it frees up their funds for pro-abortion efforts. During his last two terms in Congress, Deal received 100 percent ratings from National Right to Life. Erickson's claim crumbles in the face of the facts. The Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993 didn't fund anything. What it would have done was re-authorize a federal family planning program that is explicitly barred from funding abortions. Funding for actual abortions was never up for debate, and the bill never passed. Erickson earns a False.

pomt-00593	The USA Freedom Act undercuts privacy because "the phone records will be in the hands of the phone companies with hundreds of people available to look at the records, versus 20 or 30 people in the government."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/04/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-freedom-act-means-less-privacy-phon/	Soon, the government will no longer be able to accumulate Americans’ phone records in bulk. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says this doesn’t settle any concerns over privacy. On June 2, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which altered parts of the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law passed soon after 9/11. The most significant aspect of the Freedom Act is that it effectively ends the National Security Agency’s bulk phone records collection program, made public by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013. Graham, also a presidential candidate, was not present for the final vote on the bill. But in a CNN interview he gave from Manchester, N.H. he said he opposes the Freedom Act and would have preferred to keep the Patriot Act as is. "The (metadata) provisions I don't like at all," Graham said of the Freedom Act in a June 2 interview with Jake Tapper. "Basically, you've undercut privacy now. All of the records will be in the hands of the phone company with hundreds of people available to look at the records versus 20 or 30 people in the government. So I think the (metadata) program has been undermined in terms of the (USA) Freedom Act, and quite frankly, we've told the enemy so much about it, I'm not sure it works anymore." We took a look into Graham’s claim that because of the Freedom Act, hundreds of phone company employees will now have access to the phone records, as opposed to just a couple dozen government employees currently. But here’s the rub: The phone companies have always held this data, and the new law doesn’t change that. As it always was Prior to the Freedom Act, major cell phone providers like Verizon, AT&T and Sprint would steadily hand over all of their phone records to the NSA, which maintains a massive database. The records include information like the location of a call, phone numbers involved and the length of the call, but not the content or audio. Intelligence workers can then run a phone number with terrorist ties through the database to find out who they called and when. Even without the content, phone records metadata can reveal significant information about a person. Government officials have said there are tight restrictions on who can access the database, with Justice Department oversight. Officially, only 22 NSA analysts are allowed to approve a database query, and only 33 can actually access the database. This is the "20 or 30 people in the government" Graham references. (The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology privacy advocacy group, told us that some people dispute these figures, but they are the best figures we have.) The Freedom Act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies. If the government wants to look at a suspected terrorist’s call data, they must get a court warrant first. So in six months, when agencies have implemented the new law, will hundreds of phone companies employees have access to this data who didn’t before? Well, no. The Freedom Act doesn’t change much for phone companies in terms of how they maintain their records, so there is no reason to believe the law would dramatically increase the number of employees with access to the data. "Cellular service providers have always had access to cellular metadata," said Stephen Wicker, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell University. "The expiration of various provisions of the Patriot Act has simply eliminated the authority under which the government requested the data from the service providers." Phone companies hold onto these records, in some cases for several years, for business purposes. Per FCC regulations, phone service companies can only access these records with the customer’s permission or if required by law, such as providing information to aid a criminal investigation. We weren’t able to pin down the number of employees who can lawfully access the records. We reached out to Verizon, AT&T and Sprint, and none were able to give us a head count. But with about 175,000 employees at Verizon alone, it very well might be in the hundreds. Phone companies have customer service operators who can access an individual record to provide clients information about their account, and they have teams of lawyers who handle records requests for law enforcement. And an engineer might access the anonymous metadata for planning cell tower placement and optimizing coverage. A spokesman for Verizon, the largest wireless communications service provider, said the company will not increase the number of employees with access to the records. "Verizon takes seriously its commitment to protecting its customers’ privacy, and we have strict protocols that limit access to customer data unless there is a specific business purpose to do so," said Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden. "No additional Verizon employees will need access to those records as a result of the change in law." Graham’s office told us that while phone companies will have the same access to all the data now as they did before, there are other privacy concerns, such as the fact that phone companies will now know things like which phone numbers the NSA is interested in. The Freedom Act does not create any new database for phone companies or require them to keep any information they don’t already keep, though it does require the companies to standardize their records for ease of cross-referencing between carriers, said Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, who called Graham’s claim "bizarre." One might find cause for concern in the possibility that the new system would allow phone company employees to access other companies’ metadata, said Timothy Edgar, a fellow at Brown University’s Watson Institute and a former director of privacy and civil liberties at the White House under President Barack Obama. If the NSA wants to see all the calls connected to a phone number associated with terrorism, that might include calls to numbers belonging to other service providers. But the ideal system would have security measures that would ensure that employees wouldn’t be able to access other companies’ information while still providing the NSA with a full picture, he added. "I see very little prospect that the NSA queries of phone records held under the USA Freedom Act would result in more people having access to phone records than under the NSA bulk collection program," Edgar said. Our ruling Graham said that because of the USA Freedom Act, "the phone records will be in the hands of the phone companies with hundreds of people available to look at the records, versus 20 or 30 people in the government." The premise of Graham’s statement is incorrect. Many phone service company employees already have access to their company’s phone records, and the law doesn’t increase that number. Currently, the phone companies keep their own records, and the NSA collects these records in bulk. The new law eliminates the NSA bulk collection program, but it does not affect how the companies themselves maintain their records, other than some standardization measures. The law does not cause the phone records to change hands, nor does it create new databases or record-keeping systems. We rate Graham’s claim False.

pomt-09303	In 2004, "20 percent of U.S. households were getting about 75 percent of their income from the federal government. ... Another 20 percent were receiving almost 40 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/21/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-federal-dole-statistics-omit-important-/	In a recent speech, Paul Ryan, top Republican on the House Budget Committee, made the case that President Barack Obama's policies are only making people more reliant on federal assistance. He used recent passage of the health care overhaul to make his case to the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs on March 31, 2010. "A growing centralized bureaucracy will provide for everyone's needs, care for everyone's health, direct everyone's career, arrange everyone's important private affairs, and work for everyone's pleasure," the Wisconsin congressman said. "The only hitch is, government must be the sole supplier of everyone's happiness ... the shepherd over this flock of sheep." Even before Obama entered office, citizens were getting too much help from the government, Ryan contends. According to a 2007 report by the Tax Foundation, he said, in 2004, "20 percent of U.S. households were getting about 75 percent of their income from the federal government. In other words, one out of five families in America is already government dependent. Another 20 percent were receiving almost 40 percent of their income from federal programs, so another one in five has become government reliant for their livelihood." Ryan went on to say that more families are supporting themselves "plus - through government - supplying or supplementing the incomes of... other households. As a permanent arrangement, this is individually unfair, politically inequitable, and economically dangerous." On Ryan's latter point, we checked a similar claim made by Sen. John McCain during the presidential campaign. He said that "50 percent or 40 percent of the American people — of taxpayers — American citizens don't pay taxes, federal income taxes," a statement we found to be Mostly True. Ryan adds a new dimension to McCain's previous claim, that many people are making much of their income off the government, and we wondered if he's correct. The Tax Foundation report in question looks at data collected between 1991 and 2004. It concluded that in 2004, the federal government's "effective spending rate," or the percentage of household income received from the government, on the poorest households that Ryan refers to in his statement was about 74.5 percent. The federal government's effective spending rate on the second poorest group of households was 38.7 percent. Those figures include benefits from Medicare and Medicaid, housing services, Social Security and welfare programs. We ran Ryan's quote by one of the authors of the report, Gerald Prante, who made two important points. First, he noted that the effective spending rates are an average. So, for instance, some households in the bottom 20 percent are getting more than 75 percent of their income from the government, but some are getting less, he explained. So, it's incorrect to say that each family in that bottom 20 percent is making 75 percent of their income from the government. The same holds true for the second quintile that Ryan also references. More importantly, Prante pointed out that the figure Ryan cited also includes federal spending on public goods -- resources that benefit everyone including national defense, natural resources, and so on. "While technically defense spending could be counted as adding to one's income, broadly defined, the hint that this is all transfer spending is incorrect," he wrote to us in an e-mail. "Part of that 75% is defense spending 'received' by low-income people." In fact, another table in the report shows that, excluding effective federal spending rates on public goods, the poorest households get about 56 percent of their income from the government and households in the second lowest income bracket get about 27 percent of their income from the government. In an e-mail, Angela Kuck, Ryan's Budget Committee's spokeswoman also mentioned that the income from the government drops when you subtract spending for national defense and other costs that all U.S. citizens share. Ryan left out this important detail. Still, although the numbers he cites are arguably inflated, that doesn't negate his underlying point -- that many people are getting a significant amount of their income from the government. But there is another weakness in Ryan's statistics. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, pointed out that the study includes elderly people, who draw heavily on government support in the form of Medicare and Social Security. "Do we want to include the elderly in this picture? Is Social Security a pure transfer? It's not like it's free money," because people spend their whole life paying taxes into those programs, Williams said. The report is pretty up front about that fact. High spending rates in the lowest income brackets are "largely driven by spending on government transfer payments to elderly households — many of whom reside in the lower income quintiles — and other government aid to low income households. Nevertheless, when spending on Medicare and Social Security are removed, lower income households still benefit more from the government than higher income households." So, where does that leave Ryan's claim? It is true that many people get assistance from the government, and many of them are in the lowest income brackets, but Ryan has cherry-picked numbers from the report and omitted crucial information about what the figures represent. The percentage of households getting 75 percent of their income from the federal government is an average; some get more and some get less. Also, a significant chunk of that federal spending is on public goods that benefit every member of society. And a notable number of people who get the most assistance are the elderly receiving benefits they paid for earlier in life. As a result, we find Ryan's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10106	On supporting the Supreme Court abortion decision Roe v. Wade	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/22/john-mccain/mccain-abortion-record-is-consistent/	Back during the Republican primaries, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney accused John McCain of flip-flopping on abortion. Romney was actually defending his own changes of position by arguing that other politicians change position, too. "(McCain) said he was opposed to overturning Roe v. Wade. Now he's for overturning Roe v. Wade," Romney said in April 2007. The charge stems from remarks McCain made on the campaign trail when he was running for president in 1999. McCain had answered written questionnaires saying he opposed Roe v. Wade, but when the San Francisco Chronicle and CNN asked him about it that year, McCain said, "I'd love to see a point where it (the court ruling) is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short-term, or even the long-term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations." Anti-abortion Republicans immediately criticized the statement, and McCain aides started backpedaling, noting that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase “even in the long term.” McCain said in an interview a few months later, “I clearly misspoke there. I’m a person who’s made mistakes in this campaign, and I’ll continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, of 17 years of pro-life. I continue to hold that position, and I … continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was a very flawed decision, as in the opinion of most experts.” In South Carolina in 2007, McCain said, “I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.” His Web site also reiterates that stance. "John McCain believes Roe vs. Wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned, and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench," the Web site states. "Constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of Roe vs. Wade, returning the abortion question to the individual states." We find McCain's brief remark of support falls well short of a full-fledged change in position. His voting record on abortion appears to be solidly anti-abortion, though he differs with some anti-abortion advocacy groups on the issues of campaign finance reform and stem cell research, which he supports. On the Flip-O-Meter scale, we rate McCain's position on Roe v. Wade as a No Flip.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-22T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['None']
pomt-02132	"Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/may/08/blog-posting/florida-democrats-just-voted-impose-sharia-law-wom/	In the final days of Florida’s legislative session, some conservative blogs claimed that they had unearthed the "real" war on women -- a war being waged by Democrats. "Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women," read one headline April 30, 2014, on WesternJournalism.com, a blogging platform for "conservative, libertarian, free market and pro-family writers." The story explained: "Anyone who isn’t certain that Democrats are devoted to destroying America need only take a look at their despicable conduct in the Florida Senate. In a vote that never should have had to be taken, every single Democrat voted to force Sharia law on the people of Florida. By doing so, they placed women and children in very real danger. The vote was 24 votes for America and 14 votes for al-Qaida and the Taliban cast by loathsome Democrats." The article said that elements of Sharia law include women being barred from voting, forced marriages for young girls, stoning to death of adulterous women and a requirement that women wear burqas -- the full-body clothing required of women in some very traditional Islamic societies -- when in public. While we were distracted by the close of the legislative session and a hotly contested governor’s race, we somehow missed Democrats voting in favor of burqas and stoning. But readers have made clear to us that they want to know: Did Florida Democrats vote to impose Sharia law on women? What the bill was about It's important to note that claims that "Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women" are wrong on many levels -- the first of which is that Democratic lawmakers didn't vote affirmatively for doing any of those things. They voted against a bill that would have barred the use of foreign laws in some contexts, something far more limited. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation. At root of the Florida issue is a dispute between a Tampa Islamic center and some of its ousted trustees. In making a ruling on the case in March 2011, a circuit court judge cited Islamic law, sparking outcry from conservatives. That month, two Republican state lawmakers, Sen. Alan Hays and Rep. Larry Metz, announced they would push for a bill to ban foreign law in Florida courts. After several failed efforts, the bill that passed this year -- Senate Bill 386, "Application of Foreign Law in Courts" -- was watered down compared to previous versions. The bill doesn’t specifically mention Sharia law, and it doesn’t outright ban the use of Sharia law, said Eduardo Palmer, a Coral Gables lawyer who serves on the legislative committee of the Florida Bar’s international law section. But much of the discussion centered on Sharia law. The bill only applies to family-law cases, including divorce, child support and child custody. It doesn’t apply to other areas of law, such as corporate matters. The bill states "A court may not enforce: (a) A choice of law provision in a contract selecting the law of a foreign country which contravenes the strong public policy of this state or that is unjust or unreasonable. ... The purpose of this section is to codify existing case law, and that intent should guide the interpretation of this section." The law allows a judge to agree to apply foreign law as long as it doesn’t contradict public policy in the U.S. For example, if a couple signed a prenuptial agreement in Argentina and later gets a divorce in Florida, a Miami judge could decide to apply Argentina’s law in the divorce case here, Palmer said. But if a foreign law violated our public policy in the United States about child labor rules, for example, then a judge could reject it. "That is the universal standard that most civilized countries adhere to," Palmer said. In reality, the bill doesn’t change existing law, which already allowed judges such discretion. An earlier version would have been much more aggressive -- it would have raised the standards before a judge could have allowed the use of foreign law. A compromise essentially codified existing law. The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which tracks and counters anti-Islamic attacks, and Florida’s Anti-Defamation League, a group that fights anti-Semitism, both lobbied against the bill. Legislators who voted against the bill argued that it was unnecessary and was tantamount to an attack on Muslims. Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, told the House "This bill, this proposal, stems directly from a hatred of Muslims. It's caught on across the country and many other state legislatures have dealt with this, and I find it reprehensible." Waldman called the bill "a solution in search of a problem." A Florida Senate staff analysis in April stated there were six states that currently had laws restricting foreign law in state courts: Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. (An amendment approved by Oklahoma voters that expressly banned Sharia law was ruled unconstitutional, prompting Legislatures to later go with the more generic "foreign law.") The Senate approved the bill 24-14, with all the votes in opposition coming from Democrats. The House approved the bill 78-40, with a majority of Democrats voting "no." (House Democrats who voted "yes" included Daphne Campbell of Miami, Betty Reed of Tampa and Hazelle Rogers of Lauderdale Lakes.) As of May 6, Scott had not signed it into law yet and a spokesman said his office would review the bill. How common and controversial is the use of foreign law in Florida courts? International law experts told us it’s not unusual for foreign law to get used in Florida courts. "Foreign law is applied all the time, in various ways, and it is almost never controversial," said C. Ryan Reetz, a Miami lawyer and chair of the Florida Bar’s international section. For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country’s law to govern their agreements. "In addition, there is an entire body of law called 'conflict of laws' or 'choice of laws' that governs when the law of a different state or foreign country will be applied to one or more issues in the case," Reetz said. "As in all other states, the Florida courts have developed a series of conflict of laws rules that address this question. This body of law dates back to the founding of our country, and it has been especially well-documented over the last 100 years." In contracts, parties can choose to apply the law of any jurisdiction and the court will accept those laws as long as it doesn’t conflict with our Constitution, said Cyra Akila Choudhury, Florida International University law professor who wrote a paper about states passing anti-Sharia laws. "The Hillsborough case that is referred to was a contract case in which both parties chose shari'ah as the law," she said. "And the court had to give it credence as the freely chosen legal rules by which the contract was to be interpreted. It was no different than if they had chosen German law, or Klingon law." The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida opposed the bill, although spokesman Baylor Johnson said the final version "has relatively little impact on existing law." "Just like some folks think that tinfoil hats will protect you from the imaginary threat of aliens reading your thoughts, the ‘foreign law’ bill won’t protect against the imaginary threat of ‘Sharia law’ taking over Florida, because that threat isn’t real," Johnson said. Our ruling Claims like this one recently circulated on the internet: "Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women." Senate Democrats did vote against a bill that prohibits judges from applying foreign law in family-law cases if it contradicts United States public policy. In reality, though, the bill would have essentially codified existing practice. The bill didn’t single out Sharia law, and the United States Constiution still applies. It’s ridiculous -- beyond ridiculous, really -- to suggest that Senate Democrats forced on women such elements of Sharia law as burqa-wearing and stoning to death.

pomt-07475	"A DWI costs $17,000."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/15/texas-department-transportation/txdot-billboard-says-dwi-costs-you-17000/	Along Austin’s Barton Springs Road, home to a stretch of restaurants and drinking establishments, we spotted this head-wrencher on a billboard March 16: "A DWI costs $17,000." Really? A web site listed on the ad, whosdrivingtonight.com, led us to an online video depicting in Twitter and Facebook posts and text messages a Central Texas woman’s Sept. 17 arrest for driving while intoxicated. The video suggests the incident resulted in 12 hours in jail, two years’ probation, 100 hours of community service, drug and alcohol education classes and the loss of her driver’s license. The person, identified as Jessica, also loses her significant other and then her job after her boss requests a meeting about recent absences. Entries from a checkbook register show a pile-up of costs including vehicle towing, bail bonds, attorney fees and court costs. Near the video’s end, the account balance is shown as negative $17,422.60. Take-home message: "Designate a driver." Chasing back-up online, we found an Aug. 16, 2010, press release from the Texas Department of Transportation stating: "Convicted first-time DWI offenders can pay a fine of up to $2,000, lose their driver’s license for up to a year, and serve 180 days in jail. Safety officials say other costs associated with an impaired driving arrest and conviction can add up to more than $17,000 for bail, legal fees, court appearances, court-ordered classes, vehicle insurance increases, and other expenses." The release continues: "Of course, the consequences of driving under the influence can be much worse. In 2009, the latest year of compiled statistics, there were 27,108 alcohol-related crashes in Texas that resulted in 955 deaths and 17,542 injuries (preliminary data)." There’s no discounting the seriousness of drunken driving and its consequences. Still, we wondered how the state reached the $17,000 figure. Tracie Mendez, TxDOT’s driver behavior program manager, guided us to Austin-based Sherry Matthews Advocacy Marketing, which forwarded the summary of a 2006 study it commissioned from an Austin firm, NuStats, on TxDOT’s behalf. Cost estimates were reached, the summary says, based on June 2006 interviews of 30 people. They included a representative of the Texas Department of Public Safety and five DWI offenders plus prosecutors, county clerks and defense attorneys in 15 of the state’s most populous counties including Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis, Williamson and Hays.. The summary notes that because individual counties set their own court costs and other fees, "these costs vary throughout the state." Across Texas, the summary states, the "total costs of a DWI arrest and conviction range from $5,000 to $24,000 for a first-time offense." In the Austin area, offenders can pay $6,000 to $21,000 in fines, fees and other costs. Nowhere does the summary specify an average statewide cost--and it cautions against overreaching conclusions. A footnote states: "Due to the qualitative nature of this study, the interpretation of the results is subject to the limitations of the study parameters. While the findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the costs associated with a first-offense arrest and conviction for DWI, the results are not quantifiable." Further, the figures "are not meant to be interpreted as complete and exact." In interviews and e-mails, we fielded different explanations of the $17,000 figure from Matthews’ representatives and one executive, Janet Lea, confirmed that the the online video didn’t reflect an actual event; Jessica is not a real person. Lea also said Clay Abbott of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association had expressed comfort with the $17,000 figure. Abbott, a former prosecutor and defense lawyer, told us he’s a paid consultant to TxDOT and helped the Matthews agency brainstorm and analyze the research. He said his association duties entail training prosecutors and police officers on DWI issues. Abbott confirmed that he endorsed the $17,000 figure, though he also said the high-end attorney fees that showed up in the study struck him as too high. Abbott said he’d be more comfortable with an ad saying a DWI costs up to $24,000, the highest cost figure identified. Yet, he said, "I know attorneys here in town who are really good who would charge a whole lot less ... and not decrease the effectiveness of your counsel." Robert Nash, spokesman for the Matthews' firm, said by e-mail the billboard figure was based on an average of the highest costs for a DWI reported in each of the six studied regions. The actual average approaches $19,200. But "we decided to reduce the amount to $17,000 since not everyone will pay the maximum," Nash said. Mia Zmud, NuStats’ research director, said by e-mail that the research consisted of "structured in-depth interviews" and was not a survey. "As you point out, because of the qualitative nature of the research methodology conducted for this study, the report does not offer a definitive amount," Zmud said. "However, given that the research was conducted 5 years ago, and the costs have likely gone up, not down," $17,000 is a "plausible figure." Separately, we averaged the low-end costs for the regions, getting $6,750. When we averaged the high-end and low-end averages, we got $12,958. Informed of these calculations, Nash said: "We chose to use a number closer to the higher end -- more persuasive." Nash continued: "Our campaign materials refer to the cost of a DWI without specifically calling it out as a first offense. If someone is arrested and convicted for a second or even third time, the fine alone increases substantially. Not factored in our $17,000 are the auxiliary costs of loss of job or time off from work, loss of driver’s license/transportation, the scram device, the big hike in auto insurance rates for teens" and so on. He said too that the $17,000 figure also didn’t include lost income, counseling charges and alternate transportation modes. "However you choose to look at it, a DWI conviction is expensive, whether we believe it’s $17,000, or you prefer another price. If only one person pays $17,000 for a DWI, saying DWI costs $17,000 is a true statement," Nash said. Separately, we shared the study summary with Austin lawyer Sam Bassett, who said by e-mail that he typically charges $5,000 if a DWI case doesn’t go to a jury and up to $10,000 if it does. Abbott told us fines, set at a judge’s discretion, run from several hundred dollars to $2,000, as they did in 2006. We also asked Michael Mahometa, a University of Texas statistician, to analyze the study results’ summary. Mahometa said the sample size was too small for anyone to declare statewide cost figures. "The report was never devised to find how much, on average, are the costs of DWI," he said. Mahometa said an alternative methodology would have been to subtract the $4,792 standard deviation among the regions’ high-end cost totals from the high-end cost average of $19,167, getting $14,375. Yet, he warned by e-mail, a "better measure would be the average for each region," information not in the study summary. Another wrinkle: Since the study was "a snapshot of 'clean' DWIs - no collision, and no injuries... actual cost (if there was a collision or injury) would actually be higher than the $17,000," Mahometa said. So, how to park this puppy? Our conclusion is the research on which the billboard was based doesn’t justify the flat statement that a DWI costs $17,000. Still, it’s undisputed that some DWI cases can cost defendants a bundle--presumably including costs sometimes adding up to $17,000. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01461	"[When I was mayor] Providence was one of the five renaissance cities of America, according to USA Today in those days. Money magazine said it was the fifth best city to live in in America. In addition to that, All Cities Almanac said in 1994, I believe, that it was the safest city in America."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/02/vincent-buddy-cianci/cianci-says-when-he-was-mayor-providence-was-named/	During Tuesday’s debate among the three candidates for mayor of Providence, Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. responded to criticism about his past criminal record, saying, "I can tell you, I’ve made mistakes." He then pivoted, pointing to positive achievements during his two stints in City Hall, the most recent of which ended in 2002 after a conviction for federal racketeering conspiracy. "But there were no mistakes in the area of developing the City of Providence, creating jobs, when I was mayor," Cianci, an independent, said in the forum sponsored by The Providence Journal and WPRI-TV. "Providence was one of the five renaissance cities of America, according to USA Today in those days. Money magazine said it was the fifth best city to live in in America. In addition to that, All Cities Almanac said in 1994, I believe, that it was the safest city in America." While such ratings are notable mostly for their public relations value, it’s still quite a collection of accolades for Rhode Island’s capital. We decided to check if they were all true. Let’s go down the list, starting with USA Today. We found a 1996 story from The Journal on USA Today’s selection of Providence as one of America’s "renaissance cities." The Dec. 31, 1996, edition of USA Today profiled Providence as part of a series on cities that had revitalized themselves through "bold and creative approaches," according to The Journal story. The USA Today story chronicled the city’s efforts to preserve its historic landmarks and launch new development initiatives, including the creation of Waterplace Park. The newspaper credited Cianci for Providence’s renewal, according to The Journal. What about Money Magazine and its annual list of the best places to live in America? In 2000, Portland, Ore., was rated the best in the nation, but Providence was one of four regional winners, according to The Journal. The city was named best place to live in the East. It’s worth noting that Cianci wasn’t always happy with Money’s "best places to live" list. After Providence was ranked a lowly 136th out of 300 cities in 1995, Cianci complained in an Op-Ed in The Journal that Money "failed to take into account Providence's resurgence, renewal, ambiance and amenities." (Providence dropped to 198th on the list in 1996 and 240th in 1997. The format for the rankings subsequently changed.) On to the "safest city" claim. This is based on a 1994 story in Parade magazine, according to a Journal story from that year. For the Parade story, John Tepper Marlin, author of the 1992 book "The Livable Cities Almanac," looked at statistics for murder rates, robberies, auto fatalities, overall death rates, air pollution and infant mortality rates. He concluded that Honolulu, Hawaii, was number one and that Providence was number two -- or safest in the continental United States. At the time, critics of the survey pointed out that it looked at only a limited number of factors, not all crime-related. But Cianci was undeterred. "This is really and truly something we as a community can be proud of, and we can brag about it," Cianci said at the time. And he still is. Our ruling In the debate with Democrat Jorge Elorza and Republican Daniel Harrop, Cianci said that Providence was described as a renaissance city during his most recent stint in office and that it was also rated the safest city in America and one of the best places to live. The details are a bit off on a couple of those claims -- where they were made, the actual ranking -- but Cianci is pretty much on the mark. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04285	Says Jim Renacci has "consistently voted" for loopholes that "encourage outsourcing of our jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/02/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-claims-jim-renacci-consistently-suppo/	From President Barack Obama on down to congressional candidates, Democrats this election season are decrying tax loopholes they say benefit companies that move jobs overseas. They cast themselves as protectors of the worker and Republicans as enablers of outsourcing. Of course in politics it’s never quite so simple. Take U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton. The Democrat from Copley Township faces U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, in one of only two battles of House incumbents this November. They are fighting for Ohio’s 16th District, which encompasses parts of western Cuyahoga County and parts of five other counties to the south. At a debate Oct. 10, 2012, at the City Club of Cleveland, Sutton moved quickly to tag Renacci with the outsourcer label. Asked about the role of government in creating jobs, Sutton talked of sponsoring legislation to promote the use of U.S. goods in infrastructure projects. Then she shifted into attack mode. "We can also close those loopholes that my opponent has consistently voted for that encourage outsourcing of our jobs and stop ... continuing to support bad trade deals, as my opponent has voted for three bad trade deals that are not going to serve Ohio well in the future," she said. Renacci took exception to the loophole part of the claim. "I’d love for her to tell me one of those loopholes she’s talking about," he said a minute later after answering another question from moderator Mike McIntyre of The Plain Dealer. "I don’t know what those deductions are to send jobs overseas, those loopholes. I’d love to hear it someday." PolitiFact Ohio was curious, too. By way of background, corporate tax rates overseas are typically lower than those in the United States. U.S.-based multinational companies must also pay domestic taxes on foreign profits, but not until they return -- or repatriate -- those earnings to their home country. And many companies, through keen accounting and reinvestment abroad, make sure that never happens. The practice is known as deferral. We found a good primer on this subject posted by Howard Gleckman, editor of TaxVox, a blog from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Let’s also quickly address terminology. A recent item from our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin was helpful here. They note that, as defined by the National Academy of Public Administration, outsourcing is the contracting out of services domestically or internationally. When a company shifts "service and manufacturing activities abroad to unaffiliated firms or their own affiliates," that’s called off shoring. What Sutton described seems to fit more under the off shoring, but "outsourcing" is recognized as a catch-all. With that out of the way, let’s examine Renacci’s record. As Exhibit A, Sutton campaign spokesman Anthony DeAngelo offered the Republican budget proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, whom GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has tapped as his running mate. Ryan’s budget sought in part to move toward what’s known as a territorial tax system. Such a system would lift U.S. taxes on foreign profits, meaning that a multinational corporation would not have to pay taxes on overseas earnings it repatriates. Renacci voted in favor of the Republican budget and against the Democratic alternative, offered as an amendment to Ryan’s proposal. The Democratic plan failed in the Republican-controlled House. Ryan’s budget was later blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate. DeAngelo also pointed to Renacci’s vote in favor of the Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act of 2012. This also would have moved the U.S. toward territorial taxation. The bill passed the House in August on a largely party-line vote but has not been taken up by the Senate. Proponents of territorial taxation, including Renacci, argue that it would level the playing field with other countries and encourage repatriation. Opponents worry that the system will make it even more enticing for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. Gleckman legitimized these fears, noting that "such a shift might encourage some domestic companies to move more of their operations -- and shift both jobs and more reported income -- to low tax countries." PolitiFact Wisconsin weighed in on a similar claim by AFSCME. The large public-employees union said in a television ad that U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." AFSCME pointed to Thompson’s stated support of the Ryan budget as back-up. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the statement Half True, stressing the following points: Researchers differ on whether U.S. employment would decline under this "territorial" tax approach, with some arguing that businesses would invest more at home as a result of the tax break. And part of Thompson’s plan provides incentives that could convince companies to bring profits back home. Renacci has proposed a plan similar to Thompson’s. But before we get to that, let’s first let’s look at other votes the Sutton campaign cites in defense of the congresswoman’s claim. In September 2011, Renacci supported the Protecting Jobs from Government Interference Act. The bill, according to the New York Times, stemmed from the National Labor Relations Board’s efforts to block Boeing from opening a South Carolina plant. Republicans produced legislation that would have prevented the board from taking such action. Democrats called it the "Outsourcers Bill of Rights" and argued it would make it easier to shift jobs overseas. And in April, Renacci voted against a package of Democratic amendments to the Small Business Tax Cut Act. One amendment sought to ban tax deductions for companies that have more jobs overseas than in the U.S. This "motion to recommit" failed on a near party-line vote. DeAngelo cited other votes, but some were procedural -- not an up or down vote on an actual bill -- and others didn’t directly address the off-shoring issue Sutton raised at the City Club debate. PolitiFact Ohio found the Ryan budget, the Fairer Tax Code Act, the labor bill and the package of amendments to be the most relevant when evaluating Sutton’s statement at the City Club. As a side note, we have noted before that legislators often face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation. Finally, it’s important to consider a piece of information that even DeAngelo acknowledged: Renacci last November introduced the Returning Investment to America Act. The proposal, backed by two Democratic co-sponsors, aims to incentivize the repatriation of profits made by U.S. companies overseas. Renacci’s bill would relax taxes on these earnings when companies bring them back to the U.S. -- if the companies pour the money into expanded domestic operations or payroll. "American companies have roughly $1.4 trillion in foreign earnings sitting overseas, not being invested in the U.S. economy," one of the Democratic co-sponsors, U.S. Rep. John Carney of Delaware, said for Renacci’s news release. "With high unemployment and a struggling economy, this bipartisan legislation incentivizes companies to bring that money back to the U.S. to reinvest and hire new workers. There are strict mechanisms in place to ensure that only money being used to increase payroll or purchase new assets is eligible for the lower tax rate." In other words, the bill would do the opposite of what Sutton has accused Renacci of supporting. The legislation was sent to the House Ways & Means Committee but never made it to a vote. So where does this leave the congresswoman’s statement? Sutton said that Renacci "consistently voted" for loopholes that "encourage outsourcing of our jobs." The claim is partially accurate, but Sutton’s leaves out important details that would provide key context. Yes, Renacci supports territorial taxation. But researchers are divided on the net effect this would have on U.S. jobs. And Renacci has demonstrated an interest in incentivizing repatriation, introducing legislation of his own legislation toward that end in 2011. This clashes with Sutton’s characterization that he consistently encourages outsourcing. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.

pomt-13094	Roy Blunt "voted to raise his own pay 12 times" while in Congress.	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/06/jason-kander/kander-ad-accusing-blunt-voting-raise-his-pay-misl/	Jason Kander, a Democrat running against Republican Roy Blunt for one of Missouri’s U.S. Senate seats, says his opponent "voted to raise his own pay 12 times" while in Congress. What are the facts behind this claim? Kander provides sources in this document on his website and even provides quotations from the Congressional Research Service. But providing a source doesn’t necessarily make a claim factual. So we took a deeper look into the legislation itself, and how congressional pay raises occur. In 1989, Congress approved an annual cost-of-living adjustment to member’s pay as part of an ethics reform bill. The yearly adjustment percentage is based on private-sector wage changes and is applied automatically unless denied by a congressional statute. This created a system in which members of Congress can receive pay raises without explicitly voting for them on the record. What Blunt did was vote against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment from occurring. Each of the times Blunt is alleged to have increased his pay came between 1997 and 2010, when Blunt was still a member of the House of Representatives for Missouri’s 7th District. Here’s how it breaks down year by year. 1997 Blunt’s first year in Washington was preceded by five consecutive years of Congress voting to not adjust their pay, but that streak would not continue. The Senate and House versions of the 1998 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill (S. 1023 and H.R. 2378, respectively) differed on the inclusion of a pay freeze, with the Senate version supporting no raise. The two chambers agreed to a conference to iron out the differences, with the House voting 229-199 to "order the previous question," which is legalese for ending debate and bringing the measure to an immediate vote. The vote, which Blunt supported, meant that no pay freeze could be added to the bill and sent H.R. 2378 to conference without instructions to stop the automatic pay increase. This led to the Senate wording being dropped from the final bill, which was signed into law on Oct. 10, 1997. Members of Congress’ pay increased 2.3 percent to $136,700. On Oct. 2, 1997, Blunt told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch "I believe keeping the current salary of Congress equal with the rate of inflation is the right thing, and a necessary thing to do to be able to attract people to seek congressional office in the future." 1999 through 2007 From 1999 through 2007, similar actions to those in 1997 were taken in the House to order the previous question before an amendment to stop the pay increase could be proposed. For some of these years, the Congressional Research Service said "it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that Members would have voted to deny a pay increase if they had been given an opportunity," as amendments other than the pay freeze were suggested before the House voted to order the previous question. Some years, however, Representatives made clear their intention to introduce a pay freeze before the vote to order the previous question was taken. Every year from 1999 through 2007, Blunt voted in favor of ordering the previous question. As a result of the automatic increases, the pay of members of Congress increased from $136,700 in 1999 to $169,300 at the start of 2008. 2009 On Feb. 25, 2009, the House voted to add a provision to an omnibus appropriations act that would prohibit the automatic pay adjustment for 2010. Blunt was one of only 24 members of the House to oppose this, with 398 members voting in favor of it. Blunt also voted against the omnibus appropriations act as a whole, but this time was joined by 178 members of the House, with 245 members voting in favor of it. As a result, congressional salaries, including Blunt’s, did not increase. 2010 Well into the recession, bills were being proposed to stop pay adjustments for 2011, instead of just tacking the legislation on as an amendment to a larger bill. Blunt voted in favor of one of these bills, which passed the House 402-15 and went on to become law. So Blunt actually voted against the automatic pay increase in 2010. The vote Kander claims is a vote to increase Blunt’s pay this year comes from the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, which froze the pay of some federal civilian employees for two years. While this isn’t a direct vote on his own pay, the 1989 ethics reform bill, which began the automatic pay increases for members of Congress, specifies that their pay cannot be increased by a higher percentage in a year than that of general schedule employees. So a vote against this could be seen as a vote to protect Congressional pay increases, though it may be even more of a stretch than Kander’s prior claims. While Blunt actually voted in favor of this bill when it was passed in the House 415-3, Kander points to Blunt’s vote against the conference bill, which resolved the differences between the House’s and Senate’s versions of the bill as a vote to increase his own pay. This final version of the bill passed the house 193-165 on Dec. 21, 2010. Our ruling Kander said "Blunt voted to raise his own pay 12 times" while in Congress. This is a misleading attack. Blunt did not literally vote to increase his pay 12 times. He voted in support of measures that could have blocked or limited automatic cost-of-living increases from taking effect. Even all of those cases aren’t clear-cut, as sometimes Blunt sided with efforts to stop the automatic pay increase. Kander’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dbb9976c-3393-4a9a-aade-aed04f05f843	None	Jason Kander	None	None	None	2016-11-06T00:49:07	2016-08-10	['United_States_Congress', 'Roy_Blunt']
pomt-01539	Says U.S. House candidate Carlos Curbelo "supported raising flood insurance rates."	false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/16/joe-garcia/joe-garcia-says-carlos-curbelo-supports-raising-fl/	As thousands of Floridians faced the threat of a massive flood insurance hike in 2014, a deluge of protests from homeowners led Congress to delay some of the heftiest increases. Now U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, says in a Sept. 5 Web ad that his Republican opponent Carlos Curbelo "supported raising flood insurance rates." That’s a serious charge in Garcia’s district, which includes many homeowners in flood-prone Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. A few days later, the Garcia campaign unveiled a TV ad that makes a similar charge that Curbelo would let rates "skyrocket." We dove right in to search for the facts: Has Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates? Federal and state flood insurance laws in 2014 Congress and the Florida Legislature have taken action on flood insurance during the past few years. But Curbelo, a Miami-Dade school board member, hasn’t participated in those votes. Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida in an interview that he does not want to get rid of the National Flood Insurance Program but does agree with a new Florida law that made it easier for private companies to step in. The Garcia campaign argues that Curbelo’s comments during two GOP primary debates show he supports raising flood insurance rates. Curbelo’s statements relate to federal and state bills about flood insurance -- we’ll recap both pieces of legislation. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act of 2012 overhauled the National Flood Insurance Program, which insures more than five million properties nationwide, including about two million in Florida. The bill sought to avoid insolvency for the program -- as of July 2013, it owed about $24 billion. For some policyholders, the bill translated to skyrocketing rates. Residents, well, flooded Congress with complaints, and lawmakers reversed much of their earlier reforms. In March 2014, Obama signed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which lowered the rate increases on some policies and prevented some future increases. The Florida Legislature sought its own solution in 2014. Some private companies were already offering flood insurance, but SB 542 made it easier for them to offer more flexible and potentially cheaper plans. Gov. Rick Scott signed the bill in June, but no new companies have started selling policies, and the vast majority remain through the federal program. Experts predict slow growth in the private sector as it will take time for companies to figure out where they can profitably write policies. "It will take a decade well past this November for the private market to emerge slowly," said Jay Neal, president of the Florida Association for Insurance Reform. The two main companies offering private flood insurance in Florida are currently offering cheaper rates than the federal program, said Richard Koon, Florida’s deputy insurance commissioner. But the situation remains in flux -- the national program is expected to revise rates, and some companies might want to see if Congress will make future changes. Curbelo’s debate statements about flood insurance Flood insurance laws emerged as topics in GOP primary debates in Congressional District 26. Here was part of Curbelo’s statement in the June debate: "Our rates here in this district are going up because of things that are happening in other parts of the country. So like with everything else I am for a market-driven solution. We should allow the private sector to step in. Florida already started doing that because Congress failed to address this issue with its supposed fix that Mr. Garcia is going around town talking about. They failed so the state of Florida stepped in and has encouraged private companies to fill this need. So we should continue allowing that process to grow. And again -- when the market fails and only when the market fails -- the federal government should step in to help." During a debate moderated by CBS4’s Jim DeFede, Curbelo (and all the participating candidates) said they would have voted in favor of the Biggert-Waters fix passed by Congress that capped certain annual increases at 18 percent. Curbelo: "I would have voted yes recognizing that it is a bandaid and that it does not solve the long term-problem." DeFede: "I thought though you had given some comments you didn’t think it was Congress’ place to interfere win the market which is essentially what this is doing by capping the increases." Curbelo: "My position is Congress should not interfere with the market unless the market fails. If the market fails, that’s when government intervention is acceptable." A couple minutes later, Curbelo added some criticisms of the federal program: "Florida is a major donor state. We make investments in infrastructure, we prepare for storms in this state and we don’t get a whole lot of credit for it. Florida shouldn’t be treated unfairly under NFIP and that should have been one of the reforms that Congress passed." (A study concluded that several states, including Florida, pay more into the program than they receive in claims.) Curbelo clearly talked about allowing private companies to provide flood insurance. So how does Garcia reach the conclusion that that would raise rates? Garcia points to news articles that explain that historically the federal program kept rates artificially low for homeowners, while private insurance was prohibitively expensive. But some of the articles also showed that it remains to be seen what will happen in the future as private companies enter the market. The Palm Beach Post wrote in March 2014 that supporters of the state bill "portray it as the start of a new era of more flexible, affordable private options." Evan Hecht, CEO of a Gainesville business representing Lloyd's of London syndicates, told the Wall Street Journal that "the proposed (federal) legislation appears to allow potentially millions of people to continue to pay below-market rates, which the private sector wouldn't want to compete with." But the article also paraphrased Paresh Patel, the chief executive of HCI Group in Tampa as saying "that by carefully selecting homes to cover and pairing the protection with a homeowners' policy, HCI could charge less than the new rates and still make a profit." Our ruling Garcia’s ad says that "Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates." It’s a stretch to imagine a candidate campaigning in Miami and the coastal Keys who would tell voters that he wants to raise their flood insurance bill -- and in reality, Curbelo hasn’t done that. For starters, Curbelo hasn’t taken a vote on federal or state flood insurance. The Garcia campaign says that if Curbelo supports private companies providing flood insurance, that means he supports higher rates. That’s a huge distortion. Curbelo says he supports private companies and in hopes that competition will lower rates. Pushing competitively priced private insurance is not pushing for higher premiums.

pomt-08825	A bill to aid state and local governments "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-state-local-aid-bill-fully-paid-/	On Aug. 10, 2010, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., released a victory-lap press release after her chamber passed a bill to provide $26 billion in aid to states and localities. Pelosi and fellow Democrats touted the bill as a way to save the jobs of 319,000 state and local employees, including teachers and health care workers. Republicans blasted it as more unaffordable stimulus spending and a giveaway to unionized government workers. Ultimately, the bill passed on a near-party-line vote, 247-161, and was quickly signed into law by President Barack Obama. In the news release, Pelosi emphasized that the bill was fiscally responsible. In a series of bullet points, the release said that the bill "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas." It added that the bill "reduces the deficit by $1.4 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office." We wondered about Pelosi's statement that the bill is "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas." So we turned to the official arbiter of the costs of congressional legislation, the Congressional Budget Office. In its cost estimate, CBO backs up the assertion that the bill is "fully paid-for." Specifically, between 2010 and 2019, the bill is estimated to actually reduce the deficit by $3 million. When you add in an additional year -- making the budget window 2010 to 2020 -- the bill would reduce the deficit by $1.371 billion or, rounded up, the $1.4 billion that the Speaker's release refers to. Case closed? Not quite. The release said the bill "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas." That's not the case. According to CBO's analysis, the corporate tax changes in the bill that Pelosi is referring to will amount to $9.8 billion between 2010 and 2020. These are a mix of tax policies that only a CPA could understand, from "rules to prevent splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate" (worth almost $4.3 billion in newly captured revenue) to "denial of foreign tax credit with respect to foreign income not subject to United States taxation by reason of covered asset acquisitions" (worth more than $3.6 billion), to "limitation on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to section 956 inclusions" (worth $704 million). But that $9.8 billion in corporate tax cuts won't cover the full $26 billion cost of the bill. The bulk of the money comes from something Pelosi's office chose not to mention in the press release -- almost $12 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as the food stamp program) beginning in 2014. Another $1.1 billion would come from cuts to advanced refundability of the earned income tax credit starting in 2011. The earned income credit is a tax credit that benefits the working poor. Several billion dollars more would come from a variety of spending cuts known as rescissions. Some of Pelosi's fellow Democrats complained about the cuts on the day of the vote, even though they ultimately chose to support the bill anyway. "I am outraged by a reduction in Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that is used to pay for this measure," said Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. "Those who receive the meager SNAP benefits are the most poor and the most vulnerable in our society." Said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. "Although this legislation is critically needed, I am greatly disappointed that the Senate included as a 'pay-for,' a provision reducing (stimulus)-enacted increases in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, beginning in 2014. SNAP provides vital, short-term support to individuals during their greatest time of need, ensuring that there is food on the table for themselves and their children." In the meantime, because few lawmakers like to vote for cuts to programs that serve poor families, some suggest that the food stamp cuts will be rescinded before they take effect. Indeed, Pelosi, in a fact sheet about the bill, said that "House Democrats will work to restore this funding before the cuts are implemented in 2014." The fact sheet did not indicate how that will be paid for. "Of course, no one believes these cuts will be allowed to take place," said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "This is fantasy land." So Pelosi's news release is highly misleading because it leaves out the fact that almost half the money paying for the bill comes from cuts to a program very popular with Democrats. It's worth noting that Pelosi has taken reporters' questions about the food stamp cuts, and in a floor speech before the vote, Pelosi said in part, "While I don’t support all of the provisions, I am not happy about the taking money from our energy sector or from food stamps, but I hope that we can, Mr. Chairman, make that up in another way." In addition, the fact sheet sent to reporters by Pelosi's office cited the food stamp cuts. So while Pelosi's release was correct in saying the bill was "fully paid-for," it was incorrect to simply say that came from "costly corporate tax loopholes" (though it wouldn't have had much Democratic appeal if she'd added "and cuts to food stamps.") In reality, not even a majority of the money is from corporate tax provisions. If Pelosi had said this during a fast-paced television interview, we'd be willing to cut her some slack, but this description came from a press release written by her office, so they had ample time and space to explain all of the bill's provisions, as they had in fact done in other contexts. So we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06350	"Every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/07/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-average-15-us-factories-close-ea/	With Republicans in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats don’t have the clout they used to. Hampered in their ability to pass legislation, Ohio Democrats like Betty Sutton of Copley Township are using the bully pulpit of the House of Representatives floor to make points. On Oct. 25, 2011, Sutton and a few of her Democratic colleagues spent a half-hour there sounding off on the topic of job creation and the American dream. Sutton took aim at companies that have moved jobs overseas, and the policies that she says encouraged that action. "Many big companies have not created jobs in the U.S. Instead, they’ve taken many of their jobs to countries with the cheapest labor, the least regulations and few employee rights. This flies in the face of the Republicans’ concern that taxes on the rich means fewer jobs," she said. "On that point, every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories," she said. "Yet here on this House floor, those on the other side of the aisle are content in trying to protect the loopholes that ship jobs overseas." Democrats in Washington frequently discuss the nation’s overseas job losses, but PolitiFact Ohio hadn’t before heard a daily factory closure number. So we checked into it. Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo told PolitiFact that her office used databases from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to compute the statistic. The data shows there were 398,887 private manufacturing establishments of all sizes in the United States during the first quarter of 2001. By the end of 2010, the number declined to 342,647, a loss of 56,190 facilities. Over 10 years, that works out to an average yearly loss of 5,619 factories. Dividing that by the 365 days in a year produces a 15.39 average daily number of factories lost. "The congresswoman has always had a very strong focus on revitalizing our manufacturing base and bringing new jobs to Ohio," DeAngelo said. "Because when you look at problems from the deficit on down, a lot of those problems can be remedied, in large part by rebuilding and revitalizing our manufacturing base." Bureau of Labor statistics spokesman Gary Steinberg said Sutton used the correct data to come up with her figure, though her statement would have been more precise if she specified the time period over which the shutdowns occurred. For example, the bureau’s statistics show the nation lost 8,660 factories in 2010, which works out to more than 23 each day that year. The rate was similar in 2009. In 2007 and 2008, roughly 1,500 factories shut down annually, which works out to just four daily closures. DeAngelo said Sutton used the 10-year statistic because it was the most comprehensive number she could find. And while it might have been better if she cited that time period in her speech, her numbers on factory closures add up. "It was a good, comprehensive figure that really showed the depth of our manufacturing crisis in this country and the simple fact that we are losing so many factories and so many jobs every single day over a long period of time," DeAngelo said. It’s worth noting that manufacturing is just one segment of the economy, and that other sectors are adding jobs. For example, the Bureau of Labor statistics employment situation summary for September 2011 showed gains in the health care and professional and business services sectors. Still, a BLS publication called Monthly Labor Review found that manufacturing was one of the hardest hit employment sectors during the last recession, with losses concentrated in the transportation equipment, fabricated metal, machinery, wood product and furniture industries. On the Truth-O-Meter, Sutton’s claim rates True.	None	Betty Sutton	None	None	None	2011-11-07T06:00:00	2011-10-25	['United_States']
pomt-04498	Says Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military hasn’t asked for.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-spend-2-trilllion-military/	With the country facing tough choices on spending and taxes, the defense budget, the largest single area of discretionary spending, plays a special role. In the first of three debates, President Barack Obama tried to pressure Mitt Romney on his defense plans, but the Massachusetts governor did not allow himself to be drawn in. Obama made at least four references to Romney’s goal to greatly ramp up military spending. Each time, he did it in the context of tax policy. "Gov. Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut," Obama said. "On top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for." Romney was happy to rebut the president’s claim about a $5 trillion tax cut but on the military, he said relatively little and he never challenged the president’s number. "We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.," Romney said. "I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military." With both candidates seeking to rein in deficit spending, we thought we should examine whether the governor does want to add $2 trillion in defense spending. Romney lays out his national security policy on his website. There, he warns that restoring the military "will not be a cost-free process," and says he will "begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP." What’s 4 percent worth? The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security, a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate. Does Romney mean it The Romney campaign has an interesting response to questions about proposing this increase at a time when the government has a hard time paying its bills. The staff emphasize that it might take some time to get to the 4 percent mark. While the campaign website describes the goal as "a floor", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it "a target" in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse "Obama-era defense cuts." In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, "That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’ This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that. What the Pentagon is asking for The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military. "We are developing today the Joint Force the Nation will need in 2020," Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. "We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere." Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face. "The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.," Panetta told the budget committee. "We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in." Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said "the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts." The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public. Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military and by and large, the commanders support the plan. "It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this," Bensahel said. Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits. Our ruling The president said Romney planned to increase defense spending by $2 trillion and that was money the military hadn’t asked for. Independent analysts confirm that number, and Romney did not deny it. Military leaders have testified in support of the president’s spending plan, and we found no evidence of disagreement behind the scenes. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02301	The Koch brothers are "the richest people in the world. Individually, they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/02/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-koch-brothers-are-richest-family-w/	For weeks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been using floor speeches to target Charles and David Koch, the industrialist brothers with libertarian political views who have spent generously -- and gotten others to spend generously -- to support conservative candidates and issues. In an April 2, 2014, floor speech, Reid criticized a House budget proposal drawn up by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., saying it reflected the principles of the Koch brothers and would lower taxes on the wealthy. "Is $80 billion of personal wealth for the Koch brothers enough?" Reid asked. "I think most everyone would say yes, it's enough. But not the Koch brothers. They want more. They're the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world." We wondered: Is that correct? Reid’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry for this story, but we were able to find some answers. It’s tricky to say definitively who is richer than who, because of privacy issues and fluctuations in market values. But the longstanding yardstick for measuring the world’s richest people comes from Forbes magazine, which publishes both the Forbes 400 (a list of the 400 richest Americans) and the World’s Billionaires (which tracks more than 1,600 billionaires across the globe). Currently, Charles and David Koch, when measured as individuals, are tied for sixth place on the international list, with $40.7 billion each. Combined, their net worth is $81.4 billion, which is higher than the highest-ranking individual on the list -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates, at $77.8 billion. (A third brother, William, has long been estranged from Charles and David, and media accounts about the brothers’ giving patterns generally do not consider him to be part of the "Koch brothers." William is worth an additional $4 billion.) So are Charles and David Koch No. 1 in the world? They’re close--but not quite. Reid ignored one other family that, collectively, has greater net worth than the Kochs: the Waltons, the heirs to the Walmart fortune. Here’s the rundown, in descending order of their ranking on the Forbes international list: 9. Christy Walton and family: $38 billion 10. Jim Walton: $35.6 billion 11. Alice Walton: $35.1 billion 12. S. Robson Walton: $35.1 billion 305. Ann Walton Kroenke: $5.0 billion 367. Nancy Walton Laurie: $4.2 billion Together, the six Waltons have a net worth of $153 billion -- a little less than double the holdings of Charles and David Koch. So if Reid is going to put together the Koch brothers, it makes sense to combine the wealth of the Walton family as well. And the Walton family’s wealth is bigger. Our ruling Reid said the Koch brothers are "the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world." If you look at families -- which is what Reid is essentially doing -- then Charles and David Koch rank second internationally to six members of the Walton family, at least according to Forbes. That’s still pretty close to the top of the list. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2014-04-02T14:32:19	2014-04-02	['None']

pomt-05220	Says "As Mayor of Wilsonville, I drove TriMet out of town and replaced their bloated transit system with our own local bus line that offers better service and has saved our businesses millions of dollars."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/07/john-ludlow/did-john-ludlow-mayor-wilsonville-drive-trimet-out/	Taxpayer spending on transit, urban renewal and public safety are just some of the big issues dominating the race between Charlotte Lehan and John Ludlow for Clackamas County chair. Ludlow styles himself as the spending watchdog and crowed recently about how, when he was mayor of Wilsonville, the city dumped TriMet in favor of its own bus system. (TriMet, by the way, is unpopular in some circles.) "As Mayor of Wilsonville," writes Ludlow in a statement posted to his campaign website, "I drove TriMet out of town and replaced their bloated transit system with our own local bus line that offers better service and has saved our businesses millions of dollars." There are many tantalizing strings to follow. Is TriMet a bloated transit system? Is Wilsonville’s local bus system -- called SMART for South Metro Area Regional Transit -- really a money saver? But in the end, what we really wanted to know was this: Did Ludlow run TriMet out of town and replace it with what would become SMART? To answer this, we did some time-traveling into our news archives. We uncovered news stories documenting that in October 1988, the Wilsonville City Council voted unanimously to support a withdrawal resolution from TriMet. The resolution was backed by businesses that argued the city could pay less and get more with its own transit system. In November, the TriMet Board agreed to the withdrawal. And in January 1989, Ludlow was sworn in as mayor, replacing Bill Stark. Ludlow, in other words, was not mayor when the city council voted to dump TriMet. Nor was he on council when TriMet agreed to drop Wilsonville. So how does Ludlow get to claim that as mayor he drove TriMet out of Wilsonville? "It was signed into law when I was mayor," he told PolitiFact Oregon. In fact, he said he recalled presentations in chambers to develop a replacement bus system. "That definitely happened under my reign." We’re certain that as mayor Ludlow oversaw the selection and implementation of a new transit system. SMART’s timeline shows that in 1989, the city signed a contract with Buck Ambulance Service and door-to-door service launched that year. But the critical action took place before Ludlow took office. Businesses weren’t happy paying TriMet for service they deemed inadequate, so they checked state law to figure out how they could go their own way. Ben Altman, a private planning consultant who was on the board of the Wilsonville Chamber of Commerce in 1988, said businesses raised money for a public survey and feasibility study. "We had to do a budget analysis and show how the city could do it as well, or better than, TriMet," he said. The resolution was adopted 5-0 on Oct. 3, 1988. Ludlow was a member of the commerce chamber, but he doesn’t recall spearheading the petition effort. And in any case, that’s not what he said. He said that as mayor, he drove TriMet out of town. We find there’s some truth to Ludlow’s statement: He was mayor when the city officially separated from TriMet and he was mayor when the city sought to find a replacement transit system. But he was not mayor when the city council voted to withdraw from TriMet service, which we find to be the critical moment in the history of Wilsonville and TriMet. We rule Ludlow’s statement Mostly False.	None	John Ludlow	None	None	None	2012-06-07T17:19:52	2012-06-07	['None']
pomt-01999	"Cantor's campaign spent more at steakhouses than Brat spent on his entire campaign."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/11/chuck-todd/rare-feat-cantor-spent-more-steakhouses-opponent-d/	This might not quite be the stat heard round the world, but politicos could not resist passing along one factoid that seemed to capture the improbability of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s, R-Va., stunning defeat in his primary race against Dave Brat. "Cantor's campaign spent more at steak houses than Brat spent on his entire campaign," said Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown. Talk about a claim made for headlines and Twitter. "Eric Cantor: Burned at the steakhouse," said Rolling Stone magazine. "High steaks politics" and "Where’s the beef" popped up in the twittersphere. There’s no disputing the accuracy of the comparison, which first showed up in the New York Times. According to campaign finance data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, Cantor spent $168,000 on fundraising events at three Virginia restaurants -- Bobby Van’s Grill, Bobby Van's Steakhouse, and Blt Steak. Brat spent a little less than $123,000 across the board for his campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance reports, which cover spending up until May 21, 2014. Overall, Cantor outspent Brat more than 40 to 1, according to available records, and still lost by 10 percentage points. There’s good reason for the collective astonishment -- this is a rare event. "I can't think of any (case) in which the incumbent's spending advantage was so huge and he still lost," said Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego. Another political scientist, John Sides at George Washington University, has a database with about 9,100 House general election contests. Sides tracks which candidate won and which spent the most money. Being outspent was a clear disadvantage. "In only 10 percent of races did the candidate who got outspent actually win," Sides said. Now, this concerns general elections, not primary contests like the one Cantor lost, but Sides said the pattern wouldn’t change much. Money is a very tangible perk that comes with incumbency. The Center for Responsive Politics calculated the odds of a challenger beating an incumbent going back to 1998. In the best year, 2006, challengers who spent $1 million or less, like Brat, had a 1 percent chance of winning. In every other election, their odds were much worse. Our ruling Todd said that Cantor spent more at steakhouses than Brat did in his entire campaign. The latest campaign finance reports back that up. Cantor spent $168,000 on steakhouse dinners to Brat’s $123,000 spent in the overall campaign. We rate the claim True.	None	Chuck Todd	None	None	None	2014-06-11T16:49:42	2014-06-11	['None']

pomt-05179	Say "this biennium, liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/14/chris-garrett-bill-kennemer/do-liquor-sales-account-1-billion-state-budget/	In a recent commentary in The Oregonian, two Oregon House members -- a Democrat and Republican -- crossed the aisle to talk about how they’re watching Washington state’s switch to privatizing alcohol sales. In the piece, Reps. Bill Kennemer, R-Oregon City, and Chris Garrett, D-Lake Oswego, say they’ll look at a number of areas as the state examines possible changes to Oregon’s system. Revenue, they note, is a big piece off all of this. "Oregon’s system produces revenue that funds alcohol treatment and other services. This biennium, liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget. Regardless of feelings about the state being in the alcohol business, real money is at stake. The impact of regulatory changes on an already strained budget, including funding for our schools and public safety agencies, cannot be ignored." Oregon’s general fund -- the money that legislators most often refer to as "the budget" -- is about $15 billion in all, so that $1 billion figure caught us by surprise. We wanted to know whether it was true. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission is in charge of liquor sales in the state and keeps a close eye on the distribution of revenues. According to its figures, the commission brought in some $460 million in sales, license fees and taxes for the 2010-11 fiscal year. That’s just a single year, though, so the Commission pulls in more than $900 million in a biennium -- nearly the $1 billion that the two representatives mentioned. But here’s the rub: not much of that money goes back into the state budget. More than half of what the Commission brings in goes back into agency expenditures, liquor agent compensation and inventory purchases. The rest gets split among the state, counties and cities and a couple other areas. So, for the 2009-2011 biennium, the state general fund received just under $200 million in liquor sales revenues. We called the representatives to see what had happened with their commentary. Rep. Kennemer was immediately apologetic. "I am embarrassed and sorry," he said. The $1 billion figure came from total revenues, "unfortunately we didn't get the rest of the verbiage corrected." Rep. Garrett offered similar reasoning. "It's a billion-dollar business." It’s true that the representatives had a basis for the $1 billion figure, but to say that liquor sales account for that much of the state budget is inaccurate -- and the representatives realized that when we checked in. We rate this claim False.	None	Chris Garrett and Bill Kennemer	None	None	None	2012-06-14T16:29:39	2012-06-13	['None']
pomt-00687	After laying off 30,000 people, Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, "I would have done them all faster."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/05/anonymous-cyber-squatter/cyber-squatter-accuses-carly-fiorina-30000-layoffs/	Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, announced on May 4, 2015, that she’d be running for president as a Republican. But a cyber-squatter had moved fast to grab the Web address carlyfiorina.org and flame her. Using a simple gray-and-white color scheme and uninspired fonts, the domain owner recalled Fiorina’s controversial six-year tenure as CEO of the computer maker by addressing visitors to the page this way: "Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. "So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard. "It was this many:" At that point, a very long list of frowny-face icons begins. After much scrolling, the page concludes: "That's 30,000 people she laid off. People with families. And what does she say she would have done differently? " ‘I would have done them all faster.’ "—Carly Fiorina" Is the cyber-squatter -- who didn’t identify themselves on the site -- correct? The 30,000 number is largely accurate (we fact-checked it back in 2010), but we wondered whether it’s correct that Fiorina actually said she would have rather laid off people faster. First, some background. Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp. in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets. Her actions at HP spawned detractors as well as defenders. We looked at the numerical part of the claim in 2010, the year Fiorina ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The charge was made in an attack ad by Boxer. We found that Fiorina herself cited the 30,000-layoff figure in an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006. "When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from." Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry. Their official website, by the way, is www.carlyforpresident.com. But did Fiorina say that she wishes she’d done those 30,000 layoffs "faster"? This is more problematic. It stems from a 2005 article in Fortune magazine (reprinted here in 2011). The comment came in a section devoted to the departure of some of the company’s senior executives after the merger. Here’s an excerpt: "Fiorina summarily fired — within hours — the head of enterprise sales, Peter Blackmore, and two of his senior executives. The speed and visibility of the move caused the tech industry to view the firings as an unnecessarily cruel public hanging, and criticism of Fiorina flared. She argues back, saying that a hanging it wasn’t and that in truth these people were treated, in the usual HP manner, with ‘respect, candor, and compassion.’ But she also says that some of the European problems had been ripening for a time and that these three very senior executives clearly ‘dropped the ball.’ She believes in accountability, she says, so the men are gone. … "Under Fiorina (HP) has lost — via firings, resignations, and retirements — a noticeable number of its top people. Here’s one indicator of what some people call the ‘brain drain’: Of the 11 ‘direct reports’ that Fiorina had in October 2003, one died and five others are gone. Michael Capellas, CEO of Compaq when the merger was done, left early. Former HP employees can also, without much effort, list another 20 well-placed executives who have departed, a few of them going to competitors Dell and storage company EMC. "Fiorina does not agree, naturally, that there’s been a brain drain. In fact, she believes that one lesson she’s learned while running HP is that she should have moved more quickly in ejecting certain people. Smartened up now, she says, ‘I would have done them all faster. Every person that I’ve asked to leave, whether it’s been clear publicly or not, I would have done faster.’ " This puts Fiorina’s comment in a somewhat different light. Rather than musing that she should have laid off 30,000 people faster, the full article suggests she’s referring to a select group of high-ranking executives. Our ruling The cyber-squatter site claims that after laying off "30,000 people," Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, "I would have done them all faster." While the number is accurate -- acknowledged in a 2006 interview by Fiorina -- the comment that "I would have done them all faster" is pulled out of context. In fact, Fiorina was more specifically referring to her decisions to force out a small number of top-level executives, not tens of thousands of rank-and-file employees. The claim is partially accurate, but takes some things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	Anonymous cyber-squatter	None	None	None	2015-05-05T11:44:19	2015-05-04	['None']
pomt-04503	"Under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-donald-trump-small-business-deba/	Donald Trump is a tycoon who owns luxury high-rises, builds fancy golf courses and stars in a reality TV show. Is it also possible that The Donald is actually a small businessman? President Barack Obama says that's how Mitt Romney would treat him. During the first presidential debate in Denver, Obama attacked Mitt Romney over what constitutes a small business. "Now, Gov. Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth," Obama said. "So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue … the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families." Obama continued, "We do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Now, under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Gov. Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they’re the job creators. They’d be burdened. But under Gov. Romney’s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. And I know Donald Trump doesn’t like to think of himself as small anything, but that’s how you define small businesses if you’re getting business income." The Obama campaign has often tried to remind voters of Romney's relationship with Trump, who has been the most prominent person to question where Obama was born. In TV ads, the Obama campaign has frequently shown a photo of Romney in front of a Trump jet. But was Obama correct when he said that "under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business"? To explore what it means to be a "small business," we'll first discuss whether Trump's companies meet the definition set by the Small Business Administration. Then we'll examine whether Trump would be eligible for a small business tax cut under Romney’s plan. Does Trump qualify as a small businessman? The definition of "small business" is more complicated than you might think. The most common rule of thumb is 500 employees -- a threshold used "for research purposes" by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, an independent advocate for small business within the federal agency. But for loans and other programs, the SBA uses a more complicated standard. The company has to be independently owned and operated and "not dominant in its field." Depending on the industry, the threshold can be either an average number of employees for the past 12 months or a three-year average of revenues. For instance, a manufacturing firm could be considered "small" if it has anywhere from 500 to 1500 employees, depending on the type of product manufactured. Service providers would qualify as small if their annual receipts are lower than $2.5 million to $21.5 million, again depending on the particular service being provided. For retailing, the annual receipts threshold ranges from $5 million to $21 million. So how do Trump’s companies measure up? The Trump Organization didn’t return our queries, but we were able to find a few data points on employment at Trump’s companies. The Trump Organization, the developer’s flagship company, had 22,450 employees in 2007. Several other resort and casino holdings have thousands of employees each, though it’s unclear whether there is overlap among all of these entities. And while there have been disputes over the years about just how much money Trump brings in, it's likely he would exceed any SBA revenue standard. Now, it's possible that some Trump businesses could still qualify as small by the SBA's definition. According to news reports, Trump has some holdings that are much smaller than 500 employees and have relatively modest revenues. In a story about a tax cut proposal from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., the Huffington Post wrote that Cantor’s cut could benefit "Donald Trump's Trump Tower Sales & Leasing, which has 20 employees and annual sales of about $960,000." CNN reported that "Trump also runs a number of other companies that employ fewer than 500" people. According to the SBA, however, a small business affiliated with a large business would not be eligible for an SBA-backed loan. Comparing the Obama and Romney tax plans for small businesses However, even if Trump managed to meet the technical definition of a small business, it’s not accurate to say that Romney’s tax proposal would treat him as a small business. This highlights a fundamental difference in the candidates’ approaches to tax policy. Obama has targeted small businesses by offering at least 16 tax cuts based on a company’s size, frequently limiting the taxes to companies much smaller than the SBA's 500-employee standard. Romney, by contrast, has sought to help small businesses through lower marginal tax rates for individuals. Romney calls lower rates "incentives for job-creating businesses." It's true that conservatives often contend that tax hikes on high earners would hurt small businesses -- not a surprising strategy, since "entrepreneurs" are a more sympathetic group to most people than "the rich." The Obama campaign backs up the president's Trump claim by arguing that hedge fund partners can count as small businesspeople, and that high-powered tax planning can structure very large enterprises in such a way that they’re considered small businesses. We've concluded in a previous fact check that the connection between high earners and small businesses is exaggerated. Still, Obama’s attack during the debate was a bit of a red herring. He implies that a "definition" in Romney's plan would give unique treatment to Trump -- or any "small business" -- when the plan simply reduces rates on all individuals, regardless of whether they own a small business. Other Republicans have advocated targeted small-business tax cuts -- such as the proposal earlier this year by Cantor that "every small business that employs fewer than 500 people" would get a 20 percent tax cut -- but Romney’s main tax proposal is to make a "permanent, across-the-board 20 percent cut in marginal rates." If Romney harbors any plans for targeted tax cuts for small businesses, he hasn’t revealed them. Why does this matter? Because if Trump ends up getting a cut from Romney, it would be because he’s a taxpayer, not because Romney "defines" him as a small businessman. Our ruling Obama said that "under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business." But any tax cuts Trump would get from Romney would have nothing to do with whether he’s a small business or not. We rate Obama’s claim False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-04T16:20:36	2012-10-03	['None']
pomt-05936	"I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/27/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-ive-never-voted-democrat-when-the/	During the Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 26, 2012, Mitt Romney had to fend off challenges to his record as a conservative, including a series of charges from Newt Gingrich. In the course of arguing his closeness to Ronald Reagan, Gingrich said, "I think it's reasonable to say, and I think (Gov. Romney) said it fairly, I am vastly closer to Reagan. In that period, the governor was an independent business person. In '92 he was donating to the Democrats for Congress and voted for Paul Tsongas in the Democratic primary." Romney countered, "I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot. And -- and in my state of Massachusetts, you could register as an independent and go vote in (whichever) primary happens to be very interesting. And any chance I got to vote against Bill Clinton or Ted Kennedy, I took. … I have always voted for a Republican any time there was a Republican on the ballot." Is Romney right? Media reports dating back to 1994 -- when Romney first ran as a Republican for Senate -- said that he had acknowledged voting for former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primary in Massachusetts. "An Independent until last December, he publicizes his brief stint as a Democrat to support ex-senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 presidential primary," wrote David Broder in the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 1994. " ‘I'm not a partisan politician,’ he said. ‘My hope is that after this election, it will be the moderates of both parties who will control the Senate, not the Jesse Helmses.’ " Three days later, the Los Angeles Times’ Ron Brownstein wrote, "When Romney decided to run, Republicans exchanged quizzical looks: ‘We didn't know a single Republican when we jumped in in December,’ his wife, Ann, says. As a registered independent, Romney had voted in the Democratic presidential primary in 1992 to support Paul E. Tsongas (though he backed George Bush in the general election, he says). He briefly considered running for the Senate seat as an independent as well, his wife says, before rejecting the idea as impractical." Romney has faced some difficulty during his two presidential runs explaining his vote for Tsongas. His answer has been that he voted in Democratic primaries -- which are often the only competitive primaries in strongly Democratic Massachusetts -- for strategic reasons On the Feb. 18, 2007, edition of ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Romney was asked, "Let me talk about your political journey. You were an independent, registered independent in the 1980s. You voted for Paul Tsongas, a Democrat, in the 1992 primaries. Now you've described yourself as a Reagan Republican." Romney responded, "Kind of a mischaracterization. In Massachusetts, if you register as an independent, you can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. When there was no real contest in the Republican primary, I'd vote in the Democrat primary, vote for the person who I thought would be the weakest opponent for Republican. In the general election..." Stephanopoulos interjected, "So that was a way of supporting President (George H.W. ) Bush, is that what you're saying?" Romney answered, "Look, I've taken every occasion to vote against Ted Kennedy, he's a good friend, but Ted Kennedy, and Tip O'Neill, they're my congressman and senator. I go in their primary, just like a lot of other folks, and voted against the person who I thought was the strongest Democrat. Now, that happens in America today. But let me tell you, in the general election, I don't recall ever once voting for anyone other than a Republican. So, yeah, as an independent, I'll go in and play in their primary, but I'm a Republican and have been through my life. I was with Young Republicans when I was in college back at Stanford. But a registered independent, so I could vote in either primary." This explanation sounds a lot like what Romney said in the Jacksonville debate. But in the debate, he went further and said, "I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot." On the same day as the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary -- March 10, 1992 -- the Republicans held a presidential primary as well. The incumbent president, George H.W. Bush, won with 66 percent over challenger Patrick Buchanan, with 28 percent. (For the record, Tsongas won 67 percent, crushing once and future California Gov. Jerry Brown with 15 percent and future President Bill Clinton with just 11 percent.) For someone in Romney’s shoes, voting in the Democratic primary did make sense strategically. By the time of the Massachusetts primary, the renomination contest for Bush was all but over, whereas the Democratic contest still had some life in it. Deciding this question requires weighing two distinct interpretations of what Romney did. When Romney walked into the polling place and was handed a Democratic ballot, it’s true that there was no Republican on it. The Republican ballot was separate. So, by this interpretation, Romney is correct that there was no "Republican on the ballot" that day. But there’s another way of looking at it. Romney, as an independent, was eligible to choose which party’s primary he voted in, and he made an affirmative choice to vote in the Democratic primary, not the Republican primary. We checked with the Secretary of the Commonwealth in Massachusetts, the office responsible for running elections in the state. A spokesman confirmed that in 1992 (as is the case today) an independent would have been able to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary on Election Day. So it was within Romney’s power to choose to vote in the Republican primary for either Bush or Buchanan, rather than voting in the Democratic primary for Tsongas. That’s a choice that more than 241,000 Massachusetts Republicans and independents made that day, but Romney didn’t. (A postscript: Tsongas, who died in 1997, didn’t return the favor to Romney. Two years later, when Romney was challenging Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Kennedy got Tsongas to denounce television ads Romney was running against the incumbent. Tsongas’ criticism was effective in "blunting their impact," the Boston Globe reported.) Our ruling In the Jacksonville debate, Romney said, "I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot." Romney has been open about the strategy behind his decision, and we expect many voters would have done the same thing. We see two contrary interpretations as having merit. Romney has a point that the ballot he was handed didn’t include any Republicans. On the other hand, Romney had a right to request a GOP ballot that day and opted not to. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-27T16:39:41	2012-01-26	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12252	"Midtown crime is up by 30 percent the last quarter."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jul/11/rick-baker/did-crime-go-30-percent-midtown-last-quarter/	As Mayor Rick Kriseman boasts about low crime in St. Petersburg, his opponent, former Mayor Rick Baker is firing back with statistics of his own. During an interview with WFLA-Ch. 8, Baker criticized Kriseman’s efforts in Midtown, the area just south of downtown St. Petersburg. A large portion of undecided voters live in Midtown, making it a battleground in the St. Petersburg mayor’s race. The nonpartisan election will be held Aug. 29, 2017. "Let’s get back to the Midtown area, which you brought up before. You’ve also criticized Kriseman for not doing enough for residents there. He says that crime is down by 6 percent and officers are more engaged in the community," WFLA-Ch. 8 anchor Paul Mueller said June 25. "So, with that being said, what else would you do if elected?" "Well the Midtown crime is up by 30 percent the last quarter, so I don't know what statistics he’s looking at," Baker responded. His claim about crime going up made us wonder — what statistic is he looking at? As it turns out, Baker’s claim relies on shaky data. Police department stopped validating location of crimes by neighborhood at the end of 2015 PolitiFact Florida reached out to the St. Petersburg Police Department for a quarterly breakdown of crime in Midtown. The department said they stopped validating the location of crimes by neighborhoods when the police department replaced its crime recording application in 2016. The old system was around 20 years old and failing. While the police department does record the location of calls for service, it does not include the specific neighborhood location on the validated data sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, because the FDLE does not record the data by specific address. Still, the department was able to provide a breakdown of crime in Midtown from 2001 to 2015 when it used the old system. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The number of crimes in Midtown dropped significantly from 2009 to the end of 2015. But the police department was not able to provide crime data for 2016 and 2017 in Midtown, making it hard to assess the accuracy of Baker’s claim. When we told Baker campaign spokesperson Brigitta Shouppe about this, she provided PolitiFact Florida with a breakdown of crime data throughout the city by the first quarters of every year. The breakdown included Midtown. It showed that crime in Midtown went up 30 percent in the first quarter of 2017 (January to March) in comparison to the first quarter of 2016 (January to March). The data includes homicides, forcible sex, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and automobile theft. The 30 percent increase means the number of incidents increased from 544 to 706, according to Baker’s data. The police department could not verify the 2016 and 2017 breakdown provided by Baker. It said the data presented was based on a "working document," and was not ready for release due to the unsubstantiated numbers. Baker was vague about where the data came from, saying only that the police department provided it and that it came without disclaimers. We checked in with community advocates to see if they had noticed recent crime spikes. They told us that crime in Midtown is an ongoing issue of concern, but they had noticed no recent changes. Baker’s evidence relies on uncertain data There are a few problems with Baker’s numbers. First off, experts agreed that if the police department can’t verify the numbers presented by Baker, the data should be treated with caution. And, regardless of whether the data is accurate, experts said there are better practices to understand trends in crime. "Generally speaking, most criminologists would agree that to understand what is driving crime, we need to examine long-term trends," said Lyndsay Boggess, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida. "The social and economic conditions that lead to crime are complex and multi-faceted and slow to change." Crime rates fluctuate so even if the increase is accurate in one three-month period, it’s not necessarily a cause for alarm. For example, in the previous quarterly comparison provided by Baker from 2015 to 2016, the Midtown neighborhood saw a 20 percent decrease in crime. If you go back even further, after a decade or so, every year with a first quarter increase in crime was followed by a decrease during the same months in the following year. "The fact that the fluctuations across the years is fairly significant makes me wonder about the accuracy of the data," said Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. So, we can’t say for certain whether Baker’s claim is accurate. The police department makes crime data accessible online that shows crimes counts for the city broken down by months, not just the first quarters of every month. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com What about overall crime in the city? During the New Channel 8 interview, the anchor mentioned that Kriseman said that crime had dropped 6 percent. The Kriseman campaign said that figure was in reference to the overall crime in St. Petersburg, not just Midtown. Kriseman’s figure is accurate if you look at the number of crimes that have occurred from 2013 to 2016. According to Uniform Crime Reporting statistics published by the FBI, there were 15,560 total crimes in 2013 (the last year of former Mayor Bill Foster’s term) and at the end of 2016 there were 14,531 total crimes. That’s a little more than a 6 percent drop. But like experts said, it’s better to look at rates, and the FBI breaks those down by violent crime (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) and property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.) See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com As you can see, for the most part, property crime and violent crime rates trends have been down since the 1990s in St. Petersburg. Our ruling Baker said that crime in Midtown is up 30 percent in the last quarter. Baker says he got the statistics from the police, but he’s leaving out critical context. Most importantly, the St. Petersburg Police Department stopped validating data with neighborhood location at the end of 2015. The quarter-to-quarter comparison provided by Baker’s team relies on uncertain data and looks at a small time frame. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11230	Says he was "instrumental to passing two (recent) pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for firefighters across the state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/07/mahlon-mitchell/gubernatorial-candidate-mitchell-claims-credit-fir/	The longest paragraph in Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell’s online biography touts his role passing two niche laws affecting Wisconsin firefighters. The reference from his campaign website has also made it into at least one news account as the Madison firefighter seeks the state’s highest office. "Recently, Mahlon was instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state," the biography says, going on to describe the laws on health insurance and infectious diseases. So Mitchell’s claim is not just that he was involved, but that he was "instrumental" in "recent" legislation. Is he right? "Recently" claim a stretch Mitchell, the president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, is part of a large Democratic field seeking to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He is making his second run for statewide office, having lost a 2012 bid for lieutenant governor to Rebecca Kleefisch. The laws he references created additional benefits for Wisconsin firefighters or their families in two specific scenarios. 2009 Wisconsin Act 284 established a presumption that firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency responders who are killed or disabled by an infectious disease contracted the disease through their employment, giving them access to related benefits. 2009 Wisconsin Act 285 required municipalities to pay health insurance premiums for the surviving spouses and dependent children of firefighters who die in the line of duty if they were paying premiums for the firefighter. You’ll notice the year built into the titles of the laws isn’t exactly, well, recent. The laws both were drafted in 2009 and took effect in May 2010. Was Mitchell a key force behind laws? Mitchell’s "instrumental" claim is a bit subjective, but leaning on the dictionary definition we’ll take that to mean Mitchell is claiming a key role in getting the laws passed. A lot goes into making a bill into a law — cue Schoolhouse Rock — but it seems fair to say a key person would be centrally involved with proposing the law, writing the law or pushing for its passage, through things like lobbying or testifying on behalf of the bill. Mitchell was a member of the union’s board when the laws were passed, in charge of outreach and public relations, according to his campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Allen. She said Mitchell attended committee hearings and floor debates in support of the bill and arranged for other firefighters to do the same. And he was part of the group that organized the bill signing. But Mitchell did not testify on behalf of the bills — that was left to other union representatives. And he did not formally lobby for the bills, either, since he was not a registered lobbyist until February 2011. As to the how the laws came to be, drafting records for the health insurance bill show it was introduced by state Sen. David Hansen (D-Green Bay) after the widow of former Green Bay firefighter Arnie Wolff wrote to him about her family’s financial struggles. The bill was drafted by the Legislative Reference Bureau at Hansen’s request and modeled after similar legislation in Illinois. Drafting records for the infectious diseases bill don’t specify the origin of the idea (and Mitchell didn’t claim he proposed it), but show it was drafted by the reference bureau at the request of then-state Sen. Jim Sullivan (D-Wauwatosa) based on a bill in Virginia. The union president who preceded Mitchell, Mike Woodzicka, said the union worked with legislators on the language of the bills, so Mitchell and other board members would have been part of email exchanges on that topic. Jay Wadd, a spokesman for Hansen, said he assumes such a step would have been part of the process on their bill, though he doesn’t have specific records of it given the time that has passed. Our rating Mitchell claims he was recently "instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state." But it’s a stretch to say the action was recent, and that Mitchell’s role was instrumental. Mitchell’s union supported the bills, and he was involved with supporting them, but there’s no evidence the bills wouldn’t have become law without his involvement.

pomt-08651	Roy Barnes is like Barack Obama because they're both doing a lot of apologizing.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/15/republican-governors-association/barnes-and-obama-sorry-gop-says/	Republicans criticize President Barack Obama for what they call "apologizing" for the United States' actions to countries across the globe. Now they're trying to say that former Gov. Roy Barnes, who is running to reclaim his old seat, is like Obama because he's apologizing, too. The Republican Governors Association makes the accusation in a recent TV commercial. "Our president has traveled the globe apologizing for America," the announcer says. "Our former governor Roy Barnes is traveling the state apologizing for his first term in office." The ad concludes: "Roy Barnes and Barack Obama need to know: Georgians don’t want apologies. They want results." Is Barnes an apologist like our president? Republicans have been playing Six Degrees of Obama with Democrats for much of this midterm election season. They're betting that the closer they link their opposition to the unpopular president the better. Barnes has tried to outmaneuver their attempts for months. In August, he ducked a fundraiser Obama held in Atlanta. Barnes' campaign manager said the former governor wasn't invited, a claim AJC PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants On Fire. As proof of the RGA's accusations, its spokesman Mike Schrimpf pointed us to the group's anti-Barnes website, http://roybama.com. It lists what the RGA considers to be apologies by Obama and Barnes. First, a bit about Obama and apologies. PolitiFact National published an item on similar accusations against the president in a book by former Massachusetts governor and 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney said Obama "has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ..." PolitiFact National reviewed seven Obama speeches cited by Romney and ran them by several experts with different points of view. They also looked at previous presidential apologies. They found Romney's statement False. One of the experts PolitiFact National consulted was Nile Gardiner, who co-wrote the list of Obama apologies cited by the http://roybama.com website. Yet PolitiFact National found Romney's notion of what counts as an Obama apology, which aligns with Gardiner's viewpoint, to be invalid. "If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. ... But in our review of his words, we came up short," the item concluded. "Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well. There's not a full-throated, sincere apology in the bunch." So Obama is not apologizing for America. But what about Barnes? Is he apologizing for his first term in office? The RGA cites three examples, all from videos Barnes' campaign posted on its YouTube page. We'll take them one at a time. "Roy Apologizes" This campaign video, targeted at teachers, is titled "Roy Apologizes." "I apologize. But it was never my intent, and it is not my intent now, not to treasure teachers and learning," he says in the video. He adds that he didn't listen enough to teachers. That's an apology. "Providence" In this TV commercial, which ran during the primaries, Barnes says that "as governor, my heart was in the right place, but I didn’t listen or slow down to explain why I had to make some difficult decisions. For that, I apologize." Apology? Yes. "Listening" In this video released more than a year ago, Barnes says he has been driving across the state listening to Georgians. He doesn't utter the word "apology." He doesn't say he's sorry, either. Instead, Barnes says he "learned some lessons" since he lost the 2002 gubernatorial election to Sonny Perdue. Barnes says he needs to listen. "Listening is not something I did too much of when I was a governor before. I tried to do too much, too fast. I’ve learned some lessons. I learned I should explain myself more," he says. Apology? This is a tougher call. Barnes acknowledges mistakes and says he is changing his ways. But he never outright says he is apologizing. Overall, though, there's no doubt Barnes is giving a mea culpa. The Barnes campaign said that's what he's doing, and politicians need to look back and assess their actions more often. "Growing up in Sunday school, Roy learned that if you feel you should apologize, you should," spokesman Emil Runge said. And that can be a smart strategy, University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said. Former President Bill Clinton used that approach when he lost his bid for re-election after his first term as governor of Arkansas. He spent much of his next campaign apologizing and reclaimed his seat. So the RGA's analogy has some truth to it. Barnes is apologizing for his first term, and he's proud of it. But that doesn't make him like Obama, since the president has not apologized for America's actions. We give the RGA's statement a Half True.

pomt-06462	"The city of Columbus would save $41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own, guaranteed-check pensions."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/19/dave-yost/dave-yost-says-sb-5-would-save-columbus-41m-year-p/	People on both sides of Senate Bill 5, the controversial overhaul of Ohio’s collective-bargaining law, are fond of general statements that amplify their positions but are hard to quantify. SB 5, supporters say, will save public dollars. But, opponents warn, it will threaten public safety. Rare is the specific number in this polarizing debate. So Ohio Auditor Dave Yost triggered PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity this month when he penned a guest column for The Plain Dealer. Yost, a Republican, wrote in favor of Issue 2, this fall’s ballot referendum on SB 5. A "yes" vote would uphold the GOP-backed law. A "no" vote would repeal the changes. In building his case, Yost noted that SB 5 would require government employees to contribute at least 10 percent of their salaries toward their pensions. The new rules ban "pension pickups" -- a perk in some contracts that calls for the public employer to cover a portion of those costs. Under SB 5, Yost argued, "the city of Columbus would save $41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own, guaranteed-check pensions. That’s 500 cops and firefighters." The dollar amount is what caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. How Columbus might use the money is purely speculative. We wanted to know if such savings would even exist, especially since more general statements are sometimes made without taking into consideration the fact that many public employees already are contributing significantly toward their pensions. Yost did not cite the source of his $41 million figure in the column. So we dialed up his assistant public affairs director and press secretary, Carrie Bartunek. She referred us to story The Columbus Dispatch published March 6, several weeks before state legislators and Gov. John Kasich approved a final version of the plan. That story showed results of The Dispatch’s analysis on the impact of SB 5. Based on a survey, reporters concluded that, had SB 5 been in effect, central Ohio’s largest government entities would together have saved a $74 million in 2010. Columbus accounted for the biggest chunk in The Dispatch analysis: $50 million. What’s more: "The newspaper’s survey found that most of Columbus’ annual savings -- $41.2 million -- would come from ending the city’s practice of paying much of the employees’ share for pensions." Yost appeared to be right on the nose. But as much as we love it when public officials have faith in what they read in daily newspapers, PolitiFact Ohio decided to double-check The Dispatch’s numbers. That led us to Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman, a Democrat and a fiery opponent of SB 5. Would The Dispatch’s figures hold up under his scrutiny? The $41 million "was accurate at the time the article was published (in March 2011)," Coleman spokesman Dan Williamson said. "We currently have $36.5 million budgeted for the pickup in 2011." Columbus picks up a portion of employee pension contributions under contracts with six unions. Topping the list are workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. They receive a 9 percent pickup, according to numbers Williamson shared. Workers in three other unions get an 8 percent pickup, one union gets 6.5 percent and another 5.5 percent. So what explains the year-over-year decrease in funds budgeted for pension pickups? "In 2009, Mayor Coleman initiated a 10-year reform plan to gradually increase the amount employees pay into their health care and pensions," Williamson explained via email. Bartunek said Yost used the most recent numbers to convey his point. "We’re talking in real time," she told PolitiFact Ohio. "People know that number won’t be the same in five years." Her point is not an invalid one. Contracts are subject to change and expiration, and if Columbus officials can’t negotiate terms more favorable to city coffers, Coleman’s downward projections might not hold. Coleman acknowledges in his 2011 budget that there are assumptions made based on the city’s goals. But whether it’s $41 million, $36.5 million or some other figure, an annual pension pickup savings of $41 million is obviously no lock for Columbus taxpayers. Yost understood such caveats, "but when you’re writing a 500-word column, you’re not going to put all those pieces in," Bartunek said. "There would have to be a lot of qualifiers." So what does that mean for Yost’s claim? His statement is accurate. Columbus would have saved about $41 million had SB 5 been the law in 2010. But for PolitiFact, words matter. Yost’s description was that the city would save $41 million annually. Yost would have been more precise, and only slightly less compelling, had he simply noted that Columbus would have saved $41 million last year. That, in fact, is how The Dispatch referred to the savings. And readers also would have been fully informed had he acknowledged Coleman’s efforts to reduce pickups; Yost’s implication was that without SB 5, the savings would not materialize otherwise. Those are needed points of clarification and additional information. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Yost’s claim Mostly True.	None	Dave Yost	None	None	None	2011-10-19T06:00:00	2011-10-02	['None']
pomt-06090	Congress gave an unelected board "the power to deny care to seniors."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/06/tom-price/price-worries-about-health-care-laws-impact-senior/	For critics of the controversial federal health care law, there are few elements of it that are discussed with as much disdain as the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Rush Limbaugh, for example, has called the 15-member board "death panels." U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Roswell, explained some of his concerns about the board in a Dec. 8 letter he sent to constituents of the northwest metro Atlanta district he represents. Several people who received the letter asked us about the veracity of one particular sentence concerning the board. "[T]hey put in place an unaccountable, unelected board of 15 bureaucrats, known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board [IPAB], and gave them the power to deny care to seniors," wrote Price, a doctor, underlining that specific part of the letter. So can this board deny care to seniors, as Price wrote? First, what is this board and what can it do? It was created to reduce Medicare spending, if spending surpasses the targeted rate, which is the average of consumer and medical care inflation. Medical inflation has been higher than general inflation 24 of the past 25 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS). Board members are chosen by the president, with advice from the U.S. Senate. Board proposals to reduce spending must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by Sept. 1 of each year and to the president and Congress by Jan. 15 of the following year. The Senate can vote by a three-fifths majority to reject the board’s recommendations, but it then must come up with Medicare spending cuts. Board members should include doctors, employers, health economist researchers and third-party payers and can serve six-year terms. The HHS secretary, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator and the administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration are nonvoting members of the board. The board would be required to submit its first proposal to the president and Congress in January 2014 if per capita spending exceeds projections. "[T]he Board is directed to consider, among other things, Medicare solvency, quality and access to care, the effects of changes in payments to providers, and those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid," according to the CRS. The health care law has goals of maintaining or enhancing beneficiary access to quality care. It prohibits IPAB from reducing payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities, long-term care hospitals and hospices until 2020, noted an April report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that researches health policy. The Kaiser report says there could be changes in "Medicare Advantage, the Part D prescription drug program, skilled nursing facility, home health, dialysis, ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services and durable medical equipment." Another Georgia congressman, Rep. Phil Gingrey, claimed a few months ago that "a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy." Those bureaucrats were, yes, IPAB. We reviewed that claim and rated Gingrey’s statement as False. Section 3403 of the health care law noted that IPAB may not submit "any recommendation to ration health care." Price believes costs will exceed projections, which will require cuts to Medicare. The congressman told us that IPAB decisions will likely result in changes such as withholding payment to doctors for certain services, specifically under a formula the federal government uses for Medicare physician payment known as the sustainable growth rate. Some doctors, the congressman believes, will see fewer Medicare patients. Lack of access is equivalent to a denial of care, Price argues. "It’s a cause-and-effect relationship," Price said. The Kaiser report backs up Price’s argument. "If IPAB recommends policies that squeeze Medicare payment rates without equal pressure being placed on private payment rates, there is some concern that Medicare beneficiaries would be at greater risk of having access problems, as providers become more inclined to serve other patients," it says. Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the nation’s private insurance companies, told us that seniors could be impacted by cuts to Medicare Advantage, a health choice program for recipients. Some argue otherwise, and note that Medicare Advantage users will pay slightly less this year for care. Our conclusion Price gets it partially right. The IPAB can push for changes that impact some areas of health care, and that could have an indirect result on care for seniors. The board, however, cannot propose changes that impact the most widely used forms of care -- such as inpatient hospital services, long-term care and hospice -- for Medicare beneficiaries. The IPAB can impact changes to some programs, but not specific care to specific seniors as Price’s statement implies. Price’s concerns have merit, but his statement about the IPAB having the power "to deny care to seniors" needs much more context to be completely accurate. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-07129	Democratic tax hikes led $70 billion of wealth to leave New Jersey between 2004 and 2008, and mainly relocate to Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/17/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-blames-democratic-tax-fee-hikes/	When Democratic governors were raising taxes and fees between 2004 and 2008, New Jerseyans took $70 billion of their wealth to other states, Gov. Chris Christie said recently at Princeton University. Christie made that argument during his May 20 speech about the fiscal climate facing New Jersey. When government continues to increase the cost of living and residents subsequently can’t plan their own budgets, "that’s when folks decide just to get up and leave," he said. The governor went on to say that "between 2004 and 2008, at the height of these tax increases and tax expansions and fee expansions in the state government under Jim McGreevey, Dick Codey and Jon Corzine, $70 billion of wealth left the state of New Jersey. "That’s departed wealth, not diminished wealth because of the financial crisis. Departed wealth and departed predominantly to four states – Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania," Christie continued. "What do all four of those states have in common? They all have lower taxes than New Jersey. All of them." PolitiFact New Jersey dug into Christie’s argument that tax hikes led to that migration of wealth, but first, let’s look at the source of the governor’s numbers. The $70 billion figure comes from a January 2010 report on migrating households by a research center at Boston College. From 2004 to 2008, about $117 billion of wealth came into New Jersey and about $187 billion left the state, causing a net reduction of about $70 billion. So that number is right. Christie is slightly off when it comes to the top four destination states of that departed wealth, according to the report. Based on the percentage of departing households, the top four states were Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and North Carolina. Based on the percentage of wealth, the top four states were Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and California. Between those two measures, the governor is leaving out New York and California. Christie, however, is right that New Jersey’s tax burden exceeds other states. New Jersey ranked the highest among states as of 2009 for the percentage of per-capita income spent on state and local taxes, according to the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation, a pro-business research group. And from 2004 to 2008, New Jersey’s state-local tax burden increased every year. Now, here’s the tougher question -- did New Jersey’s tax increases really chase away that $70 billion of wealth? We asked Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts in two emails to provide evidence, but he never did. "The Governor’s remarks concerning the study and his argument made concerning the impact of tax policies speak for themselves," Roberts wrote to us. The Boston College study provides a mix of reasons for migration, based on federal data. Based on that analysis, family- and job-related matters topped the reasons for leaving New Jersey from 2004 to 2008. PolitiFact New Jersey also reached out to three experts and consulted four other studies on migration, and a varied picture emerged of the impact of higher taxes. A 2007 report from the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University said high taxes were among the reasons driving people from New Jersey. According to a 2008 report out of Princeton University, New Jerseyans move to states with lower property taxes and lower costs of living. "Our conclusion is that migration out of New Jersey is based on the very high cost of housing in the state (of which property taxes are an element)," Stanford University professor Cristobal Young, one of the authors of that 2008 report, wrote in an email. "Retirement-based migration is also important, as shown by the large flows of people to Florida." Those studies support the argument that high taxes contribute to migration, but other research suggests the impact has been minimal. A recent study -- by Young and a Princeton graduate student -- reached that conclusion in regard to a 2004 tax increase on high income earners. Joel Slemrod, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, who also found a minimal effect of taxes on migration in his own study, said the financial environment is just one aspect of many that people consider in where to live. Another factor is the quality of services in a given location, Slemrod said. "You have to look at both sides of the government ledger," Slemrod said. According to University of Massachusetts, Amherst professor Jeffrey Thompson, higher taxes don’t push people out of a state, because of the value placed on the services and the small nature of the tax increases when compared with moving costs. But higher taxes also can keep people from moving into a state, Thompson said. If states use the additional tax revenue to create jobs and reduce crime, they can overcome the unattractiveness of the higher taxes, Thompson said. Going back to Christie’s statement, let’s review: The governor blamed Democratic tax hikes for chasing away $70 billion of wealth from 2004 to 2008. Christie was not completely accurate about the destination states for the departed wealth, leaving out New York and California. Several experts agree higher taxes play a role in migration, but the governor’s spokesman couldn’t provide any specific evidence of that, and some research has found the impact to be minimal. The Boston College study -- the basis for Christie’s $70 billion figure -- also listed family- and job-related reasons as the main factors chasing people from New Jersey. We rate Christie’s statement Barely True. To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at NJ.com. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10457	"McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/28/democratic-national-committee/selectively-choosing-his-votes/	It would take a real hypocrite to announce that as president you would launch an initiative to end malaria when, as a senator, you repeatedly voted against malaria prevention efforts. That's the trap the Democratic National Committee said they caught Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain in last month after McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, announced his plan to eradicate malaria. In a news release dated March 26, the DNC claimed to fact-check McCain's malaria pledge by contrasting McCain's "rhetoric" with the "reality" that "McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators." The release proceeds to list six instances between 2001 and 2003 in which McCain voted against bills or amendments that would have boosted funding for malaria prevention. An open and shut case of hypocrisy? Not quite, as it turns out. Indeed, McCain did vote against the bills cited by the DNC. But in each case, other factors cloud the issue and, in the end, McCain mostly supported less generous alternative measures favored by his party. In the 2001 vote cited by the DNC, for example, an amendment by Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold would have boosted funding for AIDS and malaria prevention in Africa but at the same time cut funding for Defense Department military procurement to pay for it. Many Democratic senators, including Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, also voted against it. In both of the 2002 votes cited, McCain voted against an emergency supplemental spending bill to combat terrorism on the grounds that it included too many provisions — malaria funding included — that had nothing to do with terrorism. In the second of those votes, McCain was one of only 14 senators to oppose a less generous GOP alternative. And in the case of the 2003 votes cited by the DNC, Republicans said they preferred alternative legislation for a number of reasons, arguing that Democratic amendments didn't include language to encourage donations from other countries, would have exceeded budget restrictions, and might overwhelm the bureaucracy with so much money that it wouldn't be able to disburse it wisely. With the exception of the 2001 vote and one of the 2002 votes, the remaining four votes split mostly along party lines, with Democrats arguing that the GOP concerns were outweighed by the magnitude of the AIDS crisis in Africa. In the end, compromises were reached on funding measures that were somewhat less generous, which McCain supported. As a result, the DNC's charge of hypocrisy is only Half True.

pomt-11124	Says Marsha Blackburn "voted against military pay raise."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/05/tennessee-democratic-party/tennessee-democrats-slam-blackburn-military-pay-vo/	When President Donald Trump went to Nashville to boost the Senate chances of Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., he praised her for being a reliable soldier for the Republican agenda. "We need Marsha in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half," Trump said. But on one key vote, Blackburn broke with many of her Republican colleagues, and the Tennessee Democrats are chiding her for it. Blackburn was one of 90 Republicans to vote against a sweeping $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that funded agencies across the government. Inside its many pages was a 2.4 percent pay hike for the military. In an email to the media May 30, party spokesman Mark Brown had the subject line "Blackburn voted against military pay raise." The rest of the email was a copy and paste of an op-ed in the Tennessean from an Army veteran who criticized Blackburn for her vote. "This is a congresswoman that constantly touts her support for the military and veterans, so her vote against something that would improve our quality of life is both puzzling and troubling," the veteran wrote. We decided to give Blackburn’s voting record a closer look. The vote Blackburn made no secret that she opposed the spending bill. At the time of the vote, she released a statement decrying its impact on deficits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the appropriations bill would put the country deeper in debt by many billions of dollars. "Marsha has a record of supporting our military and veterans," campaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler told us. "Congressman Blackburn voted against the bloated spending package — that included a smaller military pay raise than the one she supported (2.6 percent) — because of its reckless spending." As with any all-encompassing legislation, lawmakers will find some elements they support and others they oppose. Whichever way they vote, it is difficult to tie their decision to a specific section. Past votes In her 15 years in Congress, Blackburn has voted for appropriations bills that increased military pay at least four times, in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2010. The military pay hikes in those appropriations bills ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.5 percent. There are a number of authorization bills with pay increases that Blackburn has also supported. We counted 14 over the years, including the most recent one that passed in November 2017 with a 2.4 percent pay hike. Authorization bills don’t carry the same weight as appropriations measures, because they don’t actually give agencies the green light to spend money. Despite her opposition to the latest spending bill, Blackburn welcomed Trump’s support, and several of the victories he described at the rally, such as hikes in military spending, came out of the appropriations bill she voted against. And when the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel took to Twitter to praise Trump for the military pay raises, Blackburn’s campaign retweeted the message. Our ruling The Tennessee Democratic Party said that Blackburn voted against a military pay increase. Blackburn did vote no on a $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that increased pay for members of the armed forces by 2.4 percent. However, over many years, Blackburn has a consistent track record of voting in favor of pay raises for the military. To tie her recent vote to a single part of a massive spending measure leaves out a great deal of context. In this case, the legislation was estimated to add billions to annual deficits.

pomt-12747	Says Travis County’s sheriff refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373.	false	/texas/statements/2017/mar/01/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-falsely-says-travis-county-not-enforci/	Greg Abbott, who shut off about $1.5 million in grants to Travis County out of concern that the county’s Democratic officials unduly shield unauthorized immigrants, subsequently accused the local sheriff of breaking a federal law. The Republican governor said in a Feb. 6, 2017, tweet: "Sheriff violates oath by refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 & not giving ICE info about drugs cartels & armed robbers." ICE is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that focuses on battling the illegal movement of people and trade. Abbott didn’t offer factual back-up for his charge. Separately, Wes Priddy of the sheriff’s department told us by phone there’s been no change in operations that would violate the cited law. "I don’t know where the governor is getting his information or his point of view. I suspect it’s just conjecture," Priddy said. Let’s recap the federal provisions singled out by Abbott before getting to the policy put in place by Sheriff Sally Hernandez and whether she’s not enforcing the law. Federal law Abbott did not single out any law pertaining to local police agencies accepting or refusing "detainer" requests from federal authorities seeking a hold on inmates so agents can consider them for deportation. Instead, the governor’s tweet refers to a 216-word law that’s focused on easing the flow of information between federal immigration authorities and local law agencies. Titled "Communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service," the 1990s law bars federal, state or local agencies or officials from restricting any agency or official from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration authorities "information regarding the citizenship status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual." Also, the law bars any person or agency from restricting another government entity from sending, requesting, receiving or maintaining information about any individual’s immigration status or exchanging such information with a government entity. Travis County policy We don’t know why Abbott concluded Hernandez isn’t enforcing those provisions. He didn’t say and an aide, Matt Hirsch, didn’t reply to our inquiry. But Abbott posted his tweet about three hours after a commentary piece by Hernandez was posted by the Austin American-Statesman. In the commentary, Hernandez, a Democrat elected sheriff in November 2016, defended her policy of not automatically honoring every federal request to detain immigrant inmates for up to 48 hours—with the exception of inmates charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Other inmates, she said, would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Hernandez wrote: "Our policies at the Travis County sheriff’s office are centered on all legal statutes and principles that are applicable to all. We proudly stand by our Constitution and our laws and plan to continue doing so. We will also continue to legally comply with" ICE, she wrote. A few days later, Hernandez posted a statement on the office’s website saying in part: "I am following all state and federal laws, and upholding constitutional rights to due process for all in our criminal justice system. Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated." Travis County official We asked Priddy, who oversees the county’s correctional complex, if the new policy restricts the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Abbott. Priddy told us there’s been no change in the flow of each inmate’s vital information to other law enforcement agencies including ICE. That is, Priddy said, each suspect booked into the jail continues to be fingerprinted and that information along with the person’s name and date of birth is conveyed electronically to the Texas Department of Public Safety and then, he said, to federal agencies including ICE, whose officers can then determine if a suspect merits their attention. According to the DPS, its Automated Fingerprint Information System stores the identifying characteristics of more than 4.8 million individuals. Also, Priddy said, ICE agents can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate, for instance seeking to interview a jailed individual subject to an ongoing investigation. "If so, we share and allow," Priddy said, though he said ICE officers don’t have unfettered access to inmates in the jail’s intake area, which they once did. "We are complying" with 8 USC 1373, Priddy said, adding: "We are allowing ICE the opportunity to interview inmates; we are providing them information on their requests, just as we are with any other agency." We noticed, though, the sheriff’s policy includes a provision that seemingly could fetter information flow. It states that sheriff’s office "officials shall not conduct or initiate any immigration status investigation into individuals in TCSO custody or provide information on an inmate’s release date or address to ICE." Asked about that, Priddy said by email: "The segments you are referring to are there to ensure TCSO staff do not conduct their own investigation regarding someone’s immigration status. Information regarding citizenship or immigration status is readily shared with ICE upon that agency’s request." ICE focuses on detainers Next, we asked an ICE spokeswoman, Nina Pruneda, to evaluate Abbott’s claim. Prunedo, by email, sent an agency statement that didn’t touch on any law explicitly: "ICE would welcome any changes to current policy that would allow local authorities to more fully cooperate with ICE toward achieving the shared goal of protecting public safety and national security while balancing important community policing needs," ICE said. "When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders onto the streets, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission," ICE said. Immigration experts We also asked immigration experts from different vantage points about the accuracy of Abbott’s claim. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, suggested the sheriff’s policy against employees inquiring into immigration status or providing information on a person’s release date or address conflicts with the intent of the statute noted by Abbott. By email, Vaughan pointed out a 2016 Justice Department memo that led us to an explanation of 8 USC 1373 by the Republican-majority House Judiciary Committee. That 1996 explanation says the panel’s intent was to "give state and local officials the authority to communicate with the INS regarding the presence, whereabouts and activities of illegal aliens." (After 9/11, Congress dissolved the Immigration and Naturalization Service with ICE assuming some of its duties.) "This section," the committee said, "is designed to prevent any state or local law, ordinance, executive order, policy, constitutional provision or decision of any federal or state court that prohibits or in any way restricts any communication between state and local officials and the INS." We also heard back from Lena Graber, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which has as its mission working with and educating immigrants, community organizations and the legal sector to continue to build a democratic society that values diversity and the rights of all people. Generally, Graber commented by email, the sheriff’s policy is limited to limiting detainer requests honored by the department and doesn’t extend to restricting information flow, which would conflict with the law highlighted by Abbott, she said. Sheriff revised policy Graber also underscored a section of the sheriff’s policy that wasn’t initially there, we noticed. The added section, point No. 10 in the policy, tracks with 8 USC 1373, stating: "This policy in no way prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual’s immigration or citizenship status, and nothing in this policy shall be construed to prohibit or restrict TCSO personnel from exchanging information regarding the immigration or citizenship status of any individual with ICE." We asked the sheriff’s office why the section was added. By email, spokeswoman Kristen Dark replied that the provision was added Jan. 31, 2017 "in the interest of clarity." Simultaneously, Dark wrote, another part of the policy was expanded, in part with: "Information regarding incarceration status of inmates is available on the TCSO website. Information regarding court dates is available on the Travis County Courts’ website." Those sentences were inserted in front of an existing declaration about department personnel not using resources to help enforce federal immigration laws. Our ruling Abbott said Sheriff Hernandez refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373. Given the sheriff’s policy against automatically granting federal requests to detain immigrant-inmates or using personnel to enforce immigration laws, we can see how someone might speculate about the sheriff not enforcing, or complying with, the cited law about easing the flow of information about immigration or citizenship statuses. But Abbott didn't back up his claim, which also wasn’t explicitly borne out by ICE. Notably too, the sheriff's policy was expanded before Abbott leveled his claim to specify that it shouldn't be read as slowing or stopping any information flow between office personnel and ICE regarding the legal status of individuals. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-12737	Says White House adviser Steve Bannon said, "Nobody can blame you for beating your wife if it’s out of love."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/02/blog-posting/trump-adviser-steve-bannon-did-not-say-its-ok-beat/	Like a virus, an old fake news story that claims White House adviser Steve Bannon is an advocate of domestic abuse has made the leap from one site full of contrived articles to another. A Nov. 14, 2016, post on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) starts with a headline that reads, "Stephen Bannon: ‘Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love’." It was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of its crusade to winnow fake news from users’ social media feeds. The story has been popular on Facebook, which notes the USPOLN.com story link has been shared more than 58,000 times in the past four months. The story, which is not real, makes up quotes about Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News who became White House chief strategist for President Donald Trump. The post includes a reference to real charges Bannon faced in 1996, when his then-wife Mary Louise Piccard accused him of domestic abuse. Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness. Those charges were dropped in August 1996 when Piccard did not appear in court. The couple divorced in 1997. The post cites a Politico interview (which is fake), quoting Bannon as saying that marriage is great because "you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship." The quote isn’t worded the same way as the headline. "And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love," Bannon is quoted as saying. "As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties." Again, Bannon did not say these things. They’re made up. USPOLN.com, which we’ve written about before, identifies itself as "a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The domain is registered to an address in Kosovo. The site didn’t respond to our attempts to contact them via email. But the story actually comes from yet another joke site, in an Aug. 26, 2016, post on Politicops.com. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The same story also appears on other sites in the Newslo family, like Politicalo.com and Politicot.com. The articles were posted the day after stories recounting Bannon’s 1996 ran in outlets like Politico and the New York Times. Newslo.com stories take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference.

pomt-04985	Says Jim Frishe wanted to "tax us for doing our taxes" through an accountant.	true	/florida/statements/2012/jul/20/accountability-government/attack-ad-says-jim-frishe-raised-taxes-accountants/	St. Petersburg Rep. Jim Frishe got his start in the Florida House in the 1980s, when the Republican served six years and took a vote to raise taxes. The widely unpopular "services tax" of 1987 was repealed months later amid a public uproar. But a group supporting his GOP opponent in the Senate District 22 primary isn’t letting Frishe, or voters, forget that initial vote. A television commercial riffs Frishe’s own slogan -- "This Republican has walked the walk for over 40 years" -- by saying he’s trampled voters with new taxes. Man: "Jim Frishe says he’s walked the walk in politics for 40 years. The truth is, he’s walked all over us with taxes." Woman: "Yeah, Frishe voted to raise our taxes on everything from dry-cleaning to pest control. Forty years is enough." Second woman: "Frishe voted to increase fees on car tags and fishing permits." Second man: "Frishe even wanted to tax accountants." Third woman: "You mean he wants to tax us for doing our taxes?" Third man: "Forty years of this is enough." Fourth woman: "More than enough." The ad is sponsored by Accountability in Government, an electioneering group that supports St. Petersburg Republican Rep. Jeff Brandes for the seat. We tried to contact the group’s chairman but did not hear back. The group sponsors a website, 40yearsisenough.com, that contains a lengthy document of news clips summarizing the tax controversy and newspaper editorials against Frishe. (As an aside, we want to first address the "Forty years is enough" rhetoric. It’s taken from Frishe’s own ads, where he talks about being active within the Republican Party and for Ronald Reagan. To be clear, he has served six terms in the Legislature. Six years from 1984 to 1990, and six more from 2006-2012.) Of all the tax claims, we were most intrigued by the exchange about taxing accountant services. Did Frishe really want to "tax us for doing our taxes?" The tone of the ad might suggest the taxes Frishe supported stuck. The truth is, some did and some didn’t, and some votes referenced in the ad happened more than 20 years apart. This vote on taxing accountant services, among many other services, happened 25 years ago. Tampa Republican Bob Martinez was governor and Democrats controlled the Legislature. Frishe was in the Republican minority. There was a push that year to broaden the state’s tax base, Frishe explained. There was no recession that year; rather, Florida’s economy was booming. Still, the state needed money to fix roads and pay for an influx of new public school students. To do that, the Legislature passed a 5 percent sales tax on many personal and professional services, including accountants’ fees, agricultural services, house-building, architect and engineering fees, pest control, cleaning services, computer and data processing, advertising, legal fees, magazine and newspaper subscriptions and newspaper rack sales, pet-grooming and cleaning services. The April vote on SB 777 was 83-31, with some Pinellas County Republicans, including Frishe, former Rep. and Sen. Dennis Jones, and current lobbyist Pete Dunbar, joining the Democrats to pass it despite the objections of many conservatives. Lawmakers said it was the biggest tax increase in state history and expected it to raise $761.1 million for the state in its first year and $1.2 billion the year after that. Martinez swiftly signed it into law. "There is no joy and glee in taxation, but there is a sense that this House and this Senate have taken the first step forward for protecting Florida's future," said House Speaker Jon Mills, D-Gainesville, according to a Tampa Bay Times account (then the St. Petersburg Times). Someone had to be the "adult in the room," Frishe said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida, taking a jab against Brandes, 36, whom Frishe indirectly mocks in another commercial as "a young wannabe politician, beating his chest, claiming to be a Reagan Republican." A lobbying fight to repeal the tax emerged that summer, with the Florida Association of Broadcasters railing against it loudly. Martinez summoned lawmakers for a special session on the issue, and lawmakers repealed the services sales tax on Dec. 10, 1987, and replaced it with a one percent increase on the state sales tax on goods. Frishe voted against the measure. In the House Journal, which is an official record of the proceedings, Frishe explained his vote by saying that he supported repealing the tax on services, but he opposed raising the sales tax on goods. "I favor repealing the sales tax on services as it passed in the 1987 Regular Session," Frishe wrote. "I have voted 'No' on CS/CS/SB 5-D and CS/SB 6-D because it raises the state sales tax from 5 cents to 6 cents. This merely continues to raise the needed revenue for our state from the same shrinking base and remains as regressive as it was at 5 cents. Florida has serious needs, but to continue 'business as usual' will not solve the long term needs of this state." Would Florida’s economy be in a stronger place if the tax had remained? "I think it unquestionably would," Frishe told PolitiFact Florida. We asked Brandes for his thoughts, even though he did not sponsor the ad. "I think the question is, is it a fact that Jim Frishe voted to raise taxes?" Brandes said. "Not that he later changed his mind. And I think clearly it’s a fact that he did." Our ruling A third-party group says Frishe voted to tax people for "doing our taxes." In 1987, Frishe did vote for a plan to tax services in the state of Florida, including accountants' fees. He later said he favored a proposal to repeal the services tax, but he could not support the repeal in the Legislature becuase it included a provision that raised the sales tax on goods. While those caveats give a fuller picture of Frishe's position and his vote, they do not undermine the statement made by the group Accountability in Government. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14872	"Over half of the black workers in this country earn less" than $15 an hour.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/12/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-over-half-black-workers-earn-l/	During an all-candidates’ Democratic forum in Rock Hill, S.C., on Nov. 6, 2015, host Rachel Maddow of MSNBC asked Bernie Sanders how he could win the support of African-American voters, a crucial Democratic voting group in the early primary state of South Carolina. Maddow noted that Sanders was polling at 8 percent in a recent poll in South Carolina and asked if he would be able to convince African-American voters that he could press for their issues. Sanders responded in part by citing his economic platform, which he said would positively impact African-Americans. "I have the economic and social justice agenda now that, once we get the word out, will, in fact, resonate with the African-American community," Sanders said. "We're talking about raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. … Over half of the black workers in this country earn less." We wondered whether Sanders was right that "over half of the black workers in this country earn less" than $15 an hour. So we took a closer look. We turned to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which, among other things, tracks the median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by race. The bureau’s data for the third quarter of 2015 shows that the median weekly earnings for African-American workers was $624. If you divide that by the standard 40 hours in a workweek, it works out to $15.60 per hour. That means that half of African-American workers earned less than $15.60. So Sanders was close on this but exaggerated slightly. His claim is off by a little more than 4 percent. When we asked Sanders’ campaign for their source, they pointed us to a report issued earlier this month from the National Employment Law Project that found that 54.1 percent of African-American workers earned less than $15.00 an hour. The group calculated that figure using data from 2012 through 2014. That’s a reasonable measurement, but while our figure covers a briefer period of time, it’s also more current, reflecting the continued economic growth since the end of 2014. Our ruling Sanders said that "over half of the black workers in this country earn less" than $15 an hour. Depending on the time frame used, the data shows that roughly half of black workers earn less than $15. The most recent data shows that half earn less than $15.60, which is a little higher than what Sanders said, but his number is not far off. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02240	"Georgia has the nation's fifth largest Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition program, serving more than 270,000 mothers, babies and children every day."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/15/georgia-department-public-health/georgias-wic-program-ranked-7th-largest/	One government program putting food on the table for the needy is the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program, most often known by the acronym WIC. The program targets low-income, nutritionally at-risk groups -- mostly pregnant women, new moms, babies and children up to age 5. Participants receive vouchers to buy qualifying healthy foods -- such as fruit, vegetables, peanut butter and milk. (No lobster allowed under WIC, unlike the food stamp program. See food stamps Politifact, March 21.) As its name suggests, the WIC program, which is 100 percent federally funded, is meant to supplement what’s already in the pantry. The average WIC participant received $45.47 worth of groceries a month in 2013, probably not enough on its own to keep body and soul together. During the recent General Assembly session, when GOP lawmakers were pushing through a bill to require drug tests of some food stamp recipients, a reader asked for a fact check on WIC. He jogged our memory last week after seeing a blog from the state Department of Public Health, the agency that administers the program. The post stated: "Georgia has the nation's fifth largest Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition program, serving more than 270,000 mothers, babies and children every day." "Could this be true?" the reader asked. "Dare I ask what that’s costing us?" We reached out to Nancy Nydam, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Health. Based on costs, Georgia’s program ranked fifth among the 50 states, the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia for four years, from 2009 to 2012, Nydam said. But that’s no longer the case. New data show that the Georgia program dropped to seventh in the rankings for 2013, she said. (The blogger was going on 2013 projections, not actual data for the year, Nydam said.) The new data, provided by the Department of Public Health, show that, for 2013, Georgia ranked seventh behind: California, $1,095,910,535; Texas, $482,192,108; New York, $445,559,283; Florida, $354,990,320; Puerto Rico, $242,747,993; and Illinois, $215,142,474. Georgia spent about $215.1 million for food and other services for 289,527 WIC recipients, including nutrition and breast-feeding education, and referrals for health and social services, Nydam said. Enrollment in the program was down 14,340 from 2012. It peaked in 2009, as the economy was crumbling, at 323,353, state data show. Costs for the Georgia program fell by more than $59 million, from $274.5 million in 2012, due to a couple of factors, Nydam said. Besides having fewer women and children on the rolls, Georgia has been working with manufacturers to lower the program’s costs for food. As a result, state spending on food for program participants was reduced from $225 million in 2011 to $204 million in 2012 and to $157 million for 2013, state data show. The feds also have pushed states to do more to combat fraud. After it became a stand-alone agency, the Department of Public Health created an inspector general’s office to investigate fraud in the WIC program and developed and issued new WIC vouchers, complete with a foil seal and watermark designed to deter counterfeiting, Nydam said. The inspector general’s office has prosecuted 16 people for WIC vendor fraud, terminated 183 vendors and recouped $17 million as restitution. Our conclusion: The blog statement said Georgia ranks fifth among the states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories based on the cost of its WIC program. That was true for four years, through 2012. Once Politifact inquired, state officials said there was new data showing the state dropped to seventh for 2013. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-13906	"Despite the rhetoric from Democrat politicians, more people are employed this year than at any point in the history of Wisconsin."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-right-there-are-more-people-working-e/	Jobs have been a constant theme for Gov. Scott Walker -- and a persistent point of attack from his opponents. In the run-up to the state Democratic Party convention, Gov. Scott Walker issued a string of 10 claims about the state’s economy on Facebook and Twitter. The first one caught our attention. "FACT CHECK: Despite the rhetoric from Democrat politicians, more people are employed this year than at any point in the history of Wisconsin," Walker tweeted June 3, 2016. We’re in the fact-checking business, of course. And we closely followed Walker’s 2010 campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term. In the end, the number totaled 146,795. We rated it Promise Broken. So, is employment really at an all-time high? Looking at the numbers When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and its Local Area Unemployment Statistics report, the gold standard for statewide employment data. We looked at employment numbers going back to the 1930s. The agency counts someone as employed if during the week examined they did any work as a paid employee, work for their own business or farm, or worked 15 or more hours unpaid for an enterprise operated by a family member. People who had a job but were not working because of vacations, illness or other reasons are counted as employed. In March of 2016, the most recent date for which figures are available, more than 3 million people were employed -- the highest ever. Previously, the employment number peaked in 2008 at around 2.9 million. We wondered how many other states could make the same claim. Of the 12 states in the Midwest, six others are also at their highest number of employed persons, for seven in all. (Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska.) Some of that can be attributed to population growth. In 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated Wisconsin’s population at 5.7 million, up from 5.6 million in the 2010 census and up from 5.3 million in 2000. During the last 10 years, Wisconsin’s population grew 3.7 percent, while over the same period employment grew 2.4 percent. In the last five years, population grew 1.1 percent and employment increased 6.3 percent. "Population growth plays a role in driving employment higher, which is why many economists like looking at things like the unemployment rate as a measure of the health of the labor market," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management. As of March, the state’s unemployment rate sat at 4.5 percent, down from recession highs of over 9 percent. The unemployment rate itself is an imperfect measure. The rate does not include people who have dropped out of the labor force and stopped looking for work, nor does it consider job quality -- that is people who are considered "underemployed."

In the debate, which was sponsored by Eye On Oshkosh, the two candidates, Democrat Mark Harris and Republican Dan Feyen, offered their solutions to the problems facing the district and the state. Feyen later won the seat by almost 10,000 votes. While Feyen was talking about job growth and emphasizing the need for a “great tax climate,” he made a claim about available jobs in Wisconsin. “We have 90,000 jobs available right now on Wisconsin Job Center website,” Feyen said. 	verified	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/18/are-jobs-available-in-oshkosh-and-fond-du-lac/	None	None	None	Noah Broder	None	Are Jobs Available in Oshkosh and Fond du Lac?

Fred Thompson was the lone dissenter on several popular bills, amendments and resolutions that asserted federal power over traditionally state functions, records show. In 1997, he was the lone "nay" vote against a bill called the Volunteer Protection Act, which exempted Good Samaritans from being sued. In 2000, he was the only senator who voted against a resolution "encouraging local schools to insist on zero-tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug use." In 2001, he offered the only "nay" on an amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act that shielded teachers from civil liability. "I don't think the federal government ought to be federalizing something that's been under the state purview for 200 years," Thompson told a crowd in Sioux City, Iowa, Sept. 7, 2007. "Give me a good reason why, when the federal government... can't get its own act together, why it ought to be taking on these other things in order to get a press release and a headline? ... That's not the right thing to do." But he wasn't perfect. As a senator from 1994 to 2003, Thompson did divert from his federalist philosophy in at least one big way: supporting President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which sets federal standards for local schools.

pomt-14435	When John Kasich became governor of Ohio, "there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/mar/08/arnold-schwarzenegger/arnold-schwarzeneggers-claim-about-ohios-financial/	Hoping to add some political muscle to Republican John Kasich’s bid for the White House, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed the Ohio governor for president during a rally in Columbus this week. But did Schwarzenegger, a fellow Republican, bend the truth when he described Ohio’s financial turnaround under Kasich? In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger called Kasich an "action hero," saying that when Kasich became governor in 2011, "there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus." We decided to check that claim. Kasich has made similar statements throughout his campaign for president, and highlighted this fiscal transformation on his website. "I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus," Kasich said during the Republican presidential debate in Cleveland last year. The national PolitiFact team took a deeper look at Kasich’s claim last August. It’s very similar to Schwarzenegger’s claim. Here’s what it found: An $8 billion hole? There’s an argument for $8 billion, but there’s also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011. The $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich’s budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with "conceptually" in a 2011 interview, though he took issue with some of the methodological details. Whatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this as a "hole" rather than a deficit. Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. Schwarzenegger used the term "deficit," which we interpreted as a minor misstatement rather than an attempt to deceive. A $2 billion surplus? This figure is clearer. Ohio’s Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state’s "rainy day fund" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. The surplus remained above $2 billion this week, said a spokesman for the budget office. Does Kasich deserve credit? It’s not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state’s improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state’s fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. Schwarzenegger’s claim strongly implies Kasich played a central role in the turnaround, though it doesn’t explicitly link the two together. But it’s important to remember that Kasich took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio’s. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. As of December, the national unemployment rate was 5 percent and the rate in Ohio was 4.8 percent. So Kasich’s timing has been fortunate. Our ruling In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger said that when Kasich became governor, "there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus." Kasich said, "I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus." It’s possible to argue over whether the starting point should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich and Schwarzenegger didn’t pull that figure out of thin air, though it certainly was high by historical standards. Kasich also used the term "hole," which is more appropriate than "deficit." Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it’s worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that "I" did it, since the state’s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery. The statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.	None	Arnold Schwarzenegger	None	None	None	2016-03-08T15:00:33	2016-03-06	['Ohio', 'John_Kasich']

pomt-13896	"Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/28/donald-trump/checking-donald-trump-hillary-clintons-role-growin/	Donald Trump blames Hillary Clinton for the United States getting beaten by China on trade. "Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs," he tweeted on June 21, 2016. He said something similar during a speech the following day -- that "our trade deficit with China soared 40 percent during Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned." To analyze Trump’s assertion, we looked at two key questions. First, did the trade deficit with China go up by 40 percent during President Barack Obama’s first term -- the period when Clinton was serving as secretary of state? And second, given how directly Trump blamed Clinton, how much responsibility does she have for the rising trade deficit? We found that Trump’s 40-percent figure is somewhat valid, though it depends on when you start the clock running. Where he goes wrong is saying that it’s Clinton’s fault. Did the trade deficit with China go up by 40 percent during Obama’s first term? The trade deficit with China did go up during Obama’s first term, and one can argue that the increase was as high as 40 percent. Here are recent statistics for the trade deficit with China as compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: The rise between 2008, the last year before Obama took office, and 2012, the final year of his first term, amounted to 18.4 percent, which is less than half as big as Trump said. Looking instead at the period 2009 through 2013 does produce a 40 percent increase, however, and that’s in line with what Trump said. It’s worth noting that this time frame uses 2009 as the baseline year. That was the worst point of the recession, which means that the baseline that year was artificially low. Incidentally, the evidence for the loss of "millions of jobs" is somewhat mixed. The strongest support comes from an Economic Policy Institute study that found that between 2001 and 2013, the trade deficit with China "eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs," of which 2.4 million were in manufacturing. But it’s worth noting that the Economic Policy Institute is a think tank with backing from labor unions, which are often skeptical of free-trade policies. Other analysts who take a more free-market orientation, such as the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argue that the connection between trade deficits and job losses is much less direct than the Economic Policy Institute study suggests. All told, Trump’s 40 percent figure is credible, though it’s important to note that the number is somewhat cherry-picked. How much responsibility does Clinton have for the rising trade deficit? The support for this part of Trump’s tweet is weaker. First off, the State Department has a voice in trade policy, but it is not the most important one. "The secretary of state is only slightly involved with trade policy," said Joel P. Trachtman, a professor of international law at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. "Trade policy is set at the presidential level, and the U.S. Trade Representative’s office otherwise has the greatest role in negotiations and agenda setting. So, among U.S. government officials, the secretary of state has a minor effect." Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agreed. "The secretary of state has little if any influence over trade deficits," he said. But what if Trump was saying that Clinton was part of the Obama administration, and that Obama is to blame for China’s growing trade deficit? That’s not the case, either. For starters, the trend lines go back long before Obama took office. "The United States has been running a trade deficit since 1996, with the big drop coming after the bursting of the ‘tech bubble’ in 2001 under George W. Bush," said Timothy J. Sturgeon, a senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Industrial Performance Center. The statement, he said, "is extremely misleading." Indeed, broader economic forces -- more so than an administration’s policy decisions -- tend to determine the size of trade deficits, experts said. "Trade deficits are the product of three macro forces over which the secretary of state has no control -- the trade-weighted dollar exchange rate; the state of the world economy outside the United States; and the state of the U.S. economy," Hufbauer said. Other trends also complicate an easy assignment of "blame" for trade deficits with China, experts added. Martin Baily, a Brookings Institution economist, previously told us that some manufacturing job losses stem from trade, but not all. "Part of what has happened is that there has been consolidation in the industry to take advantage of larger scale production," Baily said. "Manufacturing is changing because of technology and trade, and that inevitably will lead to plant closures." Alternately, economists Robert Z. Lawrence and Lawrence Edwards have written in the Harvard Business Review that a lack of demand led to manufacturing job losses. American factories grew to be too efficient, and therefore needed fewer workers to meet the needs of consumers, they argued. Finally, as we saw earlier with the data quirks around 2009, the Great Recession likely played a role in how the deficit grew during Obama’s first term. "This economic expansion would be expected to expand imports more than exports would expand, and thus the trade deficit would be expected to widen, holding other things constant," Lawrence J. White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. "This surely is the overwhelming reason for any expansion of the the U.S.-China trade deficit during this period." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs." Trump is largely accurate about the 40 percent bump, though that number is somewhat cherry-picked, and he has a point that some -- though not all -- estimates suggest that trade with China has resulted in millions of job losses. However, Trump’s strong words of blame for Clinton overplays the role she had in this process. Not only do other administration players have a bigger role in setting trade policy, but the growth in the trade deficit predates the Obama administration and has a lot to do with factors that any administration would have little control over.

pomt-12918	"Social Security is in trouble (it’s going bankrupt by 2034)."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/jan/17/sam-johnson/sam-johnson-airs-half-true-claim-social-security-g/	A Texas congressman forecasted disaster within two decades unless Congress adopts a fix to the Social Security program. U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, declared in a Dec. 10, 2016, online post: "Social Security is in trouble (it’s going bankrupt by 2034)." Johnson, a former Texas House member and POW who also has announced plans not to seek re-election in 2018, included with his Facebook post a web link to a Forbes magazine news article about his freshly-introduced plan for Social Security reform. That plan, he wrote in his post, would prevent benefits from being "immediately cut" by 20 percent when the Social Security fund runs dry. Johnson’s 54-page proposal would change how benefits are calculated, lowering benefits for high-income workers and increasing them for low-income workers, and also raise the age at which workers could claim Social Security retirement benefits from the existing 66 to 69. Social Security in the federal budget Social Security, established by a 1935 law, adds up to the nation’s universal support program for retired, disabled or dependent Americans. In 2015, too, it accounted for the largest single chunk of federal spending, racking up $882 billion in expenses that year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office, "The Federal Budget in 2015" And it’s no secret that barring intervention, the program is headed for shrinkage. In May 2013, PolitiFact Ohio rated Half True a claim that "the Social Security trust fund is sound," finding credible forecasts of the program’s fiscal fade; the CBO in 2012 said the fund would run dry by 2034 under current law. Millions of Americans also consider Social Security vital income. In 2015, PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True a claim that one third of the country’s seniors were depending on Social Security for 90 percent of their income; both figures were actually greater. As of November 2016, some 66 million Americans received Social Security payments, which averaged $1,241.66 monthly, according to the Social Security Administration. About 41 million beneficiaries were older than age 65 and about 25 million of those individuals relied on the aid for half or more of their monthly incomes. So, was Johnson correct that the program will be bankrupt by 2034? Johnson cites trustees' report We emailed Johnson’s Washington office and got a reply from his press secretary, Adrienne Rimmer, who sent a 272-page report from the board of trustees of the Social Security program. The report, dated June 22, 2016, made projections for the future of Social Security, which is formally called the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program (OASDI) reflecting the combination of two insurance programs: old age and survivors insurance and then disability insurance. Rimmer pointed us to language in the report stating: "Under the Trustees’ intermediate assumptions, projected OASDI costs will exceed total income by increasing amounts starting in 2020, and the dollar level of the combined trust fund reserves declines until reserves become depleted in 2034." Depleted? That sounds like nearly emptied as in almost bankrupt. Still, the trustees predicted there would remain money sufficient to pay reduced benefits. The report states: "At the time of depletion of these combined reserves, continuing income to the combined trust funds would be sufficient to pay 79 percent of scheduled benefits." The cause for projected depletion of the funds, according to the report, is "the retirement of the baby boom generation will increase the number of beneficiaries much faster than the number of covered workers increases." To refresh: The baby boom generation was born in about the two decades following WWII, a period when the U.S. birth rate surged nearly 50 percent over pre-war levels, according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control. The birth rate then tapered from about 26.5 births per 1,000 Americans in 1948 to about 14 in 2009. That cohort born in the post-war decades began to retire, and thus began to draw retirement benefits, after 2010. As more baby boomers retire, they will switch from a source of income for social security to an expense. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2014 that the number of Americans age 65 and older would grow from 22 per every 100 working-age people in 2012 to 35 per every 100 working-age people in 2030. That’s why the trustees, in their report, predicted that total program costs will begin to exceed income in 2020, with all cash reserves expended by 2034. So we could see how Johnson reached his conclusion. Bankrupt or not? And does the trustees’ forecast break out to Social Security going bankrupt? We noticed, for starters, that the trustees’ analysis, slated for its next update in July 2017, indicates there’s a minimal possibility the fund doesn’t dry up until at least 2091. But otherwise the latest report presents three scenarios, of "low," "intermediate" and "high" costs to the program, based on assumptions about birth and death rates, growth in wages, interest rates and the consumer price index. For the low-cost scenario, the report states, the board assumed a relatively high birth rate, a relatively high death rate and relatively high immigration--meaning many people entering the workforce and fewer retirees living long enough to collect substantial benefits. The low-cost scenario also assumes relatively high worker productivity and wage growth plus relatively high inflation and low unemployment--all of this adding up to workers drawing bigger paychecks and paying more into Social Security. The high-cost scenario, in contrast, assumes low birth and death rates and low immigration, all of this placing more stress on the fund. SOURCE: Document, "The 2016 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal old-age and survivors insurance and federal disability insurance trust funds," Board of Trustees, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance trust funds, June 22, 2016 Johnson’s conclusions were based on the intermediate scenario -- though the report said "significant uncertainty surrounds the intermediate assumptions." Then again, when the report authors ran 5,000 simulations with randomly assigned values to the key parameters, they found a 95 percent chance that the fund would dry up between 2029 and 2045, leaving benefits to be paid solely from incoming payroll tax receipts. News reports don't say 'bankrupt' Seeking non-governmental context, we looked up news articles from the time of the trustees’ report’s release. Up front, we noticed, none of the stories on the trustees' forecast includes the word "bankrupt," The Wall Street Journal reported on June 22, 2016: "Social Security, Medicare face insolvency over 20 years, trustees report." The article said: "Social Security faces depletion by 2034." Around the same date, Time magazine reported that "the combined trust funds that help pay old age and disability benefits are likely to run out by 2034," and The Washington Post wrote, "the Social Security trust fund has enough cash to pay full benefits for another 18 years." Outside experts concur it's not bankruptcy For more perspective, we queried several outside experts including Mike Brandl, a senior lecturer in economics at The Ohio State University. So, Social Security going bankrupt? "It’s kind of a scare tactic to use that kind of terminology," Brandl said by phone. "There is a legal definition of bankruptcy. When a firm or a person goes bankrupt, what happens generally is the creditors puts in a claim with the courts to recover their debt." According to the website for U.S. federal courts,"bankruptcy helps people who can no longer pay their debts get a fresh start by liquidating assets to pay their debts or by creating a repayment plan." A business can can either liquidate or reorganize in order to claim bankruptcy. In contrast, under the scenario outlined in the trustees’ report, the Social Security program wouldn’t liquidate assets or be reorganized after 2034; it would simply shrink what is pays in benefits. That is, Brandl told us, Social Security would "become insolvent," meaning it wouldn’t be able to pay its debts in full. We ran Brandl's analysis past Josh Gordon, policy director of the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, which sponsors research and education about the federal budget. Gordon agreed by phone: "Bankrupt is the wrong word to use. Bankruptcy implies it runs out of money, it doesn’t exist, it has to liquidate its assets, and nothing of the sort could happen to the Social Security program." We also connected with Thomas Saving, a Social Security trustee from 2000 through 2007 and director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University. Saving said by phone that regardless of bankruptcy’s definition, the trustees’ report made clear that Social Security will not be able to pay its bills in full after 2034 without a change in law. Savings added that in his view, a change in law was "certain" to be adopted by Congress because "it’s impossible to imagine that you make all these promises and you’re going to renege on them." Promises? Saving noted that working Americans pay into Social Security with the understanding that they will eventually draw benefits. So, Saving suggested, lawmakers couldn’t conceivably let the program die. Saving later emailed us a web link to a Social Security Administration web page listing nine categories of likely social security reforms intended to maintain solvency. They range from raising the cap on a federal cap on taxable income, to taxation of benefits and investments, raising the age at which a person automatically qualifies for retirement benefits, creating personal Social Security accounts or changing the rules by which children or spouses of workers receive benefits. Our ruling Johnson said the Social Security program "is going bankrupt by 2034." Johnson's cited government scenario indicates a mismatch between Social Security revenues and obligations will likely result in shortfalls and benefit cuts by 2034. But the relevant report also says the scenario's underlying assumptions come with "significant uncertainty." Regardless, it's clear that at some future date Social Security will have to rely solely on incoming payroll tax receipts to cover what would likely be reduced benefits. That’s trouble, as Johnson said. Yet it’s not bankruptcy, which suggests a terminal shutdown. We rate this claim Half True.

Bernie Sanders says by addressing economic inequality, he would also correct racial injustices. Sanders railed against Wall Street in his response to a question about race relations in the Feb. 11 Democratic debate in Milwaukee, Wis. "Turns out that the African-American community and Latino community were hit especially hard," Sanders said. "As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse." That claim stood out to us. Is it true that black wealth was slashed so dramatically as a result of the financial crisis? Sanders understood correctly. His campaign referred us to a 2013 report from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers. "According to the report, African-Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling homeownership rates and loss of jobs," it reads. The report refers to Pew Research Center data from 2011 that shows the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from $12,124 in 2005 to $5,677 in 2009. Technically, this loss fits the timeline of the housing crisis in 2006. A 2014 Pew report more closely follows the financial crisis of 2007. According to that report, median net worth of the black household decreased from $19,200 in 2007 to $11,000 in 2013 (in 2013 dollars). That’s a loss of 43 percent. Of course, the two economic crises are intertwined, and both Pew reports note that the housing bubble and the recession that followed "took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites." Here’s a chart from the Pew Center that demonstrates this: Census Bureau data corroborates, if not magnifies, this point: Black median net worth decreased 61 percent from 2005 to 2009. Whites, in contrast, lost 21 percent of their wealth. Our ruling Sanders said, "The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse." Estimates for how much wealth blacks lost from 2005 to 2009 — as a result of the housing bubble — range from 53 percent to 61 percent. African-American net worth plummeted 43 percent from 2007 to 2013 — as a result of the financial crisis. Because the two financial crises are inseparable, we won’t quibble with Sanders’ timeline. We rate his claim True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-11T22:54:40	2016-02-11	['None']
pomt-08061	"The Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his [transportation] plan."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/24/ward-armstrong/del-ward-armstrong-says-gov-mcdonnell-didnt-consul/	The chairman of Virginia’s Republican Party recently sent a letter to all the state’s Democrat legislators soliciting ideas for how to address state road needs. "If for some reason you feel uncomfortable reaching out to the Governor, just drop by our Headquarters on Grace Street," Pat Mullins wrote. "You don't even have to come in the front door. We're putting a drop box in the atrium. Just open the door, and drop your plan. Any format you like." Mullins even offered to carry each idea to the Governor’s office himself. The missive was not well-received by a number of Democrats, House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong among them. On Monday, Armstrong fired a response saying Mullins’ letter "reveals a certain desperation by the Republican Party of Virginia." He also took aim at the Governor’s recently released $4 billion transportation plan. "On Monday we learned that the Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan to borrow $3 billion and take another $1 billion out of the general fund to pay for transportation," Armstrong wrote. "Despite your entreaties, that revelation makes it difficult to believe that the Governor is inclined to listen to the Democrats if he didn’t even run this plan by the Republican majority in the House of Delegates before sending it out." It would seem remarkable if the Governor hadn’t consulted with fellow Republicans before trotting out the plan, so we thought we’d look into that. Asked for a source, Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, pointed us to a Washington Post blog. It reported unnamed legislators were miffed that House and Senate Republican legislative caucuses were not briefed prior to the announcement of the plan. Is briefing the caucuses common protocol before making such an announcement? "It’s a best practice, but not as commonly done as one might assume," said Bill Leighty, who was chief of staff to former Govs. Mark R. Warner and Timothy M. Kaine. It’s accurate the governor did not collectively brief the 78 lawmakers who belong to either the House or Senate Republican caucus. Armstrong seemed to take it one step further by saying the governor "did not consult members of his own party" before releasing the plan. McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin said Armstrong is wrong. "The governor’s transportation proposals were all derived from transportation work groups that included Republican lawmakers," he said. "Every proposal was discussed. Further, the governor and staff are in constant communication with Republican leaders in both houses regarding all policy proposals made by this office." We talked to talk to a few Republicans to make sure. Del. Glenn Oder, R-Newport News, said he helped shape and vet the proposal as part of a 12-person transportation work group that included Republicans from the House and Senate as well as the administration. Read the quote from Armstrong’s letter, Oder responded: "Who in the world would have told him that? He (Armstrong) didn’t call and ask me." Oder said everyone in the group was aware of everything in the governor’s announcement. "I can’t emphasize enough how extensive the discussions have been on these issues," he said. "To say that no one was aware just isn’t anywhere close to accurate." What about Republican leadership? "I don’t know where he gets that kind of stuff," said G. Paul Nardo, chief of staff to House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford. "There’s a lot of things you could probably criticize the administration for, but communication isn’t one of them." Nardo noted the Post blog didn’t name or quote any Republicans complaining that they weren’t consulted. "It’s just ridiculous. The speaker was involved with it in specific discussions early on and certainly kept abreast," he said, adding that Howell was made aware of the announcement days beforehand and knew "the broad contours" of the plan. "We didn’t see a press release beforehand or anything like that," Nardo said, noting that sending out a mass email to legislators in advance wouldn’t be prudent since specifics might leak. House Majority Whip Bill Janis, R-Henrico, echoed Nardo. "I am aware that the Governor directly or representatives of the Governor spoke to House leadership beforehand," Janis said. "The notion that they’re not making us aware of stuff beforehand is just flat out wrong," he said. "Whether we’re having detailed three-hour long meetings about each and every policy initiative they have...that’s just not a realistic expectation." Let’s recap. Armstrong wrote the "Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan." Clearly, not every Republican legislator was in the loop. While not every GOP legislator was in the loop, plenty were involved in shaping the plan and the Republican leadership says they were kept informed along the way. We find the claim False.

pomt-03234	"60 percent of Texas 8th graders are not proficient in math. Only 26% have a teacher with a undergraduate major in math."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/aug/16/george-p-bush/bush-claim-about-proficiency-texas-8th-graders-mat/	George P. Bush, a Fort Worth Republican running for Texas land commissioner in 2014, wrote on Twitter that "60 percent of Texas 8th graders are not proficient in math." Bush’s July 2, 2013, tweet continued: "Only 26% have a teacher with a undergraduate major in math." We were curious about both of his claims, but also wondered why a land commissioner hopeful would zero in on middle-school math. By email, Bush spokesman Trey Newton pointed out that the commissioner manages state lands, which generate school revenue. Also, he said, Bush is a former schoolteacher who has helped local charter schools. Texas eighth-graders ‘proficient’ in math? Per Bush’s Twitter post, Newton pointed us to Change the Equation, a non-partisan CEO-led initiative to mobilize businesses to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning. An initiative web page presents "proficiency" results from the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress, which for nearly four decades has tested random samples of students around the country with results serving as a kind of national report card. In every state every two years, clutches of eighth graders are tested in math and reading. On the tests, significantly, a "proficient" score means a student has more than mastered the subject. A student attaining a lower score might qualify for what the government calls its "basic" rating. In 2011, the minimum score to be considered "proficient" on the eighth-grade math assessment was 299 on a scale of 0 to 500, according to a September 2010 U.S. Department of Education report spelling out testing details. Proficient students "should understand the connections among fractions, percents, decimals, and other mathematical topics such as algebra and functions," the report said. "Students at this level are expected to have a thorough understanding of" basic "arithmetic operations—an understanding sufficient for problem solving in practical situations." Students with scores of 262 met the "basic" threshold, according to the report, meaning they were able to solve problems using varied "strategies and technological tools—including calculators, computers, and geometric shapes. Students at this level also should be able to use fundamental algebraic and informal geometric concepts in problem solving." Unlike eighth graders scoring high enough to be "proficient," the "basic" students "show limited skill in communicating mathematically," the report said. Newton pointed us to another group’s web page indicating that in 2011, 60 percent of the Texas eighth-graders chosen to take the math assessment did not score well enough to be considered proficient, though that also was an improvement on previous years, according to the information posted by Kids Count, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Some 64 percent of Texas eighth-graders were not proficient on the math assessment in 2009, Kids Count said, with 75 percent not proficient in 2003. By telephone, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson of the Texas Education Agency pointed us to a federal chart showing that on the 2011 math test, 81 percent of participating Texas eighth-graders scored well enough to meet or exceed the "basic" threshold--counting the 40 percent of students who were "proficient." On the 2009 test, 78 percent of Texas eighth-graders scored well enough to clear the "basic" hurdle, 36 percent of them proving "proficient." These results were far better than the first year shown, 1990, when 45 percent of tested Texas students achieved "basic" scores or better, including 13 percent deemed "proficient." Asked to explain the gains, Culbertson said, "Instruction has gotten better and teachers are better trained." Math teachers majoring in math And did most eighth-grade math teachers not major in math? Newton noted another Change the Equation web page including a bar graph indicating that in 2011, 26 percent of Texas eighth-grade math teachers had majored in math, compared with 31 percent of such teachers nationally. A footnote says these percentages did not count teachers who were "math education" majors. By telephone, spokesman Arnold Goldstein of the National Center for Education Statistics cautioned that the teachers surveyed do not amount to a random sample. The Texas math teachers who answered such background questions in 2011, he said, were simply those teachers who had the state’s 7,500 students in 210 schools randomly chosen to take the federal test. That wrinkle aside, does the research support Bush’s claim? Evidently. With Goldstein’s help, we downloaded NAEP survey results indicating that 21 percent of the Texas eighth-graders who took the math test in 2011 had a math teacher who reported majoring in math. That compared with 26 percent in the government’s comparable 2009 survey, 28 percent in 2003 and 36 percent in 2000. And by email, a spokesman for a Washington, D.C.-based group, American Institutes for Research, told us that other 2011 NAEP survey data--information not immediately accessible to the public--indicates 26 percent of the students had a teacher who had majored in math or "another mathematics subject" such as statistics. Claus Von Zastrow further provided a spreadsheet showing the percentages for each state. Finally, Goldstein guided us to NAEP survey results indicating that in 2011, 16 percent of the Texas eighth-graders who took the math exam had a math teacher who had majored in math education. Past surveys indicated that in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009, 10 percent to 18 percent of such eighth-graders had a math teacher who had majored in math education. For another perspective, we reached Cynthia Schneider of the Texas Council of Teachers of Mathematics, who said by telephone that her review of the 2011 eighth grade NAEP math test results for Texas showed no significant differences in the scores of students who had teachers who had majored in math versus teachers who had not. Regardless, Schneider said, it’s increasingly important for middle-school math teachers to have taken advanced math courses in college because more and more students are expected to absorb algebra and other complex math topics. "Math majors do matter," she said. Newton of Bush’s campaign suggested by email that it makes sense to stress teachers who majored in math, rather than math education. "There are differences in the overall design of these degree plans, including the number of upper-division mathematics courses taken and the level of advanced mathematics taken," Newton said. Newton stood by Bush’s emphasis on students whose scores met the "proficient" threshold, saying that’s an accepted benchmark. "If major education agencies are choosing to report it this way, choosing to report the proficient number rather than the basic, we are not being misleading by following suit," Newton said by email. Our ruling Bush said 60 percent of Texas eighth graders are not "proficient" in math and only 26 percent have a teacher who majored in math in college. Federal figures support both ends of this claim, though clarification is needed to specify that "proficient" here does not mean that 60 percent of such students are flat failing to keep up. In 2011, 19 percent of Texas eighth-graders fell short of the "basic" math achievement hurdle set for the federal math test. We rate this statement as Mostly True.	None	George P.

abbc-00243	The claim	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-23/fact-check-comparing-power-price-rises-labor-lnp/9174886	Ms Palaszczuk's claim is cherrypicking. Though household electricity prices rose significantly under the Liberal National Party, and to a lesser extent under Labor, the figures she quotes do not tell the whole story. Ms Palaszczuk relies on an analysis by the Department of Energy and Water Supply which shows that bills for a particular category of household rose by an average of 1.9 per cent a year under Labor and by an average of 12.7 per cent a year under the LNP. In highlighting Labor's record over the last three years, Ms Palaszczuk has misleadingly compared an average per-year increase under Labor with a total three-year increase under the LNP. While she does say "per year" when referring to Labor and "over the term" when referring to the LNP, the department's analysis included data that she could have used in a way that is not misleading. In addition, she neglects to point out the narrow basis for the departmental analysis she relies on. The department's figures for household bills apply only to regional Queensland. They do not apply to households in the state's more populous southeast, including Brisbane. They are estimates for the typical bills for just one type of customer, on one price structure and using the median annual amount of electricity. Experts consulted by Fact Check said that the bulk of price movements did not result from decisions made by the Newman or Palaszczuk governments. Rather, they resulted primarily from changes to network charges and wholesale prices.

pomt-01057	"Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/obama-obama-2010-us-has-created-more-jobs-all-adva/	Positive economic indicators were a major piece of President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, including a claim he repeated throughout 2014: that the American economy has outperformed the economies of other advanced countries. In talking about his goals for the upcoming year, Obama said, "As we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan and all advanced economies combined." We previously rated a similar statement by Obama, giving him a Half True for the claim that "we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office." His numbers at the time were off, and it seemed like the other economies were ever so slightly edging out the United States for total jobs created. A few months later, we’re able to update this fact-check with more recent data. The new information actually lines up better with Obama’s claim. But there are still problems with the idea that people are being put back to work. How does the U.S. compare to the other advanced economies? For this fact-check, we’ll use International Monetary Fund data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as "advanced economies" and seven of those as "major advanced economies." We looked at total average annual employment from 2010 through 2015. (This counts the number of payroll positions, meaning one person who works two jobs would be counted twice.) Country or Group 2010 employment 2015 employment, estimated Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.1 million 147.5 million 8.4 million 6.1 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.8 million 334.7 million 7.9 million 2.4 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.4 million 201.4 million 4.9 million 2.5 percent According to the IMF, then, the net number of people employed in the United States has grown by about 8.4 million people. As Obama said, this is higher than all other advanced economies combined -- the 35 advanced economies outside of the United States expanded by 7.9 million in the same time frame. And it’s clearly more than what happened in the smaller group of other G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom). Still, the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies by far -- it has more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy. (China, Russia and India are not considered advanced economies.) So it’s logical that there will, in general, be more employment growth in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations. Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by this measurement, the United States is not on top. The United States’ percentage growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on the IMF’s list of advanced economies, including: Australia, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland. The country on this list with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of nearly 15 percent. Is the U.S. putting 'more people back to work'? So if you look at net job creation, the White House claim is on target. What about the wording of putting "more people back to work," as Obama said? To support its claim when we fact-checked this a few months ago, the White House cited an internal analysis -- one we weren’t able to access for independent verification. The White House press office said the analysis used IMF data for the 36 advanced economies. They told PolitiFact that the analysis "finds that 14.9 million people have returned to work in advanced economies since the beginning of 2010. Just over half—or 7.5 million—are in the United States. In other words, the number of people put back to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined (7.4 million)." The White House said it’s notable that the United States accounts for the majority of these jobs since the U.S. population only accounts for about 31 percent of the population in advanced economies. The White House added that within the narrower group of G7 nations the U.S. share "vastly exceeds the rest of the G7 (7.5 million vs. 4.6 million)." However, the White House is using net employment gain, which doesn’t necessarily refer to people who became unemployed and went back to work -- the clearest definition of putting people "back to work," as Obama said. It’s possible that it could include people entering the workforce for the first time. We were unable to find other research to corroborate Obama’s claim. On the question of putting people back to work in the United States alone, we found that the Obama administration does have some data on its side. Statistics for the long-term unemployed have fallen consistently from their recession peak, both measured by the number of long-term unemployed Americans and the median duration of unemployment. The following Bureau of Labor Statistics chart shows the median duration of unemployment, in weeks, since January 2009, the start of Obama’s presidency. Still, the median length of unemployment is 13.7 weeks now, which is higher than it was in January 2009 (10.7 weeks). More importantly, the labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that is either working or looking actively for work -- has fallen consistently since Obama took office, from 65.7 percent to 62.8 percent. This graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the falling rate of labor participation since January 2009, when Obama took office. If these two data points sound paradoxical, they’re not. On the one hand, among the pool of people still looking for work, fewer have been looking for more than 27 weeks. On the other hand, that pool of people looking for work has shrunk, because many workers have simply dropped out of the labor market, rather than finding a job. The idea that long-term unemployed Americans are increasingly leaving the labor force is supported by an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by FiveThirtyEight.com’s Ben Casselman. The data led him to conclude that "the share of the long-term jobless who are giving up their job searches has been rising steadily, even as the job-finding rate has remained largely flat." This puts a damper on the notion, stated by Obama, that "we’ve put more people back to work" in recent years. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, added a word of caution. She noted that presidents are far from the only factor in economic growth, so it would be unrealistic for Obama to claim too much credit for these numbers. Indeed, the United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 -- meaning there was a lot of room to grow. "Is it a good thing to just put people back to work?" Sinclair said. "This mostly means we had a terribly bad recession and have finally recovered from it. That's not necessarily something to consider a policy triumph." Our ruling Obama said, "Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined." From publicly available data, we know that since 2010, the United States has created more jobs than the 35 other advanced economies combined. However, it’s not as clear cut that this recovery involves putting "more people back to work," as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more and more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs. On balance, we rate Obama's claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-21T00:42:29	2015-01-20	['Japan', 'Europe', 'United_States']

pomt-03461	Corporate tax holidays pushed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush brought "billions" of dollars back into the United States.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/18/johnny-isakson/corporate-tax-holiday-has-benefits-isakson-says/	In recent years, Republicans have been vocal about one particular way they say the federal government is anti-business. One of their main complaints is the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, a claim the PolitiFact franchise has repeatedly fact-checked with mixed reviews since the Truth-O-Meter started. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., was talking about the high corporate tax rates during a recent interview when he was asked whether there should a corporate tax holiday on off-shore profits? His answer piqued our interest. "Absolutely," he told Bloomberg radio. "It was done by John Kennedy. It was done by George W. Bush. Both times they did it, it brought back trillions or billions of dollars back into the United States which got reinvested in businesses and in jobs, and that’s exactly what we should do with the over $2 trillion that’s stranded now." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether the senator’s claim that corporate tax holidays pushed by those two presidents brought "billions of dollars back into the United States." Some elected officials push a particular idea by saying a political icon on the other side of the aisle supported a similar approach. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has asked for support of various policies by saying Republican Ronald Reagan advocated fairly identical ideas. In this case, Isakson brought up the name of one of the most popular Democrats in U.S. history, JFK. We asked Isakson’s office for more details to back up their argument concerning Kennedy, who was president from January 1961 to November 1963, when he was assassinated. It took them a few days, but their argument was based on: Kennedy’s role in creating the Investment Tax Credit, which they said reduced corporate taxes significantly. Internal Revenue Code subpart F, which prevented the deferral of taxes owed by U.S.-controlled foreign corporations on untaxed income before being distributed to shareholders in the United States. Those proposals were passed in 1962. Economists and historians say Kennedy wanted these changes because he was concerned about the flow of money out of the United States and its impact on the gold standard. Kennedy took a multilayered approach to the economy, experts say. He proposed a tax cut, saying the top rate of 91 percent was way too high and deterred consumer spending. The tax cut plan did not pass until after his death, which was tweaked by Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon Johnson. "President Kennedy realized that high taxation could have harmful effects on the economy, and he acted to bring such high taxes down," Isakson’s office said via email. "President Kennedy enacted some very significant U.S. international tax reforms. The combined effect of President Kennedy’s tax legislation is often seen as having a positive impact on the U.S. economy." David Shreve has taught courses on economic history at the University of Virginia and closely studied Kennedy administration economic policies. Shreve, currently a research analyst at the university's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, explained via email that the Kennedy changes were "the polar OPPOSITE of a tax holiday." Through our research, we found little describing the changes to the code as a corporate tax holiday. Now, to the Bush corporate tax holiday. In October 2004, Congress passed what was called the most sweeping corporate tax legislation in a generation. The 650-page bill included a provision allowing companies with vast stores of offshore revenue to bring them home under a discount tax rate of 5.25 percent. Did it result in billions of dollars returning to the United States that were reinvested in jobs and businesses? The Internal Revenue Service reported that a small number of mostly large corporations repatriated nearly $362 billion from their controlled foreign corporations as a result of the 2004 holiday. In early 2011, Obama announced he would not pursue a similar type of tax holiday. The decision sparked all sorts of analyses of the 2004 tax holiday. There were many questions about its results. "Unfortunately, there is no evidence that it increased U.S. investment or jobs, and it cost taxpayers billions," Assistant U.S. Treasury Department Secretary for Tax Policy Michael Mundaca wrote on the department’s website in March 2011. A May 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded another tax holiday similar to what was done in 2004 would have positive short-term results, but it raised questions about the holiday’s long-term effectiveness. The conservative Heritage Foundation posted an article in 2011 that concluded the 2004 tax holiday produced immediate results but "the evidence is clear that these repatriations did not produce the hoped-for subsequent surge in domestic investment." The article suggested the U.S. lower its corporate tax rate and a permanent partial exemption for future foreign-source earnings of all U.S. businesses. To sum up, Isakson’s comments were accurate about the Bush tax holiday, which brought $362 billion back into the U.S. There is, however, disagreement about its long-term effectiveness. There is even more disagreement about whether it’s correct to describe what Kennedy did as a corporate tax holiday. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-07301	On taxes, President Barack Obama wants to raise "the top rate to 44.8 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-barack-obama-wants-top-tax-rate-448/	Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- the author of a budget plan that won approval from the Republican-held House but which was assailed by Democrats because it proposes significant changes in how Medicare works -- gave a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago on May 16, 2011. In it, he criticized President Barack Obama on tax policy. Ryan said that his own budget plan makes "the tax code simpler, flatter, fairer, more globally competitive and less burdensome for working families and small businesses. By contrast, the president says he wants to eliminate deductions, but he also wants to raise rates. That includes raising the top rate to 44.8 percent. That would amount to a $1.5 trillion tax increase on families and job creators." A reader e-mailed us to ask whether the president really wants to raise rates to 44.8 percent, since the most widely discussed Obama tax proposal is to reinstate marginal income tax rates that were in effect for the wealthiest taxpayers before approval of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts proposed by President George W. Bush. As the reader pointed out, Obama’s proposal to let Bush’s tax cuts lapse would raise the top marginal income tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent -- not to the 44.8 percent that Ryan cited. We began by asking Ryan’s staff what he had meant by using that figure. Spokesman Conor Sweeney forwarded us a document that provided the reasoning that Ryan used to get to the 44.8 percent. Here’s the relevant portion of that document: Top statutory rate, 2010: 35 percent Expiration of 2001/2003 lower rates, 2011: 39.6 percent PEP/Pease provisions reinstated, 2011: 41.6 percent Net 2.3 percent Medicare tax on wages/salary: 43.9 percent 0.9 percent nondeductible Medicare tax, 2013: 44.8 percent We’ve already discussed the references to the 35 percent and 39.6 percent figures. Here’s a rundown of the rest: • PEP/Pease. These are two caps on how much income is subject to taxation for wealthy Americans. (Most Americans do not earn enough to trigger them.) The first, the "personal exemption phase-out," limits the benefit of the personal exemption for taxpayers earning above a set amount of income. The second sets a similar cap for itemized deductions. The two taxes were steadily reduced under the Bush tax cuts, disappearing entirely for 2010. The two caps are set to be revived in 2012, like the rest of the Bush tax cuts, unless Congress and the president agree to intervene. Ryan’s staff and tax experts we consulted with disagreed somewhat over how big a hit the PEP and Pease revivals would be, but their estimates ranged from about 1 to 2 added percentage points. So on the low end of that scale, Ryan’s estimate is slightly high, but the difference is modest. • Medicare taxes. Currently, the Medicare tax is 2.9 percent, split evenly between the employee and the employer. The new health care law would add a 0.9 percent, nondeductible tax to the employee’s side, so the new total is 3.8 percent, of which 2.35 percent is borne by the employee and 1.45 percent by the employer. To that employee share, Ryan added almost a percentage point to account for what he sees as lower employee salaries due to the employer’s share of the payroll tax. On balance, Ryan estimates the combined net increase from Medicare taxes to be 3.2 percent. So for Medicare taxes as well, Ryan’s staff made some assumptions that would be open to critique. But once again, the range of possible rate increases is fairly small -- about one percentage point. So even if you don’t buy Ryan’s assumptions, the most he’d be off in his final number is about 2 percentage points. Now, how about the way Ryan described his number? Usually, we’ve seen politicians use the term "the top rate" to refer to the marginal income tax rate for the highest tax bracket, not that tax rate plus several other taxes. So, one could say that using the 44.8 percent figure is a subtle way of adding an extra 5.2 percentage points to Obama’s tax proposal, making it look more draconian. But when we asked both liberal and conservative economists what they thought about Ryan’s phrasing, most were largely untroubled. "For non-tax people, I suppose he could have specified that 44.8 would be the combined marginal tax rate, though it's not clear that would have helped the average person understand," said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "Short of engaging in lengthy digressions, I'm not sure what Ryan could have done differently." If Ryan had used a specific definition of the tax rates in his speech, such as "the effective marginal income tax rate," then "that would be misleading," added J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. But he didn’t, Foster said, and that gives him some space to define what he means. Dean Baker, a liberal economist, said he’d "give Ryan a pass on this." Ryan left out that most of the rates listed in the document would be reverting to prior levels, rather than being imposed for the first time by Obama, Baker said. However, on balance, Baker said he feels that Ryan’s statement "is largely true." So where does this leave us? On Ryan’s number, it’s possible to argue that the actual rate is as low as 42.8 percent rather than 44.8 percent, but that’s open to debate. On his description of what the number means, Ryan -- particularly given that he was working from a prepared speech -- could have been clearer by saying something like, "The various parts of Obama’s tax agenda would together push the highest marginal tax rate up to 44.8 percent." Still, the figure Ryan used is close to what the tax rate would be if Obama’s agenda is followed, and a cross-section of economists we asked thought that Ryan’s presentation of that number was reasonable. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-05-18T16:42:42	2011-05-16	['None']

pomt-02193	Because the EPA closed a lead smelter in Missouri, "all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/apr/25/chain-email/lead-bullets-will-have-come-overseas-after-epa-clo/	"We, the American public have been blindsided again by the Obama crowd!!!" warns a chain email. "Last Lead smelting plant -- gone." The email goes on to blame the "Evil Protection Agency" for shutting down a lead smelting plant, calling it "backdoor gun control" and saying it will result in the cost of bullets soaring. "All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!" the email says, adding, "Long term what this means: Your investment in ammo may be your best investment. Guns will be plentiful but ammo will be another story. How does $3.75 a round (that's for one bullet) for a 9mm work for you? Box of 50 would only cost you $187.50." We wondered: Is the email correct to say that all lead for bullets will now have to come from overseas? The Doe Run plant We’ve been down this road before. In December, former Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida, stated on his website: "It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ... So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration." We rated West’s claim Pants on Fire. The shuttered smelter, operated by Doe Run, is located in Herculaneum, Mo. Facing regulatory concerns about its air-quality record, Doe Run announced in 2010 that it had reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri which included paying fines. Then, in December 2013, it shut down. We found no evidence that the EPA’s settlement had anything to do with gun control -- it was about pollution. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters, which are "terribly toxic sites," said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution, told us when we wrote fact-checked West. Lead can accumulate in the body from many sources, and it can severely hamper mental and physical development. "It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets," Rosner told PolitiFact. "The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant." Indeed, while the chain email blames Obama, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. That was during the Reagan administration. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president who presided over an advance in the national anti-lead effort. In 2008, during the tenure of President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. Doe Run’s primary smelter -- a plant that extracts lead from ore -- was the last primary smelter in the country. But Doe Run continues to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. That includes -- you guessed it -- bullets. A company spokeswoman told us in December that more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications. "In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product," the company said in a statement. "These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri." In our previous fact check, Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey told us that the company "will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead." We contacted Stankey again for this fact-check. "The primary smelter did close, (but) we are still supplying ammo customers through our only secondary smelter," she told us. "We do know that primary lead is being imported to the U.S., but we don’t know if it is specific to ammunition suppliers. ... There are many other uses of lead." Ammunition experts Now that the Doe Run primary smelter has been shuttered for a few months, we checked back with ammunition experts to see whether there’s any evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas. An NRA spokesman referred us to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Spokesman Mike Bazinet told us for this fact-check that "almost all the lead used in ammunition in the U.S. comes from secondary sources, recycled car batteries and other sources of lead. The closing of the lead smelter has not had any effect on ammunition prices or availability. ... Lead for bullets comes from secondary sources, and that was not completely understood by people out there. We certainly tried explain that it's had virtually no effect on ammunition prices." While some ammunition is imported to the U.S. from overseas, "it would be pretty heavy stuff to send (lead) across the ocean and put into a bullet. There are secondary sources of lead in sufficient quantity in the United States." Tom Falone -- president of Clearwater-based Florida Bullet, which supplies ammunition to law-enforcement agencies in Florida -- said its manufacturer has been using reclaimed lead for years. "I think that by the time we see a shortage, the industry will have found another material to replace the lead with," Falone said. Our ruling A chain email said that following closure of a lead smelter in Missouri, "all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!" While the closure of a Doe Run primary lead smelter in December 2013 means there are no smelters to make lead from ore anywhere in the United States, smelters to recycle lead remain in operation, and their output is substantial enough to satisfy the needs of ammunition manufacturers. Four months after that particular smelter closed, we found no evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12657	Says Paul Manafort "played a very limited role" in the Trump presidential campaign.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/22/sean-spicer/sean-spicers-false-claim-paul-manafort-played-mino/	Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to distance the White House from President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has come under intense scrutiny recently for alleged ties to the Russian government. Manfort’s name was mentioned more than two dozen times in a Monday hearing before the House Intelligence committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and exclusive reporting today by the Associated Press alleges Manafort worked to advance Kremlin interests years before his involvement in the Trump campaign. "Obviously there’s been discussion of Paul Manafort, who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time," Spicer said in a March 20 White House press briefing, responding to a reporter’s question about references to Manafort during the hearing. That struck us as wrong, and Spicer seemed to walk back his comments in a subsequent press conference -- while still downplaying Manafort’s role. "I know I commented on this the other day and clearly, I should have been more precise with respect to Paul's role, so let me clarify this and kind of go through the facts," Spicer said. Given the White House's continued efforts to distance itself from Manafort, we decided to review the facts ourselves around his involvement in the Trump campaign. Manafort’s early role in the Trump campaign In March 2016, then-candidate Trump tapped Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention. In a press release announcing the hiring, Trump praised Manafort as "a great asset and an important addition" in consolidating the support Trump won during the primary season. "Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party," Trump said in a statement that highlighted Manafort’s extensive political experience in "dozens of international political campaigns." About a week later, Trump expanded Manafort’s portfolio to include all functions related to the nomination process, as well as additional roles coordinating outreach efforts and establishing a new office in Washington, D.C. "I am organizing these responsibilities under someone who has done this job successfully in many campaigns," Trump said in a statement. "Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again." Manafort also began appearing on national television to represent the campaign. Manafort’s April 24 appearance on Fox News Sunday was posted on the Trump campaign’s official website, for example. (The post has since been removed, but can be seen here.) In his Sunday show interview, Manafort defended Trump’s campaign style and evolving strategy, and went on offense against then-Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, calling Trump’s most formidable rival for the Republican nomination a "liar." Manafort’s promotion to Trump campaign chairman and chief strategist On May 19, Trump promoted Manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist. Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said that Corey Lewandowski, who had been managing the Trump campaign, would "continue overseeing day-to-day operations and will work with Manafort on political strategy and communications, among other things, through the general election." In weeks leading up to the July Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign announced it had hired veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway to "serve as senior advisor to the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort." Roughly one month after the July GOP convention, with Trump’s poll numbers in decline and the campaign dealing with ongoing controversy, Trump announced Manafort’s resignation, concluding Manafort’s 20-week tenure with the campaign. "This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign," Trump said in an August 19 statement." I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success." Our ruling Spicer said Manafort had a "limited" role with the Trump campaign, but even Spicer admitted himself that characterization wasn’t correct. Not only did Manafort work to consolidate Trump's support ahead of the Republican National Convention, but he was later promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. He made multiple media appearances on behalf of Trump and worked alongside Trump’s closest advisers. We rate Spicer’s statement False.

pomt-13269	"We've had Muslims in America since George Washington."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/13/hillary-clinton/clinton-sys-muslims-have-been-america-george-washi/	A Muslim woman at the second presidential debate asked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton how they would help millions of Muslims in the United States "deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country." Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said that Muslims have to report problems, because "if they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country." And Clinton, his Democratic rival, won’t use the term "radical Islamic terrorism," Trump said, which we have said is misleading. Clinton said she wanted Muslims to feel included in the country, "part of our homeland security." "We've had Muslims in America since George Washington," Clinton said. "And we've had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali." We wondered about Clinton’s remarks about Muslims being in America since the nation’s first president, more than 200 years ago. There are about 2.75 million Muslims in America, according to estimates by Pew Research Center. Islam is the second-largest religion in the world after Christianity and the fastest growing. Muslims were singled out this election cycle when Trump in December 2015 called for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," until U.S. representatives "can figure out what is going on." Trump’s statement came a few days after a husband and wife in San Bernardino, Calif., fatally shot 14 people and wounded more than 20 others. The woman was from Pakistan and on the day of the attack pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, a terrorist group also known as ISIS. In June 2016, Trump said he was revising his plan, and would suspend immigration from areas with "proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats." After the mass shooting in California and other attacks in Paris, hate crimes against Muslims spiked in the United States, the New York Times reported. Given statements about banning Muslims from coming to the United States and the attacks some already in the country are facing, Clinton’s comment about their presence in the country dating back hundreds of years seemed relevant. Muslim slaves Clinton’s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 9, 2015, opinion piece in the New York Times by Peter Manseau, who has written about American history and religions. "No matter how anxious people may be about Islam, the notion of a Muslim invasion of this majority-Christian country has no basis in fact," Manseau’s New York Times piece said. "Moreover, there is an inconvenient footnote to the assertion that Islam is anti-American: Muslims arrived here before the founding of the United States — not just a few, but thousands." Muslims have been "overlooked because they were not free to practice their faith," Manseau wrote. Manseau’s piece discusses a man called Estevanico who was raised in Azemmour, a Moroccan city that was once a "Muslim stronghold against European invasion." In 1528, an enslaved Estevanico and Spanish explorers were shipwrecked near present-day Galveston, Texas. Estevanico eventually escaped his Christian captors and lived in the Southwest, Manseau wrote. In the 1700s, Louisiana plantation owners "made it a point to add enslaved Muslims to their labor force, relying on their experience with the cultivation of indigo and rice," the New York Times piece said. Arabs in America, a project at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, also says scholars believe Estevanico was a practicing Muslim, "though he nominally converted to Catholicism to appease his Spanish masters." The Clinton campaign also sent over a Q&A page on Tolerance.org about Muslims that says they arrived in America more than 400 years ago as slaves and that many practiced their faith in secret. They also pointed to a PBS feature on Islam in America that says 10 to 15 percent of African slaves were believed to be Muslims. Experts also backed up Clinton’s claim. Kambiz GhaneaBassiri, a professor of religion and humanities at Reed College, also noted that the National Portrait Gallery includes a portrait of Yarrow Mamout, identified as an African-American Muslim man and former slave. "His portrait reminds us that Muslims have been a part of the fabric of this nation since the beginning," Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said in a July 2016 press statement when it was announced the portrait would be added as part of the museum’s annual rotations. Scholars also referred us to a post about the Founding Fathers and Islam by James H. Hutson, chief of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress. "Readers may be surprised to learn that there may have been hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Muslims in the United States in 1776 — imported as slaves from areas of Africa where Islam flourished," Hutson wrote. "Although there is no evidence that the Founders were aware of the religious convictions of their bondsmen, it is clear that the Founding Fathers thought about the relationship of Islam to the new nation and were prepared to make a place for it in the republic." Washington said he would welcome Muslims to Mount Vernon (his home) "if they were ‘good workmen’," Hutson said. Washington also "suggested a way for Muslims to ‘obtain proper relief’ " from a proposed bill in Virginia levying taxes to aid Christian worship, according to Hutson. The post goes on to detail how the Founding Fathers in 1780 made sure the Constitution afforded "the most ample liberty of conscience … to Deists, Mahometans, Jews and Christians’," Hutson wrote. "I think that what Secretary Clinton was suggesting by her reference to George Washington was that not only have Muslims lived in the U.S. for centuries, but that our Founding Fathers — not only George Washington but also Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, and the men who wrote the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution — believed that Muslims should be free to practice their own religion, and they tried to guarantee this freedom and protect it in some of our Founding documents," said Jan Ellen Lewis, a history professor at Rutgers University who has contributed $700 to Clinton’s campaign. Our ruling Clinton said, "We've had Muslims in America since George Washington." History scholars, studies and information from the Library of Congress say Muslims have been in the United States for hundreds of years, certainly dating back to Washington. Though Muslims were brought to America as slaves from Africa, experts believe many were not able to freely practice their religion. The Founding Fathers eventually outlined freedom of religion, among other rights.

pomt-00337	Says 3,000 people "did not die" in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. That death toll estimate was "done by Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/18/donald-trump/trump-lacks-proof-puerto-rico-hurricane-death-toll/	As Hurricane Florence battered the Carolinas, President Donald Trump stirred a tweetstorm of his own creation by continuing to deride an estimated death toll from two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico last year. He said the count of Puerto Ricans killed by Hurricane Maria jumped from 16 during his October visit to 64 deaths a few months later, and "then, like magic, ‘3000 PEOPLE KILLED.'" See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com He said in a second tweet that a method by George Washington University researchers to come up with a death count "was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. FIFTY TIMES LAST ORIGINAL NUMBER - NO WAY!" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s defiance echoed his initial tweets Sept. 13 in which he said 3,000 people "did not die" from the storms and that such a number was boosted by counting deaths from "old age." Turning conspiratorial, he said it was "done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump ignores basic facts about reality for Puerto Ricans after Hurricanes Irma and Maria after September 2017. Trump also miscasts the estimate as a Democratic effort when it was created by experts on disaster response. There was no "magic" to the increase in the death toll estimates. It is based in science. "Early after a disaster, death tolls tend to be preliminary," said Roberto Rivera, College of Business University of Puerto Rico. "In the case of Hurricane Maria, indirect deaths are the reason the toll was so high, as suggested by some reports. That's the context that Trump is missing." Death toll estimates by academics The government in Puerto Rico initially reported 16 deaths in September 2017, and raised it to 34 in October and then 64 in December. But for months, researchers had said that the government’s official count was an undercount. Part of a death toll is a count of direct deaths from a storm, such as being struck by a falling tree or drowning in a flood. The more complicated count comes from indirect deaths caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions, such as someone who relies on a respirator but loses electricity. Usually, the death toll of an event such as Hurricane Maria is determined through an exam by a medical examiner. But Puerto Rico officials did not have the proper resources to effectively conduct forensic examinations. Without complete medical records, researchers were left with other ways to try to come up with an estimate. Multiple studies used different methodologies and time periods, and therefore arrived at different results about "excess deaths" — comparing the number of deaths with historical trends during the time period in previous years. Excess death measurement has been a standard in the measurement of deaths attributable to environmental and climate events since the early 1960s, said Alexis Santos-Lozada, an assistant teaching professor at Pennsylvania State University. However, in some ways the case in Puerto Rico is unique. Before Hurricane Maria, governors and stakeholders were usually the first ones to raise alarm about the number of deaths — as the mayor of New Orleans did after Hurricane Katrina. "This was not the case of Puerto Rico, in Puerto Rico we turned to estimates because both the governor and the president minimized the number," Santos-Lozada said. Origins of the 3,000 estimate Trump was referring to an estimate published in late August by George Washington University’s Milken Institute. That estimate was higher than some earlier estimates by academics and the New York Times that were around 1,000, but lower than the 4,645 midpoint of a Harvard study. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló contacted George Washington University in December, which led to commissioning the university to do a study. The Milken Institute published the first phase Aug. 28 and found a midpoint of 2,975 excess deaths in the six months following the hurricane. That number was 22 percent higher than the number of deaths that would have been expected during that period in a year without the storm. Researchers found that lack of communication and training for doctors about how to certify deaths resulted in an undercount. Trump misrepresents what the Milken Institute study actually concluded about deaths. The study did not include anyone who died for "any reason, like old age," as he said. If that were the case, the number of deaths would have been much higher. The study found that there were 16,608 total deaths during the six months — and approximately 77 percent were at least 65 years old. The study didn’t attribute individual deaths to Maria; it tried to determine a number of "excess" deaths. In other words, it tried to find how many deaths would have been expected were it not for the but rather came up with a counterfactual: how many deaths would you expect to see each month if the hurricane hadn’t happened and then subtract the actual number to arrive at an "excess" number of deaths. Dr. John "Jack" Sandberg, an associate professor in the department of global health, told PolitiFact that the contract stipulated that the study would be done with no government interference by officials in Puerto Rico — and none occurred. "I did the number crunching on this, no one ever said boo to me about anything," he said. "We are quite shocked that this is having political repercussions." Lynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute, responded to Trump's tweets in a Washington Post op-ed. "To set the record straight, our study was carried out with no interference whatsoever from any political party or institution," she wrote of the study done in collaboration with scientists at the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health. "We do not know the exact circumstances around each of the 2,975 excess deaths that occurred. Many factors — disruption in transportation, access to food, water, medications, power and other essentials — may have contributed." The government in Puerto Rico accepted the Milken institute study and raised Maria's official death toll from 64 to 2,975. The study's next phase is expected to more closely examine the identified deaths to look at causes through interviews with family members and medical personnel. Our ruling Trump tweeted that 3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico and that the death toll estimate was "done by Democrats." Trump tried to cast doubt on an estimate by George Washington University that includes indirect deaths. Studies by other academics or researchers have also concluded that the number of deaths was above 1,000. The death toll provided by the government in Puerto Rico did rise after the storm from 16 to 64 in the months following the storm. The government then hired George Washington University to research an estimate and several months later it produced a report estimate 2,975 deaths. None of that is evidence of an estimate created by a Democratic conspiracy to make Trump look bad. We rate this statement False.

pomt-09622	Says a careless attitude and "poor oversight by the Texas Department of Agriculture" led to deaths and illnesses traced to a Texas peanut plant.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-says-agencys-lax-attitude-allowed-sal/	East Texas Democrat Hank Gilbert, running a second time for state agriculture commissioner, blasted out of the chute with a dramatic claim about the agency he wants to head. Gilbert, hoping to deny Republican Commissioner Todd Staples a second term, said Dec. 14: "A careless, lackadaisical attitude has already resulted in the deaths of eight and more than 600 cases of illness nationally thanks to poor TDA oversight at the former Peanut Corporation of America factory in Plainview." He was referring to eight (the count actually reached nine) deaths due to salmonella poisonings traced to the corporation's since-shuttered Plainview peanut plant. We wondered if Gilbert accurately characterized the department's role in ensuring safe food processing plants. It turns out that a department inspector did visit the offending Peanut Corporation of America plant in 2005, 2006 and 2008 and also checked a box on a form filed after each visit stating that the plant had a license required by the state health department to operate. But the Lubbock-based inspector, who was visiting the plant to certify it as organic, has admitted to making false assumptions about its health certification on each inspection. When his actions came to light in the wake of the salmonella crisis, he was fired. The inspector, Gaylon Armonett, told the Associated Press the reason he checked "yes" the first time was that a plant manager told him an application for state health licensing had been completed and was in the hands of officials at the company's headquarters. Armonett said he checked "yes" in the succeeding years because he assumed the license was granted. "It's an inadvertent mistake," Armonett said, "and I'm sorry for it." Agriculture department spokesman Bryan Black suggested it wasn’t the department’s responsibility to police any plant’s cleanliness. "Local and state health departments are responsible for protecting consumers from food-borne illnesses," Black said. "TDA certifies products and processes to national organic standards and has strict protocols in place." The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed that firms like the peanut plant that manufacture food for sale to the public must have a state-issued food manufacturer license. The agency has said it didn’t know of the Plainview plant until the salmonella outbreak. The plant closed in February. "We never received an application for a license," DSHS spokeswoman Allison Lowery said. "As you can understand, it would be very difficult for us to know about a company when it fails to license with us." Lowery continued: "As soon as we were aware of the problems... we immediately ordered the company to close this plant and recall all products made there. We also quickly took over the recall after we got no response from the company to our recall order. And we assessed $14.6 million in administrative penalties against the company." In his statement about the peanut plant, Gilbert overstates the agriculture department's role; it's not the primary agency responsible for policing such facilities for health hazards. Still, its inspector admittedly slipped up in this case. If he'd flagged the Plainview plant for lacking the required food manufacturer license, it might have been shut down or its conditions improved. That could have prevented the 2009 illnesses and deaths. We rate Gilbert’s statement Half True.	None	Hank Gilbert	None	None	None	2010-01-12T15:28:04	2009-12-14	['Texas']

pomt-01196	"794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/02/facebook-posts/meme-says-barack-obama-has-given-no-special-recogn/	Recent events in Ferguson, Mo., have inspired waves of anger on social media. Recently, a reader asked us to check one of the memes now circulating on the Internet. The meme pairs two images. One captures several flag-draped coffins, presumably of law enforcement officers. The other is a still from surveillance footage showing Michael Brown allegedly assaulting an employee at a convenience store that he’s suspected of robbing the day he was killed by police officer Darren Wilson. To these images, the meme adds the following text: "Want to know where racial tension and cultural divide comes from? "794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House. "A man robs a convenience store and assaults a cop; the White House sends three representatives to his memorial service." The meme appears to stem from the "Culture Crisis in America" Facebook community, which describes itself as "an e-magazine for Americans subscribing to the notion that the cultural deterioration of American values rests within the root of economic and social crises across our land, and indeed, the globe." We’ll quickly note that, according to news reports, the White House did send three representatives to the service for Brown: Broderick Johnson, chairman of the My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Marlon Marshall, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Heather Foster, an adviser in the public engagement office. (Marshall had personal as well as professional reasons to attend; he’s a St. Louis native and attended high school with Brown's mother.) Here, we'll focus on the meme's claim that Obama has been indifferent to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, giving them "no special recognition." Is that correct? Have 794 officers been killed in the line of duty since Obama was inaugurated? The meme footnotes its figure to the website Officer Down Memorial Page, a privately run page that memorializes and keeps count of the number of police killed in action every year. Between 2009 and Dec. 2, 2014, the site counted 834 deaths. The lower number on the meme probably because the number of deaths has increased since its creator first looked up the number. Due to differences in methodology, the Officer Down Memorial Page figure is somewhat higher than the official federal statistics, which are accessible in an FBI database known as "Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted." The FBI figures show 521 deaths from 2009 to 2013, roughly half from felonious homicides and half from accidents in the line of duty. If you extrapolate the numbers to include 2014, that would work out to roughly 625 deaths. That’s smaller than what was cited in the meme, but given the diversity of criteria that can be used to calculate this statistic, we’re not overly concerned about the meme’s number. (The Officer Down Memorial Page, for instance, counts deaths off-duty "while acting in an official capacity to prevent loss of property, injury, or death, or is targeted because of his/her duties as a law enforcement officer.") One footnote: The numbers of fallen officers have been declining rather noticeably in recent years. According to the FBI statistics, the number of officers killed initially rose from 96 in 2009 to 128 in 2010, but then began falling, to 125, then 96 and finally to 76 in 2013. That’s a 41 percent decline in three years. Has there been "no special recognition from the White House" for fallen officers? This is where the meme is entirely off-base. We found many instances of White House "special recognition" for fallen officers. Here’s a selection of events where Obama has appeared, all archived a few quick keystrokes away on the White House website: • May 7, 2010: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: "As a nation, we rely on law enforcement officers to keep our neighborhoods safe, enforce our laws, and respond in times of crisis. These men and women sustain peace and order across America, and we look to them as models of courage and integrity. This week, we honor their extraordinary service and sacrifice, and we remember the fallen heroes whose selfless acts have left behind safer streets and stronger communities." • May 15, 2010: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "To the survivors of fallen law enforcement officers, our hearts go out to you for your loss. The husbands and wives, mothers and fathers you loved, they protected us all. And all Americans are grateful for the lives that they gave in the line of duty." • May 12, 2011: Presidential remarks at a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring National Association of Police Organizations "Top Cops" Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "Tomorrow we know that you and your fellow first responders will be back on your diligent duty -- looking out for us, looking out for one another, looking back at times with fallen partners, determined to make sure that their extraordinary sacrifices were not in vain. And we will be standing behind you, as one nation and one people, proud of your actions, awed by your courage, and grateful for your service on our behalf." • May 15, 2012: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "Today, with heavy hearts, we honor those who gave their lives. .... Their families are in our thoughts and prayers, as we remember the quiet courage of the men and women we have lost. … The rest of us can never fully understand what you go through. But please know that we hold you in our hearts -- not just today, but always. We are forever in your debt. And it is on behalf of all of us, the entire American people, that I offer my thoughts, my prayers, and my thanks. May God shine a light upon the fallen and comfort the mourning. May he protect the peacemakers who protect us every day." • May 15, 2013: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "Scripture tells us, ‘None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.’ The brave officers we gather to remember today devoted themselves so fully to others -- to serve and to protect others -- that in the process they were willing to give their lives. And so, today, let us not remember them just for how they died, but also for how they lived. … We can never repay our debt to these officers and their families, but we must do what we can, with all that we have, to live our lives in a way that pays tribute to their memory." • May 9, 2014: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: "During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we celebrate those who protect and serve us every minute of every day, and we honor the courageous officers who devoted themselves so fully to others that in the process they laid down their lives. As we mourn the fallen, let us also remember how they lived." Our ruling The Facebook meme said that "794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House." While the meme offered a reasonable approximation for the number of fallen officers, the meat of its accusation -- that Obama has ignored the suffering of law enforcement officers killed in action -- is demonstrably wrong. We found at least six instances in which Obama honored the lives of fallen officers in writing or in speeches. Archived information about these events was easily available to the public on the White House website, meaning that the meme’s creator was reckless in not taking them into account.

pomt-13122	"Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs."	false	/florida/statements/2016/nov/03/consumers-smart-solar/amendment-1-backers-promise-protections-seniors-of/	Organizers for a proposed constitutional amendment about electricity generated by solar power have told voters their proposal would safeguard consumers — especially seniors. Consumers for Smart Solar, the utility-backed group behind Amendment 1, has spent millions to promote the measure in commercials, mailers and web ads. "Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs," claimed one ad on YouTube Oct. 19, 2016. We wanted to know how the amendment would keep seniors from being targeted. When we shined a light on the measure, we found Amendment 1 doesn’t provide any new protections, for seniors or anyone else. Solar support Supporters of the Amendment 1 campaign say the constitutional change promotes solar while protecting consumers. Critics have derided the amendment, accusing organizers of obscuring their true, backdoor intention of helping established utilities control Florida’s solar market and punish electric consumers for using solar panels. So how does the amendment protect seniors, or anyone else? On its own, Amendment 1 doesn’t. All the wording says is that current consumer protections can remain in place. Along with saying people may still buy solar panels and install them, the measure reads (emphasis ours): "State and local governments shall retain their abilities to protect consumer rights and public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do." The second half concerns the future of net metering, in which solar customers sell excess electricity back to the utilities. Net metering is currently overseen by Florida Public Service Commission rules. But the first half essentially says the amendment will not preclude any current or future state law or regulation. No legal protections would change. "This provision makes clear that regardless of what course Florida takes with solar energy now or in the future, government will not relinquish its responsibility to protect consumers," a Consumers for Smart Solar spokeswoman told us. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn’t give any examples when we asked them how solar customers may currently be protected. The attorney general’s office said consumers with specific problems can file a complaint with them under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. The office reviews each complaint for appropriate action. You may have noticed the amendment does not spell out special protection for seniors. But here’s where Consumers for Smart Solar’s argument comes in. They cited an August 2016 letter to the Federal Trade Commission from Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy group. The letter said Public Citizen hoped the FTC would consider new regulations on "arrangements in which consumers lease their solar system from a corporate third-party." Florida is one of five states that do not allow a property owner to have a third-party installer put solar panels on their roof and sell the power back to them. In those deals, customers sign a lease for a period of time, usually a number of years, agreeing to buy power from the solar company. Florida customers are still allowed to lease the panels themselves, as long as they don’t sell the excess electricity to anyone, such as a landlord selling power to tenants. Consumers for Smart Solar pointed to Arizona, where solar companies bilked older customers who didn’t fully understand their lease agreements. But it’s not clear how this applies to Florida, because those kinds of deals aren’t allowed in this state. State law makes it so that someone generating electricity with solar panels can’t sell it to anyone but utility companies. The net metering clause matters here, too, because third-party companies in other states depend on the money they would get from selling electricity to utilities. The amendment would conceivably make that business model unworkable, were third-party sales ever allowed. Florida's two largest utilities, Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy have said they want to see Florida's net metering law changed to impose new fees on customer-owned solar users. More than one legal expert told us it’s ambiguous at best to say Amendment 1 offers protections. That’s up to state and local officials, who already have laws and regulations in place. Seniors aren’t specifically mentioned anywhere in the amendment’s wording. "The only defined user of electricity in the amendment is ‘consumer,’" Stetson University law professor Lance Long said. "I think it is misleading to suggest that it does have a particular concern for seniors. It seems more in the genre of ‘scare tactic’ rather than accurate information." Our ruling Consumers for Smart Solar said, "Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs." The amendment’s wording doesn’t mention seniors specifically, it only lets current consumer protection laws stand. That means the measure doesn’t preclude any protections, but it also doesn’t provide any. If there were no amendment at all, the effect on consumer laws and regulations would be the same. This talking point may lead many voters, especially seniors, to think the amendment somehow offers new safeguards for solar customers, but it doesn’t.

pomt-06964	Under Ryan plan, "those 54 and younger would receive the same kind of healthcare options now enjoyed by members of Congress."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/15/scott-rigell/rigell-says-gop-medicare-plan-offers-those-under-5/	Seeking to dispel concerns that House Republicans want to end Medicare and push granny off a cliff, U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd, recently reached out to his constituents. In a letter titled "An open and honest conversation about Medicare," Rigell defended House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s "Path to Prosperity Plan" and attempted to address the "misinformation coming out of Washington" about it. Rigell laid out a series of "facts," the first of which reads: "Under the Path to Prosperity, there are no changes to Medicare for anyone 55 and older; those 54 and younger would receive the same kind of healthcare options now enjoyed by Members of Congress." We thought it worthwhile to look into the assertion that Americans 54 and younger would enjoy the same type of health care Rigell does. PolitiFact national has walked this road in April, checking a claim from Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. As pointed out in that fact check, Medicare is currently a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.) Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government "premium support" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care. Here’s how Ryan’s plan explains it: "When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks." Ryan’s proposal would require the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, an agency that administrates the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, through which members of Congress buy their insurance. Additionally, Ryan’s plan would gradually raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provide smaller premium supports to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found it would save the government money. But it would do so by requiring future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more to buy insurance. "A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare," the CBO concluded. Now let’s compare the benefits under Ryan’s plan to what members of Congress can buy. How the plan is like what members of Congress get. Asked to support Rigell’s claim, a representative from his office passed along information from the House Budget Committee. It points out that like the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, the Ryan plan would provide seniors a list of approved plans from competing private insurance companies and allow them the flexibility to choose. Those plans would be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as do plans that cover members of Congress. The government would also pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress. How the plan is not like what members of Congress get. First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.) Second, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise rates, through a formula known as "Fair Share." Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs. Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some, but we feel it’s important to mention: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000. Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. "As policymakers consider options for decreasing federal Medicare spending and addressing the federal debt and deficit, this analysis raises questions about the extent to which the next generation of Medicare beneficiaries will be able to bear a larger share of costs," the foundation concluded in an April 2011 report. So let’s look back. While Rigell’s office -- via the House Budget Committee -- points to similarities in the two plans’ flexibility, they remain fundamentally different at the core. At a minimum, the premium supports of the Medicare plan would not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and would not likely have the same options to buy more expensive plans. And, finally, they would not receive the same protection against rising costs that "Fair Share" provides members of Congress. We rate Rigell’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10368	"The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/30/ralph-nader/number-stands-up-even-if-other-details-dont/	Perennial presidential candidate Ralph Nader is in an uphill battle for both media coverage and significant poll numbers. But somehow he's managing to get the latter without getting any of the former, he said in a recent radio interview. "The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama," Nader said during a June 18 interview on Democracy Now!, an independent, left-leaning radio program. Nader garnered less than half that in the 2000 election and, by many accounts, damaged Al Gore enough to hand George W. Bush the White House. We checked the Associated Press polls and found none that gave Nader 6 percent. The most recent AP poll prior to the interview was an AP-Yahoo poll from April 17 that had Nader at 3 percent. Nader spokesman Chris Driscoll acknowledged the candidate had erred, and said he meant to cite a June 6 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll , which did indeed have Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez at 6 percent against Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Sen. John McCain and former GOP Rep. Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate. The finding needs context, though. Was it just an outlier? And what does it say about how Nader will do in November? Other recent polls show Nader with less support. A Rasmussen Reports poll released May 18 showed Nader pulling in 4 percent against Obama, McCain and Barr. A Reuters/Zogby poll released June 18 showed Nader with 3 percent. A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll released June 19, the day after Nader's interview, gave him 4 percent. History suggests, however, that even these polls overstate Nader's prospects. At this time in 2000, he was showing around 4 or 5 percent in most national polls, and he ended up with 2.7 percent of the vote. Around this time in 2004, polls had Nader at anywhere from 3 to 7 percent. He got just .38 percent in the end. Now, onto Nader's assertion that his support has come "without any national coverage." Clearly he was speaking rhetorically — we found his name mentioned 166 times on the major broadcast and cable news programs between the first of the year and the June 18 interview. But that's six months. Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him. We are also reluctant to pick on Nader too much for getting the name of a poll wrong. So with the caveat that his claim says little about how he'll do in November, we find it Mostly True.

pomt-05574	In "the past 10 years, our (Austin) water rates have increased by 100 percent and we now have the highest water cost of the top 10 cities in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/04/brigid-shea/brigid-shea-says-austin-water-rates-doubled-decade/	Austin mayoral candidate Brigid Shea, suggesting city leaders have failed to bird-dog affordability, referred to water costs in a March 5, 2012, op-ed article in the Austin American-Statesman. "One example is that in the past 10 years, our water rates have increased by 100 percent and we now have the highest water cost of the top 10 cities in Texas," Shea wrote. "And this is before the water utility plans to raise costs by another 19 percent by 2016." The 19 percent figure is in keeping with the Austin Water Utility’s forecasts of future revenue needs, utility executive David Anders told us in a telephone interview. For this fact check, we’re gauging Shea’s claim that water rates doubled, which the utility concedes, and that water here costs more now than in other big Texas cities. To our inquiry, Shea said by email that she drew upon a report posted online in February 2012 by an Austin environmental activist and consumer advocate, Paul Robbins, who edits the Austin Environmental Directory. Robbins’ report, funded in part by the Save Our Springs Alliance, used his methodology to compare water and wastewater costs in Austin to costs in other big Texas cities as well as nearby towns and cities, though we’re not exploring those comparisons because Shea did not speak to that. Between 2000 and 2012, Robbins’ report says, Austin’s water rates went up 100 percent and its wastewater rates increased 97 percent. Over those years, the report says, inflation was 35 percent. Asked to respond, Jason Hill, a spokesman for the Austin Water Utility, did not quibble with that calculation of rate increases, saying by email that combined water and wastewater rates doubled from 2002 to 2012. But the utility looks at water costs differently, we learned. Robbins calculated that for water customers of all kinds -- residential, multifamily (as in apartments), commercial and industrial -- Austin’s 2011 cost of water was $4.87 per thousand gallons. Corpus Christi’s 2011 cost for the same amount of water, ranking second, was $4.12, the report says, with San Antonio’s cost, $4.11, ranking third among the state’s biggest cities. Austin did not come out No. 1 in all the water-cost breakdowns. Corpus Christi’s 2011 costs of water for multifamily and commercial customers exceeded Austin’s costs. Generally, the report says, Austin’s costs are higher for various reasons, including that debt service comprises 41 percent of the Austin utility’s combined 2012 water/wastewater bills. The report notes too that the population in the Austin utility’s service area increased 20 percent between 2000 and 2010 while, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the other nine large cities averaged 12 percent population growth. Also, the report says, annual transfers from the Austin utility’s proceeds to the city for other purposes are expected to total $36.5 million over the 12 months that began in October 2011. In 2000, the report says, such transfers totaled $17.2 million, which adjusted for inflation would be $28.5 million in 2012. Hill, the utility’s spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the utility had not calculated water costs in Robbins’ fashion. "We’re not in a tit for tat," Hill said. "He has an opinion on something, on how he’s done the mathematics. Our priority is not, ‘Oh, he’s completely wrong.’ We have our way of doing the rates." Utility official Daryl Slusher later said by email that the utility questions the "meaningfulness" of Robbins’ methodology which, Slusher noted, does not tease out how little a conserving Austin resident pays for water nor how much heavy residential users pay under the utility’s tiered rate structure. Robbins later acknowledged that, pointing out, though, that only Austin’s residential rates are tiered to encourage conservation, though other customers are charged slightly more during the hottest summer months. Slusher also pointed out that the utility’s annual surveys of rates in other cities indicate that based on average residential water consumption, Austin’s rates are not always highest. In 2011, the utility’s analysis says, the average Austin monthly residential water bill of $27.79 was greater than comparable bills in San Antonio, Arlington, Dallas, El Paso and Amarillo, though less than such bills in Fort Worth, Houston, Corpus Christi, Cedar Park, San Marcos, Pflugerville and Lubbock. In 2012, the utility says, the estimated average monthly residential water bill of $33.22 is expected to be less than comparable bills in Georgetown, Cedar Park, Corpus Christi, San Marcos, Pflugerville and Lubbock. Slusher said the 2012 projected average bill includes the new revenue stability fee, which took effect in November 2011. The utility says the fee -- $4.40 for a ⅝-inch water meter, with larger meters having a higher fee -- will generate $17 million in 2012 to be collected regardless of how much water is sold during the year. "On the other hand," Slusher said, "we acknowledge that Austin Water’s combined (water and wastewater) rates are among the highest in the state. Austin Water, however, delivers a lot of value for that cost." He listed among examples past actions to secure the water supply through 2100, manage land for water quality and endangered species protection, add a water treatment plant, expand the wastewater system’s reclaimed water system and encourage "green" energy choices. By email, Robbins said none of those items are unique to the Austin utility. Also, Slusher said, successes Austin has enjoyed conserving water, detailed in a November 2011 fact check, help explain the utility’s higher costs per thousands of gallons shown by Robbins’ methodology. "If our conservation programs had not achieved as much as they have then Austin Water’s cost per gallon in Mr. Robbins’ report would be much lower. So if the metric by which we measure ourselves were the one he uses in his report then there would be a disincentive to conserve," Slusher said.

pomt-10566	"While others place their hands over their hearts, Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/08/chain-email/a-new-twist-on-an-old-distortion/	A new chain e-mail against Barack Obama recycles some false charges and adds some false twists. The e-mail, forwarded to us by several readers, provides a new spin on the false claim that Obama refused to put his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance. "Barack Hussein Obama will NOT recite the Pledge of Allegience nor will he show any reverence for our flag," it says. "While others place their hands over their hearts, Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches." We have previously examined e-mail allegations that he attended a radical Muslim school (so inaccurate we called it Pants on Fire), that he took the oath of office with a Koran (also Pants on Fire) and that his middle name is Mohammed (Pants on Fire). We've also explored the questions surrounding this photograph from Time magazine's Web site, which prompted the allegations that he "refused to say the pledge" (also False). Now comes a new allegation, apparently relying on the same photo. Since this one is new to many readers, we'll revisit some of our previous findings and address the new charge about slouching. (This is the first time we can recall slouching being used as the basis for a political attack.) The Obama photo was taken Sept. 16, 2007, in Indianola, Iowa, at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual political event hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin. The caption on the Time photo says Obama and the others "stand during the national anthem." Obama was on stage with New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Harkin's wife Ruth. As the Time caption indicates, the photo was taken during the national anthem, not the pledge, so the photo does not support the allegation that Obama "turns his back and . . . slouches" during the pledge. This is corroborated by an ABC News video of the occasion. It's clear from the video that the assembled Democrats are not turning their backs on the flag to make an antipatriotic statement. They are looking at the same point — presumably the woman singing the anthem. It is a matter of interpretation whether Obama is slouching as the anthem is played. The photo shows him with his hands clasped in front of his waist while the others have their hands over the heart (a point of anthem protocol that we addressed in this item). But it doesn't look to us like he's slouching and there's no evidence to suggest his posture was making an antipatriotic statement. Obama has responded to these allegations by saying he often leads the pledge when he presides over the Senate, as seen in this video from the Senate. So once again, we find a chain e-mail is incorrect about Obama. We find the statement False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-02-08T00:00:00	2008-01-06	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-06053	Says that when Republicans held Congress and the presidency, they "doubled the size of the (U.S.) Department of Education."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/11/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-when-republicans-held-congress-and-p/	A day after Texas U.S. Rep. Ron Paul finished second in the Republican Party’s New Hampshire presidential primary, Charlie Rose of CBS News asked Paul to comment on the view that as conservatives fail to coalesce behind an alternative to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, they’re making it easier for Romney to win the party's nomination. "Yeah," Paul replied, "but what if you coalesce with big spending and you elect somebody like that and you do the big spending? This is what we’ve done. When we’ve had the House and the Senate and the presidency, we coalesced, and we increased the (national) debt, and we increased the spending, we doubled the size of the Department of Education, we passed (the) No Child Left Behind (Act), we passed Sarbanes Oxley. "Why should we coalesce behind conservatives who aren’t conservative?" Paul continued. "They’re just big government conservatives. That’s why there’s frustration out there. That’s why people have started the tea party movement. So I don’t know why people don’t understand this." We don’t doubt that federal spending and the debt were increased by Congress in past sessions and that Republicans aligned with Democrats to create the No Child Left Behind Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law in January 2002, though Paul did not note that Democrats held a narrow Senate majority when the act advanced through that body in 2001. In July 2002, Bush signed into law the Sarbanes Oxley act, which was intended to enhance corporate responsibility and financial disclosures while combating corporate and accounting fraud. But were Republican majorities in Congress and a Republican president responsible for doubling the size of the education department? To our inquiry, Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, reminded us that PolitiFact in 2007 rated True this Paul statement: "It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something, so we double the size of the Department of Education." The GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, the Senate for most of those years and the presidency from 2001 through 2008. Significantly, the earlier fact-check weighed spending over years when Republicans controlled the House and Senate, regardless of who was in the White House. And the education department’s appropriation was $100 billion in 2006, nearly quadruple the $27 billion appropriated in 1994. Adjusting for inflation — the 1994 budget rises to $36.8-billion when calculated in 2006 dollars — the increase was 172 percent. Much of the increase came as a result of the No Child Left Behind Act. In return for implementing a regimen of student testing and teacher accountability, states received an infusion of federal funds. Some perspective: The $100 billion education department appropriation in 2006 was by far the largest up to that year, and something of an anomaly. It marked a substantial increase from the 2005 funding level of $71.5 billion. In 2007, indeed, the budget fell to about $67 billion, a 75 percent increase over 1994 levels in inflation-adjusted terms — big, but not doubled. That 2006 bump was the result of a massive increase in mandatory spending related to student loan processing and to a one-time infusion of $4.3 billion to cover shortfalls in funding for grants to university students. Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending, meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications. Most other programs — including No Child Left Behind funding — are considered discretionary, meaning the amounts get decided each year. Fast forward: Paul outlined more restrictive partisan conditions to CBS News, saying there was a doubling in the department when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress plus the presidency. Accordingly, let’s focus on spending over much of the first six years of Bush’s presidency when Republicans controlled Congress. From June 2001 into November 2002, Democrats narrowly held the Senate. So, how did the education agency’s funding change during Republican dominance? According to the department, its funding in fiscal 2001, which began before Bush became president, was $42 billion, which adjusting for inflation would have been $49.2 billion in 2007 dollars. The comparable figure for fiscal 2007, the last budget year over which Republicans held full sway, was $67 billion -- nearly 60 percent higher than such spending in 2001, 36 percent adjusted for inflation. This indicates that such spending went up under Republicans, but did not double. Still, there remains a way to suggest Republicans more than doubled the department’s funding. Cutting off the comparison in 2006, the year with the highest spending, results in an increase of 138 percent compared with 2001. Adjusted for inflation, the 2006 spending was 109 percent more than the agency was appropriated for 2001. Then again, the 2006 appropriation shakes out as the second-highest amount spent through the department for any year since 1980, according to the agency. It was later outpaced only by about $138 billion appropriated in fiscal 2009, an amount driven by nearly $100 billion in education spending included in the economic stimulus package approved that year. Excluding the stimulus year, appropriations to the department from 2007 through 2011 ranged from nearly $44 billion in 2011 to $68.5 billion in 2008. David Dunn of Austin, who was chief of staff to Bush’s secretary of education, told us in an interview that he considers the 2006 appropriation an aberration. Broadly, Dunn said, "we never felt like we doubled spending" on the department. "We knew spending increased significantly. We were proud of that." Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, stood by the PolitiFact check of Paul’s 2007 claim, saying by email: "...you are pathetic. You are about to contradict something that PolitiFact (al)ready fact checked. Why don'(t) you get a life?" Our ruling Paul’s comment to CBS News, reflecting on a shorter period than his 2007 claim, holds up by comparing spending in 2006 and 2001. However, in the last budget adopted when Republicans held full sway, the department's appropriation was 60 percent higher than in 2001, 36 percent accounting for inflation. That’s an increase, but not a doubling. One could also say Republicans cut the department’s appropriation between 2006 and 2007. Paul’s recent statement rates Half True.

pomt-13882	Says Donald Trump "spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/01/michael-caputo/trump-was-outspent-his-closest-primary-opponents/	After Donald Trump replaced campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, another aide, Michael Caputo, sent a tweet that read: "Ding dong the witch is dead!" Afterward, Caputo quickly resigned from the campaign. Since then, he’s been making the rounds on television. Caputo, who ran Republican Carl Paladino’s 2010 bid for governor in New York, appeared on Capital Tonight on Time Warner Cable News last week. During the segment, Trump’s finances came up. Trump had about $1.2 million on hand through the end of May. Hillary Clinton had $42.4 million. Caputo called Trump’s spending humble. "Donald Trump is not known for wasting money," Caputo said. "He spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly, and he doesn’t intend to start burning money in the middle of the street now." Caputo says he was referring to spending by Republican rivals who left the race: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also held out until late in the race. We wanted to know if Trump actually spent less during the primary than his closest competitors. Overall spending vs. spending during the campaign At first glance, the numbers show Trump spending more than his opponents. Filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Trump’s campaign spending has topped $63.3 million through May, which are the most recent filings. Only one GOP candidate spent more throughout the campaign: Ted Cruz spent $85.8 million. Among the candidates spending less than Trump: Rubio at $50.4 million, Carson at $62.4 million, Bush at $35.1 million, and Kasich at $18.8 million through the end of May. But if you break up that spending over a timeline of the primary, Caputo’s claim holds water. We looked at how much Trump spent compared to each candidate over the course of their respective campaigns. After Bush suspended his campaign at the end of February, his campaign reported spending $34.2 million. Through the same filing period, Trump’s spending was slightly less at $33.4 million. Carson dropped his bid just a few weeks later, in early March. His campaign spent $60.7 million through the end of February compared with Trump’s $33.4 million. Rubio dropped his bid in mid-March. Trump spent about $1 million more than Rubio by the end of the filing period that included March, but if you look at spending by both campaigns over individual days, Rubio’s campaign spent almost $4 million more than Trump before the Florida senator dropped his bid. Cruz suspended his campaign after losing to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3. Campaign filings through the end of May show Cruz had spent $85.8 million to Trump’s $63.3 million. The one exception is Kasich, whose spending came in at just under $19 million through May - more than $40 million less than Trump. Caputo told PolitiFact New York he was not referring to the Ohio governor when he made the claim. Our ruling Caputo, a Trump supporter and former adviser, said, Trump "spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly." When Trump’s spending is looked at broadly over the course of the campaign, he appears to outspend the majority of his opponents through the end of May. But a review of his spending during the time rival candidates were still in the race shows a different result. All except Kasich spent more money than Trump before dropping out. It's also worth mentioning that Trump did not have any major funding from a superPAC, while some of his opponents did. The Right to Rise superPAC, for example, spent more than $80 million to elect Jeb Bush.

The previous MP in that by-election, Hugh Mahon, remains the only member in the history of the House of Representatives to be expelled. He recontested the seat and lost. However, whilst by-elections on average swing towards the opposition of the day, experts told Fact Check that there are a minority of historical cases where the government of the day has achieved a swing towards itself larger than those required to unseat Labor in Longman or Braddon. With this in mind, psephologist Kevin Bonham told Fact Check that Labor losing a seat would be "unusual, but not as unusual as the very poor historic win rate indicates".

pomt-07800	The government will "go out and buy my breast pump for my babies."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-government-will-buy-you-brea/	The Democrats are at it again, said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.: Trying to get the government to solve all our problems. "I’ve given birth to five babies, and I’ve breast-fed every single one of these babies," Bachmann said on The Laura Ingraham Show. "To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny state." We decided to fact-check Bachmann’s catchy sound bite after seeing it repeated in the media this week. Bachmann’s comments were prompted by a decision from the Internal Revenue Service to change the way it classifies breast pumps and related supplies. Previously, the IRS said breast pumps were not medical expenses because they were related to nutrition. And nutrition -- i.e., food -- is not a medical expense. On Feb. 10, the IRS announced it had reconsidered, and that it had decided breast pumps are in fact used for medical care. Like obstetric care, breast pumps "are for the purpose of affecting a structure or function of the body of the lactating woman," the IRS said in its ruling. So does this mean free breast pumps for mom? Hardly. Formally, it means that breast pumps can be treated like other medical expenses that are tax deductible. Keep in mind, the hurdle for directly deducting medical expenses is quite high: The out-of-pocket expenses have to exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted income before you can begin deducting them. More commonly, it means people can now buy breast pumps using money from flexible health spending accounts. Many employers offer these accounts, which allow workers to save part of their paychecks tax-fee to a personal account that can be used only for health care costs. Because the money isn’t taxed, people are able to set aside more for health expenses than they would otherwise. The accounts have restrictions, though. There’s a limit to how much can go to the accounts, currently $2,500. People have to save all their receipts and submit them to an administrator in most cases. And if there’s money in the account at the end of the year, the employer gets to keep it. Because of the use-it-or-lose-it provision, people tend to use these accounts for predictable health expenses, not emergencies. In addition to the IRS announcement, breastfeeding has been in the news because First Lady Michelle Obama said recently that she hoped to promote breast-feeding through her "Let’s Move" campaign to prevent childhood obesity. Obama said that studies have linked breast-feeding to lower obesity rates. Radio host Laura Ingraham, who asked Bachmann about breast pumps, questioned Obama’s motivation for the "Let’s Move" campaign, and speculated that the First Lady might intend to run for office later. Bachmann, though, said she doubted that Obama was motivated by self-interest. "I think honestly she is really committed to the far left agenda, more than anything else," Bachmann said. We should note that Ingraham was accurate in explaining that breast pumps were being newly classified as a medical expense, and hence tax deductible. Bachmann, though, described the decision incorrectly when she said, "To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny state." Those remarks have been widely reported. It’s a catchy sound bite, but like a lot of sound bites, it’s not so accurate. The government will not buy you a breast pump. Rather, it will now allow you to treat money you spend on the pumps as a deductible medical expense. Bachmann's statement suggests a large government program to purchase and provide the devices when in fact the government is actually treating them as tax-deductible, like countless other things. We rate her statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-02-18T12:25:39	2011-02-15	['None']

pomt-02060	Senate immigration legislation is the "Obama-Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/28/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-senate-immigration-reform-efforts/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is facing his most significant primary challenge since he first won the Republican nomination for his Virginia congressional seat in 2000. With a few weeks to go before the June 10 election, he has hammered his opponent, Randolph-Macon College professor Dave Brat, on the air with negative ads while seeking to boost his own conservative credentials. In short, he’s taking the challenge seriously. Cantor’s latest attempt is to brand himself as a staunch critic of immigration reform efforts that passed the Senate last year but have stalled in the Republican-controlled House. According to reports, the GOP leader sent out a campaign mailer that claims Cantor is "stopping the (President Barack) Obama-(Sen. Harry) Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty." He went on to claim the "liberal plan would give six million illegal aliens citizenship." The timing of the flier is interesting; just last week, Cantor reaffirmed his support of a plan that would give citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants who enter the U.S. military. Some might call that amnesty. But let’s go back to the Senate plan and take a look at whether Cantor’s mailer is an accurate portrayal of the bill. Is it amnesty? We asked Cantor’s campaign to explain the language of the ad to us. They didn’t respond. Is it reasonable to call the Senate bill "amnesty"? In the past, we’ve said yes and no, generally settling on Half True. In addition to spending billions on new border control measures, the bill also seeks to address the status of the 11.5 million undocumented immigrants already residing in the United States. Some of those individuals would be eligible for a pathway to citizenship. In that respect, the bill does include an amnesty provision, because in legalese, the previous offense (in this case entering the country illegally) is eventually forgiven. But the path to citizenship is not without significant hurdles and the bill does not "give" away citizenship status, as Cantor portends in his campaign literature. For many people, it would take up to 13 years before they are legally citizens. And it’s not free, either. The bill would allow people to seek "Registered Provisional Immigrant Status," by demonstrating residence in the United States prior to Dec. 31, 2011, having no felony convictions and not more than two misdemeanors and paying a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 would be required after six years. After 10 years under Registered Provisional Immigrant Status, a person could pay $1,000 and seek a green card using a new merit-based system. People brought here illegally as minors, known as "Dreamers," and some agricultural workers would get green cards in five years, versus the 10 for everyone else who qualifies. New security measures would have to be underway before unauthorized immigrants could begin that process, however. Is it Obama and Reid’s bill? Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid both support the Senate immigration bill. Reid voted for it, and Obama has called on the House to take up the legislation. But it’s a tough sell to pin the bill entirely to those two Democratic leaders, and by calling it a 'liberal" plan, Cantor conveniently leaves out that it had sizeable Republican backing. For starters, the bill is largely the product of the so-called "Gang of Eight," a group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who spent months working on the legislation before successfully ushering it through the upper chamber. Obama’s efforts were mostly behind the scenes. Perhaps the most significant addition to the Gang of Eight was Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who joined Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and added a critical conservative and Latino voice to the debate. Someone on the left could just as easily call it the Rubio-Graham plan. It's far more accurate to label it a bipartisan proposal. The four Republicans in the "gang" weren’t the bill’s only GOP supporters, either. When it passed 68 to 32 in June 2013, 14 Republicans eventually voted for it. The Democratic caucus supported it unanimously, supplying the other 54 votes. Still, that makes it about as bipartisan a measure as you’ll see pass out of the Senate on such a controversial topic these days. While many conservative groups have come out against the Senate bill, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a right-of-center organization, has backed the immigration reform efforts, as have faith-based groups that more often side with the GOP on social issues. That’s not to say it’s not a contentious or politically charged piece of legislation. But characterizing it Reid and Obama's liberal bill is a distortion of reality. Our ruling In recent campaign literature, Cantor said the Senate immigration bill is "liberal" and the "Obama-Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty." Reasonable people might consider this amnesty, but it’s a much more rigorous path to citizenship than Cantor lets on in his flier. It’s certainly not a "give" away. Further, the plan had significant support from both sides of the aisle, both inside the Senate and from outside organizations. The bipartisan Gang of Eight is credited with putting together the package, not Obama and Reid. Weighing all of that, we think Cantor is intentionally misleading Virginia voters on this issue. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2014-05-28T18:01:39	2014-05-28	['None']
pomt-14552	Says Sen. Bernie Sanders has called President Barack Obama "weak. He's called him a disappointment."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/12/hillary-clinton/did-bernie-sanders-call-president-barack-obama-wea/	In one of the more heated exchanges of the Democratic presidential debate in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton accused Bernie Sanders of having shown too little loyalty to President Barack Obama. Clinton said, "In the past, (Sanders) has called (Obama) weak. He’s called him a disappointment." For emphasis, she later repeated the charge that Sanders had used the words "weak" and "disappointment." But did he? We found lots of examples of Sanders prodding Obama to take a more aggressively liberal approach to governing, and we have previously found some truth to the charge that Sanders had tried to find someone to challenge Obama in a primary when he was running for a second term in 2012. But the specific charge Clinton made -- that Sanders used the words "weak" and "disappointment" -- were at best exaggerated. We found two examples when Sanders used one or both of those words, both of which are murkier than Clinton lets on. One is an interview Sanders gave broadcaster Thom Hartmann on July 22, 2011. Sanders lamented that Obama, in his view, had moved too far to the right politically. But while Sanders used the words Clinton cited, he didn’t say that he himself felt that way. Specifically, Sanders said, "I think there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president, who cannot believe how weak he has been — for whatever reason — in negotiating with Republicans. And there’s deep disappointment." Note Sanders’ language: He says "millions of Americans" feel that way, not that he did so himself. It’s a small difference, but we think a significant one given the forcefulness of Clinton’s attack line. The other example we found came on Nov. 13, 2011, when Politico reported that Sanders would not say whether he would support Obama for re-election (though he ultimately did). The Politico article quoted Sanders saying that Obama should "stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it’s a little bit early in the process." Here, Sanders said Obama had reached weak agreements with his political adversaries, not that Obama himself was personally weak. Once again, this is more nuanced than Clinton’s assertion made it out to be. We should note that Sanders has used other words to distance himself from Obama’s policies and approach to governing. For instance, in July 2015, Sanders told Jim Tankersley, a writer for the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, "In many respects, the president was not strong enough on many issues. For example, he’s wrong on the trade issue, dead wrong. Also, the president made a mistake, that after his brilliant campaign of 2008, he essentially said to his most motivated supporters, thanks very much for electing me, but I’ll go from here on my own. I’ll sit down and negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell, and I really don’t need you anymore. Terrible mistake. Because the only way forward, to bring forth a progressive agenda, is to have the American people mobilized." This is certainly a critical assessment of Obama’s tenure, but it doesn’t include the words "weak" or "disappointment." Our ruling Clinton said Sanders has called Obama "weak. He's called him a disappointment." Sanders has critiqued Obama and used those words to describe the feelings of Americans, or to describe Obama’s policies. But Sanders did not specifically call Obama "weak" and "a disappointment." We rate the claim Half True.

Rep. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, blamed the Affordable Care Act for MU’s decision. "#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing," Rowden tweeted Aug. 21. MU cited an IRS decision based on the Affordable Care Act as the reason for pulling insurance subsidies for graduate students, who are considered university employees. The university said it would be subject to an excise tax of $36,500 per year per student employee if it continued its subsidies program, which was specifically designed to help graduate students pay for health insurance. To make up for the subsidies, MU announced it would give a one-time fellowship to all eligible graduate students. By law, the university couldn’t tell students the fellowships funds had to be used to purchase health insurance. On Aug. 21, after significant student pressure, MU announced it would "defer implementation of its decision regarding graduate student health insurance," according to a letter by MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. In other words, the university reinstated graduate student health insurance subsidies — at least for the time being. Even after the university restored the subsidies, it wasn’t clear if MU’s initial withdrawal of the funds could be blamed on the Affordable Care Act, or if MU had actually broken the law by reinstating the benefits. We decided to take a look. ‘#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare’ MU student employees aren’t eligible for the group health plan the university offers to other workers. And, unlike other universities, MU doesn’t provide a student group health insurance plan. Instead, students — graduate and undergraduate — can opt to sign up for an individual health plan offered through Aetna Health. Some graduate students are eligible to receive subsidies from MU to pay for their insurance, according to the MU Office of Graduate Studies website. To get the money, graduate students have to sign up for a student individual health plan provided by Aetna. Then, students must email the Office of Graduate Studies, which verifies enrollment in the plan and eligibility for subsidies. Students then receive a reimbursement for the insurance plan’s partial or total cost. Subsidy levels depend on, among other factors, the number of hours students work per week. By asking students to enroll in an individual health plan to receive money, MU requires its student employees to use the subsidies to purchase insurance, said Sidney Watson, a health law professor at St. Louis University School of Law. That’s a big no-no, according to IRS regulations created to enforce the Affordable Care Act. According to the IRS, employers are allowed to give money to their employees that could go toward purchasing individual health insurance. But employers can’t require workers to use the cash specifically for that purpose, Watson said. To comply with the health care law, employers can provide subsidies — and require that the money be used to purchase health insurance — only to employees enrolled in a group plans. And as we said, MU graduate students aren’t part of a group health plan. Hence the problem. In July, MU realized the potential implications of not complying with the law. The university pulled the subsidies to avoid penalties and legal trouble. Technically speaking, MU’s withdrawal of health insurance subsidies for graduate students is "the result of the interpretation of the Affordable Care Act by the Treasury Department, because the Affordable Care Act itself doesn’t address this question," said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University. So, it’s not just the Affordable Care Act that caused the problem. But, the idea that the removal of benefits is a "direct result of" the Affordable Care Act isn’t too far from reality. Absent the Affordable Care Act, Jost said, it’s likely MU would still be able to legally provide subsidies for graduate students to purchase individual health plans. "The basic problem with the statement is that it greatly oversimplifies a very complicated situation," Jost said. ‘#MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing’ By "the right thing," Rowden meant "give graduate students health insurance," Rowden’s legislative assistant Stuart Murray told PolitiFact Missouri. By that measure it’s not correct to say MU broke the law, several experts who spoke to PolitiFact Missouri said. "The university has other options; they do NOT have to break the law," said Gerald Kominski, a professor of health policy and management at University of California Los Angeles, in an email interview. MU could dodge legal trouble by adopting UCLA’s model, Kominski said. Health insurance is a mandatory for all UCLA students and it’s a condition of enrollment, according to the university’s website. UCLA automatically signs up all students in a student group health plan, which they’re all then billed for. This effectively requires all graduate students who’ve received increased stipends to use the money to pay for insurance unless they can prove they have insurance from another source, Kominski said. Jost, the Washington and Lee law professor, came up with another alternative. "(MU) could simply add (graduate students) to its employer plan as employees and give them employee coverage," he said. A comprehensive student group health plan would also solve the issue, said Philip G. Peters, Jr., MU health law professor emeritus. He also said this solution would be expensive for MU. The university’s original solution — providing stipends to all students that weren’t specifically earmarked for health insurance — was also within the framework of the law, said Watson, the SLU law professor. Overall, the experts we spoke to offered at least five alternatives to the graduate health insurance ordeal. On balance, "Rep. Rowden is partially correct and partially very wrong," Peters said. Our ruling Rowden tweeted: "#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing." Without the Affordable Care Act, MU wouldn’t have had to remove subsidies for graduate students. But MU can still provide health insurance for its student employees — all without breaking the law. The university could, for example, create a student group health plan for graduate its graduate student employees. The first part of Rowden’s tweet is accurate but takes things out context. The second part of the statement isn’t accurate. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Caleb Rowden	None	None	None	2015-09-25T13:33:33	2015-08-21	['None']

pomt-15044	The unemployment rate may be as high as "42 percent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-unemployment-rate-may-be-42-perc/	During the televised press conference in which he announced his tax plan, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump returned to a claim he has made before -- that the official unemployment rate -- currently 5.1 percent -- woefully undercounts the percentage of people who are unemployed. During the Sept. 28, 2015, media event, Trump described an unemployment rate in the range of 5 percent as "such a phony number." "The number isn't reflective," he said. "I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent." He continued, "5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent." We previously rated False a claim by Trump that "our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent." So if 18 to 20 percent is false, how does 42 percent rate? We took a closer look. We’ll start by offering a refresher about how the official unemployment rate is calculated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population. Not factored into this calculation are people who are not currently looking for work. This is the portion of the population that alternative measures -- such as those cited by Trump -- attempt to factor in. Broadly speaking, supporters of these alternative measures say that not working, regardless of the reason, is tantamount to being unemployed, and should be reflected that way in the official measurements. The 42% calculation We asked the Trump campaign for a source of the 42 percent figure, but they didn’t respond. The Fact Checker, however, traced it back to a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director. Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a "plausible measure of the potential workforce." If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you run the numbers, "the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent," Stockman wrote. Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws. In the column, Stockman himself acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so. "Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers," he wrote. "We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else." Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial. Stockman’s calculation "treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all." In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced. Taking another whack at the numbers All of this spotlights a long-running debate among economists about whether there is a better way to calculate the unemployment rate than the one traditionally used. It’s within the economic mainstream to believe that the traditional method that produces 5.1 percent is too limiting, even if the far more permissive calculation that produces 42 percent is vastly overstated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics itself offers a more expansive alternative measurement of labor "underutilization" called the U-6 rate. The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially "unemployed" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are "marginally attached" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force. Currently the U-6 rate is 10.3 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. For the sake of argument, we decided to see if we could come up with a percentage that approaches Trump’s 42 percent. We started with the 94 million Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. Here’s a summary. Category People Neither working nor officially unemployed, age 16 and up, civilians and noninstitutionalized only 94.0 million Subtract: Ages 16 to 19 9.7 million Subtract: Ages 65 and over 37.8 million Subtract: Students, age 20 to 24 8.7 million Subtract: Students, age 25 to 29 2.9 million Subtract: Students, age 30 to 34 1.4 million Subtract: Stay-at-home moms 10.3 million Subtract: Stay-at-home dads 2.0 million Subtract: Those receiving disability checks 9.0 million Subtract: Those in job training, ages 24 to 29 745,000 (estimate) Remainder: 11.5 million In other words, there are perhaps 11.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working (though they could be full-time students between 34 and 65, undergoing job training over age 29, or be affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early). If you turn this into a new type of "unemployment" rate, it comes out to 16.4 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 10.3 percent, but it’s only a small fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed. As Burtless told us previously, most of those suffering from being "out of work" can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society. "The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits," he said. This isn't the first time Trump has used the 42 percent number. In August, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave a similar statement from Trump Four Pinocchios, the column’s harshest rating for truthfulness. Trump then repeated it in his tax-plan press conference. Our ruling Trump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16.4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trump’s 42 percent. We rate his claim Pants on Fire. CORRECTION, Feb. 11, 2016: We've updated this story to reflect some changes to the statistics for students listed in the table. Our new calculation puts the highest "unemployment" rate we could produce at 16.4 percent. The rating remains Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1b7360a0-5e27-41f2-a541-c0e476663219	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-09-30T10:00:00	2015-09-28	['None']

pomt-05779	After prenatal diagnosis, "90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-90-percent-down-syndrome-childr/	During an interview on CBS News' Face the Nation on Feb. 19, 2012, Rick Santorum got into a lengthy discussion of prenatal issues with host Bob Schieffer. We’re looking at two claims from that exchange; but here we’re focusing on here is that "90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." Let’s first look at the context of Santorum’s claim. Referring to a comment Santorum had made on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio, Schieffer said, "You sound like you're saying that the purpose of prenatal care is to cause people to have abortions, to get more abortions in this country. … any number of people would say that's not the purpose at all." Santorum responded, "Well, Bob, that's simply not true. The bottom line is that a lot of prenatal tests are done to identify deformities in utero, and the customary procedure is to encourage abortions. … You said prenatal care. I didn't say prenatal care shouldn't be covered. We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. In many cases, and in fact most cases physicians recommend, particularly if there's a problem, recommend abortion. We know, Bob, that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." First, let’s recap what PolitiFact Florida found when it checked a similar claim in April 2011 that came up during a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives. Republican state Rep. Richard Corcoran said -- and the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates publicized it on Twitter -- that "90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted." Corcoran cited a New York Times article from 2007 that discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that "about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion." The story did not say specifically where the statistic came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion. We searched and found other studies that showed similar percentages. A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. A study in San Francisco published in 2006 found an overall rate of 81 percent. That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here). However, in additional research for this article, we’ve found information that makes the question less cut-and-dried. In a joint statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups cautioned against generalizing about national patterns from a series of smaller, local studies. "No current, comprehensive estimate of the number of pregnancy terminations following prenatal diagnosis exists," the statement said. "Several studies reporting older data, studies from single centers and studies from other countries have reflected variation in the number of pregnancies terminated. These studies are frequently cited, but given their limitations, are difficult to generalize to the current population of pregnant women in the United States. Undocumented observations from prenatal genetic counselors in the United States suggest that the rate of termination for prenatally diagnosed Down syndrome may vary across the country. New research is called for to comprehensively explore the uptake of prenatal testing and the outcomes of prenatally diagnosed pregnancies in order to more accurately define how women currently incorporate prenatal testing into their lives." ACOG suggested we talk to Mark I. Evans, a physician and president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. He emphasized that the percentage can vary significantly based on region and other factors. "In liberal areas such as New York City, probably 80 to 90 percent of patients with severe abnormalties do choose to terminate when legal to do so," Evans said. "In conservative areas, the proportion of terminations is much lower, perhaps as little as 10 percent" in some cases. We also located a paper in the journal Issues in Law & Medicine, titled "Informed Consent or Institutionalized Eugenics? How the Medical Profession Encourages Abortion of Fetuses with Down Syndrome." The paper cites the example of a professor and practitioner, Elizabeth Gettig, who found that "almost 100 percent" of women with a Down syndrome diagnosis chose to abort when she practiced in North Carolina, but the number dropped to about half when she relocated to Pittsburgh. Gettig offered several reasons for the disparity. "First, the Pittsburgh region has a higher percentage of Catholics," the paper said. "Second, there are more services than most cities in Pittsburgh to assist children who have disabilities." Our ruling A number of scientific studies have shown an abortion rate from 80 percent to 90 percent -- close to what Santorum said -- but all have been localized. Since there’s evidence that the decision to abort can vary by region, we think it’s an overstatement for Santorum to say that after prenatal diagnosis, "90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." There are no standardized, national numbers, so his use of the term "in America" is problematic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-00501	"If you want to vote in" Texas, "you can use a concealed-weapon permit as a valid form of identification, but a valid student ID isn’t good enough."	true	/texas/statements/2015/jun/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-you-can-vote-texas-concealed-/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, campaigning in Texas, called for citizens to be automatically registered to vote at age 18. Speaking at Texas Southern University, Clinton also lashed out at the Texas law reached by the Republican-steered Legislature in 2011 requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls. Rick Perry, the state’s governor into 2015, "signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters," Clinton said. Mostly True, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. recently found, noting that a federal judge had aired that conclusion, though the judge’s ruling that the law is unconstitutional remains under appeal. A reader asked us to consider another Clinton charge from that Houston appearance. According to a New York Times account of her speech, Clinton said young Texans had been disenfranchised by the voter ID law. "If you want to vote in this state," she said, "you can use a concealed-weapon permit as a valid form of identification, but a valid student ID isn’t good enough." This claim took just a few key strokes and help from a state office to confirm. Prior to the change in law, Texas law didn’t require anyone to present a photo ID to vote. However, Alicia Phillips Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state, confirmed by email that student ID’s previously could have been presented to help officials pin down someone’s identity for the purposes of voting though the law did not require anyone to present more than a voter registration card. The old law broadly said a voter could present a "form of identification containing the person’s photograph that establishes the person’s identity." The Texas secretary of state’s office says on its Frequently Asked Questions web page that the current ID mandate enables a registered voter to cast a ballot at a poll during early voting or on Election Day with one of seven types of a photo ID: A Texas driver license issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety. Texas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS. Texas personal identification card issued by DPS. Texas concealed handgun license issued by DPS. U.S. military identification card containing the person’s photograph. U.S. citizenship certificate containing the person’s photograph. U.S. passport. So, yes to voting in Texas with a concealed handgun license but no-go for someone presenting a student ID. Nationally, the National Conference of State Legislatures said in March 2015, 14 of 34 states with laws requiring voters to show identification at the polls included a student ID option, including three states — Mississippi, Virginia and Wisconsin — that, like Texas, were described by the group as having "strict" photo ID voting laws. Wondering if a student ID element was ever part of the legislation that became the Texas law, we reviewed the varied versions of Senate Bill 14, authored by Sen. Troy Fraser of Horseshoe Bay and fellow Republicans that advanced in the 2011 legislative session. We found no "student" mentions. Language permitting a state license to carry a concealed handgun to be offered at the polls wasn’t in the original Fraser proposal; it was added, though, before the Senate sent the proposal to the House, legislative records show. Voting by mail We’ve noted before that Texas maintains a no-ID element for voting by mail, in 2013 rating True a claim the Texas law doesn’t require a person voting by mail to present a photo ID. That’s so, we found, for all but first-time voters who did not present a photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when registering to vote. Those voters who seek to vote by mail can expect to be asked for a copy of their photo ID, yet even they don’t have to do so if they are disabled, in the military or living overseas. A registered voter wishing to ballot by mail must say she or he will be out of her or his home county on Election Day and during the early-voting period or she or he is sick or disabled or will be 65 or older on Election Day or confined in jail though still eligible to vote. Our ruling Clinton said: "If you want to vote in" Texas, "you can use a concealed-weapon permit as a valid form of identification, but a valid student ID isn’t good enough." The photo IDs accepted at Texas polling places include the state’s concealed-handgun license and not any student IDs. We rate this statement True.

pomt-02098	"Economic inequality in Multnomah County has a face -- and a name. It has 90,000 faces and names -- the number of county residents who are still unemployed, or underemployed, in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/may/16/jim-francesconi/does-multnomah-county-have-90000-people-who-are-un/	Income inequality is a hot topic both nationally and in Multnomah County, where Jim Francesconi has made it a central theme in his race against Deborah Kafoury and four other candidates for chair of the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners. Using campaign themes of "Moving Forward Together" and "Leaving No One Behind," Francesconi has said he will focus heavily on job creation if elected. The claim: Francesconi’s campaign website describes him as a "champion of workers’ rights" and highlights a jobs plan. It also includes the claim that the county is still recovering from the Great Recession. "Economic inequality in Multnomah County has a face -- and a name," according to one item. "It has 90,000 faces and names -- the number of county residents who are still unemployed, or underemployed, in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash." Does Multnomah County have 90,000 residents who are unemployed or underemployed? We checked. The analysis: We contacted Francesconi’s campaign and asked about the statistic. They sent an email containing several sources, including the annual and quarterly reports of a nonprofit agency that tracks employment data and a link to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics table showing "underutilized" labor for every state. However, the crux of his claim was contained in a news article that put county unemployment at 91,600 as of March 2013. We checked that by calling Amy Vander Vliet, a regional economist with the Oregon Employment Department. Her department is responsible for compiling and publishing the state’s official employment numbers. The correct figure for Multnomah County unemployment at the time Francesconi’s campaign published its claim, she said, is 27,800. The 91,600 figure, she said, appears to come from a category labeled "Portland Metro" unemployment in a report issued by Worksystems, a nonprofit agency that deals with employment in Multnomah and Washington counties. The greater Portland metro area, for the agency’s reporting purposes, is comprised of seven counties, including Multnomah. We then checked the campaign’s other sources -- Worksystems’ annual State of the Workforce and its quarterly report, issued in October 2013. We checked both. The annual report did not mention "underemployment." Vander Vliet verified that. The quarterly report, which included data through the end of September 2013, said a combined 68,000 people in Washington and Multnomah counties were underemployed as of that time. Vander Vliet said she could not vouch for the figure because her department doesn’t provide county-by-county information tracking underemployment. We called Rick McKay, senior project manager at Worksystems, who came up with the 68,000 figure. He said it’s based on a sampling of telephone interviews his agency conducts. "It’s a back-of-the-envelope kind of number," he said. "But it’s somewhere in that neighborhood." McKay estimated that about 60 percent of the 68,000 underemployed people live in Multnomah County. That would put the figure at 40,800. Clearly, that number isn’t statistically valid, but if added to the 27,800 people who are unemployed in the county, we get 68,600 people who are either unemployed or underemployed in Multnomah County. That’s considerably shy of the 90,000 figure on Francesconi’s campaign website. We asked the campaign about the discrepancy and received in reply a spreadsheet showing the number of people living below the federal poverty line in every county in the country. The numbers, taken from federal statistics, put the figure at 136,065 for Multnomah County. However, those numbers don’t take into account that many of those people, even if at or near the federal poverty level, are employed. In addition, federal poverty statistics have nothing to do with any of the sources the campaign originally provided. Our ruling: Jim Francesconi, now running for Multnomah County chair, says on his campaign website that 90,000 people in the county are either unemployed or underemployed in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash. His campaign, when asked, pointed to several sources to justify the number. One source, which the campaign could have verified, gave an incorrect figure for the number of unemployed workers in the county. Another, contrary to what the campaign asserted, made no mention of underemployed workers. A third cited a figure for underemployment, but the person who compiled the figure acknowledged it was an "estimate on an estimate." Taking that estimate and adding it to the number of unemployed in the county gives us a figure of 68,600 -- a lot, obviously, but far short of the 90,000 listed by Francesconi.

pomt-03200	The 2010 DREAM Act failed despite "strong bipartisan support."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/28/janet-napolitano/2010-dream-act-has-strong-bipartisan-support-said-/	Janet Napolitano is set to leave her post as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security after serving for President Barack Obama’s entire first term and into his second. But before leaving, she issued a ringing defense of Obama administration policies, especially when it came to immigration. Napolitano singled out the how the administration has handled young illegal immigrants who were brought as children to the United States. Under Obama’s policies, these young people have been allowed to stay, at least for the time being, under a policy called referred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Obama authorized the policy after Congress failed to pass legislation called the DREAM Act that would have achieved the same thing on a permanent basis. Napolitano suggested the administration’s hand was forced due to congressional gridlock. "Congress had a chance to give the so-called dreamers a way to stay in our country through the DREAM Act but, unfortunately, that legislation failed to garner the 60 votes need for cloture, falling just five votes short despite strong bipartisan support," she said. (Napolitano is set to leave her post on Sept. 6, 2013, to lead the University of California system.) Her comments got our attention. We didn’t remember strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate for the DREAM Act. That sent us looking up congressional votes to see what the vote was. On Dec. 18, 2010, the DREAM Act failed on a cloture vote, where 60 votes are needed to advance the bill. The vote ended up 55 in favor and 41 opposed, with four senators not voting. Among those in favor, the vote included 50 Democrats, three Republicans and two independents. (The three Republicans were Robert Bennett of Utah, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Only Murkowski still serves.) Among those opposed, the vote included 36 Republicans and five Democrats. There’s some bipartisanship there, but not much. At PolitiFact, we usually describe such votes as failing "largely along partisan lines." And in fact, the 2010 DREAM Act vote stands in contrast to more recent Senate votes -- which had much more bipartisan support. The farm bill, for example, passed the Senate 66-27 on June 10, 2013, with 46 Democratic votes, 18 Republican votes and two independents. The comprehensive immigration bill to overhaul the entire immigration system, including the DREAM Act, passed on a 68-32 vote, with 52 Democratic votes, 14 Republican votes and two independents. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare the relative bipartisanship of the DREAM Act votes with other votes. We set this benchmark: A bill receiving half its support from Democrats and half its support from Republicans would be considered 100 percent bipartisan, which would be a very strong showing of bipartisanship. (There are other ways we could calculate this, but this seemed simple and fair.) Using that measure as a yardstick, the 2010 DREAM Act vote was 6 percent bipartisan. Meanwhile, the 2013 farm bill was 28 percent bipartisan, and this year’s comprehensive immigration bill was 21 percent bipartisan. Napolitano said that bipartisan support for the DREAM Act was "strong." Actually, the DREAM Act seems a rather weak display of bipartisanship. (We asked for comment from DHS, but we didn’t hear back.) We should note that we’ve looked closely at the question of what makes a bill bipartisan before. In 2009, Obama claimed that a Senate committee approved a version of the health care law with "both Democratic and Republican support." We rated that Mostly False, since it got a single Republican vote out of 14 votes in favor. In 2011, we looked at House Speaker John Boehner’s statement that the House’s "cut, cap and balance" budget plan passed the chamber with "bipartisan support." We rated that Mostly False, the proposal got five Democratic votes out of 234 in favor. We noted in that report that there is a proud tradition of claiming that a vote is bipartisan, even when it has the barest sliver of votes from the other party. This tradition is -- dare we say it -- bipartisan. But that doesn’t mean it’s accurate. Our ruling Napolitano said that the DREAM Act -- a law that would have allowed young people in the United States illegally to stay -- failed in Congress even though it had "strong bipartisan support." We looked up the vote and found that three Republican senators joined 52 other senators on the vote. The bill failed because it required 60 votes. Three Republican senators isn’t "strong" bipartisan support, though. In fact, it’s pretty minimal. The vote failed largely along partisan lines. Napolitano’s remarks clearly suggest otherwise. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Janet Napolitano	None	None	None	2013-08-28T12:04:43	2013-08-27	['None']
pomt-06336	Obama creates new tax on Christmas trees, fees get passed on to consumers.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/09/blog-posting/republicans-bloggers-needle-obama-creating-new-tax/	In Oregon, fresh cut Christmas trees are as cherished as hazelnuts and Hood strawberries: We grow a lot of them, so we own them. So it was with some astonishment that PolitiFact Oregon heard that President Barack Obama was trying to make it more expensive for people to buy holiday trees. "Is President Obama 'the Grinch who taxed Christmas' trees?" queried a headline on the Los Angeles Times website. A Republican congressman from Louisiana issued a press release, slamming the Democratic president for trying to "sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees." By the end of Nov. 9, 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation had logged more than 2,000 comments on its blog post, "Obama Couldn’t Wait: His New Christmas Tree Tax." Locally, we spotted a Multnomah County GOP retweet of the Republican National Committee: "Obama admin creates new tax on Christmas tree farms, fees get passed onto the consumer." What in the name of Rudolph and Frosty and the Polar Express was going on? Oregon is the No. 1 grower of Christmas firs and pine, harvesting more than 7 million trees. (That’s twice the haul of No. 2 North Carolina.) Was the president seriously imposing a new "tax" that might make our holidays a little less ho-ho-ho? As it happens, a national fresh tree group had sought the 15-cent tree assessment to better promote its products. It’s a "checkoff program"much like the ones already in place for beef ("it’s what’s for dinner")and pork ("the other white meat"). The Agriculture Department approved the idea. The Internet exploded. By the end of the day, the White House had decided to re-assess. Betty Malone, an Oregon tree farmer who heads up the Christmas Tree Promotion Now campaign, said she was stunned anyone would describe the tree fee as something dreamed up by the president. "It’s absurd. We’ve been working on this for three-and-a-half years. The industry has talked about this for 20 years," Malone said. "This started long before Obama" was in the White House. To be fair, not everyone in the industry embraces the idea, although the National Christmas Tree Association reports the majority of responses to the proposed program were positive. Would the fee be passed on to consumers? That’s unclear, said Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association. "It doesn’t get automatically passed along, but somebody along the line has to cover it." Finally, there’s the question of whether the 15-cent assessment is actually a "tax." The federal government monitors the agricultural marketing board that administers the money, but the revenue doesn’t go to government. Rick Dungey, spokesman for the national tree association, insists it is not a tax. (He also says consumers should not see a difference in tree prices.) In Oregon, at least, revenue has to go into the general treasury in order to be considered a tax. If the government doesn’t touch the money, even though government mandates it, the assessment is neither a tax nor a fee. But we digress. We’re talking about the federal government. Let’s turn to federal sources, with the help of national PolitiFact. "It certainly doesn't smell or quack like a tax," said Robert Litan, the vice president for Research and Policy at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and a former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton. On the other hand, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the Cato Institute, says "a coercive levy is a tax." We also checked with Stephen Bell, communications director for U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the Louisiana congressman who vowed to block Obama’s sneaky tree tax, and Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman. It didn’t matter to either of them that industry had sought the assessment or that industry was denying it’s a tax. "It doesn’t matter who asked for it," said Bell. "It’s at the sole discretion of the Obama administration to impose a tax, and they decided to impose this 15-cent tree tax." This is a tax, added Spicer, because "it’s not voluntary. It’s not a contribution to a cause." So, where does that leave us? Sources appear split on whether this truly is a tax and whether the cost would be passed along to consumers. As for the claim that Obama created this new tax, that suggests that he came up with the program -- when it’s clear the idea preceded his presidency and originated with the industry. Those are pretty big facts to ignore. So we rate the claim Mostly False: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-07228	"We went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus trillion debt when George Bush left office."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/02/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-says-george-w-bush-inherited-56-trilli/	During an interview on the MSNBC show The Daily Rundown, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., addressed the previous day’s House vote to raise the debt ceiling. Hoyer blamed Republicans for turning the vote -- which failed by a wide margin -- into a political game. The "premise" of the debt ceiling vote, Hoyer said, "was we have this debt because of President (Barack) Obama's policies. That's simply not true, and the world knows it's not true, and the Republicans know it's not true. We went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus trillion debt when George (W.) Bush left office. So to say it is Obama's debt and that the debt limit needs to be extended because of Obama is simply not true." A reader asked us to check Hoyer’s claim that the United States "went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus-trillion debt when George Bush left office." Here’s the way we initially looked at it. We turned to a historical table published annually by the Office of Management and Budget. The table reports that during fiscal year 2001 -- which included much of Bush’s first year in office, and which was based on a budget assembled during the term of his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton -- there was a surplus of $128 billion. So Hoyer was right that there was a surplus, but it was only 2 percent of the amount Hoyer indicated it was. Meanwhile, according to the Treasury Department, the level of debt when Bush left office on Jan. 20, 2009, was either $6.307 trillion (the amount of debt held by the public) or $10.627 trillion (the amount of publicly held debt plus debt held by the government, including the Social Security and Medicare trust funds). With the latter measure, Hoyer’s in the ballpark. But when we spoke to Hoyer’s office, they said he was actually using a different yardstick for the first figure. They said Hoyer was referring to the $5.61 trillion in surpluses that the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress -- had predicted in January 2001 would materialize over the next 10 years, based on the fiscal outlook at the end of Clinton’s tenure. (Hoyer’s office confirmed our conclusion about the second figure.) The CBO number provides support for Hoyer’s claim, but we think that his failure to make clear that he was comparing a projected surplus to the deficit weaken his argument. Given Hoyer’s wording -- that when Bush came into office he "inherited" a $5.6 trillion surplus, we think a viewer would assume that it’s both a tangible figure, and that it refers to a specific point in time. In reality, it’s neither. It’s a projection of future surpluses, and it’s a figure that covers a 10-year period. In fact, the final two years of those surpluses wouldn’t even fall within Bush’s two terms in office. There is some merit in Hoyer’s larger point -- that Bush came into office with a rosy fiscal outlook and left with one that was far less so. And he’s pretty close when he says that Bush left an "$11-plus trillion debt" when he departed the Oval Office. Still, Hoyer left out enough qualifiers -- that the number was a projection, and that it covered 10 years -- that we believe viewers would take away an exaggerated impression of the fiscal picture Bush inherited. So we’re giving Hoyer’s comment a rating of Half True.	None	Steny Hoyer	None	None	None	2011-06-02T11:41:34	2011-06-01	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-14568	"Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic)"	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/09/viral-image/no-evidence-support-rumors-tying-zika-genetically-/	Global health emergencies understandably stoke fear, panic and wild claims. Exaggerations about Ebola were PolitiFact’s 2014 Lie of the Year. And now rumors about Zika, a virus linked to birth defects, are taking the Internet by storm. One of the claims goes something like this: Zika is caused by genetically modified mosquitoes, a testament to what happens when man tampers with nature or a purposefully manufactured weapon for population control. As Snopes and Discover have noted, this idea appears to have originated from a post published Jan. 25 to the subreddit r/conspiracy — our first red flag. But since then, the claim has been circulated by media outlets ranging from Infowars and Natural News to the Daily Mail, the Mirror, Russia Today and Fox News. One version can be found in a popular YouTube video entitled: "Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic) funded by Gates." The video explains that British biotechnology company Oxitec engineered genetically modified mosquitoes to fight the spread of dengue fever and other diseases with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Oxitec recently released these mosquitoes in Brazil, "where we have this explosion of Zika," the video says. "Writing’s on the wall, folks." We wondered if there is any truth to the notion that Zika is being spread by transgenic mosquitoes. In a word, no. Epidemiologists told us the rumor is baseless. The mosquitoes in question wouldn’t have been capable of starting the outbreak in 2015, and the geographic correlation offered doesn’t hold up. A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the organization has seen no evidence suggesting that Zika is linked to genetically modified mosquitoes. "I don’t know of any scientific evidence for this rumor, or any obvious way to do this that would be more efficient than natural transmission," said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. "I cannot state more emphatically that I believe this theory to be absolutely untrue," said Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University. Let’s dissect this claim bit by bit. Not a new disease The claim’s first problem is history. Zika didn’t suddenly appear after genetically modified mosquitoes were released. The virus was first documented nearly seven decades ago in Uganda and has cropped up many times over the years. On April 18, 1947, researchers studying jungle yellow fever isolated the virus from mosquitoes and named it after the Zika Forest where it was found. Though Zika had never been seen before, "it had probably lurked chronically in African monkeys, or some other native reservoir, for millennia," reports National Geographic. In the next half century, evidence of Zika was found in human fluids in a number of African and Asian countries, but only 14 cases of the human disease were documented. Zika was detected outside of the two continents for the first time in 2007. The small island nation of Yap saw 108 confirmed or probable cases of the disease. The second outbreak of Zika hit French Polynesia, another small island in the Pacific, in 2013. About 11 percent of the population (28,000 cases) were infected. In May 2015, Brazil reported the first cases of Zika infection along with a surge in infants born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which baby’s head is abnormally small. There are now an estimated 440,000 to 1.3 million cases in the country and the disease has spread across Latin America. Incapable mosquitoes The claim’s second problem is that genetically modified bugs couldn’t have been responsible for the 2015 Zika outbreak. Many mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti. This particular mosquito, common in tropical areas around the world, also spreads yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya. To combat dengue fever, Oxitec engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to produce a lethal protein and self-destruct. Females, which bite, are destroyed in the lab while males, which don’t bite and thus can’t transmit diseases, are released into the wild. They mate with local, non-GM females and the self-destruct gene is passed onto offspring. Oxitec spokesman Matthew Warren told PolitiFact that the mosquitoes typically self-destruct within one to four days, and the gene disappears from the population about 12 weeks after the initial release. "This means that offspring of the mosquito do not survive," said Durbin of Johns Hopkins. "Therefore, the progeny of these mosquitoes, even if infected with Zika, would not survive to transmit Zika." Wrong location The claim’s third problem is the geographic correlation, which besides not being the same thing as causation doesn’t actually match up. The first Brazilian cases of Zika reported in May 2015 were in Camaçari, a district in the northeastern state of Bahia that’s hundreds of kilometers away from the Oxitec trial sites. The biotech firm released the genetically modified mosquitoes in Juazeiro, which is roughly 490 kilometers from Camaçari, and in Jacobina, about 340 kilometers away. It’s also very unlikely, if not impossible, that Zika-carrying Oxitec mosquitoes made their way to Camaçari. For one, the typical Aedes aegypti mosquito can fly a maximum of 200 meters to 440 meters. For another, the trials took place months and years before the Camaçari outbreak (between May 2011 and September 2012 in Juazeiro and in Jacobina between June 2013 and December 2014). So "even if an Oxitec mosquito ‘hitched a lift,’ " it would have died long before, Warren said. Beginning in April 2015, Oxitec did release mosquitoes in Piracicaba, in the southeastern state of São Paulo — about 2,000 kilometers from Camaçari and 1,900 kilometers from the epicenter of the disease in Recife. According to the state’s department of health, São Paulo has reported only 20 cases of microcephaly as of Jan. 20, 2016 (though there is some suspicion over the official tally) while Piracicaba itself has two confirmed and 12 suspected cases of Zika. Oxitec’s true role in Zika’s rapid spread Rather than spreading Zika, Oxitec mosquitoes could actually help fight the disease, as NPR, CNN, and the New York Times have noted. The self-destructing bugs have reduced virus-carrying mosquito populations in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands by 80 to 90 percent, according to studies commissioned by the company. (Critics say these results are exaggerated.) Experts said the current explosion of Zika in Brazil is more likely due to the lack of barriers, higher population density, increased mobility and novelty of the disease rather than mutant mosquitos. Whereas the disease was confined by the ocean and small populations in Yap and French Polynesia, Durbin pointed out, Zika could spread through a huge amount of territory and infect way more humans in Brazil. Immunity and resistance to the disease has been documented in Nigeria and Indonesia. But in the Americas, Zika is basically a "virgin soil epidemic," said Morse of Columbia. (So were smallpox to Native American populations in the United States and yellow fever to European colonialists in West Africa.) "I think it’s extremely likely these introductions are inadvertent and not intentional because historically we’ve seen this kind of thing happen many times," Morse said. One final note. The viral image focuses part of its criticism on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation helped fund the genetically modified mosquito program. The foundation also is helping support PolitiFact’s efforts to fact-check claims about global health and development. Gates has no input over what we fact-check or the rulings we issue. Our ruling An Internet rumor propagated in a YouTube video claims that the "Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic)." There’s no evidence that this is true. The argument offered — where the Zika outbreak occurred matches up with where the transformed mosquitoes were released — doesn’t hold up. What’s more, the mosquitoes in question were specifically engineered to self-destruct before they can spread viruses. This claim is both inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-12129	"The idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/15/joy-reid/did-confederate-symbols-gain-prominence-civil-righ/	A major catalyst in the run up to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., was the city’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. As the nation reeled from the violence, some political analysts sought to place Confederate symbolism in a broader historical context to help explain the turmoil around the Aug. 11-12 weekend. "The idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s," MSNBC analyst Joy Reid said on NBC’s Meet The Press, Aug. 13, 2017. Reid went on to say that Confederate symbols were political statements aimed at African-Americans. American history features two periods when Confederate symbolism spiked: around the turn of the 20th century and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s. As a group, most Confederate statues went up in the earlier period. Early 20th century: Confederate monuments multiply A sharp uptick in the construction of Confederate monuments took place from the late 1890s up to about 1920. That’s according to a Southern Poverty Law Center study that took a nationwide inventory of the more than 1,500 Confederate symbols in public spaces. This chart from the study shows the increased pace of construction around the turn of the 20th century, with blue dots signifying monuments on courthouse grounds, red dots indicating other sites (including monuments) and green dots representing schools. Several cross-currents explain the explosion of Confederate symbolism in this period. This was an era of generational change during which Civil War veterans, dying of old age, were venerated by their children and grandchildren, experts told us. "Organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans came into being," said Charles S. Bullock, III, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia. "Civil War veterans were honored in parades. There is a Confederate Memorial Day which pre-dates the National Memorial Day." But as a victorious North fixed its gaze on a prosperous future, the American South was mired in poverty that would persist for generations. The monuments were a way to look back to an idealized past. "Tributes to the Confederacy — placing statues, naming streets and other public facilities — were part of the Lost Cause ideology that focused on an idyllic era of stately mansions, beautiful women and gallant Confederate officers," Bullock said. But the monuments also implicitly symbolized slavery and white violence, the experts said. "On the surface, they were memorials to the Confederacy and their heroes," said Karen L. Cox, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. "Yet, they were also built during a period of racial violence and strong beliefs about Anglo-Saxon (i.e. white) supremacy." "The fact that they were placed on the grounds of county and state courthouses was intentional," she added. "The message: white men are in charge." The period between 1890-World War I saw whites reassert control over the South by enforcing Jim Crow laws, taking control of southern governments and systematically disenfranchising and disempowering African-Americans, said Jonathan Leib, a professor of geography and chair of the department of political science and geography at Old Dominion University. Racial segregation also got a major endorsement at the federal level during this era. In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Plessy vs. Ferguson which upheld the constitutionality of state laws that racially segregated public facilities that were "separate but equal." (Nearly 60 years passed before the Court would declare such segregation "inherently unequal.") "This was also a moment when the nation itself began to repair the wounds of the late war by agreeing on the inferiority of African Americans," said Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School. "Racial segregation became the law and custom of the nation at precisely the moment when many of these monuments were built." Another monument born roughly of this era, a statue of Robert E. Lee installed in Charlottesville in 1924, now figures as a present-day flashpoint. Civil rights era: Confederate flag gains prominence The second period when Confederate symbols exploded was the civil rights era. But it was the Confederate flag — not monuments — that gained prominence during this time, as Reid later clarified in an email to PolitiFact and in a Aug. 15 appearance on MSNBC. The flag became a symbol of opposition to desegregation. "It was the choice to fly Confederate flags, more so than the building of new statues, on government property that became a popular show of resistance during the civil rights era," Muhammad said. He added the decision to fly the flag was a clear sign of protest against the federal government’s growing enforcement of civil rights. It was during this era when the Ku Klux Klan came to embrace the Confederate flag, notes the Southern Poverty Law Center. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Reid said, "the idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s." She added that Confederate symbols were political statements aimed at African-Americans. Reid's comment that Confederate symbols are political statements aimed at African-Americans is backed up by history, say experts. But she is wrong that Confederate monuments were built during the civil rights era. Roughly 75 percent were erected before then, according to a comprehensive study of Confederate symbolism. It was during the civil rights era that the Confederate flag gained prominence, which she later clarified. We rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-15010	Says Donald Trump "supports eminent domain" and the Supreme Court’s Kelo decision.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/07/club-growth/trump-supports-eminent-domain-abuse-says-conservat/	Slinging any pebbles they can find at the larger-than-life Donald Trump, some Republicans are taking the real estate mogul to task over his support for a legal concept called eminent domain. Eminent domain is the government’s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects, such as highways or schools. Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights. A recent ad by Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision. "The Supreme Court’s Kelo decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations," the ad’s narrator says. "Conservatives have fought this disaster. What’s Donald Trump say about the decision?" The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News. "I happen to agree with it 100 percent," Trump said. The narration picks back up: "Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights." Is Trump an eminent domain supporter, and does he agree with the Kelo vs. New London, Conn. decision that many conservatives deride? Club for Growth described it as "eminent domain abuse" -- but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion. Trump and Kelo The 2005 Kelo case concerned the government of New London, Conn., which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city. Several residents who didn’t want to lose their homes, including a nurse named Susette Kelo, sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the government’s eminent domain powers. In a liberal majority 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found in New London’s favor. While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public -- as in government-run -- work, this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area. At the time, Trump said he agreed with the decision, even though it was controversial. We found the July 19, 2005, transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growth’s ad. Here’s an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Fox’s Neil Cavuto: Cavuto: "What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision?" Trump: "Well, it's sort of not a good one for me to say, because I noticed every article written about it said, ‘Will Donald Trump take over your home?’ sort of using me as the example, Neil. And it's sort of -- it's an interesting situation to be in. "But I happen to agree with it 100 percent, not that I would want to use it. But the fact is, if you have a person living in an area that's not even necessarily a good area, and government, whether it's local or whatever, government wants to build a tremendous economic development, where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area that's not good into a good area, and move the person that's living there into a better place -- now, I know it might not be their choice -- but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things, I think it happens to be good." As Trump acknowledges, he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high-profile case involving his property. In the late 1990s, Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., but several pieces of private property were in the way -- including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking. When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump, New Jersey’s casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead. The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government. Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the Kelo case a few years later. So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid 2000s, but what does he think of it now? His current views It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then. On Oct. 6, 2015, Fox’s Bret Baier asked Trump, "What do you think of eminent domain?" "I think eminent domain is wonderful," Trump responded, adding that as a builder, he knows "better than anybody" how frustrating it can be when you’re building a project, and one property holds out and refuses to sell. "And you need a house in a certain location because you're going to build this massive development that's going to employ thousands of people. Or you're going to build a factory that without this little house, you can't build the factory," he said. "I think eminent domain is fine." Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the Kelo decision. Trump did not respond directly to that question, though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives. "I think it's a great subject -- it's a very interesting subject," Trump said. "I fully understand the conservative approach, but I don't think it was explained to most conservatives." Our ruling Club for Growth said "Trump supports eminent domain" and the Supreme Court’s Kelo decision. As recently as this week Trump has expressed support for eminent domain, and he has in the past said he agrees with the Kelo decision, which expanded the power, "100 percent."

pomt-12518	"More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2017/apr/25/brad-schneider/are-there-three-times-many-solar-energy-jobs-coal-/	As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump has championed the cause of coal mining. But critics of the coal industry have countered that Trump and other supporters of coal are overlooking an energy sector with an even bigger impact on jobs -- solar energy. In a Chicago Tribune op-ed published on April 20 -- two days before Earth Day -- Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., took issue with Trump’s environmental priorities. At one point in the op-ed, he wrote, "More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry." We had previously looked at whether there are more people employed in the U.S. solar-energy industry than in the oil industry. (There aren’t.) But the comparison with the coal industry was new to us, so we decided to take a look. The sources of Schneider’s statistics When we contacted Schneider’s office, they cited two sources, one for each number in the statement. The first number -- 260,000 U.S. solar workers -- stems from the 2016 edition of the National Solar Jobs Census, which is published by the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit organization aligned with the solar industry. We confirmed that, according to the foundation’s calculations, there were 260,077 solar workers in the United States in 2016. The second number -- unstated in the op-ed, but equaling 87,000 workers employed in coal mining, if you do the math -- actually overstates the number of mine workers. According to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the federal Energy Department, the number of people working at coal mines was 65,971 in 2016. The actual ratio between the two numbers would be almost four-to-one. So the congressman has some support for his statement. However, the comparison is not exactly apples-to-apples. Let’s explore why. Comparing data for energy jobs is tricky One problem for Schneider’s numerical comparison is that it uses different databases, with different methodologies. The Solar Foundation told us that their data comes from more than 500,000 telephone calls and more than 60,000 emails to known and potential energy establishments across the United States, resulting in a total of 3,888 full responses. The group counted jobs held by a worker who spends at least 50 percent of his or her time on solar-related work. They included jobs in installation, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and project development, among other categories. The Energy Information Administration data, meanwhile, comes from official U.S. Labor Department data. It includes employees "engaged in production, preparation, processing, development, maintenance, repair shop, or yard work at mining operations, including office workers." The coal industry considers the official coal employment numbers to be low "to the point of being fiction," said Terry Headley, a spokesman for the American Coal Council. "They don't include many people who work at a coal mine every day, full time, but are not company employees," Headley said. "They are employees of service companies that provide direct support services, such as coal truck drivers, electricians, surveyors, machinists, mechanics, construction workers and others. Taken together, despite everything that has been thrown at it, West Virginia alone has some 50,000 ‘coal miners and contractors’ according to the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training. If you go by the federal government data, West Virginia has only about 13,000 coal miners working." A better source While there will always be difficulties in making an exact comparison between the two energy sectors, there is a database well-suited for directly comparing solar and coal jobs. The United States Energy and Employment Report was designed by the Energy Information Association to put a variety of energy sectors on an equal statistical footing. This report found 373,087 solar jobs in 2016, compared to 160,119 coal jobs. (That’s a higher number for solar jobs than in the Solar Foundation report; it’s because the Energy Information Administration included jobs even if a relatively small proportion of the worker’s work week was spent on activities related to solar energy.) Here’s the full summary: This data produces a ratio of 2.3 solar jobs for every coal job. So by this measurement, there are more solar jobs than coal jobs, but it’s short of three times as high, as Schneider wrote. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and an expert in labor-force data, said she agreed that the U.S. Energy and Employment Report data is the best source to use. She added that other data from Indeed, where she is a senior economic fellow, bolsters the idea that the labor market is healthier for solar than for coal. "We saw almost eight times more solar job postings than coal job postings in the United States in the first quarter of 2017," Sinclair said. "Of course, these numbers don't represent current employment and are reflective of both growth and turnover in the different sectors. Still, it gives a sense of scale of these industries. This comparison leads me to think that Rep. Schneider's estimates may be on the conservative side looking forward." Our ruling Schneider said, "More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry." Based on an apples-to-apples comparison using the best available data, the ratio is just short of three-to-one. Still, the data we found confirms that the number of solar-related jobs does outpace the number of coal-related jobs today. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-10253	Biden is "one of the least wealthy members of the U.S. Senate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/howard-dean/we-should-all-be-so-poor/	Wealth has taken a beating in this presidential campaign as John McCain tries to paint Barack Obama as an elitist and Obama fires back that McCain is so rich he can't keep track of how many houses he owns. Now, it seems, a lack of wealth is the new political badge of honor. Just a day after Obama named Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate, Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean was on C-SPAN highlighting not only Biden's assets, but also his lack of assets, financially speaking. "Joe Biden has certainly been a good example of a working-class kid who grew up and got himself a scholarship to a great university, worked really hard and has really made good," Dean said. "One of the least wealthy members of the U.S. Senate, I think he remembers his roots and I think he'd tell you what a great country this is given his own experiences." Biden is the proverbial career politician. His main income is his salary as a U.S. senator. According to financial disclosure forms submitted on May 15, 2008, Biden's $165,200 salary as a senator in 2007 was supplemented with $20,500 he earned as an adjunct professor at Widener University Law School and a $112,500 advance he received from Random House for his book, Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics. Biden's financial picture gets a little fuzzier after that, because although each senator's financial disclosure statement includes assets, liabilities and earnings, the form does not require exact figures; instead, officials check off a range under which each item falls. So we know he has some income from several bank accounts, mutual funds and insurance policies. But he also lists liabilities including loans against cash value of life insurance policies, $15,001-$50,000; a loan he co-signed to pay for his son's college expenses, $15,001-$50,000; and a line of credit with the J. Wilmington Savings Fund Society for somewhere between $100,001 and $250,000. The Center for Responsive Politics analyzes the possible ranges of net worth among senators and in 2006 they determined that Biden's net worth was somewhere between negative $302,980 and $277,997. But keep in mind, you don't have to declare the value of your primary residence. Property records show that Biden's three-bedroom Wilmington, Del., home has an assessed value of $525,700. Still, in 2006, those disclosed numbers ranked Biden dead last among U.S. senators. "In the most recent rankings, 2006, he was the least wealthy, poorest I guess you could say, of the senators," said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. The center has not yet completed its rankings for 2007, but Ritsch said he has seen Biden's 2007 report and his net worth "hasn't changed much. I suspect he's still at the bottom of the list." It's a heady list. Senators had a median net worth of about $1.7-million in 2006, and 58 percent of the members rated as millionaires, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan research group Center for Responsive Politics. So where are the guys at the top of the ticket? In 2006, Obama's net worth was estimated at somewhere between $456,012 and $1,142,000, according to a CRP analysis. That earned him a ranking of 67th. But it's a ranking that is sure to go up. Obama's 2007 tax return showed earnings of $4.2-million, based largely on the sale of his books Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope. McCain rode his wife's coattails to No. 8 in the 2006 ranking among senators, with an average net worth, $36.4-million. Much of McCain's wealth comes from his wife, Cindy McCain, who is chairman of Hensley & Co., her family's Arizona beer distributorship. So congratulations, Sen. Biden, you are in fact one of the least, if not the least, wealthy members of the U.S. Senate. For now. We bet book sales for a vice presidential candidate will soon change that.

pomt-00183	"He even supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/oct/19/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-attacks-molinaro-record-womens-issues/	Gov. Andrew Cuomo is keeping up the attacks on his Republican opponent, Marc Molinaro, as he campaigns for a third term. His latest ad, running online and also airing on television, focuses on issues important to women and criticizes Molinaro for opposing equal pay, abortion rights and taking guns away from domestic abusers among other positions. But one claim stood out. Cuomo says Molinaro "supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth." Where did that come from, and is it true? The Assembly bill As an Assembly member in 2009, Molinaro voted against a bill to prohibit the use of shackles and restraints on pregnant inmates who are in labor. In support of the "anti-shackling bill," women who had been incarcerated in New York State described how they were subject to the use of waist chains, handcuffs, and shackles, while they were in labor. Health care organizations called the restraints harmful to women and their babies. "Physically restraining a pregnant prisoner poses undue stress on both her and her baby, is uncomfortable and possibly could interfere with proper assessment of the patient's condition," the Medical Society of the State of New York wrote in a letter supporting the bill. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called for an end to the practice before the legislation. By 2009, at least four other states had enacted prohibitions on restraining inmates during delivery. Groups opposed to the bill included the New York State Association of Counties, which said it takes away discretion of local sheriffs and medical personnel. It could add expenses to local budgets, the association said. The New York State Sheriff’s Association also opposed the measure. The bill, S.1290-A/A.3373-A, won wide support, passing 61-0 in the Senate and 119-21 in the Assembly. The law restricts the use of restraints when pregnant inmates in labor are transported to a hospital and during delivery and recovery. During transport to a medical facility before labor, and only under "extraordinary circumstances," the law allows corrections staff to handcuff them by one wrist if the women are a danger to themselves or to medical or corrections personnel. No restraints may be used during labor or during recovery. The law calls for corrections personnel to stay with the woman during her hospital stay to keep her in custody. The law applies to state correctional facilities and local jails. Between 60 and 70 state prison inmates were pregnant in 2007 and 2008, according to Sen. Velmanette Montgomery, a bill sponsor. Molinaro's regret Molinaro said recently that he would not vote the same way today - not because he changed his mind about the substance of the bill, but because of politics. He said he voted against the 2009 bill because of concerns raised by physicians and corrections officers about women acting violently against themselves and their newborns, according to an article in the Poughkeepsie Journal. "The way the bill was written, there was no discretion," Molinaro told the newspaper’s editorial board. "It made a very black-and-white statement that could put women and children at risk." Molinaro explained his regret to the editorial board. "I regret that vote only in that I had to deal with it politically," he said. "The only reason I regret that vote is that you can spin it the way you wish." We asked the Molinaro campaign whether he had anything to add and if there is any context we should consider when evaluating Cuomo’s claim about Molinaro’s vote. Campaign spokeswoman Katherine Delgado provided a memo written by then-Gov. David Paterson when he signed the bill into law. Paterson acknowledged some people were concerned the law would be interpreted to apply to any pregnant woman being transported for any reason. Paterson wrote that he did not share that concern. The Molinaro campaign also drew attention to Paterson’s statement that he would prefer a bill that would allow corrections personnel to use discretion about whether to use a restraint if the inmate posed a risk to the public or could escape. Paterson decided not to veto the bill because inmates who are a danger to the public would also likely be a danger to themselves or medical or corrections personnel, as specified in the law. Inmates thinking about trying to escape would be deterred by the presence of a correctional officer, he said. In a video interview with USA TODAY Network, Molinaro pushed back on the use of the term "shackle" when describing restrained inmates. He was not directly asked about that vote. But speaking generally about votes that have come under scrutiny during the campaign, Molinaro said he has evolved. "If we want to be held and defined only by slices of our lives, we’ll get nowhere," he said. Our ruling Cuomo said Molinaro "supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth." Molinaro was one of 21 Assembly members to vote against a bill that would prohibit the use of restraints on pregnant inmates held in local jails and state prisons during childbirth.

pomt-12166	Says a New York physician and his wife jumped to their deaths because they "can’t afford" Obamacare.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/03/blog-posting/blog-posts-dont-update-bad-details-about-couples-s/	A story shared on multiple websites about a New York couple who committed suicide because they couldn’t afford to pay for health care is the result of news outlets that at first wrote the pair left a note saying as much, but later walked back the claim. A July 28, 2017, post on NewsBreaksHere.com said a 53-year-old Manhattan chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife had jumped out of a high-rise window together, leaving a note that read, "We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care." The post noted that the suicide came "just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare," but that three members of the GOP had voted no, defeating the measure and keeping the Affordable Care Act in place. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. There was a double suicide in midtown Manhattan on July 28, according to the New York Post. Glenn Scarpelli and Patricia Colant jumped from the ninth floor of the building where they worked, leaving behind a 19-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter. The husband and wife also did leave a note, which read, "We had a wonderful life." But the couple was deeply in debt. The New York Post reported a lien showed they had owed more than $23,000 in federal taxes, and as of April 2015 they had more than $232,000 in debt. Scarpelli had faced legal action in 2013 for not paying back a $60,000 student loan. The "financial spiral" in which they were trapped was too much for the couple, who elected to jump to their deaths, the Post reported. There was no mention of medical costs, or health insurance premiums, or anything else related to the Affordable Care Act. So where did all these posts mentioning health care costs come from? Initial versions of the New York Post’s story apparently cited a law enforcement source that said there was a second note at the scene. That note reportedly read, "We both have medical issues, we just can't afford the health care." Later versions of the story corrected that assertion, saying a New York Police Department spokesman refuted that detail, and that there was no mention of health care costs in the couple’s sole suicide note. Several posts on different websites cited a version of the story from the U.K.’s Daily Mail, which appears to have included the same details and also was updated. Neither story indicates what was changed in the text during the subsequent updates. Using an uncorrected and incomplete version of the story led those posts to highlight the erroneous assertion that medical expenses, whether through high insurance premiums or procedural costs, drove the couple to suicide. Our ruling Bloggers said a New York physician and his wife jumped to their deaths because they "can’t afford" Obamacare. Multiple blog posts said that the couple committed suicide because of unaffordable medical costs. That was based on initial reports about the note the pair left behind, and turned out not to be the case. News outlets later took out references to health care expenses when they updated their stories, but the flawed information remained in other posts. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10837	"Our whole food system in this country...most of it is genetically engineered. And (there is) no testing for the health consequences of this food."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/11/dennis-kucinich/biotech-foods-less-widespread-and-better-tested-th/	At a cancer forum in Iowa sponsored by Lance Armstrong, Kucinich said, "In 1992 the Food and Drug Administration approved, without any scientific basis, the manufacturing of genetically modified organisms for food. Our whole food system in this country has now been — most of it is genetically engineered. And no safety testing was done, no testing for the health consequences of this food." He's exaggerating. First, a little history. The FDA caused a storm of controversy in 1992 when it declared that it would hold plants developed through biotechnology to the same standards as all other foods. Under the ruling, foods made with plants whose genetic material had been altered using biotechnology would not face higher scrutiny than foods produced in traditional ways. In 1994, the agency for the first time approved a bioengineered food product — a tomato that resisted rotting — for human consumption. Although the safety standards are the same for bioengineered and traditional foods, the agency says that, in practice, genetically modified foods usually receive a more thorough review. These foods are subject to a voluntary consultation process, where the producer can choose to review its own health research with the FDA's scientists. That process appears to give an advantage to the food companies, but it still involves more testing than Kucinich's statement suggests. As of 2004, every bioengineered food product on the market had completed this consultation process, the FDA said. (More recent statistics were not available.) So Kucinich exaggerates when he says that "no safety testing" has been done on the products that are on the market, although the process has been criticized for giving food companies too much influence. In 2001, the New York Times reported on the political considerations that went into the FDA's decisions on genetically engineered foods in the 1990s, revealing that many scientists in the agency had expressed doubts about the safety of the foods but were silenced by the focus on the deregulation of industry by the first Bush administration. Many environmental groups continue to push for greater regulation of genetically modified foods, including labeling, while the FDA continues to insist that these foods do not pose health risks to consumers. Kucinich is closer to the mark with his claim that most food is genetically engineered. The Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group critical of biotechnology, says that a handful of genetically modified crops - mostly corn, soybeans, canola and cotton — account for most of the foods involved. But the group also estimates that 60 to 70 percent of processed foods contain at least some residual genetically modified organisms. Joe Mendelson, the group's spokesman, said Kucinich "has firm ground to say it's penetrated our food markets a great deal. But it is certainly not everything."

NBC News called Eastman "the new darling of the left." She "rode a progressive wave," the Omaha World-Herald said of her May primary victory. Now Eastman gets to challenge a Republican incumbent, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, for the congressional seat in November. That has put her under the watch of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that wants to retain the House of Representatives’ Republican majority. The PAC, aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, released a TV and web ad on Sept. 4 saying that because Eastman was opposed to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 -- the so-called Republican tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump just before Christmas -- and has spoken of repeal, a vote for Eastman would be a vote to "eliminate your tax cuts." "Your family," the ad says, would have to pay $2,500 more a year in taxes as a result. Eastman’s position, however, is more nuanced than that. What it really means The ad begins with an announcer saying, "We know Kara Eastman is a liberal. But what does that really mean?" If Eastman is elected, the ad says with a series of answers, Americans would pay $32 trillion. "That’s the cost of Eastman’s plan to give everyone free health care," the announcer says. Then the ad gives another figure, $600 billion. "That’s the price of Eastman’s free college plan," the announcer says. And finally: "$2,500 -- that’s how much more your family will pay after Eastman eliminates your tax cut." The first two figures are based on the legislative equivalent of moonshots for progressives like Eastman. For example, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, has said his College for All Act, eliminating tuition for families making $125,000 or less, would cost $600 billion, financed through a new "Wall Street speculation tax." And left- and right-leaning think tanks alike have pegged the cost of Sanders’ "Medicare for All Plan" around $32 trillion, although Sanders disputes the estimates. But free college and health care in the United States would require a political tsunami before they could get more than fleeting floor discussion in Congress. Eastman might support them but even if elected, she could be waiting a long time. The Kaiser Family Foundation last year suggested it could take "a prolonged national debate over making such a dramatic change to the U.S. health care system." That is why we are focusing here on something far more likely: a change in the tax rates and Eastman’s position specifically. If Congress doesn’t change the new tax law, in fact, Americans are practically guaranteed to face a tax hike within a decade. That’s because lawmakers structured individual tax cuts to expire by 2027, a way of making costs fit within 10-year congressional budget contours. The law can be amended and extended when the time is right -- and unless members of both parties want to face accusations that they raised taxes, they are almost certain to try to make those changes and keep many if not all of the individual tax cuts intact. That brings us back to Eastman’s position on those taxes and the claim we are examining. The Congressional Leadership Fund is telling residents in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District that "your family" will pay $2,500 more if Eastman gets her way. Will they? The facts To answer, we first asked the Congressional Leadership Fund to cite the basis of its claim. The PAC said the $2,500 figure is from a U.S. House Ways and Means Committee analysis in December of how much money families in each congressional district would save with the tax cuts. The committee’s Republican leaders said in their estimate that a married couple with two children in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District would get a median cut of $2,597. Next, we looked at why the Congressional Leadership Fund says Eastman would take these tax cuts away. The PAC said the elimination claim came specifically from a May 14 article in the Omaha World-Herald that described differences between Eastman and her Democratic primary campaign opponent. The article said: "The candidates agree that the recent Republican tax overhaul was overly tilted to the wealthy, but Eastman wants to repeal the law and go in the other direction while Ashford would want it to be rolled back. For example, the bill cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Eastman wants to see it at least returned to 35 percent, while Ashford would set the corporate rate at about 26 percent." If both parts are true -- that the median annual tax cut for a family of four in Eastman’s district was $2,500, and if Eastman "wants to repeal" the tax law -- then the claim would be accurate. But there’s more to it. Even the $2,500 figure is disputed. Figures for savings by middle-class families across the country have differed because of variables included or excluded in estimates, such as changes to deductions and exemptions, and even because of different methods of counting. As PolitiFact reported in July: "For 2018, the average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of the income scale is $780. That’s much less than it is for the top one-fifth of the income scale -- $5,790 -- and compared to the top 1 percent, at $32,650, it’s positively paltry." That’s a national figure. While the Ways and Means Committee says the average savings in Nebraska District 2 is $2,597, the liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has put the savings for middle-class Nebraskans -- those earning $45,430 to $73,300 -- at $840. But the institute added that due to the scheduled expirations, those families’ taxes will rise by 2027. "The CLF ad is deceptive in that they are using fuzzy math and refuse to admit to voters that the Republican tax bill will raise taxes on middle-class families in Nebraska by 2027," said Heather Aliano, Eastman spokeswoman. Eastman’s plan Quibbling over sums aside, what about Eastman’s statement, as cited by the Congressional Leadership Fund, that she wants to repeal the law, a characterization -- but not an Eastman quote -- in the Omaha World-Herald? Courtney Alexander, the Congressional Leadership Fund’s communications director, told PolitiFact the article speaks volumes. "We are simply referring to an article by the Omaha World-Herald, which is arguably the most respected newspaper in the state," Alexander said. Yet the information on taxes was in a single paragraph highlighting the candidates’ general positions, not the details. We found several more detailed descriptions, and Eastman’s campaign sent us others. None spoke of repealing the entirety of the 2007 tax cuts. Nor, for that matter, did the article that the Congressional Leadership Fund says it based its ad on. In that single paragraph on taxes, Eastman said she wanted the corporate income tax rate returned to 35 percent, but she did not speak about individual rates. That turned out to be consistent with more detailed quotes and statements elsewhere in which Eastman criticized the December tax package as too generous to the wealthy but never said she wanted to take away middle-class tax cuts. In an interview with the Gateway, an independent, student-run newspaper and website at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Eastman said in August that "we need to be thinking more about regular people." "I would like to see that tax bill flipped so that we are taxing the very wealthy and large corporations at a fair rate," she said in that interview. "Giving them a tax break does not benefit Nebraskans. It actually just benefits the CEOs of those companies and the shareholders. And we're seeing clearly that cutting taxes for the very wealthy is not the way to boost the economy." On her campaign website, Eastman says, "The U.S. has to generate more revenue to pay down our $20 trillion debt by raising the top tax rate and eliminating corporate tax loopholes." The website says nothing about overall repeal. Discussing this with the Congressional Leadership Fund, Alexander again cited the newspaper language that said Eastman wants to "go in the other direction" from the one the tax bill followed. Although that direction was not specified in the article the PAC cites, Alexander said that "if you repeal the tax cuts, the tax rates go up. Kara Eastman said she wants to repeal the bill." Eastman has not said she wants to repeal everything, however. She has not laid out her own tax plan or proposal, but she has said repeatedly that she wants rates to go back up for the rich, not the middle class. "That tax plan is a dupe to Americans, to the middle class, to working people, and we need to flip that tax plan on its end," she told KETV, Omaha’s ABC affiliate, on March 12. Asked how she would change it, she spoke about "taxing the very wealthy, the 1 percent and corporations." Aliano, the campaign spokeswoman, told PoltiFact, "Kara doesn’t want to see tax rates rise for the middle class. She’d like to maintain the tax breaks the middle class receives long term -- something the Republican tax plan doesn’t do." Our ruling The claim that Eastman will raise taxes on "your family" by $2,500 is based on a generalization in a single article that could be open to interpretation. It need not be viewed in isolation, because a body of interviews and statements exists that show more specifically what Eastman would do. She would raise rates on the wealthy. She has not spoken of raising rates on the middle class. We rate the claim False.

pomt-10759	Obama spokesman Bill Burton says Clinton gave Bush "a blank check on a critical foreign policy issue."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/29/barack-obama/not-quite-a-blank-check/	A spokesman for Barack Obama said that Hillary Clinton gave President Bush a "blank check" by voting for the Kyl-Lieberman Amendment declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to be a terrorist organization. Obama and other Democrats have tried to use Clinton's vote to portray her as careless on Iran and remind voters she backed President Bush's request to go to war with Iraq. Obama advisers say the Kyl-Lieberman amendment provides a new rationale for keeping U.S. troops in Iraq and could be used to justify an attack on Iran. "Without a doubt," Obama adviser Greg Craig said in a memo, "President Bush can cite that language as authorizing him to maintain and use U.S. troops in Iraq for the purpose of containing Iran, curtailing Iran's influence in Iraq, and, if need be, to expand our troops' activities beyond Iraq's borders to pursue and attack Iranian forces." Sen. Joe Biden made that argument forcefully in a statement after the vote, arguing that the Bush administration has interpreted laws in ways Congress did not intend. "I don't trust this administration not to twist its words into a justification for war," Biden said. "I don't trust this administration to follow the plain meaning of the law." But Clinton emphasized that the amendment was "non-binding" and that it "in no way authorizes or sanctions military action against Iran." So which side is right? Some foreign policy analysts — and a senator who supports Obama — say it's an exaggeration to call the amendment a "blank check." "It's non-binding, so it has no policy implications, let alone legal implications," said Michael A. Ledeen, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. "It's posturing." Sen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat supporting Obama, told Bloomberg Television that the resolution does not give authority "to invade Iran or any other country ... I have the same concerns that Barack Obama does about this administration and what they might do with the power that they have. But I don't think this resolution gives them a green light to do anything." But other analysts say that while the legislation may not appear to be a blank check, the Bush administration may try to use it that way. "I think it's sort of a stretch, but this administration has been known to make that stretch previously," said Max Bergmann, deputy director of the National Security Network, a left-leaning group that studies national security. "It's getting into an area where Congress and our country have been burned before." Given the differing interpretations, we rate the "blank check" claim to be Half True.

pomt-04050	"Washington, D.C., had some of the strictest gun laws in the country. And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/28/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-after-dc-passed-gun-laws-viol/	Do gun laws work? As lawmakers consider President Barack Obama's call to take action against gun violence after mass shootings in Connecticut, Colorado, Wisconsin and Arizona, some argue new rules won’t help. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told Fox News that Obama’s plan — which proposes steps such as closing background check loopholes and banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — is "not going to solve the problem." "Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country," Rubio told host Brian Kilmeade on Jan. 17, 2013. "And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed." We wanted to know: Did violence leap after the nation’s capital cracked down on guns? Unprotected citizens In 1976, the District of Columbia required all guns to be registered, banned new handguns and required guns at home to be stored unloaded and disassembled or locked up. The law’s handgun ban was invalidated by federal courts in 2007, a decision reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. But for three decades, the nation’s capital had some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country. We’ll note that the president isn’t proposing D.C.’s gun laws — indeed, the Supreme Court took that off the table — so it’s a comparison of questionable value. But we were curious whether Rubio was correct to say that Washington’s handgun ban was followed by violence. Why would violence climb after such a ban? Rubio’s office declined to explain, but a Jan. 15, 2013, opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by journalist and attorney Jeffrey Scott Shapiro makes a similar argument: The gun ban had an unintended effect: It emboldened criminals because they knew that law-abiding District residents were unarmed and powerless to defend themselves. Violent crime increased after the law was enacted, with homicides rising to 369 in 1988, from 188 in 1976 when the ban started. By 1993, annual homicides had reached 454. Shapiro’s homicide numbers match the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics. But when we looked at related data, it was quickly apparent he chose statistics that told a simple story — pass ban, violent crime soars — that was in reality much more complicated. We reached out to Shapiro to ask for research to support his conclusion, but didn’t hear back. Violent crime rates in the District of Columbia from 1976 look like a rockin’ roller coaster, dipping slightly after the ban’s passage, climbing steadily until the early ‘80s, diving again through the late ‘80s, then climbing a steep mountain until the early ‘90s. Then violent crime, as in the rest of the country, fell steeply, settling into a slower cruise downward since the start of the new century. (It’s still much more violent in the District than the rest of the nation, with 1,330 violent crimes per 100,000 people compared with 363 per 100,000 for the entire country in 2010.) But Shapiro cited the annual homicide number for 1993 — the height of violent crime in the four decades we’re examining — then later says: Since the gun ban was struck down, murders in the District have steadily gone down, from 186 in 2008 to 88 in 2012, the lowest number since the law was enacted in 1976. He fails to mention that drop started in 1994. Weapon-choice theory But back to Rubio. In his Fox News interview, he didn’t claim the gun ban caused the crime rate to rise. But he does say that the gun laws are "not going to solve the problem," citing D.C.’s experience as an example. We know that violent crime didn’t simply "skyrocket" in the District after the handgun ban passed in 1976. It took a rocky path with peaks in 1981 and 1993, and has generally fallen since then. A similar trend echoed across the United States. That suggests a wide range of factors at work, not merely D.C.’s gun laws. Some experts who study violence, such as Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University, say the early ‘80s peak and fall can largely be attributed to the baby boomer generation entering their teens and 20s and then growing up. (People tend to be more law abiding as they age.) The later U.S. peak, Blumstein said, came with crack cocaine and President Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs. And the fall in violent crime since then? Theories include the passage of Roe vs. Wade and a reduction in environmental lead. Blumstein argues an important part of the explanation was the decline in the demand for crack as people saw its effects in older friends and relatives, "and aggressive actions by police in taking the guns off the street." Ah, so, back to gun laws. What, if any, role did they play in violent crime in the District of Columbia? There’s not a lot of fresh research on the subject, since Congress put a chill on government-funded firearms research starting in the late ‘90s. (Something that the president’s recent executive actions seek to reverse.) But Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, pointed us to a 1991 study in the New England Journal of Medicine. "Sen. Rubio couldn't be more wrong," he told PolitiFact. The study, conducted by a research group at the University of Maryland and University at Albany, examined suicides and homicides in the District of Columbia compared with nearby cities from 1968 to 1987. They found that the adoption of the gun-licensing law "coincided with an abrupt decline" in gun-related deaths not found just across the border. Nor were there increases in homicides or suicides that didn’t use guns. "Our data suggest that restrictions on access to guns in the District of Columbia prevented an average of 47 deaths each year after the law was implemented," the authors concluded. Despite widely circulated Internet criticism to the contrary, researchers did consider the effects of population changes, including age and population size. They got similar results. How did the laws help? The researchers argued the data supported something called the weapon-choice theory. When people don’t have easy access to guns, some will use a less deadly form of force. So even if the number of assaults and suicide attempts stays the same, with fewer guns, deaths drop. The researchers argued their results showed it was reasonable to assume that even with violent crime rising, restrictions on gun access had "a preventive effect." In other words, even if "violence skyrocketed," as Rubio said, that’s not direct evidence that D.C.’s gun laws failed to help. Of course, they also didn’t fully "solve the problem." Our ruling Rubio, expressing his disappointment in Obama’s recent actions to prevent gun violence, argued they wouldn’t solve the problem. "Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country," he said. "And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed." Crime statistics don’t support Rubio’s simple story. Rather than skyrocket, violent crime rose and fell, rose and fell. Other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. And one peer-reviewed study about gun laws’ role in violent crime through 1987 showed they reduced homicides and suicides. Rubio’s statement is partially accurate — in some years, violent crime in the District of Columbia did rise even with a handgun ban in place — but leaves out important details and context.

pomt-06233	The balanced-budget amendment once came within one vote of passing Congress but was defeated because of the no vote from a top Senate Republican, and Rick Santorum says he "stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/rick-santorum/Rick-Santorum-says-he-called-for-resignation/	A Republican lodestar this year is passage of a balanced budget amendment, a constitutional change requiring Washington to balance its books every year, with some exceptions, such as if the country is at war. So far, the proposal has failed to get the two-thirds majority required in the U.S. House, falling short in a 261-165 vote on Nov. 18, 2011. It’s slated to be voted on by the Senate in December -- a vote was a requirement of last summer’s debt-ceiling deal -- but two-thirds passage there is unlikely given that the chamber is controlled by Democrats, even though some have supported it in the past. Even if the measure were to clear Congress, it would still need approval from legislatures in 38 states to become part of the Constitution. Nonetheless, it remains a key talking point for Republicans on the presidential campaign trail. And in a Nov. 29, 2011, op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., asserted that the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of passing Congress and going to the states during his first year in the Senate. He also said that he’s not afraid to expose fellow Republicans who stand in its way. "The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work," Santorum wrote. "The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding ‘no’ vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals." Did that really happen? And was there really a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who dared to buck his party on this key issue? Santorum campaign aide Matt Benyon said his boss was referring to a vote in 1995, Santorum’s first year in the Senate, and that the Republican in question was the late Mark Hatfield, who died in August 2011 at 89. Santorum on Jan. 4, 1995, became a co-sponsor of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate. This was the era when Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich’s Contract With America, had swept into power in the House and Senate, and the amendment, then as now, was a major part of their agenda. It passed the House, with more than the two-thirds majority required, on a 300-132 vote on Jan. 26, 1995, but failed to reach the two-thirds mark by one vote in the U.S. Senate on a 65-35 vote on March 2, 1995. While several Democrats voted for the measure -- including then-U.S. Sens. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Paul Simon, D-Ill., and current Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa -- the lone Republican to oppose the measure was Hatfield. The Oregon Republican and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the measure a "procedural gimmick." Santorum, then only 36 (the New York Times pointed out that Hatfield was first elected governor of Oregon in 1958, the year Santorum was born), called for the veteran lawmaker to be stripped of his committee leadership, as did some other young Republican Turks. "He can vote against the balanced-budget amendment. But he shouldn’t be in leadership," Santorum said at the time. "This is an issue that is at the core of what Republicanism is all about … I see this as a major stumbling block in the way of the agenda." For his part, Hatfield, who had served in the Senate for 28 years at that point, stood his ground, saying, "I do not care for the implication -- and I only say implication -- that perhaps a conscience vote is no longer possible on the Republican side of the aisle." A variety of senior Republican lawmakers, ranging from North Carolina’s Jesse Helms to Vermont’s Jim Jeffords, spoke in favor of Hatfield's right to break ranks on the issue. Defending Hatfield at the time, Jeffords told the Times, "He is a moderate, and moderates can make or break this Senate. Either we can have compromise, or we can have gridlock." Hatfield held onto his committee chairmanship, though he opted not to run for a sixth term in 1996. Our ruling Santorum was correct in stating the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of clearing Congress and that the vote by the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations committee against it was key to its failure to pass. Hatfield said he opposed it because he viewed it as a "gimmick." And Santorum and others did call for Hatfield's resignation as committee chairman. Santorum's description of his role as evidence of his leadership skills is an opinion, and we don't check opinions. But he has the basic history right. We give his statement a True.

pomt-11103	Under Philip Levine, Miami Beach "passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable and never enforced. He passed a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/jun/09/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-philip-levines-record-miami-beach-ma/	As he makes his run to become Florida’s governor, Democrat Philip Levine often touts the more progressive moves he made during his time as mayor of Miami Beach. Chief among them is increasing the minimum wage and banning assault weapons. "Everyone wants to tell you what they’re gonna do in the future, but no one wants to tell you what they’ve done," Levine said June 9. "Well let me tell you what I’ve done as mayor: I raised the minimum living wage in the city of Miami Beach and I plan to do it statewide. We actually decriminalized marijuana. We’ve had the highest LGBTQ scores in the entire state of Florida. We became the leading poster child on sea-level rise and climate change and by the way, we banned assault rifles." But one of Levine’s opponents in 2018 Democratic primary says Levine’s achievements aren’t as successful as he sometimes makes it seem. "They passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable and never enforced," said Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. "(Philip Levine) passed a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced." Gillum’s claim is largely accurate. Miami Beach passed a resolution urging lawmakers to adopt an assault rifle ban, but it wasn’t a ban. It was a resolution that carried no legal authority. As for the minimum wage increase, Miami Beach passed an ordinance to gradually increase it to $13.31 per hour by 2021, but it was struck down by the courts before it went into effect. Assault rifle 'ban' On July 13, 2016, the Miami Beach Commissioners adopted a resolution urging Congress and the Florida Legislature to lobby for assault weapons bans. It also urges the Florida Legislature to lift the preemption policy that prevents local governments from enacting gun control ordinances. The resolution had no legal authority, though. That’s because resolutions, according to the Florida Statutes, are a statement of position, not an official legislative action of a governing body like a law. "A resolution of the city commission of the city of Miami Beach, Florida, calling upon the federal and state-elected officials to collaborate with local officials and first responders to prevent mass shootings… ," the resolution heading says. So rather than an actual ban, the resolution was really more of a call to action for lawmakers to consider banning assault weapons. It did not impede Miami Beach’s access to them. The resolution wouldn’t have survived. Under Florida law, any local officials who try to enact gun regulations that are more restrictive than state law face fines up to $5,000 or even removal from office. Florida cities, including Miami Beach, have sued Gov. Rick Scott so they can enact tougher local gun regulations. As we mentioned, Levine sometimes touts this achievement with no additional clarifications, but at one point during the June 9 debate, Levine acknowledged that the assault weapon ban "wasn’t enforceable." "As the mayor of Miami Beach we did many things," Levine said. "From reforming a police department from raising the minimum wage to fighting back sea level rise to decriminalizing marijuana to banning assault rifles even, though unfortunately, it was not enforceable." Minimum wage In June 2016, Miami Beach Commissioners voted to gradually raise its minimum wage in the city from $8.05 to $13.31 per hour by 2021. The increase would have been enforced basically starting January 2018 and gone up every year until reaching the 2021 threshold. The law never went in to effect, though. Florida Circuit Court Judge Peter Lopez ruled in March 2017 that Miami Beach's minimum wage law was pre-empted by a state statute preventing local minimum wages from exceeding the state rate. A panel of the 3rd District Court of Appeal upheld Lopez’s ruling, but Miami Beach (along with other cities) asked the Florida Supreme Court to review the December 13 appellate court ruling. So, Gillum is right that no one really got the benefit of it. The one thing worth noting is that Gillum could have been more precise in describing the action Miami Beach took. Gillum said it was a resolution, but it was an ordinance. This means that the minimum wage increase, unlike the assault weapon resolution, would have been enforced had it not been struck down. During the debate, Levine alluded to issues with the minimum wage effort. "In 2004, the people of Florida voted that the local municipality should have the right to enforce and set their own minimum wage," Levine said. "That's what we did. Unfortunately, we got sued by the governor, the state of Florida, the Retail Federation. We are fighting it in court and we believe it's going to go to the Florida Supreme Court and we're going to win. The fact of that matter is we did it." Our ruling Gillum said Levine "passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable," and passed "a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced." Gillum’s claim is largely accurate. He could have been more precise in describing the legislative action Miami Beach took, but his general idea for both initiatives is accurate. The assault weapon "ban" that Levine talks about was a symbolic resolution, not an actual ban. And the minimum wage increase was struck down before taking effect in 2018.

Most North Dakota hunters can breathe easy. If you have an out-of-state hunting license anywhere outside of North Dakota -- and it’s an out-of-state license, rather than a residential one for residents of that state -- you’re safe. If you have a North Dakota residential hunting license, you’re also safe, because in applying for that license you already gave up any other residential licenses. North Dakota’s Game and Fish department doesn’t allow a person to hold two residential licenses. (Those tend to expire within a season or year anyway.) In theory, this applies to folks living in North Dakota who have a residential license in a state other than North Dakota, which conceivably could be people who have just moved. (This is the basis on which the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party, which is the state’s branch of the Democratic Party, defended the ad.) Would casting a vote in North Dakota make even those licenses void? We found no evidence of that. We called the Fish and Wildlife offices in North Dakota’s neighboring states: Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota. They all told us that voting in North Dakota wouldn’t make them lose their licenses. "If they purchased that license prior to leaving Montana as legal resident, it is valid until the expiration date, no matter what they do in North Dakota," said Ron Jendro, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department. The same goes for Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota; the licenses are valid until they expire. For other states, establishing residency elsewhere means their resident hunting license is void. That’s the case in North Dakota and Kentucky, the two other states whose hunting permit offices we called. But there’s no way that casting a vote would suddenly make those licenses null. Lee Ann Oliver, elections specialist at the North Dakota Secretary of State’s office, told us they have a central voter file, but fish and wildlife departments don’t get access to that database. And anyway, in order to vote, a person has to already have established residency. "They’re putting the cart before the horse," Oliver said. "You have to be a resident before you can vote." Voters can show a North Dakota driver’s license, nondriver’s identification card, tribal ID or long term care card. If those don’t include a current North Dakota residential address or date of birth, the voter may supplement their ID with a variety of documents, like bills or bank statements. Our ruling North Dakota Democratic-NPL said, "Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses." It’s hard to interpret this in any way except that it seeks to discourage people from voting. But voting will not cost anyone their hunting licenses. People with out-of-state hunting licenses get to keep their licenses; the warning only applies to people with residential licenses in another state who recently moved to North Dakota. Voting would not make those null, but establishing residency in another state, which is a prerequisite to voting, might, depending on the state. The ad employs a ridiculous argument.

pomt-05291	Says the majority of candidates in Texas’ 25th Congressional District live outside the district.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/may/23/justin-hewlett/justin-hewlett-says-majority-districts-congression/	Justin Hewlett, among a dozen Republicans seeking to represent a new tornado-shaped U.S. House district running north toward Fort Worth from western Hays and Travis counties, points out in a recent mailer that members of Congress are not required to live in the districts they represent. The Constitution holds that House members must be residents of the state -- not the district -- they represent. So it’s legal, say, for a member representing Central Texas to live in El Paso or Port Arthur or Brownsville, though we cannot recall such a farflung turn. Hewlett’s mailer continues: "In fact, the majority of the (Congressional) District 25 candidates reside outside of the district." We were curious if Hewlett was right that at least seven of the GOP aspirants do not live in the district, which brings together parts or all of 13 counties including Burnet, Lampasas, Bosque, Hill and (smidges of) Tarrant and Bell counties. The sole Democratic candidate, Elaine Henderson, lives near Austin in Lago Vista, which is in the district. Hewlett -- the mayor of Cleburne, in Johnson County, which is in the district -- told us in a telephone interview that he checked each opponent’s filings with the Federal Election Commission and researched home addresses online. By email, he passed along his breakdown indicating that five candidates do not live in the district, while three candidates might have moved in after declaring their candidacies. According to Hewlett’s breakdown, candidate Ernie Beltz Jr. lives in Cedar Park, not in the district; Bill Burch lives in Grand Prairie, not in the district; Dianne Costa lives in Lewisville, not in the district; Michael Williams has an Arlington home and an Austin apartment, both not in the district; and James Dillon lists his hometown as Liberty Hill, not in the district. Wes Riddle lives in Belton, Hewlett told us, just outside the district. Hewlett wrote: "Since taking some ‘heat’ about not living in the district, (Riddle) bought a property" in Gatesville, in the district, and changed his voter registration to that address. Dave Garrison, Hewlett said, has listed an address in Horseshoe Bay, just outside the district, but claims to have an apartment in Bee Cave, near Austin, in the district. "If this is true, it is likely that he has changed his voter registration to the apartment in Bee Cave," Hewlett told us. Finally, Hewlett wrote, Roger Williams is from Weatherford, outside the district, but when he declared his candidacy he said he and his wife would buy an Austin home. "He is now claiming they own a house in Austin," Hewlett said. "If this is true, it is likely that he has now changed his residence to Austin." The unmentioned Republican candidates in his analysis are Chad Wilbanks of Austin; Brian Mathews of Austin; and Charlie Holcomb of Wimberley, all presumably living in the district. Separately, Wilbanks pointed out a news article on the candidates in the March 17, 2012, Killeen Daily Herald stating that six candidates, or half, live within its boundaries and six -- Beltz, Burch, Costa, Dillon and Michael and Roger Williams -- do not. To launch our own check, we asked the election commission if it tracks where House candidates live. A commission spokesman, Christian Hilland, advised by email that the agency is not required to collect home addresses of House candidates; most addresses on file are for candidate postal boxes or campaign headquarters. Next, we played Dial-A-Candidate, focusing on candidates listed as non-residents in the Herald story plus those whose residency is questioned by Hewlett. We then confirmed three candidates as non-residents, while four said they indeed live, and vote, in the district. Dillon, listed as living in Liberty Hill, outside the district, declined to discuss his residency. Details: --Burch told us he lives in Grand Prairie, outside the district, though hopes to move into the district before November 2012. --Beltz confirmed that he lives in Cedar Park, about two miles outside the district. --Costa said she lives outside the district in Denton County’s Highland Village, though her family has a 230-acre ranch in Hamilton County, which is in the district. "I pay taxes in the district. I have an investment in the district," Costa said. --Michael Williams’ campaign manager, Will Fullerton, told us that Williams got an apartment in the Austin part of the district after the race started and registered to vote there. Vanessa Shaw of the Travis County Tax Office separately told us by phone that Williams registered to vote in the county in early 2012. --Rachel Nolen of Riddle’s campaign said the candidate has offices in Belton and Austin, but lives in Gatesville, which is in Coryell County and the district. Peggy Vaden of the Coryell County Tax Office later told us by phone that Riddle registered to vote there in August 2011 and has since voted there twice. --Steve Ray, a consultant to Garrison’s campaign, said that while Garrison has a Horseshoe Bay house just outside the district, he has lived and voted in Bee Cave, near Austin and in the district, since at least last fall. Shaw, of the Travis County office, said Garrison registered to vote in the county in September 2011. --Roger Williams moved into a West Austin apartment in the district on March 16, 2012, his campaign spokesman, Kasey Pipes, told us by email. Asked about Williams’ Weatherford home, Pipes replied: "He’s keeping two residences, but his primary residence will be in Austin." Shaw told us Williams’ registration to vote in the county took effect in May 2012. Our ruling Our conclusion is that four of the 12 Republican candidates -- not the majority, as Hewlett says -- live (and vote) outside the district. Still, some hopefuls lived outside the district until not long ago, giving Hewlett’s claim an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08820	Kathryn Starkey "aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents’ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/13/committee-protect-florida/group-raps-kathryn-starkey-aiding-and-abetting-tax/	A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax. The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.) "Taxin’ Kathryn," says the mailer sent in early August 2010 . "With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?" We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her voting record on setting tax rates. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving the sales tax. After questioning Starkey’s attendance record as a member of the Pinellas-Anclote River Basin Board, the mailer says that when she did attend, "Starkey aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents’ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same DESPITE skyrocketing property values that allowed local governments to pad their budgets." Here is what the minutes show. Of the seven budget meetings she attended, the board voted six times to keep the tax rate the same. Starkey voted with her colleagues five out of those six times (She cast a dissenting vote in 2006). So overall, she voted over 70 percent of the time to keep the same tax rate. All this came as taxable values were soaring in Pinellas and Pasco counties. Between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2007, when the rate stayed at 40 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, the total taxable values for the basin board went from roughly $48 billion to $81 billion in Pasco and Pinellas counties, according to Southwest Florida Water Management District. By the time the board lowered the rate to 37 cents for fiscal year 2008, the total values were roughly $86.6 billion. Simply counting votes misses an important fact, though. Starkey did make efforts to lower the tax rate. In 2004, for instance, she made a motion to lower the rate to 39 cents. The motion died for lack of a second, and Starkey went along with the rest of the board to keep the tax rate the same. And it was Starkey who took the lead role in 2006 when she again argued for lowering the rate, this time making a motion to set it at 37 1/2 cents. The motion failed. She tried again, arguing for 38 cents. Her motion failed again. The board voted 3 to 2 to keep it at 40 cents, and Starkey dissented for the first time. At the preliminary budget meeting in June 2007, Starkey made the motion to set the rate for the 2008 budget at 37 cents, which finally passed. "Every year I tried to roll it back," she said, but didn’t have the votes. Pennington’s mailer is technically correct: Starkey did go along with votes most of the time to keep the tax rate for the basin board the same, even as taxable values soared. But it leaves out the important context that Starkey tried over three years to lower the tax rate. We rate this Half True.

pomt-08057	Texas "children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching."	true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/26/mike-villarreal/rep-mike-villarreal-says-texas-students-may-have-t/	In the flurry to pre-file legislation before the Texas legislative session starts in January, state Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, announced a proposal he said "would end the practice of Texas schools hiring full-time teachers with no classroom teaching experience." "Parents are shocked when I tell them that their children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching but is now responsible for educating a classroom full of kids," Villarreal said in a Nov. 30 press release. "If we are serious about improving education, we need to listen to the research about the importance of student teaching. We shouldn't hand the classroom over to a teacher who has never stood in front of a class and taught a lesson." Any questions? We decided to check how much practical experience is required of newly-minted Texas schoolteachers. On its website, the State Board for Educator Certification lists the basic requirements for becoming a Texas teacher: a bachelor's degree, teacher training through an approved program (universities and "other entities" such as for-profit programs) and completion of state teacher certification tests. Texas has 177 teacher preparation programs, run by providers including universities, school districts and for-profit companies, according to a November 2009 Houston Chronicle news story. Traditional university programs include a student-teaching component prior to graduation. For aspiring teachers who already have a college degree, SBEC suggests "alternative certification and post-baccalaureate programs." According to the website, "many of these programs can be completed in a year, during which time you may have a paid teaching position in a public school classroom." According to the Texas Education Agency, 7,500 new teachers during the 2010 academic school year were certified through university programs, and 11,567 were certified via alternative programs. Asked to back up Villarreal's statement, Peter Clark, his legislative director, pointed to those teachers who are in alternative programs. "They do not receive their full certification until the end of that first year teaching," he said in an e-mail. "But during that full school year they are the teacher of record responsible for a classroom, and they may have started that year without ever standing in front of a classroom of students and delivering a lesson plan." According to state law, teacher candidates who serve a year-long internship have a "probationary certificate" until they complete the year, but during that time they're classified as a "teacher" on school campuses. Does that mean they haven't had any teaching practice before entering the classroom? Karen Loonam, a TEA deputy associate commissioner, told us that it "is possible" for someone to start teaching without any practice teaching "but highly unlikely since our rules require 30 clock-hours of field experience in the classroom and 80 hours of training prior to entering the classroom." According to state law, 15 of those 30 hours of field experience must be spent performing "professional educator activities" while interacting with students, teachers and faculty in a school setting "that is part of regular classroom instruction." According to Villarreal's press release, his legislation "would require a teacher candidate to undertake 15 hours of practice teaching to become full-time teachers... this legislation would ensure that the 15 hours on campus are spent delivering lesson plans rather than merely observing, assisting with administrative functions or attending school events." In an interview, Janice Lopez, the education agency's director of educator standards, told us the law doesn't require that those 15 hours in the classroom are spent teaching. "We require that they go through training and hopefully that training is interactive — interacting with students while observing a certified teacher," Lopez said. Loonam told us that usually the field experience is "a combination of activities for an individual to see the realities of the complex job of teaching — how does the teacher develop lesson plans... observing students... classroom management. We've tried to put in our rules some requirements to help these people get prepared before entering the classroom," she said. Loonam also told us that school districts' "late hires" may start teaching in the classroom without having those 15 classroom hours. "If a principal finds out on a Thursday — and school's going to start Monday — that she just lost a teacher for whatever reason, she needs to find someone to fill that vacancy," she said. If there's a teacher shortage in that particular district, the district may hire a prospective teacher who knows about the subject to be taught but doesn't have the required training. The new teacher is then assigned a certified teacher as a mentor and completes training throughout the school year. Ed Fuller, a researcher for the University Council for Educational Administration, an interstate consortium of higher-ed institutions, called the Texas education code's practice-teaching requirement "vague." "Teachers are not, in fact, required to complete any practice teaching or student teaching before becoming a teacher of record" — a teacher who has sole responsibility for a class, he said. Fuller said teachers without any experience come largely from alternative certification programs that don't offer student-teaching training. But according to Vernon Reaser, who heads an alternative teacher-certification program based in Houston, the alternate route is more demanding than the single semester of student-teaching required by university programs. Alternate-route teacher candidates must first complete a year of professional teaching — the internship — as a real teacher before the principal decides whether the teacher should be certified, said Reaser, president of A+ Texas Teachers. He told us most prospective teachers who are certified through the program do practice teach, "and those that don't will get it anyway in the first few months. "This is the person's career, not just a temporary assignment like student teaching is," he said. "They have to perform well that year just like every other teacher does in order to keep their job." We also consulted Pamela Hall, a personnel administrator for the Austin Independent School District, who told us the district rarely hires individuals without teaching experience, but when it does, it's through the state's alternate certification programs. Such teachers are on probation for their first year, she said. Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, told us the agency does not keep information on how many individuals never taught before becoming classroom teachers. She said that information is kept by each certification program. Time to grade Villarreal's statement. We did not find a precise count of teachers in Austin or Texas public schools who started without teaching practice, though, significantly, it's undisputed that schools can — and do — hire teachers lacking even a minute of experience teaching a class. We rate the statement True.	None	Mike Villarreal	None	None	None	2010-12-26T06:00:00	2010-11-30	['Texas']
pomt-05991	Suzanne Bonamici supports a plan that will cut choice for Medicare Advantage seniors.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/21/rob-cornilles/does-suzanne-bonamici-support-plan-reduces-choice-/	Republican Rob Cornilles continues his attack on Democrat Suzanne Bonamici, claiming once again this week on Think Out Loud that her support of President Obama’s 2010 health care reform act means that she supports cuts to seniors on Medicare and Medicare Advantage. "…She supports taking $500 billion away from Medicare. I don’t support that. It would largely affect those seniors who are on Medicare Advantage, which is about a quarter of a million Oregon seniors. They’ve chosen that option. I want to maintain they have that choice. She does not." Cornilles and Republicans nationally have refused to back off their erroneous claim that Obama’s Affordable Care Act cuts $500 billion from Medicare. As we reported in November 2011 and in October 2010, the act reduces Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But those dollars don’t come out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits. As PolitiFact Oregon’s Ryan Kost reported: "The $500 billion is all in future spending reductions and come through the law’s attempts to slow projected growth, not cut spending." An initially estimated $136 billion of the $500 billion in future savings is to come from Medicare Advantage. What is Medicare Advantage? Let’s back up for a moment. Every person 65 or older gets what’s called original Medicare or traditional Medicare. It consists of Part A, which covers hospital care, and Part B, which covers doctor visits. You can get these services from any provider who sees Medicare patients. Part A is free; Part B premiums usually come out of your Social Security check. Some private insurers also offer what’s called Medicare Advantage, Part C, where seniors can pay an extra monthly premium for services not covered by plain Medicare A and B, such as vision, hearing and dental. Often, these plans will include Part D, which is the prescription drug plan pushed by then President George W. Bush in 2003. Some seniors prefer Medicare Advantage plans because they are comprehensive, with all billing through one entity, said Joe Baker, president of the nonpartisan advocacy group Medicare Rights Center. Other seniors might prefer traditional Medicare because they travel a lot and don’t stick to one region, or they want services that aren’t covered by advantage plans. "There are trade-offs with both," Baker said. Now, why would Congress want to reduce future growth in Medicare Advantage spending? Because it’s considered bloated. As the Kaiser Family Foundation reported in a 2010 video primer, Congress in previous years had increased payments to private insurers who offer Medicare Advantage plans in order to increase enrollment in those plans. Insurers used that extra money to offer more benefits to those people, such as vision and dental care. "However, as a result of this payment system Medicare actually pays more for beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Advantage plans than it pays for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare," says Tricia Neuman, a vice president of the Kaiser Foundation and director of the Medicare Policy Project. "This has increased costs to the Medicare program. These over-payments also contribute to Medicare’s fiscal problems, shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund and actually increasing payments paid by other beneficiaries." (Kaiser Health News reported in December 2011 that according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the government spent in 2011 "10 percent more for beneficiaries enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) plans than if those beneficiaries were in fee-for-service Medicare.") Ah-ha! So private insurers are making out nicely off of Medicare Advantage plans, leaving traditional Medicare recipients to pick up the slack. We can see why government would want reform. Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, says that’s besides the point. Bonamici supports the Affordable Care Act. Ostrom says that means Bonamici supports eliminating choice for seniors. "Whether services are cut, contracts terminated or out-of-pocket expenses grow unaffordable, it is completely reasonable to suggest that when people must drop from a plan they like, they are forced out. A $900-a-year increase in out-of-pocket costs would be considered unaffordable by many seniors. They have no choice," Ostrom said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon in November 2011. Is Ostrom correct on that front? Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, projected in an April 2010 memo that "[t]he new provisions will generally reduce (Medicare Advantage) rebates to plans and thereby result in less generous benefit packages." He estimated that by 2017, enrollment will be 7.4 million rather than the originally projected 14.8 million. (As of September 2011, 11.9 million were enrolled.) A follow-up from Foster, as posted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance website in October 2010, states that out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries should grow to $873 a year by 2019. Yet, the Kaiser Family Foundation cautions against sweeping predictions inits October 2010 report: "The HHS Actuaries predict a decline in enrollment between 2011 and 2019, and an erosion of extra benefits. However, such predictions are difficult, and at the present time, Medicare Advantage appears to remain an important part of the Medicare program." It turns out that enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans increased 6 percent from from 2010 to 2011, according to the Government Accountability Office. Enrollment was projected to increase again in 2012 and average premiums decrease. In the past we gave Cornilles a False for perpetuating the inaccurate statement that Bonamici and other Democrats support $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, hurting seniors. Here, however, he’s making a more specific point about seniors on Medicare Advantage. It’s hard to know what will happen to Medicare Advantage, but it’s undeniable that reduced payments to insurers could result in higher costs or decreased benefits for seniors. We acknowledge that truth in the statement. Still, there’s significant information missing. The Affordable Care Act was designed to save money by slowing future spending, including future spending on Medicare Advantage plans. But spending still goes up. In addition, many outside factors can affect the cost and range of benefits, making it impossible to know how Medicare Advantage might change. While the statement from Cornilles is partially accurate, it is taken out of context and ignores important details on a politically volatile subject. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08676	"There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by ... Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/10/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-there-have-been-more-terrorist-at/	Just days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Ann Coulter, the often provocative conservative pundit, wrote a column in which she compared the number of terrorist attacks in the United States under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Coulter was challenging the argument by Gen. David Petraeus -- the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan -- warning against a proposed Koran burning in Gainesville, Fla., on the grounds that, in Coulter's words, "it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans." Coulter wrote that "this is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting?" She went on to knock Andrew Sullivan, an iconoclastic conservative pundit, for suggesting that if Obama was elected, his racial background and life story could help counter jihadist recruiting efforts. "It didn't work out that way," Coulter wrote. "There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin (sic) had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the 'it will help them recruit' argument yet?" (For the record, she said she opposes [Koran]-burning, saying, "The reason not to burn [Korans] is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm.") Coulter raises a pertinent question about what the U.S. can actually do to curb recruiting by jihadists. But the only part of her comment that's checkable is her claim that "there have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq." So we looked into it. We'll start by noting that Coulter's terminology is quite specific, leaving out a lot of terrorist activity that occurred under both presidents. She appears to be counting terrorist attacks (not foiled attacks or arrests before attacks were carried out or plots undertaken), and she is limiting her count to attacks on U.S. soil (leaving out attacks against U.S. interests in other countries). She also starts the clock after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which means excluding the July 4, 2002, incident in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian immigrant, fired on an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two. Among the other incidents excluded by Coulter's parameters are the December 2001 "shoe-bombing" incident, in which Richard Reid was foiled trying to detonate plastic explosives packed in his shoes and the March 2006 case of Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate, driving an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians. Both cases were reportedly motivated to one degree or another by radical Islam. After looking through several sources, including reports by the FBI and independent commissions, we conclude that there were no Islamist-inspired terrorist attacks fitting Coulter's strict definition under Bush. As for the record under Obama, we found two that fit Coulter's categories. One was the attack at Ft. Hood in Texas on Nov. 5, 2009, which left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Maj. Nidal Hasan, a military doctor and suspected Islamic extremist, has been charged in the shooting. The other attack at a military recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark., June 1, 2009, left one soldier dead and one wounded. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad has been charged with being the gunman in that incident. Using Coulter's criteria means excluding at least two well-publicized incidents that took place during Obama's tenure -- the foiled Dec. 25, 2009, attempt to bomb a plane landing in Detroit by alleged "underwear" bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and the failed Times Square attack of May 1, 2010, by alleged car-bomber Faisal Shahzad. So, Coulter's numbers may be meticulously circumscribed, but they're right: There were zero attacks during the six years cited under Bush, and two attacks in the first 16 months under Obama. But terrorism experts told us that the more important question is what those statistics signify. The answer may be: not much. In large part, that's because terrorist attacks often take years to plan. Bruce Hoffman, director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, noted that Najibullah Zazi -- who plotted simultaneous suicide attacks on the NYC subway a year ago -- made contact with and was trained by al-Qaida in 2008. So he began his planning under Bush but was arrested under Obama, Hoffman said. The same goes for many of the Somali-Americans who went to Somalia for terrorist training as far back as 2006 and 2007 but only got onto the authorities' radar screen in 2009. In fact, experts we spoke to agreed that it's unlikely that the terrorists and alleged terrorists in question even gave any thought to who was serving as president when planning their attacks. Someone who takes the fateful step of starting to plan a deadly attack against U.S. citizens isn't likely to be swayed in their views by mere changes in partisan control; they have become fundamentally opposed to the underlying foundation of American society. "Islamist terrorism exists not because of what we do but because of what its practitioners believe and because of the policies of the states that support it," said Ted Bromund, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Bromund called it "solipsism" -- that is, extreme self-centeredness -- for any American to assume that our own short- to medium-term actions will have much of an impact on jihadist recruiting. "Islamists have their own ideology, and states like Iran have their own interests, which are not simply a mirror reflection of us and our actions," Bromund said. "Therefore, we should carry out policies that are in accord with our interests and values and not fall into the habit of believing that the problems of the world are really all about us." This view actually fits pretty well with the broader point Coulter was trying to make, which is that individual incidents and events aren't likely to have much of an impact on terrorist recruiting. Reviewing the evidence, Coulter's numbers are correct -- there have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil under Obama than under Bush. But this statistic is of questionable value. It's based on carefully constructed parameters that could have produced a different comparison if those parameters had been tweaked. It suggests that terrorist plots can be blamed on a specific presidency, even though plots can take years to come together. And it suggests that the only way to measure success in combating terrorism is by comparing deadly attacks on U.S. soil, even though "it's immensely relevant whether someone has become motivated to attack U.S. persons or interests anywhere in the world, including Afghanistan and Iraq," said Robert Chesney, a law professor and terrorism specialist at the University of Texas. Ultimately, we think the statement is accurate but doesn't provide needed context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00221	Says Washington’s Kim Schrier has a plan to eliminate employer-provided health coverage, double income taxes and put your care "in the hands of government bureaucrats."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/11/national-republican-congressional-committee/washingtons-kim-schrier-no-bernie-sanders-nor-her-/	"Medicare for All" is today’s catch phrase for government supported, single-payer health care, and if you’re a free-market Republican, that can sound like a path toward socialism. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician in Washington state who’s running for Congress, uttered that phrase, and Republicans in the other Washington (D.C.) even have it on videotape. "Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system," Schrier said. The video clip, with suspenseful music added for emphasis, is part of an ad put out by the National Republican Campaign Committee, or NRCC, an arm of the Republican Party that supports Republicans running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The NRCC supports Dino Rossi, a Republican former state senator, in the race for the open seat in Washington’s 8th Congressional District, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs across the Cascades. Medicare for All, the Republican ad says, would mean "your employer-based health coverage" would be "eliminated. Your income tax could double. Kim Schrier’s plan will put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases for Washington families. Washington can’t afford Kim Schrier in Congress." We could approach this by asking whether "Medicare for All" would do this, as we’ll do briefly. But another question arises: Does Schrier really have a plan like this? Let’s see. Definitions Medicare for All can mean different things. In its broadest sense, it means that the country would get rid of the current system of multiple health insurers vying for your or your employer’s premiums. Instead, the government would build on an existing taxpayer-supported system: Medicare, the federal program that already covers seniors age 65 and older. It does not mean the government would pick your doctor or hospital. Instead, the government would set or negotiate payment rates to providers, and you’d go to the doctor of your choice. The costs and many other details for such a system are in debate, with critics saying that even a doubling of all individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient. Supporters say the savings in health care premiums and administrative costs would balance this out, and one proposed bill in the House — a bill with 123 co-sponsors, all Democrats — would raise taxes on the incomes of the top 5 percent of earners and on stock and bond transactions. (For a fuller look at this, check out PolitiFact’s annotated checks of an op-ed by President Donald Trump, who called Medicare for All part of Democrats’ "radical agenda.") But there are variations on this idea within Congress. One set of proposals would let you or your employer keep the insurance you have but, alternatively, let you buy coverage in the Medicare system if you wanted. Another set of proposals would only open Medicare to individuals and small employers, keeping large-employer insurance largely unchanged. And yet another would allow Medicare buy-in only to people age 50 or 55. Each one of these variations has been introduced in Congress. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a handy side-by-side comparison of eight of these bills. What Schrier wants On her campaign website, Schrier says "quality health care is a fundamental human right," and that is why she says she wants Medicare for All — but not yet. It will take time, she says, because it will take a Democrat in the White House and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass, and then more time to implement. For now, she says, Congress should allow a voluntary buy-in. "Too many Washingtonians face skyrocketing healthcare costs, and we need to take immediate steps to help them get the coverage they need and deserve," her website says. "That’s why I am committed to moving us toward a Medicare for All system that guarantees affordable, high-quality care for every American. Medicare has proven to be the most cost-efficient way to deliver high-quality care. "But we cannot simply wait for a Democratic president and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass a bill that will take years to implement. In the meantime, we need to take immediate action to stabilize our insurance market and build on the ACA (Affordable Care Act) in the short term and implement a Medicare public option immediately, as we work toward a universal system." Schrier’s Medicare buy-in would be handled through state health care exchanges -- the Affordable Care Act marketplaces -- with private individual and small-group plans offered as well. Prices would be based on a sliding scale, with subsidies available for the neediest. Tale of the tape The video clip in the NRCC ad comes directly from Schrier’s campaign website’s video. But there are major differences. The NRCC added scary music and cut off Schrier right after she said, "Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system." The full video is more than 12 minutes long. And right after mentioning Medicare for All, Schrier says, "But I see patients and what they are going through, and we do not have the luxury of waiting until we have a Democratic Congress, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president to get Medicare for All. We need to take action right away." She then lays out her "buy-in, public option" plan. So on what does the NRCC base its claim that Schrier would eliminate your employer coverage, put "your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats" and require "historic tax increases?" The ad gives citations on the screen. The part about employer coverage cites a 2017 New York Times analysis on the proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for single-payer health care. "The employer-based insurance that now covers 156 million people would be eliminated," the Times story said. "Those people would lose their current coverage and be enrolled in the new program instead." For the possible doubling of taxes, the screen cites an Associated Press story from July, which said, "Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan would boost government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, requiring historic tax hikes, says a study released Monday by a university-based libertarian policy center." This is a study from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Sanders disputes the high-end cost. The New York Times’ and other analyses have said there would be trade-offs, because people could spend less on health care and premiums. As for the government’s control, the ad’s screen cites a July story in The Hill. The article was about comments from Seema Verma, Trump’s administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Medicare. "By choosing a socialized system, you are giving the government complete control over the decisions pertaining to your care or whether you receive care at all," Verma said in a speech in San Francisco, as the article reported. Not her plan The NRCC’s claims about Schrier assume she wants a Medicare for All program similar to the one promoted by Sanders and a number of House members. Schrier doesn’t specify anyone’s single proposal but says Medicare for All is desirable in the long term -- but unrealistic for now. So when would she want it? We asked her campaign, and spokeswoman Katie Rodihan answered without giving a date because, she said, Schrier isn’t even promoting that kind of plan. "Dr. Schrier's plan specifically does not eliminate employer-based coverage, does not require an income tax increase, does not give the government ‘complete control,’ and does not require historic tax increases," Rodihan said in an email. She added that the bill the ad seems to cite "is Bernie Sanders' plan, not Kim Schrier's," and that "Kim does not" support it. "The fact is that Kim has her own plan that is separate and distinct from Medicare for All." Our ruling The NRCC says "Kim Schrier’s Medicare for All plan" would eliminate employer-provided health coverage, "put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases." It is true that Schrier said, "Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system," but she then said a lot more, and the ad ignores it all, instead citing criticisms of a specific plan she doesn’t support (and those criticisms themselves are in dispute). Her plan would make Medicare available to all -- all who chose it, that is. The day may come when a Sanders-like plan is viable and politically realistic, but Schrier made clear that since that day is not now, she is focused elsewhere. We rate the claim Mostly False.

The headline on a May 6, 2017, post on ConservativeFlashNews.com read, "Malia Obama arrested with a gang of thugs in Chicago." The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news in users’ feeds. The post said Obama and the men were at an unnamed park in Chicago, and were charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance. Obama had been forbidden by her famous parents from going to any such party, the story said, but disappeared before turning up at the police station. This didn’t happen, of course, because the story is fake. It turned up on a few other websites around May 6. But it actually originated on May 5 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately tried to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake -- this Malia Obama post is just the latest example. A previous story from TheLastLineOfDefense.org said Malia Obama had been expelled from Harvard University for smoking marijuana in Boston, despite the fact that she hadn’t even been enrolled at the school. As for the fake accomplices pictured in the story, the image is taken from a series of mugshots showing a group of eight men arrested in Florence County, S.C., in 2013 for running a dogfighting ring. Malia’s image was inserted to suggest she’d been partying with the other seven. But that’s not the case. As far as we know, the 18-year-old is still enjoying her gap year before enrolling at Harvard this fall. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!

A post on viralactions.com, headlined, "80% of black men in Atlanta are Homosexuals, study says," claims that Georgia State University students "began a study assessing the sexuality of the male population of the city with surprising results." The study divided the population into the categories "black, white, Asian, and oreo, then divided them further into heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual," said the Jan. 7, 2016 post. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post also claimed that the percentage of gay black men in Atlanta is expected to be much higher "due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society." We did not find a Georgia State University study concluding that 80 percent of black men in Atlanta are gay. We did find social media accounts linked to viralactions.com that made it clear that its information is not factual. Viralactions.com’s website doesn’t feature a page describing its mission or who’s behind it, and to anyone visiting the site, there’s no easy way to tell if it’s stories are real or not. But it does link to Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts that suggest its content is fake. The website linked to an Instagram page for the username "folksrtalking," with a biographical description claiming to have "3 BILLION satire article views shared & counting from over 50 blogs! You may not know my name but you definitely seen my work if your on the Net! #IZM." Its Twitter page, also for the username @FolksRtalking, said "Folks don't want to be INFORMED they want to be ENTERTAINED. #InfoTainment News at its Finest! #NYC." The Twitter account links to another website, celebtricity.com, which describes itself as "the most notorious fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world. If it's trending on social media you'll find it here!" Viralactions.com’s Facebook page appears to have been called TmzWorldstar, but is no longer available on the social media network. TmzWorldstar appears to be part of a web of hoax websites recycling and cross-posting fabricated information. Fellow fact-checkers at Snopes.com in February 2016 deemed as false claims that a study found that 80 percent of black men in Georgia were gay. The story debunked by Snopes in 2016 is the same one that has resurfaced on Viralactions.com. Viralactions.com published a story claiming 80 percent of black men in Atlanta are gay, citing a nonexistent Georgia State University study.

pomt-04179	Says, "In the last four years we’ve cut $36 million in ongoing revenue."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/15/sam-adams/did-sam-adams-cut-36-million-budget/	PolitiFact Oregon has been around government budgets long enough to know that they’re hard to decipher. There are add-on packages and inflationary costs, general fund dollars and one-time dollars and all-funds budgets. Numbers by themselves don’t mean much without context. So, naturally, our ears perked right up when Portland Mayor Sam Adams made this statement in a budget work session shortly after the Nov. 6 election: "In the last four years we’ve cut $36 million in ongoing revenue." He also tweeted the number Nov. 13and used it again in a year end-interview with the Portland Mercury. Sounds gloomy, right? But remember, this is the same mayor who once hooted about a one-time $22 million budget surplus in February 2011, and we found that claim to be Half True. So we wanted to know more about these dollar "cuts." We decided to give his statement the full Truth-O-Meter treatment. We were aided by one of The Oregonian’s Portland City Hall reporters, who immediately pointed out that the $36 million was really closer to $25.6 million because the city had added $10.3 million for new programs over the same period. In other words, Adams had to "cut" as much as he did because he chose to spend money elsewhere. Apparently this was not news to anyone at the budget meeting because Andrew Scott, the city’s financial planning manager, clicked through a PowerPoint presentation with a slide that outlined $25.6 million in "ongoing shortfall" and $10.3 million in new program additions. Now, we bet you’re asking for the definition of an "ongoing shortfall." Government budgets don’t stay flat, obviously. The cost of maintaining the same programs goes up every year, sometimes beyond the cost of inflation, whether due to increases in demand for services or steep hikes in health and retirement benefits. When projected revenue falls short of dollars needed to maintain services, that’s the shortfall. State and local governments can’t print money like the federal government, so they have to fix the shortfall by raising revenue (usually taxes) or cutting services, pay, etc. Elected officials may always choose to add new programs. But if they don’t have enough money, they have to reduce or eliminate other programs. We call that making choices; we could even call that "budgeting." We’ve called out politicians previously for talking about "budget cuts" when government has had more money than the year before, just not enough to cover a shortfall and pay for new programs. We also bet you’re asking for some hard numbers. The city’s total annual budget is in the $3.5 billion range, but Adams is talking about the much smaller amount known as the general fund. The general fund includes property taxes and business license fees, but does not include gas taxes, sewer and stormwater charges or water fees. The numbers vary, depending on how you slice them, from $349.5 million to $472 million in 2009-10, to 352.5 million to $490 million for 2012-13.. But no matter how you look at the numbers, if you compare apples to apples, the figures today are higher, even slightly, than what they were in 2009-10, with ups and downs along the way. In other words, today’s budget is not $36 million less than the 2009-10 budget, which is what the average person probably thinks when the mayor says that he has "cut $36 million in ongoing revenue." Scott, the city’s financial planning manager, disapproves of our simplistic way of looking at numbers. He says that you can’t compare dollars to dollars because that doesn’t account for steep growth in government costs, such as participation in the Public Employees Retirement System or health insurance. The cost of running government doesn’t stay the same from year to year. He’s right about that, but taxpayers and non-wonks don’t live in a world where buying everything you did the previous year, even if it costs more, is considered spending the same in dollars. Had Adams just said the city had cut services, he’d be on more solid ground. Of course, he’d also have to mention that the city had added services. But that’s not what the mayor said either. He stated $36 million in ongoing cuts. That’s not true, even if his spokeswoman stands by the statement. His statement contains some connection to reality: The city has not been able to spend $36 million that it needed to maintain current services over the four years. Part of the reason is because the mayor and council chose instead to spend $10 million on other programs. The remaining $25 million was based on an expectation of maintaining the status quo.

pomt-00398	If Missouri Amendment 1 passes, the auditor's office "could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/05/saundra-mcdowell/mcdowell-claims-missouri-amendment-1-would-adjoin-/	If November ballot measure Amendment 1 passes, municipalities such as St. Louis and Joplin could be smushed into one district, according to Saundra McDowell, Republican candidate for state auditor. During an interview on "The Weekend Report" radio show, published online Aug. 20, McDowell, who is running against Democratic incumbent Nicole Galloway, said Amendment 1 would require all new voting districts to be 50 percent Republican and 50 percent Democrat. To do that, the auditor's office "could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch," she said, even adding later in the interview that "this will happen." As states nationwide seek solutions for gerrymandering, Missouri is doing the same with Amendment 1, which would put the power of redrawing state voting districts into the hands of a non-partisan expert picked from a list curated by the auditor's office. The amendment also seeks to rid lobbyist gifts from the Missouri General Assembly and to keep legislative records public, among other stipulations. It is authored by Clean Missouri, a bipartisan group that aims to reduce the influence of lobbyists and corporations. It has attracted attacks from many politicians, including McDowell. Given the strikingly different claims from Amendment 1 proponents and McDowell's surprising assertion about non-contiguity, we decided to assess her contention. The McDowell campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment, noting that she doesn't intend to take media interviews for approximately 60 days as of Aug. 27. Who has power over redistricting? In the statement, McDowell claims that the auditor's office would have overwhelming control over the redistricting process, adding that the auditor’s office "could literally change the entire demographics of Missouri." She said earlier in the interview that Democrats back Amendment 1 so that Galloway can bend the maps in favor of her party. Amendment 1 language gives the auditor's office just one role: making a list of potential non-partisan demographers from state residents who apply. From that list, the state Senate's majority and minority leaders would have to agree on one or accept a random lottery after each leader removes a third of the list. After the demographer draws up the maps, state legislative commissions can make any changes to it after holding a public hearing. Benjamin Singer, communications director for Clean Missouri, said there was no language in the amendment specifying which part of the government the demographer works in, such as the auditor's office. Must districts be contiguous? The question of whether St. Louis and "a southwest Missouri Republican district" could become a district without their borders touching is answered in the amendment, sort of. Section 3 says new districts "shall be composed of contiguous territory. Areas which meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous." Edward Greim, a lawyer who specializes in constitutional and election law, filed a lawsuit in August to remove Amendment 1 from the ballot. The lawsuit will be decided upon by a judge as early as this week. Greim said that on the surface, this language gives more teeth to contiguity than the current law. But Greim said a loophole in the same section of the amendment prioritizes fairer dispersal of Republicans and Democrats in an area over contiguity. The phrase in question is that contiguity is "subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b)." "Now, they only need to be composed (of contiguous districts) if you have met A and B," Greim said. So if A and B can only be met without contiguity, then contiguity becomes moot, Greim said. Ruth Greenwood, a redistricting attorney from Campaign Legal Center, said "subject to" simply means one requirement has a lower priority than another. "It would ultimately be up to the court to interpret the text," she said. Do districts need to be half-Republican and half-Democrat? Context is essential to McDowell's statement, as she said that non-contiguity is required because every district has to be close to 50 percent Republican and Democratic. But the amendment's requirement that any shift in the statewide electorate reflect a substantially proportionate shift in the state legislature would not be met if that was the case. The amendment also requires the map to be drawn based on voting numbers from the sum of all districts. In other words, Greenwood said, the map can't be drawn solely on a district-by-district basis. Why? Because a big goal of the amendment is to reduce the "efficiency gap" in votes. The statistic measures the difference in the number of votes that don't contribute to a win. After all, everything above 50 percent is not necessary. This would fight gerrymandering methods, where the goal is to increase the opposition party's so-called "wasted votes" while decreasing one party's own. What matters is not how red or blue a certain district is, but how "efficient" votes are being translated to representation. With the Clean Missouri model, not every district has to be "50-50," as potential voting maps of other states have demonstrated. Rather, it simply seeks to reduce the disproportionate representation of the party in power. Our ruling McDowell said that if Amendment 1 is enacted, the auditor's office will necessitate non-contiguous voting districts. Specifically, she said the auditor's office "could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch." Her sentiment is too broad and mostly unfounded. Because the auditor's office does not have complete control over drawing districts, and Amendment 1 is not trying to make every district is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, McDowell's allegation of non-contiguous voting districts becomes more dubious. Her supposed saving grace — "subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b)"— is highly debatable and best left up to legal parsing. We rate the statement Mostly False.

A video clip of Barack Obama bashing the candidate is a good start. Someone who is apparently not a fan of Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, a Democratic gubernatorial contender, created a professional-looking YouTube video attacking him. It begins with a picture of Baker with the "Ghostbusters" symbol. "Thurbert Baker for Governor?" reads the headline on the video, created June 10. Baker's position in the controversial Genarlow Wilson case is the focus of the three-minute video posted by "concernedcitizen4u". The video also includes civil rights stalwarts the Revs. Joseph Lowery and Al Sharpton taking Baker to task. Baker is in a crowded Democratic field seeking that party's nomination to become the state's next leader. To win, or at least get in a runoff, a Democratic candidate must capture a significant portion of the state's African-American vote. Blacks make up about half the Democratic voter base in Georgia. Baker is black. The other leading Democratic candidates are white. Whoever posted the video -- and at this point that person or political campaign remains unknown -- apparently is trying to undermine Baker's support in the black community by using a 3-year-old statement by the man who is now president of the United States. Then-candidate Obama assailed Baker for pursuing the case against Wilson, who is also black. This is a stealth political attack at its lethal best. Brutally blunt, it focuses on a target audience and is virtually untraceable. But is it true? The Baker camp said no. "This isn't the first time a false attack has been spread anonymously ... and it won't be the last," Baker campaign manager Jeff DiSantis said. "It's a pack of lies." Wilson, you may remember, was convicted in 2005 of felony aggravated child molestation for what he said was consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl. Wilson was 17 at the time of the incident and faced 10 years in prison after he was convicted. Some activists suggested prosecutors treated Wilson harshly because he is black. The accusations of racial discrimination, added to a story about sex, generated national news coverage. In 2006, the state Legislature changed the law to make similar acts between teens a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 12 months in prison. The changes, however, did not apply to Wilson and anyone else already imprisoned on such charges. So he remained in prison. Not fair, Obama said. The Democrat referred to the Wilson case in several speeches in 2007 during his run for president. Obama compared Wilson's case to I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the former chief of staff to Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. President George W. Bush decided to commute Libby's sentence after he was convicted of perjury and obstruction in a CIA leak case. "You've got Scooter Libby not serving any jail time. But you've got a young man, a football player who didn't even commit a felony, who's being locked up for 10 years, then it's harder for you to say you stand up for justice in America," Obama said in one campaign speech that was recorded. The crowd cheered. The video ends with audio replaying some of Obama's speech. "It's harder for you to say you stand for justice in America." Video of the future president questioning your commitment to justice can't be good for Baker in a Democratic primary. The video does not say when Obama's remarks were recorded. But an Atlanta Journal-Constitution account of Obama's visit to Atlanta in August 2007 said he made comments about Libby and Wilson at that time. There's one problem with Obama's comments. State law 16-6-4 said at the time of Wilson's conviction that aggravated child molestation was a felony. Monroe County Superior Court Judge Thomas H. Wilson (no relation to Genarlow) ruled in June 2007 that the case was a misdemeanor and that Genarlow Wilson should be freed. Baker appealed the ruling, saying Judge Wilson overstepped his authority. The attorney general said at the time he was worried the ruling had the potential to allow other convicted child molesters to be freed. Baker was quoted in the AJC as saying he thought the 10-year sentence was "harsh." But, Baker also said: "I took an oath to uphold the laws of this state. And in taking that oath, I don't have the luxury of taking the law into my own hands or picking which cases to defend." The Georgia Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in October 2007 that Genarlow Wilson should be freed. We tried to reach "concernedcitizen4u", but our efforts have been unsuccessful. People who watch the video may get the wrong impression about the case. Wilson was indeed convicted of a felony. So Obama's comments about the case in 2007 were incorrect. We believe the video is misleading and rule that this item is False.	None	Concernedcitizen4U	None	None	None	2010-06-18T06:00:00	2010-06-10	['None']
pomt-10554	"I have something in common with my husband. He never carried caucuses either. He lost all of the ones that I've lost."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/13/hillary-clinton/both-caucus-losers-but-shes-more-thorough/	Trying to brush off some of her recent defeats, Sen. Hillary Clinton compared her battle with Sen. Barack Obama to Bill Clinton's presidential travails, noting that he, too, had a tendency to perform lousy in caucuses. "I have something in common with my husband. He never carried caucuses either. He lost all of the ones that I've lost," she said in a Feb. 11, 2008, ABC/Politico interview. Misery may love company, but the New York senator is stretching facts a bit to draw comparisons with the self-proclaimed "Comeback Kid." That's partly because some states have switched their selection processes between primaries, in which voters cast statewide ballots for the nominee of their choice, and the older caucus system, in which voters meet at the precinct level to decide a winner, sometimes under complicated rules. It's true that Bill Clinton lost all the states that Hillary Clinton has lost among those states that held caucuses in both 1992 and 2008. Those are Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota and Washington. Hillary Clinton also lost primaries in Delaware and Utah — states that in 1992 held caucuses that Bill Clinton lost. And she lost the caucus in Colorado, a state whose primary Bill Clinton couldn't carry 16 years ago. On the other hand, she won the Nevada caucus that her husband lost in 1992. The couple's fortunes also differed in several states that have changed their nominating processes. Hillary Clinton lost caucuses in Kansas, Nebraska and North Dakota, which each held primaries in 1992 that Bill Clinton won. She won the primary in Arizona, a state Bill Clinton was unable to carry when it held a caucus in 1992. As an incumbent president in 1996, Bill Clinton didn't have to sweat intraparty battles and coasted to the party nomination unopposed. It's hard to read too much into comparisons like the one Hillary Clinton cites because the political complexions of some states — particularly in the West — have changed markedly over the past 16 years. So, too, has the nature of campaigning — and the way the 24/7 spin cycle affects groups of voters. Safe to say, both Clintons do better in big states that hold primaries. For this reason, we rule Hillary Clinton's claim Mostly True. UPDATE: We have updated this item to show that Nevada held a caucus this year, not a primary.

pomt-02410	"We have invested record funding in protecting our environment."	false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-record-funding-environmental-prot/	So we know Gov. Rick Scott likes to portray himself as the jobs-promoter-in-chief but what about tree-hugger-in-chief? During his fourth State of the state speech March 4, Scott began by reeling off a list of recent accomplishments. "A lot has happened since I spoke to you last year. I can talk about how our unemployment rate is now down to 6.3 percent. How our crime rate is at a 42-year low. How we have invested record funding in protecting our environment....." Some of those numbers sounded familiar to us. But we hadn’t heard Scott’s claim that during his tenure we have invested record funding to protect the environment, so we decided to fact-check that claim. Funding to restore springs We asked Scott’s spokesman to provide us with documentation to support his claim that during his tenure Florida had invested record funding on environmental protection. Spokesman John Tupps told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Scott was referring to his proposed budget that includes a "record $55 million" to protect and restore springs -- "building upon last year’s investment of more than $37 million." Funding for springs is only a subset of funding for environmental protection, but we’ll look at the status of springs funding first. As of early March, the Legislature hadn’t voted on the amount for springs protection. It’s possible the Legislature will set an even higher amount: A coalition of Senate committee chairs drafted a bill to raise $400 million for springs from documentary stamp taxes on real estate transactions. The state has more than 1,000 freshwater springs, and many are suffering from nitrate pollution that fuels the growth of toxic algae blooms. Geologists have found an increase in saltiness in a few freshwater springs, which could signal future problems with the state's drinking supply, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In 2013, the state asked water management districts for a list of projects essential to springs restoration and received a list of about $122 million. The Legislature set aside $10 million, but the total climbed to $37 million, once other sources including local government money was included. "If the Legislature passes Gov. Scott’s $55 million springs recommendation it will be a record level of spending for Florida’s springs," Eric Draper, Executive Director Audubon Florida, told PolitiFact Florida. Annual DEP funding Though Scott’s spokesman said he was referring to money proposed for springs protection, his claim was more broadly about the environment, so we asked the Department of Environmental Protection, called DEP, for the bottom-line budget total for each year during Scott’s tenure. We found similar figures back to 2004, during the tenure of his predecessors, Govs. Charlie Crist Jeb Bush. Here is the bottom line total each year: 2004-05: $2.1 billion 2005-06: $2 billion 2006-07: $2.9 billion 2007-08: $2.4 billion 2008-09: $2 billion 2009-10: $1.3 billion 2010-11: $1.4 billion 2011-12: $1.8 billion 2012-13: $1.4 billion 2013-14: $1.3 billion These numbers come with some caveats: they are appropriation numbers, not actual expenditures, and they combine state and federal dollars. In several of those years, the numbers included debt service payments of more than $400 million. It’s no surprise that the dollar amounts were higher in flush financial times under Bush and part of Crist’s term and then plummeted along with the economy in the second half of Crist’s tenure and Scott’s tenure. We have seen the same pattern for other state spending priorities. Spokespersons for DEP and Scott also cited other environmental projects Scott has supported -- including an $880 million water quality plan to provide clean water to the Everglades. Facing the prospect of court-ordered cleanup, in 2012 the state reached a settlement with the federal government to end a long-standing dispute about Everglades cleanup. All of the $880 million won’t be spent this year; it is a 13-year agreement. For this year, Scott proposed $130 million for Everglades, which includes part of that $880 million, as well as other state and water management district sources. "Scott has skillfully negotiated the Everglades deal with EPA, which gives him a talking point of boosting environmental programs in Florida," said Jerry Phillips, a DEP attorney in the 1990s who is now an environmental watchdog. "But the reality is that Bush and Crist had been negotiating with EPA for years as well, on issues such as the Everglades." Environmental cuts The total DEP budget doesn’t tell the full story because other agencies also do work that relates to protecting the environment. We interviewed several environmentalists who pointed to Scott’s lack of investment in protecting the environment. We will cite some of their examples: • In 2011 Scott and the Legislature abolished the Department of Community Affairs, which for decades reviewed development plans in cities and counties. • In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections. The South Florida Water Management District’s total budget dropped from about $1 billion in 2011 to $622 million in 2014. Water management districts handle planning for water resources and wetlands protection, among other environmental issues. • In December 2012, DEP laid off 58 employees. • The number of enforcement cases handled by DEP has dropped dramatically, from 2,289 in 2010 (Crist’s final year) to 799 in 2012, the Tampa Bay Times reported. As of the end of May, only 145 new cases had been filed. • For many years the Legislature invested $300 million a year in Florida Forever, a program to buy land with money from a tax on real estate transactions. During the economic downturn, the Legislature pulled back. In 2010, Crist’s final year, the program received $15 million. In 2011, Scott proposed zeroing out Florida Forever (it ultimately got $744,000), and then in 2012 he signed a budget that included about $8 million. In 2013, lawmakers approved $20 million and directed the state to sell off $50 million worth of land to generate additional dollars. In March, DEP scrapped the program without selling an acre. Scott has proposed $70 million for next year -- that includes $40 million from the sale of non-conservation lands. Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida, said Scott’s claim is "disconcerting" because of the various cuts. "You have to take all that into account when you run budget numbers," he said. "It sounds to me like Scott’s people are coming up with their own selective set of budget figures. ... He doesn’t have environmental creds as far as I am concerned." Our ruling During his State of the State speech Scott said, "We have invested record funding in protecting our environment." After the speech, a Scott spokesman said he was referring to money directed toward springs restoration. Scott’s statement during the speech likely left listeners with the impression that his investment in the environment in general is a record, and that would be misleading. Sorting out the total investment in environmental protection under Scott compared to predecessors is complicated because funding comes from state and federal sources and multiple state programs relate to the environment. However, under one way to compare funding - - the total for the Department of Environmental Protection -- Scott falls far short of Bush’s record. And Scott doesn’t beat Crist’s record, either. Scott tried to take his spending recommendation for one particular environmental project -- springs restoration -- and portray that as an overall record, and that’s not the case.

pomt-08344	Says Republican candidates in Oregon are "advocating violence" against gays.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/28/basic-rights-oregon/basic-rights-oregon-tries-tie-one-pollsters-anti-g/	Campaign donation requests say the darndest things. Take, for instance, a fresh-off-the-keyboard e-mail received from the Basic Rights Equality PAC -- the political finance arm of Basic Rights Oregon -- that ties the views of one pollster to those of the Senate Republicans. First, the e-mail starts by quoting from a Willamette Week article: "It’s hard to believe. But there it was in bold print in ‘Willamette Week’: an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans ‘advocates death for gays.’ " The e-mail continues, making some assertions of its own: "It’s shocking that candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence." Indeed, it is shocking. That’s why PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out. As a basis for their claim, Basic Right Oregon points to the Willamette Week article, which reported on "an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans" and his alleged extreme anti-gay views. A quick Google search, and we had before us the article with the perfectly provocative headline "Republican Pollster In Oregon Says Slaves ‘Well-Treated’; Advocates Death for Gays." According to the article, state filings showed that the campaign arm of the Senate Republicans had paid thousands of dollars to Target Market Strategies for polling over the past few years. Senate Democrats pounced when they learned that Dennis Oliver Woods, the "company principal" of Target Market Strategies, had published a book that included the following passages: "Some crimes are such a violent assault on the image of God in man or on biblical society that God stipulates that nothing less than death will satisfy His offended sense of justice." And then this one: "In addition to murder (see Lev. 24:17), the death penalty is specified for a number of crimes. This is the ultimate form of restitution. These crimes include promotion of witchcraft…Bestiality (see Lev. 20:15), homosexuality (see Lev. 20:13), incest and adultery ..." We decided to give Woods a call directly to discuss his views. He wouldn’t chat with us but instead sent us an e-mail that didn’t do much to address what he actually thought. "My point of view is really irrelevant now since the Senate Republican caucus has dismissed me and I am no longer working for them," he wrote. PolitiFact Oregon wrote him back, asking for clarification. He never responded. To learn more, we got our hands on a copy of his book, "Discipling the Nations," from which all this was excerpted. The book says that "Part III," the section excerpted in Willamette Week, "offers God’s Blueprint for Civil Government. Chapter 7 holds forth the Word of God as the only adequate rule for civil government." Michael Gay, the spokesman for the Senate Republicans, says they did not know about Woods’ book, which was published more than 10 years ago and is not widely distributed. They have since stopped using his services. "He served no advisory function to the caucus whatsoever," Gay said. "He was merely a vendor who made phone calls. "We wrote the poll questions, we told him what to ask, he was scripted." Maya Blackmun, a spokeswoman for Basic Rights Oregon, argues, "(I)t's common knowledge that on political campaigns pollsters are a key player in advising and consulting on a campaign, interpreting results, providing cross tab analysis, targeting profiles, connecting messages with key audiences, etc." Even if Woods does believe in the death penalty for gays and even if he was an adviser to the Senate Republicans, Basic Rights Oregon asserted that Republican candidates are "blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence." PolitiFact Oregon finds no evidence of this claim. Certainly, no member of the Republican Senate caucus has spoken in support of Woods’ views or said anything remotely similar. Blackmun concedes that the e-mail could have done with a bit of editing. It would have been fairer, she said, had the e-mail read something to the effect of "it’s shocking that an adviser to candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay." "We made a mistake," Blackmun said. "The additional words would have made it clearer." We find the claim that Senate Republicans are advocating violence against gays False. Comment on this story.

pomt-13757	Says that as a U.S. senator, Russ Feingold "voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/22/ron-johnson/gop-national-convention-ron-johnson-attacks-challe/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson used part of his July 19, 2016, speech at the Republican National Convention to boost his re-election campaign, attacking challenger and ex-senator Russ Feingold for voting "against authorizing our military 11 separate times." It’s a claim we want to check, given that Johnson made it in the context of arguing that electing Feingold would made America less safe. But first a little on how the Wisconsin Republican got there. The attack Johnson opened his speech in Cleveland with this greeting: "Ladies and gentleman, what difference, at this point, does it make?" It was a shot at Hillary Clinton. While secretary of state, Clinton uttered that phrase to him during a Senate hearing on the bombing of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans died in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. (Our In Context on Clinton’s remarks is one of our most-clicked items. And PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True another claim from the speech in which Johnson took credit for inducing Clinton’s comments.) After criticizing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Johnson continued his speech by warning of dangers posed by terrorism if Democrats win in the November 2016 elections. Then he pivoted to attacking Feingold, a Democrat who served three terms in the Senate before Johnson defeated him in 2010. "So, the question is, when will America actually confront this terrible reality. We certainly won’t, if Democrats win in November," Johnson said. "In Wisconsin, I’m running against Russ Feingold, a man who even after 9/11, was the only senator to vote against giving law enforcement the tools they need to help stop international terror. During his 18-year Senate career, he also voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times." During his current campaign, Feingold has defended, and raised money on, casting the only vote against the Patriot Act in 2001. He said the law "gave the federal government way too much power to spy on people without adequate oversight." But in the context of Johnson’s remarks about terrorism and being tough on defense, what does it mean that Feingold "voted against authorizing our military"? In short, Johnson is making an attack that is broader than a claim about 11 votes. Understanding the NDAA To back Johnson’s statement, which is also made in a Johnson TV ad, his campaign staff cited 11 instances in which Feingold voted against the National Defense Authorization Act. But here are two key points made by three experts on defense budgets about NDAA votes: 1. The annual NDAA contains thousands of pages and hundreds of provisions, which means a lawmaker might vote against it for any number of reasons. Some lawmakers think it doesn’t authorize enough funds, others might think it authorizes too much; or a no vote could come from opposition to a policy in the bill, such as gays in the military or moving detainees out of Guantanamo Bay. "Even if you’re the biggest proponent of a strong defense, you could find something to object to in the NDAA almost every year," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist think tank. 2. The NDAA authorizes funds, but it doesn’t provide any. Money is actually allocated through a separate appropriations process. So, voting no on an NDAA would not result in any shutdown, like voting no on appropriations could. Indeed, some federal agencies operate for years without an authorization bill. "An authorization is just a license to hunt, it doesn’t actually bag you a deer," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a public spending watchdog group. We also found that although Feingold sometimes was among only a small number of Democrats voting against an NDAA, often he was joined by conservative Republicans: 1993: 22 senators voted no, including Republican stalwarts Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Vietnam war veteran John McCain of Arizona, the GOP’s 2008 presidential nominee. 1994: Feingold was joined by McCain and another war veteran, Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP’s 1996 president nominee, voting no. 2009: Feingold was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the NDAA. But 28 Republicans, including conservative stalwarts such as Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the current Senate majority leader, and Jeff Sessions of Arizona, also voted no. Feingold has given different reasons for his no votes. In 2008, for example, he said he supported a number of provisions in the NDAA, including a pay raise for troops and limiting the outsourcing of private security functions in war zones, but voted no because it contained "$70 billion to continue the war in Iraq but no language mandating that we safely redeploy our troops." It's also worth noting that Feingold did vote yes on a number of NDAAs, including in November 2005, June 2006 and December 2010, just before he left office. Our rating Johnson argued that Feingold would be weak on defense, and claimed that as a senator, Feingold "voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times." During his 18 years in the Senate, Feingold did vote 11 times against the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues such as gays in the military. The 11 votes indicate a pretty clear pattern. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that appropriations bills provide funding. And experts told us conclusions can’t be drawn about why a lawmaker votes no on the NDAA, given that sometimes lawmakers oppose it because of certain policy provisions. Moreover, lawmakers on both ends of the political spectrum, including ex-military conservative Republicans, have voted against it over the years. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Johnson’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5667d437-28d4-4b76-913a-c8e9cf079d5e	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-07-22T10:30:00	2016-07-19	['United_States', 'Russ_Feingold']

pomt-00541	"The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/18/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-income-inequality-widest-1920s/	Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the 2016 Democratic nomination has focused on the gap between rich and poor. Sanders recently tweeted that the income inequality is wider than it’s been in a long time -- a very long time. "The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s," Sanders tweeted from his @BernieSanders account on June 4, 2015, after his first campaign trip to Iowa. But is the inequality gap really that big? Intriguingly, Sanders’ tweet mirrors a statement made by someone on the far opposite end of the political spectrum: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In January, PolitiFact Texas fact-checked a claim by Cruz that "today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928." For that fact-check, a Cruz spokesman directed us to a report done by the Pew Research Center citing research from Emmanuel Saez, a University of California-Berkeley economics professor who studies wealth and income inequality. The report showed a database compiled by Pew that included the distribution of top incomes for more than 20 countries. The data compiled showed that 1928 and 2012 were the two years where the top 1 percent of the richest Americans earned the greatest share of the nation’s income. Here’s the chart, which lists, in descending order, the top 15 years the richest American taxpayers had the greatest share of U.S. income : Year Top 1% income share 1928 19.6 2012 19.34 1927 18.68 1916 18.57 1929 18.42 2007 18.33 1914 18.16 2006 18.06 1926 18.01 1913 17.96 2008 17.89 2005 17.68 1936 17.64 1917 17.6 1925 17.6 In other words, in 1928, the top 1 percent of taxpayers collectively held 19.6 percent of the nation’s income. In 2012, the top 1 percent held 19.34 percent of the nation’s income. So a recent year -- 2012 -- did rank second to 1928 on the list of biggest years for income inequality. But we’ll note two reasons for caution. First, other recent years did not rank as high on this list. While the years 2005 through 2008 ranked in the top 15, the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 did not. The Wall Street meltdown in 2008, which reduced incomes at the top of the spectrum as well as the bottom, may be a reason why. But this fact does offer some doubt about whether the 2012 result was more than a blip. Tax hikes that took effect in 2013 may have led taxpayers to time their liquidation of certain assets to avoid higher tax rates, said Saez, who with Thomas Piketty and others developed the underlying research. That suggests that 2012 could be an unusually high year, and experts say the increased taxation after 2013 could reduce how much of the nation’s income is held by the top 1 percent. The second caveat is that the method Saez used doesn’t fully account for all of the income sources that flow to those in the bottom 99 percent. The data used in his study looks at pre-tax, private income but doesn’t account for other sources of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans. Accounting for those factors in the calculation could produce a narrower income gap, although a full-blown study going back to the 1920s would be required to see whether the Saez method has produced an abnormal result. (Read the PolitiFact Texas fact-check for more detail.) Our ruling Sanders said, "The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s."

pomt-00801	"In this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/02/bernie-sanders/checking-bernie-sanders-americans-low-voter-turnou/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and is considering running for president, recently decried the lack of Americans participating in the electoral process during a town hall at a union hall in Austin, Texas. During an appearance at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers-sponsored town hall on March 31, 2015, Sanders told the audience: "I beg of you do not enter that world of despair. We can win this fight. In order to win this struggle we are going to need nothing less than a political revolution, and let me tell you what I mean by ‘a political revolution.’ When, as was the case in this last election in November, when 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, when 80 percent of young people, when 75 percent of low-income workers, chose not to vote, what we need to do is create a momentum so that 70, 80, 90 percent of the people vote. And when that happens, we win hands down." It's a longstanding concern for Sanders, who has introduced a bill to make Election Day a national holiday so more people can vote. We wondered: Was Sanders right about the low level of voter participation? First, let’s look at the numbers. • "63 percent of the American people chose not to vote." Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist, has assembled the United States Election Project, an extensive and widely used archive of voter participation data. He found that in the November 2014 general election, 33.2 percent of the voting-age population cast a ballot and 35.9 percent of the voting-eligible population voted. The difference between those two figures is that the voting-age population includes non-citizens and felons, neither of which are able to vote, whereas the voting-eligible population excludes these groups. If you flip the numbers so they are expressed as Sanders used them, 66.8 percent of the voting-age population didn’t vote, and 64.1 percent of the voting-eligible population didn’t vote. Using the latter figure -- which political scientists consider a better measurement -- Sanders is quite close. Incidentally, according to McDonald’s data, the overall turnout rate in 2014 was the lowest since World War II. • "80 percent of young people" did not vote. We found a study conducted by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University that had some relevant data for voters age 18-29. It estimated a turnout rate for that age group of 21.5 percent. That works out to a 78.5 percent non-participation rate -- close to the 80 percent Sanders cited. • "75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote." This is the claim for which Sanders has the weakest support. After each election cycle is over, the Census Bureau looks back at how many Americans of different demographic groups voted. The data isn’t yet compiled for the 2014 election, so we looked instead at the 2010 election -- the most recent midterm election prior to 2014. (In general, presidential-year elections see higher turnout across the board than midterms do, so using 2010 offers the best apples-to-apples comparison for 2014.) According to the 2010 data, those earning less than $30,000 a year -- the cutoff Sanders’ office told us he was using -- had a turnout rate of either 28.9 percent (if you use total population) or 34.6 percent (if you use citizens only). Flip those and you get 65 percent of citizens in that income category not voting, or 71 percent of everyone in that income category not voting. Those are both lower than Sanders’ claim of 75 percent, and for the more salient statistic -- citizens alone -- it’s off by a full 10 percentage points. (Jeff Frank, a Sanders spokesman, acknowledged that the statement was an estimate.) We should note that political scientists say that the census data may overstate actual voting rates, since it’s based on what respondents tell researchers, and there’s a widespread assumption that people over-report socially admired actions like voting. So it’s possible that Sanders’ 75 percent figure is closer to accurate. However, saying so requires speculating beyond the hard figures. To sum up, then: On the numbers, Sanders is quite close for turnout rates among Americans overall and among young people, but he’s a bit off for turnout rates for lower-income Americans. Did all of these people 'choose not to vote'? However, there’s another wrinkle to what Sanders said. Sanders twice used the phrasing "chose not to vote." In the same Census Bureau survey we mentioned earlier, researchers asked for the reason why people didn’t vote. It’s broken down by age and income, so we can check all three of Sanders’ claims against the data for 2010. We divided the stated reasons for not voting into two categories -- reasons of circumstance and reasons of choice. Under reasons of circumstance, we included "illness or disability," "out of town," "too busy/conflicting schedule," "transportation problems," "registration problems," "bad weather conditions," and "inconvenient polling places." Under reasons of choice, we included "forgot to vote," "not interested," and "did not like candidates or campaign issues." (We ignored "other" and "didn’t know.") Our division is not infallible -- others can combine the reasons into their own categories -- but we think our calculation offers a useful starting point for comparison. All three demographic groups Sanders mentioned turn out to have pretty similar breakdowns. For Americans overall, 55 percent didn’t vote for reasons of circumstance. For young Americans, it was 56 percent, and for low-income Americans, it was 52 percent. By contrast, the percentages of people not voting by choice were lower across the board. For Americans overall, it was 33 percent. For young Americans, it was 30 percent and for lower-income Americans it was 34 percent. This means that Sanders went too far when he said that large majorities chose not to vote. "It would be true to say that roughly an estimated 80 percent of youth did not vote in the 2014 midterm," said Abby Kiesa, youth coordinator and researcher at the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. "However, the existing research about youth voting does not suggest that all of those youth actively chose not to vote. In fact, young people in particular face barriers such as navigating a new system, that may prevent them from registering and voting, even if they do want to vote." This may have been an unintentional word choice on Sanders’ part, but at PolitiFact we pay close attention to speakers’ precise wording. Class differences in voting A final note: Sanders may have gotten some of his numbers wrong, but he does have a point that poorer Americans vote at lower rates than rich Americans do, as do younger Americans. "There is a class bias in voting," said Sean McElwee, a research associate with the think tank Demos. In 2010, for instance, the Census Bureau found that as 34.6 percent of citizens making below $30,000 were voting, a much higher percentage of those earning at least $150,000 voted -- 59 percent. Even taking into account the caveats in the data, McElwee said, "this is a disturbing gap." Our ruling Sanders said that "in this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote." Sanders was too loose with some of his numbers and his wording, but he has a point that rates of non-voting among Americans, and especially among younger and poorer Americans, are high.

pomt-14319	Wisconsin’s "effective" unemployment rate is 20 percent.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-wisconsins-effective-unem/	At a campaign rally in Wisconsin on March 29, 2016, Donald Trump took aim at Gov. Scott Walker and -- reading from notes that he said came from "books" -- made a number of statistical claims that reflect negatively on the state. The Republican frontrunner for president cast blame on the Republican governor and onetime presidential candidate, citing figures on state government debt and the number of people on food stamps. But one of Trump’s most striking claims was about unemployment -- something Walker frequently takes credit for having brought down. "Unemployment rate -- well, they say -- that can't be possible," Trump told a crowd in Janesville, looking at his notes. "Unemployment rate, they have down 20, that can't be possible." As members of the audience interjected, Trump continued by saying: "What? Is it 20 percent? Effective or regular? I mean just -- effective unemployment rate, 20 percent. Hey, this is out of the big book." So, is Wisconsin’s "effective" unemployment rate 20 percent? The measures There is no official measure for the effective -- or as Trump on other occasions called it -- the "real" unemployment rate. But even taking into account the federal government’s most expansive measure of unemployment, Wisconsin’s rate doesn’t even reach double digits. Here’s what the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics told us: BLS has six measures of unemployment, ranging from U-1 -- the most restrictive -- to U-6 -- the most expansive. In between is U-3, the official unemployment rate. That’s the one you see reported in the news most often. The U-3 official unemployment rate in Wisconsin was 4.6 percent in 2015. That rate is updated monthly. The most recent rate, for February 2016, was also 4.6 percent. The U-6 rate, meanwhile, is sometimes referred to unofficially as the "real" unemployment rate. U-6 includes people who are unemployed, plus "marginally attached workers," meaning those who are not in the labor force but want to work and are available for work. It also includes people who want to work full time but, because of economic conditions in their area, are able to work only part time. The U-6 rate is calculated only annually. Wisconsin’s U-6 rate for 2015 was 8.3 percent -- again, far below Trump’s 20 percent. Trump made a similar claim in June 2015 in announcing his run for president. He said the "real" unemployment rate for the United States at the time was "anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it." (At the time, the official unemployment rate nationally was 5.5 percent.) PolitiFact National rated that statement False, citing U-6 figures as we've cited. Trump’s campaign staff didn’t respond for that fact check and, as of press time on this fact-check, had not responded to our requests for information. Our rating Trump said Wisconsin’s "effective" unemployment rate is 20 percent. Wisconsin’s latest official unemployment rate -- the one reported most often in the news -- was 4.6 percent in February 2016. It was also 4.6 percent for all of 2015. The government’s most expansive unemployment rate -- which includes the unemployed, people in the labor force who aren’t looking for work and people who are working part time but want to work full time -- for Wisconsin was 8.3 percent for 2015.

Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly. "I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died," Clinton said. Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan. "Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York," Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. "A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed." Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected. Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts. Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami. Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran. He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported. "We have two missions," Ahmadinejad proclaimed. "To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world." Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population. The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-04-16T00:00:00	2008-04-16	['Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad']

pomt-10673	"I'm prolife. I'm not going to apologize for becoming prolife. Ronald Reagan followed that same course, as did Henry Hyde and George Herbert Walker Bush. And I'm proud to be prolife."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/19/mitt-romney/their-shifts-were-less-stark/	Under attack from Alan Keyes during a GOP debate on Dec. 12, 2007, Mitt Romney said he's not the only politician to have changed his position on abortion. He cites three prominent Republican figures to make his case, but their shifts are far less stark than his. Let's take them one at a time. We examined Romney's abortion record here. After supporting abortion rights early in his political career, he changed his mind after meeting a stem-cell researcher in 2004. As governor of California in 1967, Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill legalizing "therapeutic" abortions, defined as those approved by medical staff where there is substantial risk to the physical and mental health of the woman, or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Biographer Lou Cannon, in his 2001 book Ronald Reagan: The Presidential Portfolio, writes that it was a difficult decision. "Reagan did not know what to do," Cannon writes. "His staff was divided (also largely on religious lines), and he was lobbied heavily from both sides. … After several days of indecision, Reagan reluctantly signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act. After he recognized its consequences, he became an opponent of abortions, except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest." Thirteen years later, Reagan ran for president under a platform that included strong opposition to abortion. Now, the case of Henry Hyde: In the early 1970s, in the Illinois legislature, he initially was receptive to a colleague's request that he co-sponsor a bill relaxing the state's ban on abortion. But after he read up on the issue, he declined. "I had never really thought about abortion, so I read the bill and read a book: The Vanishing Right to Live , by Charlie Rice. I became convinced that abortion was an evil," Hyde says in a 2006 National Review article, "Hyde in Winter," by John J. Miller. Hyde did not support the bill, rather he helped defeat it. As he went on to Congress, he became a strong abortion opponent, winning passage in 1976 of what became known as the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal funds for abortion. George H.W. Bush's position on abortion was an issue as Reagan considered him as a running mate in 1980. "While he personally opposes abortion, he is against passing a constitutional amendment to make it illegal," a Newsweek article said of Bush that year. Reagan, running on a strict antiabortion platform, needed a vice presidential candidate who was right there with him. Richard Allen, Reagan's foreign policy adviser at the time and later national security adviser, writes about the angst in the Reagan camp in an article for the New York Times . " 'There's Bush,' I suggested, half expecting him to close off the discussion. Instead he paused and then said, 'I can't take him; that "voodoo economic policy" charge and his stand on abortion are wrong.' " Allen goes on to say that Bush was approached by Reagan himself about whether he could pledge to support the platform. That was the beginning of Bush's unwavering antiabortion support. Planned Parenthood says Bush "turned his back on reproductive health care to be Reagan's running mate," while the National Right-to-Life Committee endorsed him for president in 1988. So, where does that leave us? Reagan had an abortion-rights moment early in his career. Hyde briefly considered backing the abortion-rights bill of a colleague. Bush at one time opposed outlawing abortion. Still, it's difficult to compare records on this issue because of the way the political landscape and dialogue has changed over the years. None of the three politicians Romney cites made so clear a change as he did, but he's not entirely wrong either. We rule Romney's statement Half True.

pomt-07382	Says the Internal Revenue Service estimated it must hire "16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer" to enforce the federal health care overhaul.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/may/04/saxby-chambliss/us-sen-chambliss-says-16500-irs-agents-needed-heal/	More than a year after Congress approved a health care overhaul, the debate is far from over. Legal challenges are working their way through the courts. States are preparing for major changes. Opponents continue to rail against "Obamacare." Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are working to understand what it all means to them. When a constituent wrote a letter to U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, his office replied with a three-page defense of his opposition to the law that the recipient shared with us. One argument concerned new tax credits, taxes and a host of other rule changes for businesses and individuals that will require new technology, administrators and paperwork to implement. This boosts the Internal Revenue Service’s workload. "In order to fully enforce the provisions of this bill, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that it will be required to hire an additional 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer," the Chambliss reply said. An additional 16,500 agents? That’s nearly the population of Decatur. Is this correct? PolitiFact Georgia’s parent publication, PolitiFact National, checked related claims twice before. So has FactCheck.org, a nonprofit team that performs similar work to PolitiFact. We found that Chambliss’ claim has led a long existence with several incarnations, all of which are misleading. The Truth-O-Meter first ruled on a similar statement by U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican and one of at least a dozen lawmakers who made this point during last year’s fight over the legislation. He said that "according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates" of the health care bill. Kirk’s attribution was misleading, PolitiFact ruled. The 16,500 actually came from an estimate from Republicans with the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation. House Republicans voted against the final health care bill. This is what actually happened: The CBO, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, offered a cost estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion over 10 years, but it suggested nothing about how those costs would translate to jobs, PolitiFact ruled. Republicans picked numbers at the high end of the CBO estimate that favor their case, the ruling concluded. Another problem is that even the Republicans on Ways and Means acknowledged that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs if they factored in overhead such as desks and office supplies in addition to salaries. The jobs figure is based on an estimate for the costs of benefits and payroll for a single worker. PolitiFact ruled Kirk’s claim Barely True because it’s fair to assume the IRS will need to hire new employees. The assertion continues to resurface. FactCheck.org noted that Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said it would take "16,500 armed bureaucrats to make this program work." It called the comment a "wildly inaccurate claim." FactCheck.org also pointed out other problems. For instance, it misrepresented the Ways and Means estimates, which were for the number of potential employees. Actual IRS agents only make up a small percentage of the IRS workforce. The rest are clerks, accountants, administrators, attorneys, help-line workers and others who are not involved with enforcement. And only a small segment of agents -- law enforcement officers who work on criminal cases -- are armed. U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota made a similar claim in January but earned a better PolitiFact rating than Kirk did. She noted the health care bill "may" put those agents in charge of policing the bill, not that they would. This more careful language earned her a Half True. After Bachmann made her statement, the IRS submitted a budget request to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for fiscal year 2012. It includes estimates for workers it needs to begin implementation of the health care act. We read the 159-page document and counted requests for 1,269 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes at a cost of $473.4 million. They were typically for support roles in areas such as information technology or customer service. Most were not agents. And so we turn to Chambliss’ claim. The attribution is incorrect. The 16,500 figure did not come from the IRS, but from Republican members of Congress who opposed the law. That estimate was for employees, not "agents." And it didn’t account for overhead costs, which even the claim’s supporters acknowledged would likely lower the jobs number. For 2012, the IRS estimate is 1,269, mostly in non-enforcement roles. Chambliss’ statement that the IRS estimated it must "hire an additional 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer" to implement health care reforms not only repeated an oft-criticized, misleading claim. It got the claim wrong. We therefore rule Chambliss’ statement False.	None	Saxby Chambliss	None	None	None	2011-05-04T06:00:00	2011-03-28	['None']

Rick Perry argues in an April 2 column in the Austin American-Statesman that such broad mandates are "ineffective." The column also was published by the San Angelo Standard-Times. As evidence, Perry turns the spotlight onto Massachusetts, which has required that adults have health coverage since July 2007. "The number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is about the same as it was when the mandates were passed in 2006," Perry wrote. In a state held up as a shining example by health care reform advocates, that's quite an indictment. Is it true? While waiting last week for Perry's office to elaborate, we looked into how many people are insured in the Bay State. In April 2006, Mitt Romney, then-governor of Massachusetts, signed into law a health care plan with the aim of helping that state reach nearly universal insurance coverage. The plan — similar in some respects to the new federal law — included an expansion of the state's Medicaid program, subsidized coverage for eligible residents and the creation of exchanges where individuals and small businesses could buy coverage. The Massachusetts individual mandate applies to residents who are 18 or older and has penalties for not complying, although people whose incomes are at or below the federal poverty level are exempt. Dick Powers, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Health Connector, an agency that administers parts of the state's health care system, said children were not included in the mandate because virtually all of them already had insurance in 2006. Now for the numbers: According to Powers, about 600,000 Massachusetts residents did not have insurance when the state's health care legislation was signed. Since then, he said, 408,000 people have obtained coverage. The Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy estimates that in 2009, the share of people without insurance was down to 2.7 percent, the lowest uninsured rate in the nation. The division says that translates roughly into 171,000 people — a far cry from the 2006 "before" number of 600,000. It's also a far cry from Perry's claim that the number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is relatively unchanged, a statement that Powers called "outrageous" and wrong. “Someone saying that probably doesn’t believe Nolan Ryan ever pitched a no-hitter either,” Powers said. For another source, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, whose most recent data on the subject are from 2008. According to estimates based on the bureau's Current Population Survey, a sampling of about 100,000 households that has been done for more than 50 years, Massachusetts had about 657,000 uninsured residents in 2006. That roughly matches up with the state's estimate of 600,000. By 2008, the number of uninsured in Massachusetts had dropped to about 350,000, according to the Census Bureau's CPS data. Another Census Bureau measure puts that estimate even lower. Based on the American Community Survey, a more reliable source of state data than the CPS because the surveys are sent to more households, about 263,000 people in Massachusetts lacked health insurance in 2008. (That was the first year the ACS included a question about health insurance coverage.) However you do the the Massachusetts math, the number of people without health insurance has dropped by at least 300,000 since 2006 — not the "about the same" that Perry airs in his column. So where does this leave Perry's statement? After we'd visited with officials elsewhere, a Perry aide told us by e-mail Monday that the governor's statement was "an error." Perry's office also sent us a new version of his Friday column that removes the Massachusetts claim while adding one that references Hawaii, which we're not reviewing in this article. But Perry's original column has already been widely circulated on the Internet, making a correction problematic. Perry's retraction does not change the ridiculous nature of his Massachusetts claim. We rate Perry's unamended statement — the one published in the Austin American-Statesman — as Pants on Fire.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-04-05T18:05:43	2010-04-02	['Massachusetts']

pomt-03175	"The House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-bill-clinton-continued-kosovo-/	Congress is about to debate whether the U.S. should act militarily in Syria in the wake of suspected usage of chemical weapons by the regime of Bashar Assad. After initially sending signals that the military might strike before waiting for approval by Congress, the Obama administration ultimately decided to ask for congressional approval. This set up the possibility that President Barack Obama might feel pressed to pursue military action even in the face of a congressional rejection. And because the NATO air campaign in Kosovo in the late 1990s proceeded along similar lines, the Kosovo experience quickly became a part of the discussion of Syria. On the Aug. 1, 2013, edition of Fox News Sunday, Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said, "The House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass. But he had bombing missions being carried in Kosovo after the House of Representatives voted against him taking action." King is a senior Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. Is King right that there is precedent for a president carrying out military action even after the House specifically voted against authorizing such action? First, some background. The Kosovo conflict erupted in the 1990s between two groups within the former Yugoslavia -- Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups have long disputed the territory known as Kosovo, and after greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Seeking to prevent casualties like those that had proliferated in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995, NATO -- the military alliance of the United States and western Europe -- edged in 1998 and 1999 toward action against the Serbs, who it viewed as the aggressors. NATO initiated airstrikes on March 24, 1999, a campaign that would continue for the better part of three months, until agreements were reached for Serb forces to withdraw, for the Kosovo Liberation Army to disarm and for refugees to return home. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence; 100 countries have recognized it, and it has joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. However, despite ongoing negotiations by the United Nations and other international officials, its final status remains unresolved. Did the House reject Clinton over Kosovo? During his second term as president, Clinton pressed Congress to authorize NATO military action in Kosovo. On March 23, 1999, the Senate, by a 58-41 vote, passed a non-binding authorization of force. The Senate resolution backed "military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)." That’s short of a declaration of war -- the method outlined in the Constitution -- but it is similar to what other presidents have sought, and usually received, from Congress in recent decades when they wish to pursue military efforts abroad. (In this article, we take a closer look at the differences between post-World War II declarations of war and authorizations for the use of military force.) The day after the Senate passed this resolution, NATO bombing commenced. But the House of Representatives did not vote on the Senate-passed resolution until more than a month later. On April 28, 1999, the House took up several pieces of legislation on Kosovo. By a 249-180 vote, the House prevented any Defense Department funds from being used on a ground campaign. Meanwhile, by a 139-290 vote, the House defeated an effort to remove U.S. armed forces from the Kosovo conflict. A more traditional declaration of war failed by an even larger margin -- 2 votes for, 427 against. But the most important legislation -- and the one directly relevant to judging King’s claim -- was the Senate resolution that authorized air and missile strikes against the Serbs. It failed the House in a rare tie vote, 213-213. The vote was a stinging rebuke to Clinton, and an embarrassment to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who backed a president from the opposite party. The defections were mixed -- 31 Republicans supported Clinton’s request while 26 Democrats voted against it. The New York Times, which called the debate "heated and sometimes anguished," reported that White House spokesman Jake Siewert brushed off the House vote. "The House today voted no on going forward, no on going back and they tied on standing still," Siewert said. "We will continue to prosecute the air campaign and to stop the violence being perpetrated by (Serb leader Slobodan) Milosevic." Indeed, NATO continued airstrikes the following day and for about two months after the failed House vote. Did the House eventually reverse course and authorize the campaign? By saying that "ultimately, a vote did pass," King suggested that the House did ultimately authorize force in Kosovo. But whether that’s true is not as settled as the first part of his claim. On May 20, 1999, the House passed an emergency appropriations bill that funded the Kosovo campaign. By funding military activities that were already under way, the spending bill can be seen as a way for Congress to tacitly back the Kosovo campaign, even though the bill did not explicitly use language that authorized the war. Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress watcher, said King phrased his statement broadly enough to be accurate. In addition, Ornstein said, it was a narrowly targeted emergency spending bill, rather than an "omnibus" bill funding potentially hundreds of programs. That suggested to him that it’s "a direct vote on continuing to bomb," he said. Other experts say "not so fast." The War Powers Resolution, passed in the wake of the Vietnam War, was intended to stop presidents from fighting wars without input from Congress. Under the War Powers Resolution, a president can initiate military action but must receive approval from Congress to continue the operation within 60 days. Presidents from both parties have regularly ignored the law, and Congress has often been reluctant to assert itself. But it remains on the books. As it happens, section 8(a)(1) of the resolution addresses the question of whether a spending bill constitutes authorization. It says, "Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall not be inferred … from any provision of law … including any provision contained in any appropriation Act, unless such provision specifically authorizes the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities … and stating that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of this joint resolution." That would suggest that approving spending does not equal authorization. But to make things even more complicated, there is some case law (particularly the 1973 case Mitchell v. Laird) suggesting that appropriations measures might be sufficient as to infer authorization, said Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. Our ruling King said that "the House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass." King is right that the House failed to pass an authorization for military action in Kosovo, and that Clinton continued to pursue the air campaign despite the legislative setback. However, it’s not a slam dunk that "ultimately, a vote did pass." The House did pass a spending bill covering the costs of the Kosovo campaign, but not an authorization along the lines of what is required by the War Powers Resolution. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Peter King	None	None	None	2013-09-04T13:58:32	2013-09-01	['Bill_Clinton', 'Kosovo']

pomt-03164	"We cut business taxes so today 70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-majority-businesses-are-exempt-bus/	Florida’s CEO-turned-governor has a big crush on businesses. Republican Gov. Rick Scott loves them so much that the majority don’t have to bother paying business taxes, he told a conservative crowd at the Americans for Prosperity Foundation conference in Orlando. Scott told the crowd that during his tenure the state has cut taxes five times (we noticed he pared down his claim quite a bit from earlier this summer when he said he cut taxes 24 times.) "We cut property taxes for homeowners and businesses. We cut business taxes so today 70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax. And we got rid of a sales tax on machinery and equipment so we will have more manufacturing jobs." Do nearly three-quarters of Florida businesses not pay a business tax? Corporate income tax exemptions grew under Scott PolitiFact Florida has been tracking Scott’s promise to eliminate the corporate income tax rate over seven years. The tax is paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Scott initially wanted the Legislature to reduce the corporate tax rate, but that didn’t work out. So he took a different route: relieving businesses of paying the tax by upping the amount of income exempt from the tax. In his first year, Scott lobbied to exempt the first $25,000 worth of taxable income, up from $5,000. In 2012, he got the Legislature to raise the exemption to $50,000. Scott wanted to then raise the exemption to $75,000 but the Legislature didn’t go along with it in 2013. We turned to Florida Department of Revenue data to show what percentage of businesses don’t pay corporate income taxes. There were 49,562 corporations in total and 38,060 would have been exempt from the tax -- or about 76.8 percent in 2011. The tax exemption for those businesses adds up to $12.6 million. That left 11,502 businesses that paid about $166 billion in corporate taxes. These numbers represent the 2011 tax year, filed in 2012. The exemption has increased since then, so the number of exempt corporations may be slightly different. We should note that many of these small businesses didn’t have to pay the corporate income tax before Scott’s tenure, too. Department of Revenue data shows of the 38,060 exempt businesses, about half earned less than $5,000 and therefore were exempt before Scott took office. We interviewed two experts about Scott’s claim: Kurt Wenner of Florida TaxWatch and Sam Staley, managing director of Florida State University’s DeVoe L. Moore Center, which aims to increase public understanding about the role of government in a market economy. Both Wenner and Staley pointed out that large businesses have always paid the lion’s share of the corporate taxes -- and continue to do so after Scott’s exemptions. (The large businesses get that exemption, too, but for them it means they don’t pay the tax on a small slice of their income.) "Small businesses don’t contribute that much to overall revenue," Staley said. Therefore, the state is "not losing that much by exempting them." However, even small businesses could be paying several other taxes or fees, such as property or sales taxes or in some cases, licensing fees. To assess a state’s business climate, "you have to look at an entire portfolio of taxes and regulations," Staley said. "Even if they don’t have to pay state corporate income tax, it might not be enough to compensate added costs of permitting at the local and county level," Staley said. Wenner said that anytime the state can reduce taxes it will increase Florida’s attractiveness for businesses. However, "Florida’s corporate income taxes have never really been that high." Our ruling Scott said "70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax." His general point was that during his tenure, he’s been cutting all sorts of taxes. State data for 2011 taxes shows that 76.8 percent of businesses don’t pay the corporate income tax due to the exemption. Scott is including some very small businesses here in his calculation and omitting that many of them were exempt from paying this tax before he took office. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06616	Says he did not support the October 2008 legislation to rescue Wall Street firms.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-never-was-2008-wall-street-resc/	Stumping for president in Newton, Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick Perry denied that he ever supported the 2008 legislation approved by Congress to rescue Wall Street. A recording of Perry’s Sept. 16, 2011, comments was placed online by Steve Deace, a radio host, who says on the recording that "our very own" Rebekah Maxwell asked Perry about his "past endorsement" of the "controversial (Troubled Asset Relief Program) bailout ... which a lot of people believe launched the Tea Party movement in America." Our transcript of the Maxwell-Perry exchange: Maxell: "One thing that I was wondering about was your earlier support for TARP and how that ... makes a difference?" Perry: "You got wrong information." Maxwell: "You never supported TARP?" Perry: "No, ma’am." Maxwell: "No. I thought I saw a letter where you had actually written encouraging the support of TARP legislation." Perry: "No, ma’am, you saw wrong." Did Perry never support the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which established TARP and allowed the bail out of Wall Street? Fortuitously, this covers turf we plowed in January 2010 in rating Half True a claim by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison that Perry was for the Wall Street bailout before he was against it. Hutchison said in a Texas gubernatorial debate that Perry signed a letter sent to members of Congress on the day the Senate was scheduled to vote on the bailout bill, urging lawmakers to "pass an economic recovery package." "You wrote a letter to Congress saying pass this bill, we need to shore up the financial markets," Hutchison said. "…Governor, you asked for it too. You were for it before you were against it." In the debate, Perry conceded that he co-wrote a letter with West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin. But, he said, he and Manchin "thought you were smart enough to understand what we were talking about--stop the spending and cut the taxes." "Governor," Hutchison replied, "that’s not what the letter said." "I wish we’d made it a little clearer for you," Perry said. Perry probably could have made it clearer for everybody. This much is certain: On the morning of Oct. 1, 2008, the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association publicized a three-paragraph letter signed by their respective chairmen, Perry and Manchin, stating: "We strongly urge Congress to leave partisanship at the door and pass an economic recovery package ... If Congress does not act soon, the situation will grow appreciably worse." The letter doesn’t explicitly endorse the plan then before the Senate. But no other plan was in play that day amid national fears of an economic collapse. And The Associated Press cast the governors' letter as part of a frantic national push for the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street sought by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and President George W. Bush. Later the same day, Perry issued a contradictory-sounding second statement, partly headlined: "On Protecting Taxpayers." "In a free market economy," Perry said, "government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America." Asked to clarify at the time what Perry wanted the Senate to do, his spokeswoman, Allison Castle, demurred. "The senators have to make their own decisions," Castle said. Asked in 2009 about Perry's dual messages, Perry spokesman Mark Miner saw nothing confusing. Miner said Perry simply favored tax and spending cuts over bailouts. "You call on Congress to take action, nine times out of 10, the action they take is wrong," Miner said. After the Republican gubernatorial debate, we sought out Manchin for his take on the letter. In a comment delivered by a spokesman, Manchin said: "You had to look at the situation our country was facing then. What we were urging was for Congress to work together in a bipartisan effort, and to follow the lead of the governors ... to move the states ahead. That effort continues today." At the time of the Senate action in 2008, Manchin said he supported his state's two Democratic senators, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, who voted for the Wall Street package. But he too sounded a contradictory note: "I do not support a bailout. Nobody supports bailing somebody out on the backs of working people … for someone to profit on Wall Street." All in all, it's easy to see the rationale for charging Perry with being for the legislation. The Manchin-Perry letter urged action on the very day the Senate was poised to take up the bailout package. Still, Perry is correct that the joint letter didn’t explicitly advocate the Senate plan. Also, his second Oct. 1, 2008, statement could be taken as a timely signal he didn’t want Congress to rescue Wall Street the way it did. We rate Perry’s claim Half True.

pomt-07558	Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/01/david-prosser/wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-david-prosser-says/	The candidates in the acrimonious race for Wisconsin Supreme Court have spent a considerable amount of time focusing on their experience and qualifications for the job. Justice David Prosser’s experience is pretty simple to understand. He has served a dozen years on the court and was Outagamie County district attorney for a couple of years. A Republican, Prosser also served 16 years in the state Assembly, and was speaker. The JoAnne Kloppenburg file is more difficult to evaluate: 21 years as an attorney in the state Department of Justice. That leaves plenty of room for interpretation -- by the candidate and her opponent. That’s what happened in a March 21, 2011, debate at the Marquette University Law School. Prosser told the audience that Kloppenburg "is incredibly envious" of his record as a district attorney, and his time as a lawmaker and justice. He said he had prosecuted cases that involved violent crime. "I’ve had victims of crime cry on my shoulder," Prosser said. He continued with this observation about Kloppenburg’s experience: "She has a very different record as a prosecutor. It’s all the prosecution of DNR regulations of docks … the length of docks. The width of docks. Whether people can have docks. That’s a complete different kind of prosecution that I am familiar with or have been writing cases about as well for 12 and a half years." That stopped us and undoubtedly many in the audience. More than two decades on cases hassling dock owners? Sounds like a lot of legal grunt work. It’s a claim that Prosser has made repeatedly on the campaign trail, and a theme that’s been picked up in ads from outside groups attacking Kloppenburg. We asked for backup. Prosser’s campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said in an email that state court records and other research tools showed 46 cases that involved Kloppenburg, 76 percent of which "were for the DNR." "Of the 46, five were directly identifiable with piers," he said. Fair enough. For a decade, Kloppenburg led the Department of Justice’s environmental litigation team. Docks would be in her wheelhouse. Kloppenburg opponents have seized on her record as a environmental lawyer, painting her as an extremist. On March 29, talk show host Charlie Sykes said: "If you are an environmental zealot, I do understand that JoAnne Kloppenburg is probably your candidate." Sykes added: "If you have a pier that’s a few feet too close … JoAnne Kloppenburg is your worst enemy." But let’s circle back to the support Prosser’s campaign provided. Of the 46 cases cited, only five dealt with docks. What about the rest? The Kloppenburg campaign gave us a list of 17 published decisions of cases that she argued before the state Appeals Court. The cases involved water and air pollution permits, a landfill dispute and the state’s authority over navigable waterways. Two involved the civil rights of state prison inmates, one involved the treatment of a prisoner. No dock cases were included. The campaign noted that over the years, Kloppenburg has argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts around the state, and numerous cases before the state Supreme Court -- including one in which a decision was handed down March 23, two days after the debate at Marquette. In that case, Kloppenburg represented the state in a lawsuit involving a dispute over a hearing for a water discharge permit for a paper mill in Green Bay. Environmentalists wanted a public hearing about the permit; the DNR did not. Kloppenburg represented the DNR and won the case -- with Prosser voting with the majority. While environmentalists were unhappy with the decision, business groups -- some of which are paying for ads attacking Kloppenburg’s legal credentials -- were pleased. She said her campaign was able to identify citations of 206 court cases dating back to 1989, and said few, if any, involved docks or piers. Other cases she’s handled in her career included those involving complaints from prisoners, the state’s part of lawsuits against big tobacco companies, Indian treaty rights and gaming compacts, and medical malpractice caps. She has had numerous cases involving well-known state and local companies, including Patrick Cudahy, Enbridge, Georgia Pacific, and a sunken barge in the Menomonee River. Kloppenburg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board that her job was to enforce the state’s environmental laws. When we asked Prosser directly to explain his comment, he said he was well aware Kloppenburg handled a much broader variety of cases for the Justice Department than docks. Indeed, a number of them were argued before him on the Supreme Court. "I’m certainly aware of the breadth of those cases," Prosser said, adding that his comments about docks were "a little rhetorical flourish." Prosser recalled a case about a July 2006 decision about a Green Lake subdivision that let homeowners have a fractional interest so they could have a boat slip on a nearby dock. The court ruled in favor of the DNR and forced the association to reduce the number of boat slips. Prosser also mentioned another case that was relayed to him in a private letter from a circuit court judge in northern Wisconsin. "Those are the two I was most familiar with," Prosser said. He added this about his dock comment: "I was really trying to inject a little bit of levity into this. I think the rhetorical flourish is easily justified in terms of these two cases." But that flies in the face of the reality of the campaign. As we noted, the dock cases have emerged as a line of attack against Kloppenburg from several fronts. What’s more, those in the audience didn’t offer a lot of chuckles during that portion of the debate. Former Journal Sentinel reporter Alan Borsuk, who now works for the Marquette Law School, blogged this about the event: "I’ve been at some testy and tense debates and joint appearances by candidates in various races, but this one was way up the list, if it wasn’t the champion on my personal list." Borsuk noted the exchange about experience and said Prosser touted his record "while slighting her record in environmental work with the attorney general’s office as involving ‘the length of (boat) docks.’" Let’s bring this ship to shore. Justice Prosser told a debate audience that his opponent’s work as a prosecutor was very limited and said she only handled cases involving the size and length of docks. But the record shows a much broader range of cases handled by Kloppenburg in her time at the Department of Justice. Indeed, Prosser later said he was well aware of the "breadth" of those cases. What’s more, Prosser brushed the claim off as a "rhetorical flourish" and an attempt at "levity." That would be more believable if people treated it that way at the time and if it didn’t match up with one of the major lines of attack from Kloppenburg critics in the campaign. At PolitiFact, a statement is False if it is not accurate. It’s not accurate to say that Kloppenburg’s has only handled dock cases. That’s a ridiculous claim -- from a justice who has heard her argue a variety of cases before him on the state’s high court. False plus ridiculous equals Pants on Fire.

pomt-04268	Says Jeb Bush "extended early voting" after seeing "long lines."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/08/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-jeb-bush-extended-early-voting/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist emerged as a prominent critic of Gov. Rick Scott’s decision not to extend early voting before the presidential election. Crist, a Republican-turned-independent who campaigned on behalf of President Barack Obama, joined Florida Democrats in asking Scott to give voters more time to cast early votes, citing long lines in Orlando and South Florida on Nov. 4, 2012, the last day of early voting. Scott declined to extend early voting to Sunday, a move Crist denounced as "unconscionable" given the hours-long wait times. In an interview with Miami-based CBS 4, Crist pointed to his decision as a Republican governor in 2008 to extend early voting, a move that irritated Republicans who thought (correctly) it would help Obama voters. "Got a lot of grief from Republicans, but you know, when you’re governor, you don’t just work for one party or the other, you work for the people of the state,’’ Crist said on Nov. 4, 2012. "I saw the long lines. I saw that it was still hot in South Florida, a lot of senior citizens were waiting in those lines. And I realized it was an emergency situation where people needed to have the opportunity to vote. "The same thing, or a similar thing, happened under Gov. Jeb Bush, and he extended early voting as well as governor," Crist said. We wondered if Bush really extended early voting during an emergency-like situation. Early voting Bush actually signed into law the statewide maximum of 14 days for early voting in 2004. Election supervisors said it was highly popular and asked the Legislature to expand early voting hours and add more locations. But Bush and the GOP-led Legislature went the other way the next year, passing a law that capped the number of hours for early voting and confined it to election offices, city halls and libraries. Early voting remained popular -- especially with Democrats. In 2011, the Legislature and Scott enacted a new law that reduced the maximum early voting days to eight days. Democrats in the Legislature said the law was designed to depress voter turnout among people in their party. The 2002 primary Things were going haywire in South Florida during the primary election on Sept. 10, 2002, the first statewide election since the infamous 2000 presidential recount. It was the election that determined Bill McBride, and not Janet Reno, would be the Democratic gubernatorial challenger for Bush. Some precincts in Broward and Miami-Dade counties opened hours after their scheduled 7 a.m. start. New, untested touch-screen voting machines malfunctioned. Some people walked away without casting a vote. Bush issued an executive order that called for polls to stay open two additional hours statewide. That meant the polls stayed open until 9 p.m. for most of the state and 10 p.m. for the Panhandle, which is in the Central Time Zone. Neither Bush nor his top elections official, Secretary of State Jim Smith, were pleased with having to make the call. "I frankly wonder what in the hell have they been doing for two years," Smith was quoted as saying about the South Florida elections officials in an Associated Press report. "I am hopeful that by November, at least they will be able to open the polls on a timely basis and the equipment will work." Bush ordered the extension "out of fairness," according to the Associated Press. "It's shameful. It's the responsibility of the supervisors of election to be prepared," Bush said. "The state put up money - significant sums of money - for training, for machines. ... There's no excuse for not having precinct workers in a precinct for voting, no excuse for not turning on the machines." In a phone interview with PolitiFact Florida, Crist said the point he was trying to make about Bush was that "the guy had a heart" amid chaos at the polls. "In a voting situation in Florida, when help was needed, he answered the call," Crist said. Charley and 2004 Flash-forward to 2004, when Floridians faced an onslaught of hurricanes. Hurricane Charley walloped Southwest and Central Florida on Aug. 13, just days before the start of early voting for the Aug. 31 primary election. Bush declared an elections emergency for 10 counties struck by Charley on Aug. 19, as the storm had ruined some voting equipment and made it difficult to locate and train poll workers. In a letter, Bush authorized the state’s top elections official to waive election law to delay the start of early voting and help counties hurt by the storm with logistics, according to an Orlando Sentinel report. Early voting had begun in all but three counties affected by Charley. "The letter gives counties that were affected by the hurricane and the secretary of state the flexibility they need to meet the needs of residents," Bush spokesman Jacob DiPietre told the Sentinel. "That could be combining precincts if a building was destroyed. It gives them the ability to move polling places and to waive certain deadlines and fees." To be clear, this does not count as an example of Bush extending early voting. He was allowing for greater flexibility in counties affected by Hurricane Charley. Our ruling In his attempt to portray Scott as more concerned about politics than voters, Crist argued that even Bush, a popular Republican, extended early voting as governor. Well, not exactly. In 2002, Bush extended regular voting by two hours because of malfunctioning voting machines -- not early voting. And in 2004, he gave supervisors a handful of counties more flexibility in starting early voting days after a devastating hurricane. It’s important to note that both events were primary elections. Crist made it sound like Bush issued early voting extensions during a presidential election, as Crist did, to accommodate large turn-out. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-15145	Says Scott Walker "brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/01/gwen-moore/scott-walker-didnt-fund-law-requiring-independent-/	In April 2014, Gov. Scott Walker signed a groundbreaking law, a decade in the making, that provides for this: Any time there is a death in Wisconsin and a police officer is involved, an outside agency -- not the officer's own department -- must conduct an investigation. News coverage suggested Walker was enthusiastically behind the bill. And since then, Walker on occasion, including at least once on the presidential campaign trail in New Hampshire, has made a point to say that the law he signed was the first of its kind in the nation. U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, offers a different view on the GOP governor and the law. While speaking to reporters in Milwaukee on Aug. 26, 2015, Moore was asked about a comment she made about Walker’s campaign for the White House. Two days earlier, in a teleconference with reporters, she had said Walker's policies are "tightening the noose, literally, around African-Americans." Moore told the Milwaukee reporters she might have chosen her words differently. But she defended her criticism of Walker’s policies, such as drug testing food stamps recipients, which she said hurt African-Americans. And regarding the law on officer-involved deaths, Moore said of Walker: "He brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it." The implication is that Walker signed the law, but hamstrung it by not allocating money to enforce it. As we’ll see, Walker initially did not provide extra funding for a state agency that does the bulk of reviews, but ultimately signed a state budget that provided the funding. Officer-involved deaths around U.S. Officer-involved deaths around the country, particularly since the August 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., have spurred a number of claims that have been checked by PolitiFact National. Among them: National Urban League CEO Marc Morial said "the number of killings of citizens by police" in the United States "is at a two-decade high." Our colleagues rated the statement Half True. There were many unknowns in the available data. Wisconsin’s investigation law was prompted in part by the 2004 fatal shooting 21-year-old Michael Bell by police in the Wisconsin-Illinois border city of Kenosha. Wisconsin’s law The law, which had Democratic and Republican co-sponsors, applies to deaths that result "directly from an action or an omission of a law enforcement officer while the law enforcement officer is on duty, or while the law enforcement officer is off duty but performing activities that are consistent with his or her law enforcement duties," according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. It says all police agencies must have a written policy regarding the investigation of officer-involved deaths, and that the policy must require a team of at least two investigators to conduct the review. The law does not specify that any particular state or local agency run the investigation. Once the investigation is complete, a report must be submitted to the district attorney in the county where the death occurred, for consideration of criminal charges. If no charges are filed, the investigation agency must release its report to the public. The funding Republican J.B. Van Hollen, who was the state attorney general when Walker signed the law, asked Walker to include money in the 2015-’17 state budget in order to implement the law. The request, for the Department of Justice, was for $738,600 for five positions -- three special agents and two analysts. Walker, however, did not include the any funding for the law as part of the budget he submitted to the Legislature in February 2015. The next month, as the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee reworked Walker’s budget, newly elected Attorney General Brad Schimel, also a Republican, renewed the funding request. "As a result of the new legislation, the DOJ has become the go-to investigative resource when there is an officer-involved critical incident in Wisconsin," Schimel told the committee. "Officer-involved death cases are very time-consuming. It is critical to public confidence in law enforcement that the investigations be conducted expeditiously and capably. In addition to the intensive work involved in conducting the investigations following an officer-involved death, the DOJ typically receives public records requests from parties. These requests require the careful review of reports, photographs, crime scene diagrams, audio and visual recordings and other multi-media prior to release." Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick responded at the time by saying that when the bill was adopted, the Department of Justice did not anticipate a fiscal impact, and the governor's office believed no additional resources would be needed. She cited a memo that had been issued by Walker's budget office a few months before the bill became law. "If DOJ feels as though additional funding is necessary to address these cases, we are willing to work with them and the state Legislature to ensure adequate funding," Patrick told the Capital Times. Two months later, in May 2015 -- with a state report showing DOJ had investigated 12 deaths in the less than a year since the law took effect, up from seven in 2013 -- the committee agreed to fund four of the five positions that were requested. So, although the law didn’t specify that the state Department of Justice investigate officer-involved deaths, as a practical matter it has become the agency doing them. The $635,000 allocation made by the Joint Finance Committee, for three agents and one analyst, ultimately became part of the two-year budget that Walker signed into law in July 2015. Our rating Moore said Walker "brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it." Walker has cited the fact that a law he signed was the first in the country to require independent investigations of deaths that involve police officers. And he did not include in his 2015-’17 budget proposal funds requested by the state Department of Justice for five positions to implement the law. However, three months later in the budget process, Walker signed a final budget that included money for four positions, which had been added to the spending plan by state lawmakers. So, ultimately, Walker did include some funding, although only after the Legislature included it in its version of the budget. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Moore a Mostly False.

pomt-14132	Says Donald Trump promised to repeal Obamacare, build a wall, ban Muslims, and more.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/05/hillary-clinton/clinton-video-lists-8-promises-trump-presidency/	Even before Donald Trump’s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, "Everything I say I’m going to do folks, I do." It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We’ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren’t actually promises. We did not hear back. ‘Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day’ At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. "I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases," Trump said. "My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones." The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, "I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools." Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. ‘Defund Planned Parenthood’ Trump’s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, "Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood," and then continued "but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood." Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. ‘Repeal Obamacare’ There doesn’t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says "On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare." ‘Build a great great wall’ Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn’t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish ‘a deportation force’ There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said "You’re going to have a deportation force. And you’re going to do it humanely." We couldn’t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn’t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, "Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States." Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, "We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out." Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn’t said if he would create a new deportation unit. While he might not be touting the same phrase, the result remains the same. ‘Ban Muslims from entering the country’ Immediately after the shootings by Muslim fundamentalists in San Bernardino in December 2015, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying, "Donald Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on." Within a few days, Trump said certain people would be exempted, including American citizens who are Muslim, foreign leaders, and athletes headed to competitions. However, according to the New York Times, within his first 100 days "the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place." That puts the ban firmly in the promise zone. ‘Kill the spouses and children of our enemies’ Trump said this during an interview on Fox and Friends, Dec. 2, 2015. "The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families," Trump said. In an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, Trump seemed to dial down this threat. O’Reilly asked him if he would have killed members of the bin Laden family. Trump said "I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer." Trump was pressed on this at the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. Asked how this policy would set the United States apart from ISIS, Trump said, "We have to be much tougher." Trump finished his answer with, "I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families’ lives." While this could be a death threat, it isn’t quite as clear as his original statement. Clearly, he wants to make family members suffer, but he doesn’t say how much. Restore waterboarding and ‘go further’ In the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary, Trump said, "I would bring back waterboarding and I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding." Trump stood by his waterboarding policy on March 22, 2016, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer he would "go further." Trump has also said that "torture works." The only caveat that Trump offered during his CNN interview is that he would listen to military officials’ advice on the use of interrogation methods. Whether a Trump administration would ever use waterboarding, he has promised to keep it on the table. Our ruling A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn’t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate.

pomt-05623	Says a study shows that children who live with a biological parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend "have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/25/glenn-grothman/gop-wisconsin-state-senator-says-study-shows-kids-/	The tasks of Wisconsin’s Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board include raising public awareness about the mistreatment of children. Under a bill introduced in February 2012 by state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, the board would be required to "emphasize non-marital parenthood as a contributing factor to child abuse and neglect." That’s a reference to homes where a child lives with a biological parent and the parent’s boyfriend or girlfriend. The "non-marital parenthood" focus of the bill attracted national news coverage from CNN and the Huffington Post. It also drew criticism from advocates of single parents such as liberal talk show host Alan Colmes. During his national Fox News radio program on March 2, 2012, Colmes asked Grothman to explain the bill. "We do have a child abuse and neglect board and their goal is to educate people on how to reduce abuse," Grothman replied. "Now the studies show that, if you are living with your two biological parents compared to with a biological parent and a boyfriend or girlfriend -- if you were with that boyfriend or girlfriend, you have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused." Grothman went on to say that "people certainly know there are single moms who are good parents and there are single moms who aren’t. But when the statistics show you’re 20 times greater -- in one type of family structure than another -- to cause a child to be a victim of sexual abuse, it’s something that ought to be out there." We decided to take a look at Grothman’s numbers. Grothman’s evidence Although he said "studies," Grothman made it clear to Colmes that the statistic he cited is from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study on child abuse and neglect published in January 2010. Mandated by Congress, the study "serves as the nation’s needs assessment on child abuse and neglect" and is the fourth in a series that dates back to the 1970s. The newest study surveyed child protective service agencies in a representative sample of 122 counties about abuse and neglect cases they investigated during a one-year period -- the second half of 2005 and the first half of 2006. The study also obtained information about children who were identified by professionals as having been abused or neglected but whose cases were not officially investigated. A major difference was found among perpetrators of different types of abuse. More than 70 percent of children who were physically or emotionally abused were abused by a biological parent, but only 36 percent of children who were sexually abused were sexually abused by a biological parent. As for Grothman’s claim, Grothman aide Lance Burri cited a chart in the study on the rate of sexual abuse in different types of households. The chart shows that children living with two married biological parents were sexually abused at a rate of 0.5 per 1,000 children, while the rate for children living with a single parent with a partner in the home was 9.9 per 1,000 children. That means the sexual abuse rate for children living with a single parent who has a partner in the home was 19.8 times higher than the rate for children living with biological parents who are married. So, by saying the rate is 20 times higher, Grothman is correct, a point we confirmed with the study's lead author, Andrea Sedlak. She noted that the study did not determine who the perpetrator was in the cases where children who were sexually abused were living with a parent and the parent's partner. We would also note that the sexual abuse rate wasn’t higher in all types of single-parent homes. The same chart Grothman cited shows the rate among children living with a single parent who had no cohabiting partner (2.4 per 1,000 children) was lower than that of children living with other married parents, such as a biological parent and a stepparent (4.3 per 1,000 children). Other viewpoints We asked Ken Taylor, executive director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Council on Children & Families, about Grothman’s claim. His group is one of three that lobbied against Grothman’s bill. Taylor said that while Grothman accurately quotes the study, a child living with a single parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend is only one of many risk factors associated with abuse and neglect generally. Others include poverty, an adult’s substance abuse or mental illness, and whether the adult was abused as a child, he said. The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which also opposed Grothman’s bill, testified at a hearing on the bill that promoting marriage over single parenthood could put children at greater risk if there is domestic violence in a home with married parents. Conversely, promoting the reduction of substance abuse among adults, for example, would have only a positive impact on child abuse and neglect, the coalition said. The Legislature didn’t act on Grothman’s bill before adjourning its session in March 2012. That means the bill would have to be re-introduced to be considered and Grothman hasn’t made a decision about doing that, his aide said. But the bill’s statement -- that "non-marital parenthood" is a "contributing factor to child abuse and neglect" -- is supported by the study. The overall rate of abuse and neglect was lowest in homes with married biological parents -- 6.8 per 1,000 children. It was highest for children living with one parent who had an unmarried partner in the household -- 57.2 per 1,000 children. That’s more than eight times higher than the rate in households with married biological parents. Our rating Grothman said a federal study shows that children who live with a biological parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend "have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused." Grothman accurately quotes the study, which found that the rate of sexual abuse among children who live with a biological parent and the parent's partner is 20 times higher than the rate for children who live with their married biological parents.

pomt-04516	Romney "would turn Medicare into a voucher program."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-wants-turn-medicare-voucher-prog/	President Barack Obama wasted little time deriding Mitt Romney’s Medicare plan as a "voucher program" while talking entitlements in the first presidential debate. "First of all, I think it's important for Gov. Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future," Obama said during the Oct. 3, 2012, debate at the University of Denver. "And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program." In the past, PolitiFact has found Obama’s "voucher" characterization reasonable, though as Obama noted, Republicans prefer "premium support." Merriam-Webster defines a voucher as "a written affidavit or authorization … a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school." The plan pushed by Romney’s running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, isn’t exactly a coupon, but it’s not so far off. Democrats have attacked Ryan’s Medicare reform ideas since he presented his first version in early 2011. Ryan has since tweaked his ideas, and Romney indicated in a summer interview that he agrees with Ryan’s most recent plan, which Ryan presented as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. Under the current system, the federal government pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services. That would end under the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan. Instead, beneficiaries would have the choice of receiving a fixed subsidy from the federal government that could go toward a private insurance plan or a plan similar to traditional Medicare. We should note the plan would only apply to people who are under 55 today, not current seniors. The private plans would comply with standards set by the federal government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based in part on the second least-expensive plan available on the health insurance exchange. We don’t know with certainty whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn’t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan’s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details. Some experts in health policy say there are marked differences between the terms "voucher" and "premium support." While there are technical differences that may matter to health-policy professionals, these are not the type of differences that most beneficiaries would see as significant. In recent years, the definitions of "premium support" and "vouchers" have become almost indistinguishable. Generally, we think "voucher program" is a fair way of describing to voters the vision for Medicare under a Romney-Ryan administration. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

Trump was asked by Fox Business moderator Neil Cavuto about his proposal to ban Syrian refugees and others from entering the United States. Trump rattled off incidents around the world, including in Indonesia and France, and said that migration could be a "great Trojan Horse." "When I looked at the migration, when I looked at the line … where are the women?" Trump said. "There look like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men. Young. And people are looking at that and saying, ‘What’s going on?’ " Trump made a similar claim in October. It was False then, and it’s False now. We asked Trump’s campaign for more information about his claim but did not hear back. However, there are two databases that track the movements of migrants in Europe and Syrian refugees. Neither supports his statement. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps spread over several nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to numbers as of Dec. 31, 2015, the total comes to more than 4.6 million. Of those 4.6 million, 50.7 percent are female and 51.8 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. So the majority of refugees are: 1. Women; 2. 17 or younger. In all, only 22.7 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the U.N. were men older than 18. Looking at the migrant crisis more broadly only slightly helps Trump’s case. The U.N. also tracks so-called "sea arrivals," refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The counts a little more than 1 million people who have crossed into Europe since the start of 2015, with almost 3,800 dying during the journey. The U.N. breaks those migrants into three categories: Adult men, 49 percent; Adult women, 19 percent; and children, 31 percent. Our ruling Trump said that among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe, "there look like very few women. Very few children." The data in no way supports that claim. The majority of more than 4.6 million Syrian refugees entering Europe are women and children 17 and younger. Of migrants arriving by sea -- about 1 million people -- 31 percent are children and 19 percent are women. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10999	"If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/12/paul-soglin/gubernatorial-candidate-paul-soglins-claim-about-g/	The most recent mass shooting, which killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in Annapolis, Md., reignited the gun control debate. The tragedy brought to mind a claim made earlier this year by Democratic gubernatorial candidate and Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. During a March 23, 2018, news conference, Soglin claimed: "The latest statistics demonstrated that if there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder." In light of recent events, we decided to examine Soglin’s claim. Guns and the risk of suicide, assault When asked to backup the claim, Soglin pointed to a January 2016 article in The Trace, a nonprofit news organization focused on gun issues, titled "A gun as a defense against terrorists? The stats say it’s more likely to harm your family." The article cites a statistic we came across frequently during our research -- household gun ownership triples the risk of suicide and doubles the risk of homicide. In addition, the article highlighted a study that found access to firearms increases the likelihood of assaults against family members and others to whom people are close, such as girlfriends or boyfriends, escalating to homicide. That 1992 study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found death was 12 times more likely if such assaults involved a firearm than if the assault did not involve a firearm. However, neither the study nor the article states that guns are 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or assault than they are for self defense. So, where did the number come from? Well, if Soglin added all of the numbers — three times the risk for suicide, two times the risk for homicide and 12 times more likely for a family and intimate assault to escalate to homicide — he would have gotten 17. But the numbers cannot be added together -- family and intimate assaults that escalate to homicide are already accounted for under homicides as whole. In addition, none of these numbers compare the use of a gun for self-defense with the risk of homicide or suicide, which was the focus of Soglin’s claim. The studies compare the risk of gun ownership to non ownership. Are there other studies that are on point? According to a 2014 analysis in the Annals of Medicine that examined 16 published studies, people in the United States with access to a firearm are three times more likely to die by suicide than those who do not have access, and are two times more likely to die by homicide. This study made no mention of family or intimate assaults, and did not make comparisons with self defense. We could not find any recent studies comparing how often guns are used for suicide and assault vs. how often they are used for self defense, but there is a 20-year-old study that comes close to corroborating Soglin’s claim. That 1998 study by A.L. Kellermann with the Emory University Center for Injury Control said for every time a gun is used in the home for self-defense or legally justifiable shootings, it is used four times in an unintentional shooting, seven times in a criminal assault or homicide and 11 times in an attempted or completed suicide. The study found a gun is 18 times more likely to be used in an attempted or completed suicide, homicide or assault than it is for self-defense. But some of these homicides may involve strangers and, therefore, it would not be entirely accurate to say this study supports Soglin’s claim about the danger to known victims. What’s more, gun laws, ownership and crime rates have changed since this study was completed, so its findings may be out of date. Finally, Soglin’s larger point about guns being used infrequently for self defense is generally accurate. A study done using federal crime and victimization statistics by the Violence Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based organization dedicated to stopping gun deaths and injuries, found that between 2007 and 2011, there were 29.6 million victims of an attempted or completed violent crime. Of those victims, 235,700 used a firearm as a form of self defense. That means about 0.8 percent of attempted or completed violent crimes involved a victim using a firearm as a form of self-defense. Our rating Soglin claimed "If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder." Soglin is on point in stating a gun is much more likely to be used for a suicide, assault or homicide than used in self-defense, but is on less solid ground when it comes to stating exactly how many times more likely. That depends on the study, many of which do not differentiate between known and unknown victims. What’s more, recent research is limited. Overall, we rate Soglin’s claim Half True.

pomt-06615	"Since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent and their tax rates go down 40 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/21/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-400-richest-taxpayers-saw-incom/	During a Sept. 20, 2011, interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sought to highlight how America’s richest taxpayers have benefited economically in recent years. "The top 400 earners in this country are worth more … than half of the American people," Boxer said. "And since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent and their tax rates go down 40 percent." We checked the first part -- that the top 400 tax payers saw their incomes grow by 400 percent -- in March 2010, giving it a rating of True. But the second half of her statement was new to us, so we decided to look into it. When Boxer made her comments, the question of how much the wealthy should pay in taxes was at the top of the national agenda. In remarks on Sept. 19, 2011 about his plan for reducing the federal debt, President Barack Obama said that "middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires. That’s pretty straightforward. It’s hard to argue against that. Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett." (Buffett is the legendary investor who for years has placed high on the list of richest Americans.) As we explored elsewhere, Obama is correct that it’s possible for a secretary to pay a higher tax rate than a very wealthy person, but it’s also not typical. In general, wealthier taxpayers do in fact pay a higher percentage in taxes than less-affluent people. The main exceptions are people in Buffett’s category -- the richest of the rich, whose income comes mainly from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at 15 percent rather than the maximum of 35 percent for wages and salaries, and hedge fund managers, who benefit from a tax code provision that also taxes their earnings at 15 percent. In her comment, Boxer explicitly focused on Buffett’s peers. Her data comes from a periodic Internal Revenue Service report that looks at the income and tax data from the 400 tax returns with the highest adjusted gross income. (In case you’re wondering, these 400 titans aren’t named, and their data is aggregated.) Technically, these aren’t "families" necessarily, but for a comment made during a television interview, we think it’s close enough. We’ll take Boxer’s two claims in order. The data we’re using, which goes back to 1992, is adjusted for inflation. "Since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent." In 1995, the aggregate adjusted gross income for all 400 tax returns worked out to $17.4 billion, or an average of $43.6 million per return. By 2008 -- the most recent year available -- the aggregate income for the top 400 soared to nearly $66 billion, or more than $164 million in adjusted gross income per return. That amounts to a 276 percent increase. If Boxer had been using data one year older, she would have been correct: Using 2007 data, the rise was almost exactly 400 percent. This illustrates how sensitive this measurement is to economic conditions. "Since 1995 the top 400 wealthiest families have seen … their tax rates go down 40 percent." From the same IRS document, we can see that the average tax rate for the top 400 returns was 29.93 percent in 1995 and 18.11 percent in 2008. That’s a decline of 39 percent -- for our purposes, close enough to Boxer’s claim to be accurate. Our ruling On the data, Boxer is right for one claim and wrong for the other, though on the one for which she’s incorrect, she would have been right using data from one year earlier. More broadly, even the smaller, 276 percent increase supports her underlying point -- that for the richest of the rich, incomes have grown by leaps and bounds while average tax rates have declined for the same group by 40 percent. As we’ve noted, extrapolating tax-burden patterns from the super-rich (like these 400 tax-paying units) to the merely very rich, the rich or the plain old affluent should be done with care. As the Congressional Budget Office has determined, the tax system is generally progressive, despite the lower tax rates for Buffett and his peers. The poorest one-fifth has an effective tax rate of 4.3 percent, the next fifth has a rate of 10.2 percent, the middle fifth has a rate of 14.2 percent, the second-highest has a rate of 17.6 percent, and the top fifth has a rate of 25.8 percent. And the rates keep going up the higher you climb. The top 10 percent of earners had an effective tax rate of 27.5 percent, the top 5 percent had a rate of 29 percent, and the top 1 percent had a rate of 31.2 percent. In other words, the top 400 have a distinctly different tax pattern than even the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers, a much larger group that includes about 1.1 million households with an average pre-tax income of $1.7 million. Still, Boxer chose her words carefully. She referred to the top 400 taxpayers, and by that standard, her numbers, while imperfect, largely stand up. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-02464	"Chained CPI would save $1 trillion in the second decade off the federal budget debt," a report shows.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/23/david-brooks/chained-cpi-and-what-it-means-federal-budget/	President Barack Obama has yet to formally roll out his 2014-15 budget, but it is already notable for one idea that won’t be in it. Something called chained CPI, or consumer price index, has become a flashpoint in the debate over the deficit and spending on entitlement programs. It is a technical shift that would affect everything from how much the government bumps up government payments to how it calculates the taxes we owe. Put simply, using chained CPI would save the government money (and cost you some money). The president included a version of chained CPI in last year’s budget. Excluding it this year avoids a fight within Democratic ranks over preserving the value of Social Security. The move caught the attention of the Sunday talk shows. David Gregory, host of NBC’s Meet the Press prodded his panel of analysts, saying both parties were in campaign mode. "Yes. And it's all bad for the country," said David Brooks, a columnist for the New York Times. "Chained CPI would save a trillion dollars in the second decade off the federal budget debt." We decided to take a closer look at Brooks’ figure. But first, a little bit about this thing called chained CPI. Seeking an accurate way to track inflation Chained CPI matters because so many bits and pieces of the government’s business are indexed to inflation. The list includes tax brackets, pension benefits, the cut-off point for tax credits, who’s eligible for food stamps, and most prominent of all, Social Security benefits. The aim of all this indexing is to keep everything in line with the actual cost of living. If a retiree has $100 to spend on groceries today, 15 years from now he or she should be able to buy the same amount of food even if prices went up. The problem is, economists generally agree that the way the government measures inflation today exaggerates inflation by a tiny bit. The technical problem is that as prices of some goods and services rise, people will change what they buy. Chained CPI adjusts for that. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analysts for Congress, calculated that chained CPI is about one-fourth of 1 percent less than the measure in place today. It hardly sounds like much but over time, the impact builds. Depending on how much you earned, when you retire and how long you live, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a group focused on preserving government programs for less affluent Americans, estimated it would reduce benefits by 1 to 2 percent over the course of the average retirement. Defenders of Social Security don’t like chained CPI because it reduces the amount of those monthly checks. Anti-tax groups don’t like it because shifting tax brackets would, bit by bit, increase people’s income tax bills. But from a deficit reduction perspective, chained CPI has plenty of fans. They often point to the CBO estimate that over 10 years, the change would reduce the accumulated deficit by $340 billion -- $216 billion in lower spending plus $124 billion in higher tax revenues. About half of that lower spending would come from Social Security. The source of the $1 trillion We tried to reach David Brooks to determine the source of his claim and we didn’t hear back. He did not get it from the CBO because that group has provided no estimate beyond 2023. (Brooks clearly spoke about savings taking place in the "second decade.") We found the $1 trillion figure in publications from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates for aggressive steps to cut deficits. In a fact sheet, the group wrote, "The chained CPI would reduce the deficit by over $1 trillion in the second decade." "I will caution that the estimate is not an official CBO cost estimate," Jason Peuquet, a research fellow at the committee, told us. Peuquet said the number was derived from several government sources including the CBO and the Social Security Administration. "So it is grounded in the best projections available." he said. But projecting so far out is perilous. CBO sometimes goes beyond a typical 10-year window, but it offers many caveats when it does. In a long-term projection for Social Security, for instance, CBO ran 500 different scenarios. It stood by the general direction of its conclusions but not the specific numbers. That said, the figure Brooks used might be close. Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, compared the $1 trillion to the CBO’s estimate for using the chained CPI across all government activities. "Under such a proposal, an estimate of $1 trillion for the second 10 years is probably in the ballpark," van de Water said. However, Van de Water underscored that there is a substantial difference between the across-the-board policy the CBO evaluated and what Obama had in his budget last year and is dropping this year. In 2013, the president exempted programs for low-income people and offered extra payments for Social Security recipients who had been on the rolls a long time. Van de Water said the total 10-year savings would have been about $100 billion less. When Brooks talked about the impact of the president’s new budget, he was not comparing it to the last one from the White House. "Brooks is roughly accurate about the theoretical savings but has somewhat overstated the savings from the proposal that the Administration actually put on the table," Van de Water said. Peuquet also offered one reminder. He said that Brooks would have done better to have spoken of reducing deficits -- the government’s yearly gap between what it spends and what it takes in -- rather than the nation’s debt, which is the accumulated money it owes to lenders. Our ruling Brooks said that using the chained CPI would reduce U.S. debt by $1 trillion in the period of 11 to 20 years from now. That number did not come from the Congressional Budget Office, the one government body that members of both parties count on for impartial long-term projections. Also, the chained CPI estimate Brooks cited goes beyond what Obama proposed last year. In 2013, the president exempted programs for low-income people and offered extra payments for Social Security recipients who had been on the rolls a long time. Those caveats would bring down the savings, no matter what the real number is. We rate Brooks’ statement Half True.	None	David Brooks	None	None	None	2014-02-23T18:22:53	2014-02-23	['None']
pomt-02014	"Only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/08/katrina-vanden-heuvel/vanden-heuvel-1-out-10-minimum-wage-workers-today-/	The city of Seattle refreshed the national debate on the minimum wage recently by approving a plan that will gradually hike its hourly minimum wage to $15. The move positions Seattle with the highest minimum wage in the country, almost $5 more than than the $10.10 level sought by President Barack Obama. ABC’s This Week spotlighted the decision in a June 8, 2014, segment pitting Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot against The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel. Gigot argued the proposal may have detrimental effects by pushing young earners with toes in the workforce out of low-wage jobs. Vanden Heuvel countered with a point that inverted popular understanding of who is affected by minimum wage policies. "Listen, this is smart economics, it’s good politics, and it’s morally right," she said. "First of all, only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person." PunditFact wanted to fact-check her talking point. What the numbers say We have unpacked similar claims over recent months. The notion that most minimum wage earners are young workers starting out their professional careers or teenagers working over the summer or to pay for college is not always cut and dried. A February Congressional Budget Office report says that "of the 5.5 million workers who earned within 25 cents of the minimum wage in 2013, three-quarters were at least 20 years old and two-fifths worked full time." But are just 10 percent of minimum wage earners young adults or teenagers? The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a reliable federal trove of employment data, is the most detailed source of information on federal minimum wage workers. But even its data isn’t complete because it focuses only on workers who earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. That does not account for workers in the 21 states and District of Columbia with higher minimum wage levels, from $7.50 in Missouri to $9.32 in Washington. Half of all workers live in states where the minimum wage is more than $7.25 an hour, according to the Congressional Budget Office report, which makes for a significant caveat. Still, according to the BLS, workers who are 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers who earn at or below the federal minimum wage. (Someone can earn less than the minimum wage thanks to exceptions in the law for vocational students, for example.) That’s a far cry from what vanden Heuvel said. A different study Vanden Heuvel told us she was trying to describe who would benefit from raising the minimum wage, and that the majority of those people would be older workers. That’s not what she said, but we’ve seen others make the same mistake -- including Obama. Vanden Heuvel appears to rely on data from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which supports increasing the minimum wage. The institute looked at workers who would benefit from increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, which would include everyone who makes less than that amount, not just those workers earning $7.25. The institute also factored in workers making up to $11.10 an hour currently, assuming that if workers below them would get a raise, they would as well, EPI report author David Cooper said in April. So what did EPI find? Among the people who EPI believes would get a raise, only 12.5 percent are less than 20 years old. Here’s a breakdown by age bracket: Age EPI (workers earning up to $11.10) 19 and under 12.5% 20-29 36.5% 30-39 16.6% 40-54 20.8% 55 and over 13.7% So that’s closer to one in 10, though it doesn’t factor in young adults in their 20s and it’s measuring workers who might benefit from raising the minimum wage -- not who is making the minimum wage today. "The number she is using is much more along the lines of who would get a raise, not who is today a minimum wage worker," said Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. The Congressional Budget Office report also looks at workers who would be affected by a hike in the minimum wage, using the same logic as EPI that some employees would indirectly see a pay increase to retain their spot in a company pecking order. CBO projected 12 percent of workers who would be paid $11.50 an hour or less by 2016 are teenagers (Table 2). CBO did not break down its data by more narrow age groups. Our ruling During a faceoff with a Wall Street Journal editor on ABC This Week, vanden Heuvel listed several reasons in favor of raising the minimum wage. "Only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person," she said. Her words described the current demographics of minimum wage workers, but that is not what’s reflected by the research we found. According to the BLS, workers who are 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers who earn at or below the federal minimum wage. Vanden Heuvel was wrongly describing a study of who would get a raise from increasing the minimum wage. According to the liberal Economic Policy Institute, teens would make up 12.5 percent of people who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $10.10. We rate her claim False.

A Dec. 21, 2016, headline on the website USA Snich read, "Pope Francis To Followers: ‘Koran And Holy Bible Are The Same’," claiming the pontiff said as much in an hourlong visit with Vatican visitors. The story said Francis told the guests that the religious teachings were equally valid, and that the time is ripe for "merging our faiths." Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts with PolitiFact and other fact-checking websites to debunk potentially fake news. To be clear, we can find no evidence Francis ever said such a thing, although the story persists on Facebook with links tracking back to a variety of websites. The post refers to the Monday prior to its publication, which would have been Dec. 19. Francis did speak to a group that day, telling Italian children to spend time with their grandparents. USA Snich is another website that appears to mix fake news and real events, sometimes posting stories that are entirely fabricated like this one. As its "source," it shared a non-working link to the website WashingtonPost.com.co. Websites with .co after a legitimate media outlet’s name often are associated with fake news, like ABCNews.com.co and NBC.com.co. We were able to track the original story to a 2015 post on NationalReport.net, which says in its disclaimer that it is "a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways." Like USA Snich, the story appears word-for-word on a variety of websites that share fake news, like CivicTribune.com and DailyNewsPosts.info.

pomt-02587	There is "more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly 20 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/28/barack-obama/state-union-obama-says-us-produces-more-oil-it-buy/	In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama noted the country’s progress toward energy independence. There is "more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly 20 years," he said. Later in the speech, he added, "The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades." Earlier in January, we fact-checked Obama’s same claim about domestic oil production after he spoke at North Carolina State University. We rated it True after PolitiFact dug into the U.S. oil numbers. Here’s what we had found: A White House spokesman offered up this White House blog post that explained Obama’s point in more detail. According to the White House, Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. "Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,"Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards. Our ruling Obama said the United States is producing more oil at home than its buying from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration.

pomt-06042	Mitt Romney is "tearing down his 3,000-square-foot house to build an 11,000-square-foot house."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/video-says-mitt-romney-planning-quadruple-size-his/	The 28-minute video "When Mitt Romney Came to Town" -- an attack on the Republican presidential candidate’s experiences with the private-equity firm Bain Capital -- claims that Romney is "tearing down his 3,000-square-foot house to build an 11,000-square-foot house." When the news came out last summer, it became something of a media sensation. Vanity Fair published a list of things that "could fit inside Mitt Romney’s new house," including a Memphis-area Enterprise-Rent-A-Car facility, Jennifer Aniston’s old house and "the world’s largest whale." But is the tale accurate? There’s a bit of disagreement over two issues -- the square footage involved, and whether the project is actually going forward. We’ll tackle those two issues individually. The dimensions of the "tear-down" project The home in question is located in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent oceanfront neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. A recent article by the San Diego Union-Tribune makes the Romneys’ immediate neighborhood sound positively dreamy. "The area’s winding lanes are lined with Tudor-style mansions, shingled California bungalows and cottages that could have been airlifted from the Cotswolds," the article said. (The Union-Tribune noted that Romney trails both President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee in donations from the 92037 ZIP code.) Mitt Romney and his wife Ann bought their property, located on what is described as a quiet cul-de-sac, in 2008 for $12 million; two years later, it was assessed at $8.7 million. The Union-Tribune reported that it was built in 1936 and has three bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths. It has a lawn that slopes down to a white sand beach. Columbia Journalism Review’s "The Audit" blog noted that the vast majority of the property’s value stems from its location, rather than its structure: "The county assessed the value of Romney’s house at $8.7 million last year," The Audit reported. "Eight million bucks of that value was in the land and just $750,000 was in the 3,000 square-foot house and other improvements." Will Carless, a staff writer with the Voice of San Diego who lives nearby and often surfs in the vicinity, said the expanse of the Romneys’ parcel is notable, with structures placed far enough back not to get hit by even the biggest swells. "Half his yard is ice plant," he said, referring to a non-native species of flora. "I’ve often looked up and thought it was such big waste of space." Apparently the Romneys did, too. The size of their family was also a factor. A campaign spokesman told the Chicago Tribune that the reason for nearly quadrupling the size was to make room for visits by the couple's five married sons and 16 grandchildren. When the Union-Tribune initially reported the proposed renovation on Aug. 21, 2011, it cited a permit application Romney had filed with the City of San Diego to bulldoze the existing, 3,009-square-foot, single-story home and replace it with a new, two-story, 11,062-square-foot structure. That’s the source of the information used in the Winning Our Future video. But that description has been contested by Romney himself, in an interview with New Hampshire Union Leader publisher Joseph W. McQuaid on Aug. 29, 2011. McQuaid wrote: "It's not accurate, Romney said, simply. The application he made, two years ago, was to double the living space by turning one story into two. The 'quadrupling'' was a measurement of added nonliving space, including a basement and garage." Granted, even doubling a home’s size is no trivial undertaking. Still, it’s not quadrupling. We wondered if Romney had a point that the description was overblown. So we asked the National Association of Realtors for what the standard practice would be for making such comparisons. "There's no national standard for measuring or reporting square footage," said Stephanie Singer, a spokeswoman for the real estate trade group. "Those rules are usually dictated by local zoning ordinances and/or state laws. So determining square footage can vary widely across the country. Some jurisdictions may include rooms like unfinished basements, for example, while others do not." She added that the association’s code of ethics does not directly address the question of disclosures about a home’s square footage. "The code does stipulate that Realtors shall be honest and truthful in their real estate communications," she said. "In the case of determining square footage, however, Realtors often rely on disclosures and information made by the sellers." Without solid guidance, we think it’s reasonable for the filmmakers to have used the numbers that Romney stipulated on the application itself. That makes this part of the film’s portrayal accurate. Is the tear-down going forward? The video’s phrasing suggests that the project is proceeding. But that’s not necessarily accurate. Dave Schwab, a reporter with the La Jolla Light newspaper, told PolitiFact that he bumped into a T-shirt-and-jean-clad Romney outside his house as Schwab was initially reporting the story of the tear-down last August. Romney was in a rush to leave town, but he told Schwab he would put him in touch with his staff for further information. Schwab recalled the staffer telling him in so many words that Romney is "running for president, and as soon as that ends, he will revisit the project." Interviews with Schwab and others confirmed that the project has not yet begun. In fact, we have not seen any reports that the project has even received official government approval yet. In a Jan. 2, 2012, article, the Union-Tribune reported that city officials described the plans as being "on hold." Other reports suggest that some of the neighbors aren’t wild about a large-scale expansion, though it’s unclear what role, if any, that could play in the approval process. One key step in the process involves an environmental review -- and a real estate agent who is representing nearby homes said that’s no piece of cake. "That’s nowhere near a rubber stamp of approval," said Craig Lotzof of the Lotzof Group. "Any time you build along the coast -- it doesn’t matter who you are -- you have lots of hoops to go through." So while there’s no sign that the Romneys have backed off their tear-down plan, it also isn’t imminent, and it still faces practical hurdles. So the video’s suggestion that a tear-down is under way or about to start is incorrect. Our ruling The video used a reasonable figure for dimensions of the "teardown" project -- even though the Romney campaign calls it a doubling of living space, the official application uses numbers that would amount to a quadrupling. But the video implied that the project is under way when in fact it’s not imminent. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-14128	Says Donald Trump "brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/may/06/ted-cruz/donald-trump-attacked-bringing-hundreds-foreign-wo/	Donald Trump has promised to be the "greatest jobs president that God ever created." But he’s also been attacked for his record of hiring foreign workers. A Ted Cruz ad that aired in Indiana attacked Trump’s use of temporary foreign visas known as the H-2B program: "Trump still brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans," stated the narrator. Cruz dropped out of the presidential race May 3 after losing Indiana, but we suspect Democrats will be happy to launch this same attack line at Trump in the months to come. So we decided to look into it. The bottom line: Trump did try to hire hundreds of foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, although it’s unclear just how many actually took jobs. The workers also weren’t necessarily replacing Americans, but filled temporary jobs locals allegedly couldn’t do or didn’t want. Mar-A-Lago foreign workers Trump’s Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach County is an oceanfront eating club designed for the 1 percenters. The club’s website describes itself as offering "an incomparable, royal lifestyle" in a historic 126-room mansion. It offers a beach and pool, a spa and fine dining for those who can afford the $100,000 initiation fee. The club’s director of human resources referred us to the campaign for this fact-check, and a campaign spokeswoman did not respond. The charge that Trump hires foreign workers revolves around the club seeking H-2B visas for low-skilled workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal — Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year — and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. Nationwide for both programs, the vast majority of the workers are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don’t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can’t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort, and unlike Americans, they may be reluctant to raise any complaints with their employers. Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don’t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. A spokesman for the State Department said that information is kept confidential. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they tried but couldn’t fill positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings. Four were hired, while 79 didn’t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren’t hired because they didn’t meet requirements. Some applicants didn’t want to work split shifts, or didn’t have enough experience. Many wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didn’t respond when the resort contacted them. One applicant said they only were applying as a prerequisite to continue getting unemployment. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. News reports suggested Mar-A-Lago did the bare minimum to meet legal requirements to try to recruit U.S. workers. For example, CNN wrote that job openings were placed in a local newspaper with small circulation for just two days rather than a larger newspaper. Nationally, while employers claim there are labor shortages in lower- and semi-skilled occupations, "there is no credible evidence that such labor shortages exist," wrote Daniel Costa, an immigration expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, in a paper in January. The New York Times asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions. "The only reason they wouldn’t get a callback is that they weren’t qualified, for some reason," Trump replied. "There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area." But some experts question Trump’s assessment that it’s hard to find local help. In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didn’t show much interest in using the free service. Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, about Trump’s foreign hiring practice.) Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server. "We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them," Veenstra said. "There has been nothing else since then." There are plenty of local applicants, said Greg Schell, an attorney in Palm Beach County who represents foreign workers. "The local job fairs for hotels and other hospitality jobs are overwhelmed with applicants," he said. Our ruling A Cruz ad says that Donald Trump "brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans." Federal labor records show Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not. Cruz makes it sound like foreign workers took jobs from Americans already in positions, but that’s not the case. It’s an ongoing debate whether there were qualified Americans who would have been willing to work the seasonal, part-time service jobs for which the club was hiring. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-01574	Says cuts to Medicare affect people who have already "paid in. We paid for it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/how-much-have-medicare-beneficiaries-paid-system/	The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently aired an ad in the hotly contested Iowa Senate race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. It features a woman named Darlene Blake of Des Moines, Iowa, talking about the importance of Medicare. "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare," Blake says. "That’s just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it. That should be there for us." In a separate fact-check, we looked at the claim that Braley "voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare." Here, we’ll look at the claim that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already "paid in. We paid for it." The ad has a point that Americans 65 and over have "paid in" to Medicare through the payroll taxes they’ve paid throughout their working lives. Currently, workers pay a 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare, while employers kick in an additional 1.45 percent. Self-employed people pay both parts of the tax. Meanwhile, starting in 2013, households earning $125,000 (or $200,000 or $250,000, depending on the number of people in the household and their tax-filing status) pay an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax. However, it’s not as if those payroll taxes are placed in an account for that beneficiary’s future use alone. Instead, the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by workers of all ages (combined with the proceeds of current beneficiaries’ Medicare premiums) foot the bill for the Medicare costs of today’s beneficiaries. And the way the math has worked out over the years, today’s beneficiaries have gotten far more back in Medicare spending than they put into the system through their tax payments. We discussed this topic in 2013, using statistics from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research institute in Washington. We’ll recap their findings here, updated with the most recent data. Institute researchers figured out what people turning 65 in various years have already "paid in" to the system and what they can expect to "take out" after they reach age 65. Because marital status and family income can significantly affect both the amount paid in and the amount paid out, the institute offers calculations for various types of family units. To make the final amounts comparable to what might have been done with the tax money had it been invested privately, the institute adjusted all dollar figures at 2 percentage points above the rate of inflation. (The authors note that different assumptions for long-term returns on investment would change the results.) We looked at the statistics for three "cohorts" of seniors -- those who turned 65 in 2000, 2005 and 2010. That means they’re 79, 74 and 69 years old today. We found that, for Medicare recipients, the "worst" deal for any of these demographic groups is still quite generous. A two-earner couple, with one high earner and one average earner, who both turned 65 in 2010 would have paid $158,000 in Medicare taxes over their lifetimes, but can be expected to be the recipient of $385,000 in Medicare spending. That’s a ratio of $2.40 in benefits for every dollar paid in taxes -- and that’s the least generous ratio we found. The highest such ratio we found was for one-earner couples in which the earner turned 65 in 2000 and was paid the average wage. Such a couple would have paid $39,000 in Medicare taxes but can expect to benefit from $306,000 -- a ratio of $7.80 in Medicare spending for every dollar the couple paid in taxes. So the ad’s claim -- that cutting Medicare is "just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it" -- is greatly exaggerated. For today’s typical Medicare beneficiary, what they paid into the system represents just 13 percent to 41 percent of what they can expect to get out of it. The rest is funded by younger Americans’ payroll taxes. The fact that taxes paid by active workers are supporting today’s generation of retirees is a big reason why some policymakers are concerned about the program’s long-term solvency. In 1950, the average American lived for 68 years and retirees were supported by 16 active workers. Now, the average life expectancy is 78 and just three workers support every retiree. By the time today’s middle-aged workers reach retirement age, only two workers will be around to support their benefits. Promised benefits will exceed revenues by about 30 percent, and there will be no money in the trust fund to rely on. "The problem with the quote from the ad is that it is numberless," said C. Eugene Steuerle, who helped assemble the Urban Institute’s calculations. " ‘We paid for it’ doesn’t say what we ‘paid’ nor what ‘it’ is, since the program expands constantly over time." Steuerle added, "We paid for our parents’ Medicare. There’s very little money sitting in the trust funds. The issue is what we think we should expect from our children, which requires consideration of the cost and the benefits." Our ruling The ad says that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already "paid in. We paid for it." While Americans have indeed "paid in" to Medicare, the amount that today’s beneficiaries have paid in only covers a fraction of their expected costs. The taxes paid by today’s typical beneficiaries will cover just 13 percent to 41 percent of what those beneficiaries can expect to get from Medicare during their lifetime. The rest of what has been "paid in" for their care has come from younger Americans. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11591	"Top CEOs (are) making 300 times the average worker."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/joe-kennedy/do-ceos-make-300-times-average-worker-joe-kennedy-/	During the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III bemoaned the seismic income gap between top executives and the average employee, even as he celebrated the current bullish economy. Emphasizing the need for greater economic fairness, Kennedy said workers should take home a larger share of corporate profits, relative to that of their bosses. "We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices," he said, "and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right." We wondered if the pay gap between top executives and the average employee was as wide as Kennedy claimed. What the numbers show As we’ve noted previously, the gap between CEOs and workers is vast, but there’s no standard formula for computing the figure, which means there’s room to quibble over the numbers. Results vary based on which corporations — and how many of them — are used in a study, and researchers use different definitions to define workers and stock options, and to compute salaries. At the high end is the AFL-CIO. The labor union’s analysis compared the 2016 compensation of CEOs of S&P 500 Index to those of production and nonsupervisory workers. It found top executives, on average, received $13.1 million in total compensation, while the average employee earned $37,632. That’s a ratio of 347 to 1. An analysis by the liberal Economic Policy Institute also produced a large disparity in pay, though relatively smaller than that of the AFL-CIO. The institute’s study of 2016 compensation used two different measurements, which varied in their treatment of executives’ stock options. The first measure assumed stock options were cashed in, and therefore were added to CEOs salary, bonuses and other payouts. Under that measure, CEO compensation was found to 271 times the average worker’s pay. Under the second measure, in which stock options were granted but not cashed in, the ratio was 224-to-1. Bloomberg analyzed 2017 income data and found CEOs made 265 times more than the income paid to average workers. Kennedy’s office did not reply to our request for comment. Our ruling Kennedy said, "Top CEOs (are) making 300 times the average worker." His numbers describing today’s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research. The AFL-CIO put the ratio at 347-to-1. The liberal Economic Policy Institute said CEOs make either 271 or 224 times that of average employees, depending on how you measure stock options. Bloomberg pegged the ratio at 265-to-1. We rate his claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joe Kennedy	None	None	None	2018-01-31T00:56:50	2018-01-30	['None']
pomt-09184	After the oil spill, Congressman Adam Putnam "doubled down saying all energy sources, including oil drilling in the Gulf, should be considered just days after the oil spill started."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/02/scott-maddox/maddox-says-putnam-double-downed-oil/	Scott Maddox, Democratic candidate for Florida commissioner of agriculture, is trying to portray his Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, as supporting oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico -- despite the recent oil spill. In an e-mail to his supporters, Maddox said: "While the oil slick has not yet made it to Florida’s shores, it gets closer and closer with every day that goes by. It’s nothing short of a ticking time bomb for our incredible beaches and tourism economy. "The Florida legislative leaders who pushed for oil drilling in state waters – as close as three miles from our beaches – have even backed off. But not Putnam. He doubled down saying all energy sources, including oil drilling in the Gulf, should be considered just days after the oil spill started." Maddox's campaign said the email was dated May 25, 2010, but the copy we received was May 27, 2010. Maddox, a former Tallahassee mayor, has been using the oil spill -- and his challenge to Putnam to permanently rule out increased drilling -- to draw attention to the race. Maddox's Tallahassee law firm is suing BP and Transocean, which managed the rig, on behalf of fisherman and seafood restaurants. Maddox spokesman Steve Vancore pointed to Putnam's efforts to broker a deal on oil drilling in 2006 as evidence that he's been supportive in the past. At that time, he proposed allowing drilling "as close as 50 miles from shore" and got 13 other Florida Republicans to sign along, leading to passage in the House, the St. Petersburg Times reported April 2, 2010. Putnam's campaign manager Trey McCarley didn't dispute that position but noted that the bill gave important power to the states. They could petition the federal government to allow drilling between 50 and 100 miles from the shore. But if not, a 125-mile ban would be in effect. To back up the new claim from Maddox, Vancore pointed us to an article in the Panama City News-Herald posted on April 24, 2010 -- four days after the rig collapsed -- to show Putnam's support for oil drilling. The article, about Putnam's visit to a paper mill and talk at a GOP dinner, said: "Putnam said he disagreed with Maddox’s anti-drilling mantra of 'No, baby, no' and that he thought all energy sources should be considered. 'The government should avoid picking winners and losers in exploring new energy,' he said. 'I have been generally supportive of opening up those areas, and specifically supportive of opening up those areas that are well off shore.'" Vancore told us in an email that's a "double down" because "Putnam not only restates his support of drilling but ups the ante by specifically restating his support of drilling in areas that are 'well off shore'. ... He matched his bet when he said he is generally supportive" of near shore drilling and doubled-down when he said 'specifically supportive' of all others. But in exploring Maddox's claim about Putnam, we find some sleight-of-hand in his timing. There is no dispute that Putnam had supported increased oil drilling in the past and continued to support it a few days days after the initial explosion. But the quotation that Maddox cites that shows Putnam's comment came four days after the accident, before the magnitude of the oil spill was truly known. A look back at the news coverage of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and an AP timeline shows that it took nearly a week after the April 20 rig collapse for it to be clear that a major spill had occurred. On April 23, one of the dominant stories was that the search had ended for the 11 missing workers. At that point, an oil sheen had been reported but no leak detected. In fact, the headline from one AP story on that day was: "Coast Guard: No oil leak from sunken rig off Louisiana." But officials feared "as much as 336,000 gallons of crude oil a day could be rising from the sea floor nearly 5,000 feet below." On April 24 -- the day that Putnam made his statement -- oil was found leaking from the well for the first time but the amount was unknown. Then, in an April 25 AP article, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said "This is a very serious spill, absolutely." By April 28, Coast Guard increased the estimates of the leak from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels of oil a day. By May 2, the large magnitude of the spill was clear. A Miami Herald article May 2 stated that Florida emergency managers "acknowledged Saturday that the state can't protect every stretch of coastline threatened by an uncontrolled undersea gusher spewing a massive oil slick that has spread across the Gulf of Mexico faster than expected." Gov. Charlie Crist warned that Florida could face a catasprophe. On May 3, Maddox held a press conference to attempt to "shame" Putnam into preventing expansion of drilling, according to a May 3, 2010 blurb in The Buzz, a blog of the St. Petersburg Times. "I think it's astounding that four days after the explosion Adam Putnam was reaffirming his position in favor of off-shore and near-shore oil drilling," Maddox said. "The most important thing is that we don't face this type of risk very close to our shores." Putnam's campaign replied the same day, according to the May 3 blog: "I am deeply concerned about the economic and ecological damage the oil spill is causing. Everyone from the president on down has correctly said we should have a thorough investigation of its causes and the lack of preparedness of the industry to respond to a disaster before proceeding with any new exploration." By then, Florida politicians were making an about-face on oil drilling -- including Putnam. In a May 3, 2010, statement on his web site he said: "I am deeply concerned about the economic and ecological damage the oil leak is causing. This is a national disaster. It is clear to every elected official, from the President on down that consideration of any new exploration closer to shore needs to be taken off the table and we need to have a thorough investigation into what happened and the inability of the industry to effectively respond." To recap: It's clear that Putnam had long supported an expansion of oil drilling before the spill. And he held the same position on April 24 when he was quoted by the Panama City newspaper.

pomt-02157	Says Attorney General Eric Holder recently revealed "this idea to have government have gun owners wear special bracelets that would identify you as a gun owner."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/01/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-eric-holder-wants-gun-owners-wear-id-b/	"Waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists" was not the only questionable thing Sarah Palin said during her recent speech to National Rifle Association enthusiasts. In stirring up concerns about gun rights, the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee turned conservative rabble-rouser misrepresented comments from Attorney General Eric Holder about investments in smart-gun technology. "Every day we are seeing more and more efforts to strip away our Second Amendment rights," Palin told the crowd. "They are trying," she said, before leading into her claim about Holder. "Recently, he reveals this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner," Palin said. "Well, hey, Holder, you don't want to go there, buddy." There is more to the story than Holder wanting gun owners to wear identifying bracelets. Holder’s comments on gun bracelets Holder uttered the words "guns" and "bracelet" before a House appropriations subcommittee on April 4, 2014, as he testified about his agency’s 2015 budget request. U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., asked Holder about requested grants to "encourage development of innovative gun safety technology." Holder explained the grant request stems from a White House-driven meeting amid talk of gun regulation reforms. "We talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear, how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession of the weapon. "It’s those kinds of things that I think we want to try to explore so that we can make sure that people have the ability to enjoy their Second Amendment rights, while at the same time decreasing the misuse of weapons that lead to the kinds of things that we see on a daily basis, you know, where people, kids especially, are struck down by ..." Harris cut him off, saying "sure, no one wants that to occur," and moved on. Holder’s comment about new gun technology was picked up a few days later in an April 7 Washington Free Beacon story under the headline, "Holder: We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets." From there, it was picked up by Fox News, InfoWars, Townhall.com and the National Rifle Association, among others. In each case, the coverage focused on the idea of "gun tracking bracelets." But the technology doesn’t track gun owners, and it doesn’t always require a bracelet. Smart guns and the Department of Justice Holder had smart guns on his mind because of President Barack Obama and reforms he sought after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. Obama directed Holder, via one of 23 executive orders, to release a report on gun safety technology "and challenge the private sector to develop innovative technologies." As he mentioned in his testimony, the department’s National Institute of Justice released a report in June 2013 assessing the marketplace, and Holder chaired a meeting with industry leaders and experts at the White House. Smart guns are also called "owner-authorized guns," "childproof guns" and "personalized guns." Basically, these are firearms made with electronic chips and sensors that can discern an authorized user from an unauthorized user. The gun will fire if it recognizes the owner and won’t if the owner is not recognized. Some high-tech models include a fingerprint reader that works kind of like the one in new iPhones (or James Bond’s personalized gun in Skyfall). Other models include the capability to read a radio signal from a transmitter embedded into a bracelet, ring, watch or pin worn by the gun owner, or even a chip implanted in the hand. "If that is within a certain programmed distance to the gun, the gun mechanically makes itself operable," said Stephen Teret, a smart-gun proponent, professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Law and the Public’s Health. "If it’s not within a certain distance, the gun won't work." So the short signals emitted in smart-gun technology do not function like GPS on mobile phones and other devices. The lack of GPS technology would prevent the government from identifying and tracking gun owners, should the government try, said Mike Bazinet, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm and ammunition trade group. Bazinet noted that doesn't mean the group isn't concerned about that prospect. The technology could require a bracelet. It could also require a watch, a ring, a pin, or even just a fingerprint, experts say. The point is there is no plan to identify gun owners with a "scarlet letter" bracelet. Origins and controversies Teret says the earliest smart gun was developed by Smith & Wesson in the 1880s. The manufacturer added a metal lever to the back of its handguns, requiring a person to press the the lever and the trigger at the same time to fire the weapon. A child’s hand would be too small to do that, thus preventing accidental injuries and deaths. Manufacturers started thinking about incorporating electronics into guns in the early 1990s to make them safer. The concept had support from the Bill Clinton administration, lost steam during the George W. Bush years, and then re-emerged after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings under Obama, Teret said. International companies, such as Armatix in Germany and TriggerSmart in Ireland, are ahead of the curve, thanks in part to less political resistance, Teret said. But there is technology emerging in the United States. Utah-based Kodiak Industries is offering the Intelligun, a fingerprint-locking system installed onto a 1911-style, .45 caliber pistol, for $399. This year, a California gun retailer told the Washington Post he planned to sell the Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol, an $1,800 product that works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun when worn by the right user. It was supposed to be the first smart gun sold in the United States, but the owner and Armatix representative received backlash from gun rights activists, and the plans were scrapped. Here’s what the iP1 looks like: It’s not the development of smart guns that concerns the firearms industry, Bazinet said. It’s government’s embrace of them. A New Jersey law, the only one of its kind, requires after three years from the first smart gun being sold in the United States that all new guns sold in the state be built with this technology. To Bazinet, smart guns won’t be ready for mass use until police forces are using them. His group has warned about defective guns and dead batteries while saying consumers should be able to buy them if they want. Of course, none of this information changes the veracity of Palin’s comments about ID bracelets for gun owners. It just shows how wrong she was. Emails to Palin’s political action committee were not returned. Our ruling According to Palin, Holder recently revealed "this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner." That’s far from the truth. Holder said he wants the federal government to explore gun safety measures, including smart-gun technology that would prevent weapons from being fired by anyone except their rightful owner. The comment in question came as he explained why his agency is seeking federal money for grants to spur research into safer guns. He listed fingerprint identification and the gun talking "to a bracelet or something that you might wear" as tools that could prevent a gun owner’s firearm from being used by someone else. Some smart guns are powered by bracelets with embedded radio signal transmitters, but that’s just one way this could work. The purpose of accessories worn in order to fire a smart gun is not to help the government track owners or identify them (again, Holder is pursuing no such policy). The goal of the emerging technology is to minimize shootings caused by suicides, children or stolen guns. We rate Palin’s claim False.

pomt-14390	Says when Bernie Sanders was in college, Sanders said "something very similar" to what conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley had written as a college student in the 1990s -- that "women have a legitimate role in date rape."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/17/bill-mccoshen/bernie-sanders-made-rape-comment-similar-one-wisco/	In this item, we see if what conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote years ago about date rape is similar to something Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders wrote years ago about rape fantasy. Yes, the 2016 campaign season has come to this. The claim we’re checking was made on March 11, 2016, at the end of a week in which Bradley was in the news for writings she did in college and for a case she handled as a private attorney. Bradley viewed the disclosures as aimed at boosting JoAnne Kloppenburg, a state appeals court judge and former Supreme Court candidate who is challenging Bradley in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election. The claim The claim we’re checking was made on "Here and Now," a Wisconsin Public Television public affairs program. There were two Madison-based guests: Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, which revealed Bradley’s college writings; and political consultant Bill McCoshen, a former Republican state official who said Bradley’s commentaries were written too long ago to be relevant. Ross said Bradley had written that "women have a legitimate role in date rape. I mean, these are ugly things to say. They're out of touch ..." McCoshen then interjected, saying: "By the way, that last comment -- Bernie Sanders said something very similar when he was in college, and he just won the Michigan Democratic primary. So, let’s have the same standard for all candidates for public office." Sanders’ comments about rape also were viewed by some as demeaning to women. It’s fair to say up front: Both Bradley’s and Sanders’ comments are open to interpretation. What Bradley wrote The 1992 student magazine column in question by Bradley (her maiden name was Grassl), who was 21 at the time, was an opinion piece against feminism, which she said "has adopted an agenda that no longer articulates the feelings of the average American woman; instead, it advocates the extremist platform of the issues advanced by the political left." The portion of the column highlighted by One Wisconsin Now referenced author Camille Paglia, a professor at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Bradley wrote that Paglia had been "prevented from speaking at several colleges" after Paglia "legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape." (In a column of her own published the previous year, Paglia had written: "A girl who lets herself get dead drunk at a fraternity party is a fool. A girl who goes upstairs alone with a brother at a fraternity party is an idiot. Feminists call this perspective ‘blaming the victim.’ I call it common sense.") Of Bradley’s column, One Wisconsin Now said: "It is abhorrent to blame the victim of a sexual assault, whatever the circumstances." So, in an anti-feminism column, Bradley stated that in her opinion, another writer "legitimately" suggested that women play a role in date rape. What Sanders wrote Sanders’ comments about rape were also in written in a newspaper column and also drew criticism -- although he made them at age 30, eight years after he graduated from the University of Chicago. The column generated news in the presidential campaign after it was referenced in a May 2015 profile about Sanders by the magazine Mother Jones. Sanders’ column was published in the Vermont Freeman alternative newspaper in 1972, the year he began running for public office. The column was about gender stereotypes and changing gender roles. But it started with what Sanders -- when the issue came up in the presidential campaign -- described as "bad fiction": "A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees. A woman tied up. A woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously …. Do you know why the newspapers with the articles like ‘Girl, 12, raped by 14 men’ sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?’’ New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser, who McCoshen cited to back his claim, wrote in June 2015 that the column "disgusted" her, adding: "Did Sanders confess that he finds real-life instances of sexual violence against children titillating?" So, in a column about changing gender roles, Sanders made reference to a woman fantasizing about being gang raped. Our rating McCoshen says that when Sanders was in college, he said "something very similar" to what Bradley had written -- that "women have a legitimate role in date rape." Bradley was in college when, in an anti-feminism column, she wrote that a professor had "legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape." Sanders was eight years out of college when he wrote in a column about gender roles: "A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously.’’ So, both Sanders and Bradley wrote about rape in ways that were offensive to some women, although their columns were about different and broader topics.

pomt-14260	Says Hillary Clinton voted "for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/10/bernie-sanders/clinton-voted-virtually-every-trade-agreement-kill/	The race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders heated up this week after a rhetorical spat over who was or wasn’t qualified to be president. It started when Clinton said Wednesday that Sanders "hadn’t done his homework and he’d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn’t really studied or understood." Responding to a Washington Post article that cast Clinton’s comments as questioning his qualifications, Sanders shot back, saying Clinton is the one who’s unqualified, upsetting Clinton’s supporters and former president-husband. The tiff leveled off Friday when Sanders took back his statement and said "of course" Clinton is qualified. But Sunday on Meet the Press, Sanders said his point all along was Clinton lacks good judgment. "Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs," he said, "when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water, and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country." There’s a lot to fact-check in this statement, but we were particularly curious about Sanders’ claim that Clinton supported "virtually every trade agreement." Sanders is exaggerating slightly, but he has a point that Clinton has been largely in favor of free trade. His claim that these deals have cost the country "millions of jobs" is up for debate. Clinton’s position on free trade Unlike Sanders’ two decades of consistent opposition to free trade agreement, Clinton has zigzagged through the years. "Some people are generally pro-trade or anti-trade. She’s case-by-case on trade," Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Washington Post last year. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Bill Clinton. "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal," she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History. As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She said yes to six and no to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and the deal with Andean countries. She skipped the votes on agreements with Jordan and Peru, which came up when she was running for president the first time, but supported both deals. Clinton explained her seemingly inconsistent positions in a 2005 speech to Congress: "The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward." While the deals with Chile, Australia and Singapore similarly excluded labor rights standards, Clinton said she "supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations." However, Clinton (as well as then Rep. Sanders) voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which expanded duty-free exports from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru and gave President George W. Bush "fast-track authority" to approve trade deals with South American countries. The Sanders campaign pointed out that Clinton supported normalizing trade relations with China while campaigning for Senate in 2000, and, once elected, she also voted for legislation that included an amendment granting Vietnam normalized trade status. (Sanders voted against both.) As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA "a mistake" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. "I support the trade agreement with Peru. It has very strong labor and environmental protections. This agreement makes meaningful progress on advancing workers’ rights, and also levels the playing field for American workers," she said in 2007. "The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement." As secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Employment impact unclear The debate over the impact of trade deals on employment has been waging for decades, and the jury is still out. On one side, unions and some left-leaning think tanks often link American job losses to expanded trade. Labor advocates opposed the Chile and Singapore agreements, which they said in a 2003 report would kill an unspecified number of jobs. The liberal Economic Policy Institute has found that NAFTA has cost the United States over 800,000 jobs and the South Korean deal about 60,000. In a 2014 report, the think tank reported that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China. Business groups, on the other hand, argue that trade deals actually boost employment. For example, a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs. Meanwhile, the U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times contend that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy. And in a recent fact-check, we found several nonpartisan reports demonstrating that NAFTA produced no significant job losses nor job gains. Analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected no net impact on employment from the Chile, Singapore and South Korea deals. Our ruling Sander said Clinton voted "for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs." Out of the 10 trade deals Clinton could have voted on, she voted in favor of six and against two. On two other deals (with Peru and Jordan), she didn’t vote but did vouch for them. As for Sanders’ point about subsequent job losses, independent research has shown the impact of NAFTA, for example, to not be significant one way or the other for jobs. Sanders’ claim is partially accurate and needs additional information. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-10T17:29:31	2016-04-10	['None']
pomt-03673	Says the U.S. fleet of attack submarines is scheduled to fall below the 48 boats that Navy says it needs to carry out current missions.	true	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/26/randy-forbes/forbes-says-us-attack-sub-fleet-will-fall-below-na/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, has never been shy about seeking money for the Navy. He represents a district that’s anchored in Hampton Roads, home to the world’s largest naval base and two of the nation’s busiest shipyards. In an April 9 op-ed, Forbes and Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., called for more funding to replace the nation’s aging fleet of attack submarines, or SSNs. The column appeared on AOL Defense, a website that describes itself as "the idea hub of the U.S. defense world." Forbes and Courtney wrote, "The Navy has stated it requires 48 SSNs to execute current missions, but given the current rates of replacement, the SSN force is scheduled to drop below the stated minimum in less than a decade." They wrote, "All Americans should be gravely concerned" by the loss of national security that will be caused by the diminution of the fleet. The attack subs, which cost about $2.6 billion apiece, are sent on a variety of missions, including intelligence, mine warfare, anti-submarine, anti-ship, small-scale special forces insertion and land target strikes. We decided to check their claim that the number of attack submarines is scheduled to fall below the Navy’s required level in less than a deacde. Forbes’ office referred us to two studies published in March by the Congressional Research Service and documents from the Department of Defense in 2010 and 2012. The Navy, since 2006, has said it needs 48 attack submarines to carry out its missions, according to a CRS report released March 27. So Forbes is right on that part of his claim. The Navy now has 55 attack subs, but these nuclear-powered vessels have about a 30-year lifespan. In a nutshell, the SSNs are scheduled to be retired during the next 22 years at a faster pace than the nation will replace them. The Navy’s long-range plan calls for scrapping about three submarines annually for a number of years and replacing them with one or two new subs. Forbes based his column on Navy projections released last year. They showed that the number of attack subs would sink below the 48-ship standard in 2022 and not resurface to that level until 2035. Forbes’ claim that the fleet would fall below the Navy’s stated need "in less than a decade" was based on the best information available at the time his op-ed was published. The Navy has since updated its 30-year projections to fit into the federal budget proposed by President Barack Obama on April 10. The Navy said its attack sub force wouldn’t fall under the 48-ship threshold until 2025 and would stay below that level for 10 years. The Navy would hit bottom in 2029, with 42 SSNs. Forbes, who is chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, has scheduled hearings on the Navy’s shipbuilding plan. He has urged Congress to ensure that at least two new attack subs are produced every year. The decline in the SSN fleet, Forbes says, particularly threatens U.S. intelligence and security operations in East Asia and the Western Pacific, where China is becoming increasingly dominant. Eric Wertheim, author of "Combat Fleets of the World" and an expert on global sea power, told us it’s hard assess the degree of threat the reduction of the SSN fleet poses to U.S. security. "What the Navy and military are trying to do is have a balanced force," he said. "They plan to respond and be ready for any kind of operation, whether it’s low-intensity, such as Libya, peacetime activities, like intelligence or a high-intensity operation, such as is possible with places like China." Wertheim said it doesn’t necessarily mean that the U.S. won’t be able to carry out missions with a reduced attack sub fleet but, in military planners’ minds, there are increased risks that it won’t be able to respond to all threats. "The question for them is what amount of risk are we willing to take," he said. "We don’t know what we’ll need until the future comes." Our ruling Forbes wrote that the nation’s fleet of attack submarines is scheduled, in less than a decade, to fall below the 48 boats the Navy says it needs to carry out current missions. The congressman accurately cited the best information that was available when his column was published on April 9. Since then, the Navy has issued new projections that say the fleet won’t fall below 48 SSNs until 2025. We don’t fault Forbes for not knowing information that wasn’t available at the time. We rate his statement True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2013-04-26T06:00:00	2013-04-09	['United_States']
pomt-01039	Mercedes-Benz USA moving its headquarters to Atlanta will create at least 800 jobs.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/26/nathan-deal/mercedes-move-will-create-jobs/	The 2014 governor’s race spotlighted two diametrically opposed facts about Georgia’s economy: Different groups ranked the state tops for business at the same time the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation. Georgia’s unemployment rate tumbled to 6.9 percent in December (from 7.2 percent in November), and in January, Mercedes-Benz USA announced it was moving its headquarters to metro Atlanta. Newly re-elected Gov. Nathan Deal touted the move in a press release as "creating at least 800 jobs" while repeating the state’s top-ranked business environment. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if that meant the move would create jobs to nudge the needle on Georgia’s unemployment rate – still stubbornly well above the national 5.6 unemployment rate. In other words, is moving jobs – in this case, from New Jersey – the same as creating them? First, it’s worth noting that the 800 figure comes from an incentive letter from the Georgia Department of Economic Development to Mercedes. The state is offering a package of grants, tax credits and "cost avoidances" worth $23.3 million. Mercedes-Benz USA CEO Steve Cannon has told several media outlets that the firm expects about 40 percent of its workers to relocate to Atlanta. Using the 800 figure, that means 320 people will move and the firm will need to hire for 480 jobs. So does that translate into "creating" 800 jobs? Absolutely, said state Economic Development Commissioner Chris Carr. After all, once the auto company sets up shop here this summer, there will be at least 800 jobs that today don’t exist. It’s a net increase of positions, and in an industry that has gradually shifted to the southeast for its manufacturing and office operations. "This puts Georgia high on the radar for the automotive industry and also for German companies," Carr said. "Whether a Georgian here or new Georgian, Georgians would not have that job except for the sake that Mercedes will move here." The qualifier of "at least" 800 jobs shows the state is looking at the tax credits as an investment, Carr said. "You have to play for the long game," he said. To an economist, the claim is accurate-ish. Once Mercedes moves here, the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics will show it as 800 jobs in Georgia. Those jobs will do the things economists study, like boost demand for housing and increase tax collections on the state and local level, said Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University. That said, it’s incorrect to imply the move means 800 jobs for current Georgians, Seaman said. "We should be happy, not euphoric. We could be euphoric if this was creating 800 opportunities for existing Georgians," he said. The distinction between those soon-to-be Georgians and the folks who already know the pain that is rush hour on the top-end Perimeter? The folks here are the ones paying the taxes that fund those incentives and might wonder what’s in it for them. Georgia’s generous incentives to the film industry answer the question. There was no doubt that most of the jobs tied, say, to Jennifer Lawrence’s first days filming in Bellwood Quarry, came from California. But Seaman said the state’s investment has also created a growing demand for Georgians who know how to do work in that industry, not to mention private-sector investments in sound stages and studios. "Over time, it is an investment that can pay off," Seaman said. "I think it’s a good thing for the state." The bottom line is, claiming Mercedes’ move will create 800 jobs is generally correct but lacking in context. If you’re an unemployed Georgian today, you likely have a shot at 480 Mercedes job openings, not 800. But there should still be 800 jobs, once it’s all said and done. And that alone could spur more work. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2015-01-26T00:00:00	2015-01-13	['United_States', 'Atlanta']
pomt-06043	"One year today since #GOP took control of the House" and "no new jobs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/13/frank-pallone-jr/frank-pallone-says-twitter-republicans-have-contro/	A Democratic congressman from New Jersey took a jab at his Republican colleagues to mark the one-year anniversary of GOP control in the House of Representatives. In exactly 140 characters, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) reminded his more than 5,000 Twitter followers last week of what one year of Republican rule has reaped. "One year today since #GOP took control of the House. One full year of obstruction & no new jobs. #WeCan’tWait. Get back to work no-show GOP!" Pallone’s Jan. 5 tweet said. No new jobs, really? Actually, the United States has added more than a million jobs in the last year. From December 2010 to December 2011, the country gained 1.64 million jobs, according to the most recent federal employment data. And there’s been job creation, month over month, for the past 15 months. We’re not crediting Congressional Republicans with that job growth. As we’ve noted before: there’s a variety of factors that contribute to job creation, and it’s difficult to nail down a specific catalyst. Still, to say there’s been "no new jobs" is clearly wrong. A written statement from the congressman’s office said, in part, that Pallone "tweeted a message decrying the consistent Republican inaction in Congress on moving a meaningful agenda to create jobs and address the unemployment crisis that has continued to plague our struggling economy. In the full year since Republicans have taken control of Congress, they have refused to propose any serious jobs plan to get Americans back to work." In response to a follow-up question that asked whether Pallone concedes the tweet wasn’t intended to say there’s actually been "no new jobs," the congressman’s spokesman wrote: "We stand by the statement issued earlier, which clearly states our position." "In the full year since Republicans have taken control of Congress, they have refused to propose any serious jobs plan to get Americans back to work," the statement said. "House Republicans have not only failed to make any progress on measures to create jobs, they have voted against Democrats’ job creation proposals 17 times." It’s worth noting that PolitiFact National checked a related statement made in Facebook posts that claimed Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but "zero on job creation." PolitiFact noted that what defines a job creation bill is up for significant debate. Still, they ruled the statement Pants on Fire largely because the methodology behind the figure also excluded President Barack Obama’s "American Jobs Act" as a "job creation" bill. Our ruling A tweet posted on Pallone’s account on Jan. 5 said it’s "one year today since #GOP took control of the House" and "no new jobs." A written statement from Pallone’s office said the tweet decried "consistent Republican inaction in Congress on moving a meaningful agenda to create jobs." But "no new jobs" isn’t the same as a "no new jobs agenda" and the U.S. gained 1.64 million of the former in the last year. Yes, there’s a limit of 140 characters on Twitter, but there’s still room for accuracy. We rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01412	Michelle Nunn ranks agriculture issues as the 18th most important items facing Georgia.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/10/david-perdue/perdues-agriculture-against-nunn-claim-base/	Candidate references to the family farm and toting watermelons are far more than folksy. Agriculture is Georgia’s top industry, pumping more than $71 billion a year into the state economy. In that context, talking farms is political calculus, especially in farm heavy Middle Georgia. That math was on display in its full glory at the state fair this week in Perry, where U.S. Senate hopefuls Michelle Nunn and David Perdue debated for the first time. "How do you justify to the farmers that in your list of priorities there are 17 items more important than the farmers in this state?" Perdue, the Republican asked his Democratic opponent. Nunn appeared confused by the question and called the claim untrue. "There is no plan that has that listed," Nunn said. Considering that the winner of the race will replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a former agriculture lawyer who spent his Congressional career on agriculture committees, PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into the facts behind the political theater. First, some background. Nunn and Perdue are both political novices who lay some claim to rural Georgia. Nunn spent the first six years of her life in Perry, before her father was elected to the U.S. Senate. The family still owns a farm in the area. Perdue also is a Middle Georgia native. An ad featuring his cousin, ex-Gov. Sonny Perdue, talks up that background and youth spent "pickin’ watermelons." Both candidates have met with the clout-wielding Georgia Farm Bureau, which does not endorse candidates. Both have said they will seek seats on the Senate agriculture committee if elected. Perdue’s television ads have long featured him wearing a jean jacket, walking in a rural field. His platform includes reducing regulations facing farmers, to help boost production. "I hope to bring fresh ideas that will help relieve burdensome regulations and ensure our local farmers succeed in growing a strong Georgia," Perdue said in an August press release. Perdue’s criticism against Nunn’s agriculture credentials is based on two pages out of 144 pages of Nunn campaign memos that were produced in December 2013 and leaked this summer. Starting on page 61 are several policy issues that call for background memos for the candidate and her staff to review. Listed in order of need for completion, agriculture ranks 18, after issues as varied as the budget and the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. "It is absolutely clear that’s how she ranks agriculture on her list of priorities on what to discuss," Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. The memo appears to contradict that interpretation, however. The document bolds the word "agriculture," a sign from the authors that the policy paper on the issue is either done or near completion. Policy papers on issues that are ranked higher in the memo, such as the budget, are not bolded and therefore still in process. Nunn spokesman Nathan Click said that’s because the issues were not listed in order of importance but as "topics the consultants want addressed." Click said Nunn made her commitment to agriculture clear when, within a week of announcing her candidacy in July 2013, she told reporters her goal was to serve on the Senate Agriculture and Armed Services committees. Her father, Sam Nunn, was chair of the armed service committee during his 24-year tenure in the Senate. Nunn’s seven-page jobs plan includes a call to expand partnerships between state universities and farmers among other priorities such as tax reform. "My family has a third generation farm in Perry, and we have grown and raised everything from pecans to peppers to pigs – if you count our farm pig, Maybeline," Nunn said during a visit to the Georgia Farm Bureau in February. "I understand how important our agriculture community is to our economy and our heritage as Georgians." So where does that leave us? It is accurate that agriculture is listed as 18 out of 22 policy memos that need completing, according to leaked internal campaign documents. But there is no evidence to support the idea that the list is a ranking of Nunn’s priorities. Perdue’s statement ignores critical facts and is misleading on its face. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08477	Shows in a television ad that police took evidence from Solantic, Rick Scott's new health care company, after allegations emerged that the company was engaging in fraud.	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/problems-rick-scotts-new-health-care-business-sola/	Democrat Alex Sink is airing a rare, two-minute campaign ad that tries to link Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott to alleged fraud at a urgent patient care business he founded in 2001, Solantic. The spot, called "Fraud Files," opens more like an introduction to a Dateline NBC episode than a campaign commercial, mixing a narrator's voice with short clips from TV. The first half of the ad deals with Scott's time running Columbia/HCA. The second half talks about Solantic, the company he built after resigning from Columbia/HCA. "In 2008, new allegations emerged that Solantic was also engaging in multiple forms of fraud," the narrator says over visuals of flapping yellow sheriff's police tape, a detective in a suit taking notes and men in police T-shirts carrying boxes out of a building. The ad essentially is blending together two fraud allegations. The first is a 2008 lawsuit filed by Dr. P. Mark Glencross. Glencross alleged that Solantic improperly used his medical license in 2004 when the company filed paperwork saying each clinic had a medical director in charge. Scott was deposed during the case -- Scott has declined to release that deposition. The two-year-old case was settled within a month of Scott's deposition and both parties signed a confidentiality agreement. The second stems from allegations by another former Solantic physician, Dr. Randy Prokes. During the gubernatorial primary, Prokes sent an e-mail to Bill McCollum's Republican campaign for governor claiming that Solantic billed Medicare at full rates for patients seen by a nurse practitioner, when federal rules require that billing be at 85 percent of the fee paid for physician examinations. The McCollum campaign passed the letter on to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The FDLE then sent the letter on to the inspector general’s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That's where the letter sits today. The Department of Health and Human Services has not said whether it's investigating Prokes' claims. The claims of fraud are real, but suggesting through images that police raided or seized records from Solantic is entirely misleading. Ads are about both the visuals and the words campaigns choose. In this case, the Democratic Party is inflating the allegations against Solantic by including video of sheriff's tape and police collecting evidence. There have been no reports that we could find of police raiding a Solantic facility, and the Democratic Party, when asked, could provide no evidence of any such search. As such, we rate this claim False.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-10-12T17:34:34	2010-10-10	['None']
pomt-13551	Chicago Public Schools "lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school system," "match the United States of America in kids graduating high school going on to a four-year college," and are "producing eighth-grade leaders in the country in math gains, fourth-grade leaders in reading gains."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2016/aug/25/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-scores-well-cps-test/	In June, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner called some Chicago Public Schools "crumbling prisons," and then five-year-old emails from when he was in private business revealed he’d also called principals "managerially incompetent" and half its teachers "virtually illiterate." Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could not let the moment pass, even as he said he was accepting Rauner’s apology for the remarks. At a press event after Rauner’s email comments were released, Emanuel used the opportunity to boast about CPS students’ achievements. "Well, let me tell you what the [Chicago Public Schools] ‘crumbling prisons’ with wardens as principals and guards as teachers have done. They lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school system…They now match the United States of America in kids graduating high school going on to a four-year college...That same prison with that same warden and that same security guard is also producing eighth-grade leaders in the country in math gains, fourth-grade leaders in reading gains." That’s a lot to study, so we decided to do our homework. Testing the claims Lauren Huffman, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office, noted Emanuel often repeats those claims, citing statistics from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP calls itself the largest, continuing organization that tests students in a variety of subjects. It is under the umbrella of the National Center for Education Statistics run by the federal education department. We were able to verify the mayor’s claims about eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading by examining "The Nation’s Report Card" for 2016 and the Trial Urban District Assessment published by the NAEP, and by interviewing Grady Wilburn, a statistician with the National Center for Education Statistics. Wilburn said Chicago’s fourth-grade reading score had improved 15 points since 2003, the second-highest improvement behind Washington, D.C., which improved 26 points. Since 2013, Chicago improved 7 percentage points and tied for first place with Washington, Cleveland and Boston. While the chart shows numerically that D.C. is higher, it does not account for statistical significance. Wilburn said when districts are tested for statistical significance, Washington, Cleveland and Chicago are not different from each other. Significance testing considers sampling error associated with only assessing a portion of students, not all of them. In eighth-grade reading, Wilburn said scores show Emanuel’s statement to be accurate. Since 2003, he said, eighth-grade CPS math scores have improved 20 percentage points. They are statistically tied for highest gains since 2003. They’re tied with Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles. If you look just at 2013-15, Chicago’s scores went up 6 percentage points, and that is the biggest gain. Of the 21 urban districts monitored, CPS students were the only ones to improve in eighth-grade math from 2013 to 2015. Passing or surpassing? Emanuel made two other claims about Chicago Public School students. One of the claims was that they now match the nation in kids graduating high school and going on to a four-year college. The Chicago Consortium on School Research at the University of Chicago published a new study in June that examined high school graduation, college enrollment and bachelor’s degree attainment rates. Chicago Public Schools’ "four-year college enrollment rate for 2014 is 42 percent, two percentage points lower than the national rate, and half of CPS graduates who enroll in four-year colleges will graduate in six years," a summary of the report says. Two percentage points lower than the nation in college enrollment would indicate Emanuel’s statement is slightly off, but it is clear CPS graduation rates, college enrollment and degree attainment have been rising significantly. In 2006, the graduation and college enrollment rate was eight percent. In nine years, by 2015, that rate had doubled to 16 percent. Emanuel’s other claim, that CPS leads the nation among urban districts for high school graduation, was more difficult to verify. The National Center for Education Statistics put the adjusted cohort graduation rate at 82 percent for 2013-14. Jenny Nagaoka, deputy director of the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research and an author of the study of CPS college attainment, said the CPS rate for the same year is 74 percent, but she cautioned the two institutions might rely on districts that calculate rates differently. Unlike reading and math scores, there doesn’t appear to be a comparison of urban district graduation rates. In 2012, she said CPS was "probably in the middle of the pack" nationally. "On the basis of this, I can’t conclusively say this is a true or false statement," she said. "CPS is certainly higher than Baltimore. We may be higher than New York. CPS is certainly higher than many. Chicago has made great gains. We’ve really closed the gap compared to the national rate and that’s important." Chicago’s improvement in graduation rate comes at a time when, nationally the rate also has been climbing. "It is a big accomplishment to improve the gap when the national rate also is improving," Nagaoka said. Our ruling Emanuel’s boasts about reading and math scores compared to other urban districts were accurate. His statement about going on to four-year college was a bit off, but probably not statistically significant. We could not find data to conclusively verify that CPS leads urban districts nationwide in its graduation rate, but it has made dramatic improvement. A similar study from the consortium concludes, "While changes in student demographics account for some of the increase in graduation rates, improvements in student performance in high school — compared to similar students who started high school in the past — accounts for most of the change; students are passing more classes and earning more credits in ninth grade. Not only are more students graduating, but they are leaving high school with higher achievement than graduates in prior years. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63a534ae-e972-481b-a873-1a398ba7c69f	None	Rahm Emanuel	None	None	None	2016-08-25T19:07:16	2016-07-26	['United_States', 'Chicago_Public_Schools']
pomt-10993	"Bob Hall never successfully passed a bill."	false	/texas/statements/2018/jul/12/kendall-scudder/kendall-scudder-says-bob-hall-hasnt-passed-bill-la/	A North Texas Democrat nominated for the Texas Senate told a Dallas crowd that the incumbent, Bob Hall of Edgewood, has an empty legislative record. Kendall Scudder of Sulphur Springs said at a July 2, 2018, event noted by the Dallas Morning News: "None of you should be surprised to find out that Bob Hall never successfully passed a bill before. And we're going to keep it that way." Hall, a businessman who joined the Senate’s ruling Republicans in 2015, told the newspaper: "I'm not one to try to get my name in lights when it comes to passing bills. I see myself as part of a team." Still, has Hall not advanced any of his own measures into law? Records show a Hall proposal advancing into law Before reaching Scudder, we gauged Hall’s record by searching the Texas Legislature Online website maintained by the Texas Legislative Council. Our searches for proposals authored by Hall that Gov. Greg Abbott signed or let into law showed one such accomplishment. In the 2017 regular session, the Hall-authored Senate Bill 102, clarifying position titles in the Texas National Guard, made it through the Senate and House and was signed into law on June 1, 2017. Hall said in a June 2017 statement of intent filed with the proposal that lawmakers previously created new general officer positions within the Texas National Guard but the federal government didn’t recognize or fund the position titles. "This bill would clarify these new general officer titles and duties to allow for proper recognition and funding," Hall said. Hall otherwise authored 52 proposals in 2015 and 69 more in 2017, records indicate. Put another way, about 1 percent of his authored legislation made it into law. Yet that rate doesn't capture Hall's full legislative record. In the regular sessions and a summer 2017 special session, records show, Hall co-sponsored measures offered by others--some of which passed into law. In 2015, Hall was a co-sponsor of seven House bills that passed into law and in 2017, Hall co-sponsored three House measures in the regular session that made it into law and three House proposals that passed into law after action in the special session. Scudder, responding by email, told us his point in Dallas was that Hall hasn’t been effective. "I was specifically referring to Sen. Hall's inability to pass legislation benefiting his district as a primary author (in short stump speeches, it can be difficult to specifically outline the intricacies of legislative processes)," Scudder wrote. Our ruling Scudder said Hall has never passed a bill. Hall's had scant success ushering his own measures into law. Still, he authored a 2017 proposal clarifying Texas National Guard titles that passed into law. He's separately cosponsored other proposals now in statute. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14716	By the end of 2015, more than 1,300 people will have died on Georgia roads. One of out evey four fatalities resulted from drunken driving.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/dec/30/state-public-service-announcement/state-correct-traffic-deaths-are-2015/	More than 1,300 people have died on Georgia roads this year, and 25 percent of the deaths are the result of drunken driving. Those claims headline a public service announcement airing statewide on television and radio in this season of merriment and cheer. "Watch your speed. Put down the phone, and don’t get behind the wheel if you’ve been drinking," Gov. Nathan Deal warns listeners. For months, state officials have been alert to an unwelcome change: After falling annually for nine straight years, Georgia’s traffic deaths were up this year. But have more than 1,300 people really died this year on Georgia roads? And have 25 percent — or one out of four of those deaths — been caused by drunken driving, as the public service announcement says? PolitiFact Georgia decided to rev up the Truth-O-Meter. Figures compiled by the state Department of Transportation and released through the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety show traffic deaths in Georgia fell each year from 2005 to 2014, going from 1,729 to 1,170, even as U.S. census estimates show the state added about 1 million residents. Georgia roadway deaths for 2015 hit 1,345 as of Monday of this week. That's up 186, or 16 percent, from 2014, and it’s still a few days until we turn the calendar to 2016. According to state data, the 1,345 included six people killed in car-train collisions, 192 pedestrians, 138 motorcyclists and 21 bicyclists. The largest number of traffic deaths occurred on state and local roads, 675 and 485, respectively. But deaths on interstates — often the most visible because of the gridlock that follows — are up 21 percent, from 153 in 2014 to 185 so far this year. But were 25 percent of this year's fatalities alcohol-related? The answer: That could well be the case, but officials don’t know that with absolute certainty. Harris Blackwood, the director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, said his agency has certified data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showing that 297 of Georgia’s 1,179 fatalities two years ago, or 25 percent, involved alcohol blood content of 0.08, the legal limit. Smaller amounts of alcohol — 0.01 percent or higher — were found in 30 percent, or 349, of those fatalities in 2013, Blackwood said. Part of the reason they don’t know for certain about the role of alcohol in 2015 traffic deaths is it can take months to obtain blood test results from the GBI crime lab, he said. "However, there are indicators, such as open containers, information provided by other passengers, and so on," Blackwood said. "The percentage of alcohol as a factor has been consistent on a percentage basis over a 10-year period, even as fatalities were going down prior to this year," he said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website gives an extensive five-year view of fatal crashes in Georgia and the nation — including the role alcohol plays. Between 2010 and 2014, alcohol-impaired driving was a factor in 24 percent to 25 percent of all fatal accidents each year. The one exception was 2011, when the percentage dropped to 22 percent. Nationally, 30 percent to 31 percent of all fatalities in those same five years involved alcohol-impaired drivers (those with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or above), according to the NHTSA data. Blackwood said the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety also did a preliminary analysis early this year and found no evidence that "the alcohol percentage is going down" from prior years. In the first nine months of 2015, there were 483 instances where an officer requested an alcohol test or a driver refused an alcohol test, he said. (We should note that some law enforcement agencies consider it standard protocol to request a blood alcohol test in fatal traffic accidents.) Our ruling A public service announcement says more than 1,300 people will die on Georgia roads before the end of the year. By Monday of this week, the number was 1,345, according to a tally kept by the Georgia Department of Transportation and released by the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety. The PSA also makes the claim that one in four of those people died in alcohol-impaired fatalities. The truth is that state officials don’t know for certain what’s happened in these traffic deaths. It takes time to investigate. They’re basing the claim on a trend they’ve seen and one that doesn’t seem to be changing in Georgia or the nation. That’s probably context the reader deserves to know.

pomt-01421	Muslim nations did not "call out" the people who celebrated the 9/11 attacks.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/08/bill-oreilly/oreilly-no-muslim-government-called-out-those-who-/	Bill Maher, cable show host and ardent atheist, ignited a cable television free-for-all when he said the Muslim world has "too much in common with ISIS." ISIS, of course, is one of the names for the forces of the Islamic State group which has engaged in beheadings and mass executions with ghastly regularity. Liberals have been critical of Maher for, they say, making sweeping generalizations of Muslims. Conservatives, meanwhile, have come to Maher’s defense. On Fox News, host Bill O’Reilly delivered one of his Talking Points commentaries on the question of whether Islam is a destructive force in the world. To a significant degree, O’Reilly answered in the affirmative. Among his reasons -- the governments of Muslim-majority nations have "failed to confront Islamic terrorism (and) have not attacked violence in the name of Allah." O’Reilly then played video that featured Palestinian youngsters jumping and smiling as news spread of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "Thousands of Muslims, regular folks, celebrated in the streets," O’Reilly said. "They were happy that more than 3,000 innocent people, including Muslims, were murdered. Again, these people are a minority but they were not called out in any official way by Muslim nations around the world." O’Reilly is correct that public demonstrations in support of the 9/11 attacks took place. They largely occurred in the Palestinian territories, although we also found reports of one in Egypt. Middle East specialist Peter Mandaville, associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University, recalls them as "small scale and localized." But our fact-check is focused on the question of whether Muslim nations repudiated the celebrations. "There was a report of (the) Palestinian Authority information minister at the time, Yaseer Abed Rabbo, appealing to Palestinians to not show happiness in response to the attacks, but no specific condemnation that I know of," Mandaville said. We found a couple of compilations of Muslim reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. In addition to Mandaville, we contacted several researchers who study the Middle East. We found no instance when the government of a Muslim-majority nation chastised or condemned the people who were elated by the toppling of the World Trade towers and the other deadly events of that day. What we did find were many official condemnations of the attacks themselves. King Abdullah II of Jordan said, "What these people stand for is completely against all the principles that Arab Muslims believe in." The day after the attacks, Abdelouahed Belkeziz, Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued a statement saying he was "denouncing and condemning those criminal and brutal acts that ran counter to all covenants, humanitarian values and divine religions foremost among which was Islam." The Organization of the Islamic Conference (now called the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) represents all of the Muslim nations in the Middle East and worldwide. The group later issued a joint statement that spoke to "the necessity of tracking down the perpetrators of these acts in the light of the results of investigations and bringing them to justice to inflict on them the penalty they deserve." The League of Arab States said much the same thing, as did Islamic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and other countries. From Syria, Yemen, Pakistan and other nations, over 40 clerics and Islamic-oriented party leaders -- many with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that advocates for Sharia law -- signed a statement on Sept. 12, 2011, saying, "We condemn, in the strongest terms, the incidents which are against all human and Islamic norms. This is grounded in the Noble Laws of Islam which forbid all forms of attacks on innocents." So while it’s true that governments did not speak out against the jubilant Palestinians, there was broad rejection of the attacks from officials and top religious leaders. Nathan Brown, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, raised the possibility that the street celebrations loomed larger in America than elsewhere. "I remember them being reported in U.S. media since they seemed so outrageous," Brown said. "But I do not know if they got any domestic attention in the countries where they were reported in U.S. media to have occurred. For instance, I remember Palestinian media reporting the blood donation made by Yasser Arafat but not anything about Palestinian celebrations." Arafat had a photo-op with him donating blood to help the survivors of the 9/11 attacks, although later reports questioned whether he actually did. We did find several accounts of the Palestinian authorities attempting to seize video of the demonstrations, which could speak to how the events might have played in the region. Dubai-based Media Watch Middle East is a private firm that tracks the activities of news organizations throughout the region. We asked them to look for coverage of the celebrations. They reported that an "extensive search" of their database turned up nothing. Apart from official reaction, average Muslims attended candlelight vigils and other public events to voice sympathy for the victims and to repudiate the attacks. We found photos from Iran and Bangladesh. These demonstrations stand in sharp contrast to the video from the Palestinian territories. Our ruling O’Reilly said that Muslim nations did not "call out" the people who celebrated the 9/11 attacks. So far as we can tell, there was no official condemnation of people celebrating the 9/11 attacks. However, Muslim governments, and religious leaders, condemned the attacks themselves, as did many average Muslims. O’Reilly’s statement is accurate as far as it goes, but it leaves out important information that might lead someone to reach a different conclusion. That meets our definition of Half True.

pomt-13003	"House Democrats strike to implement Sharia law!!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/14/blog-posting/websites-revive-claim-house-democrats-strike-impos/	Several websites continue to insist without a shred of evidence that Democrats in the U.S. House have attempted to enact Sharia law, the religious guidelines of Islam. "THIS IS TREASON!!" exclaimed one headline we saw on Dec. 12, 2016. "House DEMOCRATS STRIKE To IMPLEMENT SHARIA LAW!!" A Dec. 12 Facebook post linked to an undated story that referred to a third outlet going back to December 2015. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com First of all, there was no strike, either as a work stoppage or an attack. The citations refer to the Dec. 17, 2015, introduction of HR 569, which sought to support Muslim-Americans and denounce hate crimes and persecution. One story we found online said the resolution "threatens to restrict our right to even report facts that tarnish Islam’s reputation, a law that all Sharia-governed countries already have in place." Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation. PolitiFact has checked a string of complaints about efforts to institute Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States — most recently by retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the potential future national security adviser of President-elect Donald Trump. But the resolution, introduced by U.S. Rep. Donald Beyer of Virginia, did not seek to institute Sharia law, or any law, for that matter. The resolution was non-binding, meaning it did not have the effect of law, and was introduced to address an upswing in anti-Muslim sentiment. HR 569 has 145 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats. Some online stories distorted what the bill would do by saying it "will serve as a test by which further criminalizing of ‘Islamophobia’ may be introduced" and single out only Muslims as worthy of special protection. Some websites said the resolution would equate hate speech with violence, and that would potentially alter constitutional rights. But HR 569 "declares that the civil rights and civil liberties of all United States citizens, including Muslims in the United States, should be protected and preserved." The resolution denounces "the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim." It also "steadfastly confirms its dedication to the rights and dignity of all its citizens of all faiths, beliefs, and cultures." There’s no threat of new legal reprisal for intolerance against Muslims, only that Congress would officially disapprove of such behavior. The aim was for Congress to show support for "the inalienable right of every citizen to live without fear and intimidation, and to practice their freedom of faith." The resolution was referred to committee. With no Republican co-sponsors in the GOP-controlled House, it likely will not see any further action. Our ruling Bloggers said, "House Democrats strike to implement Sharia law!!" There was no kind of strike. Instead, the stories referred to a non-binding resolution introduced in December 2015 that sought to affirm congressional support for Muslim-Americans facing hate crimes and persecution. It did not have the effect of law or mention Sharia law, but rather aimed to send a message that anti-Muslim sentiment would not be tolerated by members of the U.S. House. The resolution has not received any Republican support and is likely dead. Wanting Congress to officially condemn hate speech and persecution is not the same as seeking to institute Sharia law.

pomt-09154	"Across the country, more than half of the U.S. attorney seats remain without a prosecutor chosen by Obama."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/10/thomas-melsheimer/dallas-lawyers-say-cornyn-among-republicans-keepin/	Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn draws fire in a recently published opinion piece pointing out that the four chief federal prosecutor positions in Texas have yet to be filled by lawyers of Democratic President Barack Obama's choosing. Two Democrats, Dallas lawyer Thomas Melsheimer and Craig Smith, a state district judge, said in an op-ed article in Monday's Austin American-Statesman that Cornyn's insistence on holding sway over the U.S. attorney appointments in Texas has kept them from happening. "Obama should be allowed to select a competent nominee of his choice without Cornyn's blessing on the front end," they write. Other Senate Republicans are similarly thwarting the president, they suggest. "Across the country," they write, "more than half of the U.S. attorney seats remain without a prosecutor chosen by Obama." Really? We reached Melsheimer, who said he based the less-than-half claim on information provided by the interim U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, James T. Jacks. We couldn't reach Jacks, but Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, told us Obama appointees have been confirmed as U.S. attorneys for 51 of the nation's 93 districts. A U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary web page lists the U.S. attorneys nominated by Obama and confirmed by the Senate. Fifty-one of 93 equals 55 percent, not "less than half." According to the Senate committee list, the last time that Obama appointees occupied less than half the U.S. attorney slots was early May. His 47th U.S. attorney nominee was confirmed with others May 5; three more nominees were confirmed May 25, nearly two weeks before the oped was published. Still, we wondered if there's a legitimate beef with Cornyn, who serves on the judiciary committee, and if it matters when the leadership posts are filled by civil-service lawyers instead of presidential appointees. Some perspective: Traditionally, the U.S. attorney posts turn over with each change in president. Though nationally, a handful of the top prosecutors appointed by President George W. Bush remain in place, the Bush appointees in Texas are gone, replaced by career Department of Justice lawyers considered temporary holders of the plum posts pending the arrival of Obama's choices. Cornyn said Wednesday he's falsely accused of blocking nominees and that the president has been slow to put names forward. Generally, he said, "we're working in good faith together to try to fill as many of these vacancies as we can." It's the Senate's role to confirm each president's nominees. For judicial-related appointments, Cornyn and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, rely on their own advisory committee to guide them on who to recommend the president name to federal judgeships and U.S. attorney posts in Texas. Last year, the committee was expanded to include Democratic-leaning lawyers. But the White House earlier said it would not choose anyone without a sign-off from the state's Democratic House members, who have elected as their chair U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin. In a March 2009 statement, the White House said Cornyn and Hutchison "will be accorded a full opportunity to share their views about each candidate whom the president proposes to nominate." But the statement also said: "No federal judge, U.S. attorney or U.S. marshal will be nominated by the president, however, unless that person has the confirmed support of the Texas Democratic delegation." Doggett said this week that a tradition hearkening to Republican Ronald Reagan's presidency grants appointment sway to House members from the president's party in states lacking members of the president's party in the Senate. The House Democrats have recommended various Texans to Obama for federal judgeships, U.S. marshal positions and each U.S. attorney slot. With competing groups seeking to be the clearinghouse for nominees, the situation seems ripe for standoffs. One element: House Democrats favor one candidate to be U.S. attorney for the state's Dallas-based Northern District, while Cornyn and Hutchison have aligned behind another. Meanwhile, the president's only announced choice for a U.S. attorney post in Texas, nominated in February, withdrew in April, telling a Beaumont TV station he'd decided to remain a state district judge, indicating impatience with the process. "There is no timetable for a decision on the nomination," the station quoted John Stevens, the nominee, saying. "It's just sitting there. It seems like there ought to be a quicker method." Far as we can tell, the White House has not spoken out lately about its Texas appointments. This week, an Obama spokesman didn't immediately have a comment. Doggett noted that besides the lack of Obama's U.S. attorney appointees in Texas, seven Texas judicial posts wait to be filled. Doggett said Cornyn has played a delaying role, though the White House shares blame. "As long as the White House doesn't put a high priority on (filling the openings), the (GOP) senators are only encouraged to be obstructive," Doggett said. UPDATE, 2:38 p.m. June 11, 2010: After we posted this article, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich told us that Obama, in consultation with state congressional delegations, has nominated a steady stream of candidates for U.S. attorney posts "at a pace similar to that of previous administrations." He said that through June 9, Obama had nominated 72 individuals as U.S. attorneys, with 51 confirmed by the Senate and two having withdrawn. Bush had made 83 nominations by the same point in his first term, with 75 confirmed and two having withdrawn. And at the same point of his first term, President Bill Clinton had nominated 83 U.S. attorneys with 81 confirmed. Nobody we queried had objections to staff lawyers filling in as U.S. attorneys until the political appointments are made. Does the delay make a difference? It matters, Doggett said, because a presidential appointee can be counted on to carry out administration priorities. "If a U.S. attorney has consistently under the Bush administration ignored violations concerning polluting our waterways and oceans," Doggett said, "and somebody under the Obama administration thinks it's time to give that attention and prioritize, that's a good example of why it makes a difference." Attorney Richard Roper, Bush's appointed U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas through 2008, agreed, saying political appointees -- "somebody on the president's team and the attorney general's team" help make sure "all priorities of the attorney general are being carried out." As for the lawyers' statement, it misses the mark: Obama choices were confirmed for more than half the nation's U.S. attorney slots as of early May. Yet it's not off by much. Obama still doesn't have appointees in place in nearly half the posts. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Thomas Melsheimer	None	None	None	2010-06-10T00:00:00	2010-06-07	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06528	"Every month, another 50,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turn 18 and become eligible to vote."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/07/ruben-navarrette-jr/pundit-says-50000-hispanic-citizens-turn-18-and-be/	In an opinion column, California-based pundit Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Republicans risk offending Latino citizens with broadsides about immigrants. "Every month, another 50,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turn 18 and become eligible to vote," Navarrette said in his column posted online Sept. 28, 2011, and published in the next day’s Austin American-Statesman. "The GOP had better hope these folks have short memories and don't hold grudges toward those who tried to turn their parents into scapegoats." Setting aside Navarrette’s judgment, we wondered about his figure. By email, the columnist said the 50,000-a-month count was researched by the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington group that says it seeks to improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation. Navarrette pointed out a September 2008 news article in the Arizona Republic quoting Mark Hugo Lopez, the center’s associate director, saying: "About 50,000 Latinos a month turn 18 (in the United States) and are eligible to vote for the first time." In an interview, Lopez told us he reached the 50,000 count by dividing by 12 the number of U.S.-born Hispanics recorded as turning 18 in the 2009 American Community Survey undertaken by the U.S. Census Bureau. He forwarded his table indicating that in 2009, 659,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turned 18, or nearly 55,000 a month. From 2000 through 2009, Lopez calculated, an average of 500,500 U.S.-born Hispanics annually turned 18, or nearly 42,000 a month over the 10 years. And what of other population groups? According to the center’s table, some 2.7 million U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites turned 18 in 2009, for a pace of 225,000 a month, and 755,000 U.S.-born non-Hispanic blacks turned 18, nearly 63,000 a month. Compared to Hispanics that year, then, more blacks and four times as many white citizens turned 18 every month. And over the 10 years, the chart indicates, an average of nearly 214,000 whites and nearly 51,000 blacks turned 18 every month. In an interview, Lopez said he put the 50,000-a-month figure in a January 2011 center report on Latinos and congressional reapportionment. The report says that while Hispanics accounted for about 51 percent of the nation’s population growth from 2000 through 2009, not all of that growth translated to immediate electoral strength. To date, Latinos often do not vote in numbers reflecting their share of the population. Then again, the Pew report says, many Latinos are too young to vote or are not U.S. citizens. "Among the nation’s 48.4 million Hispanics in 2009, a record 20.1 million are eligible to vote," the report says. "Yet an even greater number are not eligible to vote. Some 15.5 million Hispanics are U.S. citizens 17 years of age or younger and 12.8 million of all ages are not U.S. citizens. Even so, the number of the Latinos eligible to vote continues to grow. Since 2000, nearly 6 million more Latinos have become eligible to vote. The bulk of this growth was attributable to the 5 million U.S.-born Latino youths nationwide who turned 18 during this past decade. That translates into an additional half-million U.S.-born Latinos coming of age each year — a pattern that is certain to persist, and grow, in the coming decades." The Pew Hispanic Center elaborated on the bulge in U.S.-born Latinos under 18 in an April 2011 report stating that Latino electoral participation reached a national high in 2010, though Latinos still do not turn out in numbers equal to their share of the U.S. population. In 2010, the report says, 16.3 percent of the nation's population was Latino, but only 10.1 percent of eligible voters and fewer than 7 percent of voters were Latino. "This gap is driven by two demographic factors — youth and non-citizenship," the report says. "More than one third of Latinos (34.9 percent) are younger than the voting age of 18. And an additional 22.4 percent are of voting age, but are not U.S. citizens. As a result, the share of the Latino population eligible to vote is smaller than it is among any other group. Just 42.7 percent of the nation's Latino population is eligible to vote, while more than three-in-four (77.7 percent) of whites, two-thirds of blacks (67.2 percent) and more than half of Asians (52.8 percent) are eligible to vote." So, how does Navarrette’s claim stand? The 50,000-a-month count is about right. Regardless, it’s a tad misleading to showcase that figure for Latino Americans when both the number of black and Anglo citizens reaching voting age is, for now, even greater.

pomt-01232	Says Jonathan Gruber was "some adviser who never worked on our staff."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/19/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mit-professor-jonathan-gruber-wa/	Even overseas, President Barack Obama couldn’t escape questions about a domestic controversy surrounding the health care law. Footage emerged last week of Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist, claiming more than a year ago that the "stupidity of the American voter" and a "lack of transparency" were key to passing the Affordable Care Act. Why is that of interest? Because Gruber played a role in helping to write and pass the health care law. Obama, however, downplayed Gruber’s involvement while speaking at the G20 summit in Australia. A reporter asked Obama about Gruber’s remarks. Obama replied, "I just heard about this. I get well briefed before I come out here. The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is no reflection on the actual process that was run." Here, we wanted to hash out what role Gruber had in crafting the Affordable Care Act and whether Obama accurately recounted his involvement. Getting to know Gruber Gruber was instrumental in helping Massachusetts build its health care overhaul from 2003 to 2006, sometimes called "Romneycare" after former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, which is widely viewed as the model for the federal law. Both share the central idea to require everyone to purchase health insurance and similarly set up a marketplace to allow individuals to buy coverage. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum claimed a Romney adviser, who turned out to be Gruber, admitted that the Massachusetts law was the model for the federal law. We rated Santorum's claim was Mostly True. We’ve interviewed Gruber from time to time as an expert on both laws. A month after Obama took office in 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services contracted Gruber to provide "technical assistance in evaluating options for national healthcare reform," according to a federal job posting. Gruber was the only person considered for the position because he developed a "proprietary statistically sophisticated micro-simulation model that has the flexibility to ascertain the distribution of changes in health care spending and public and private health sector costs." Essentially, Gruber had built a way to accurately estimate health care costs and spending for varying health insurance proposals, federal programs and tax policies, and it made him "uniquely positioned to provide the analytic work." For this, Gruber was paid quite well. According to a recent story by the Washington Post Fact Checker, Gruber earned about $400,000 for his work with HHS and the Obama administration. He has since made seven figures helping various states set up their own insurance marketplaces in compliance with the Affordable Care Act. The Gruber Microsimulation Model Gruber’s model, called the Gruber Microsimulation Model, was able to predict important factors, such as how much insurance would cost for individuals to buy in each state. Another important element of Gruber’s model is its outputs were very similar to those produced by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper. With everyone watching closely to see how the Congressional Budget Office was evaluating the fiscal impact of the various health care bills, having a model that could accurately predict what the CBO would say was very valuable to the process. Gruber declined to comment for this story. But others who worked on the legislation have rebutted claims that Gruber was "an architect" of the Affordable Care Act. John McDonough, a Harvard health policy professor who was a senior adviser to the Senate Health and Education Committee when the law was written, told PolitiFact that Gruber’s involvement was important, but it did not involve the actual writing of the bill. "Jon had designed an economic model to be able to estimate any changing set of parameters like how much a policy would cost and how many people would get covered and various other effects," said McDonough, who also worked with Gruber in Massachusetts. "In 2009 and 2010 he took a year off from his teaching and other duties and worked out of his home in Lexington, Mass., and was basically on call almost 24-7 to run various models for us." "But he was not in the room in the determination of what policies would be in or not be in the law," McDonough added. "I was one of an army of people who were in the room at various times. Jon was not." Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress who served as a senior adviser for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services from 2009-10, wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that Gruber "did not make policy, nor did he work for the White House, HHS, or any congressional committee." "The true architects of the ACA are the members of the Senate Finance and Senate Health committees who wrote the bill," she wrote. Gruber and Obama Gruber may not be an architect of the bill, like some have said, but referring to him as "some adviser" is somewhat misleading as well. After all, his microsimulation model made him uniquely qualified for the critical task of figuring out just how much all of this would cost the government and consumers. Such a flippant characterization also dismisses Gruber’s influence on Obama’s positions on health care reform in the lead-up to his presidential bid and during his first year in office. A video clip that resurfaced last week showed then-Sen. Obama speaking at a Brookings Institution event in 2006 (Gruber spoke later in the event). During his remarks, Obama said about the forthcoming Hamilton Project, "You have already drawn some of the brightest minds from academia and policy circles, many of them I have stolen ideas from liberally, people ranging from Robert Gordon to Austan Goolsbee; Jon Gruber; my dear friend, Jim Wallis here, who can inform what are sometimes dry policy debates with a prophetic voice." Further, Gruber visited the White House a dozen times from 2009-10, according to visitor logs. This included a July 20, 2009, meeting with Obama. According to a 2011 NBC news story, Obama or his staff sat down a dozen times during 2009 with three different people who helped advise Romney’s health care overhaul in Massachusetts, including Gruber. "The White House wanted to lean a lot on what we’d done in Massachusetts," Gruber told NBC News in 2011. "They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model." Gruber also had meetings with many of the heavyweights on Obama’s economic and health care staff: Peter Orszag, then the director of the Office of Management and Budget; Larry Summers, director of the National Economic Council; Jason Furman, the deputy director of the National Economic Council; and Jeanne Lambrew, the director of the Office of Health Reform for the Department of Health and Human Services. Our ruling Obama said Gruber was "some adviser who never worked on our staff." This careful wording significantly downplays the MIT economist's role. Gruber was an adviser. But he was not just "some adviser," an especially flip characterization. By HHS’ own documentation, Gruber was considered "uniquely positioned" for a contract job assisting with Obama’s health care reform efforts. In that sense, he was a very important adviser. Further, while Gruber never worked "on our staff," he was paid by the federal government quite handsomely, and worked very closely with the staff. His economic simulation model was very important to those writing the bill, even if he wasn’t the person deciding what would make the legislation and what would be left at the cutting board. He also met with Obama in the White House and had a dozen meetings that often included some of the most senior members of Obama’s economic and health care teams. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13401	"During her first four years in Washington Sen. Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers nearly 90 percent of the time."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/sep/24/maggie-hassan/hassan-claims-ayote-follows-koch-brothers-agenda-9/	Democrat Maggie Hassan has gone on the attack against Republican rival Kelly Ayotte in the race for U.S. Senate. Recently, Hassan accused Ayotte of siding with billionaires Charles and David Koch while representing New Hampshire in the Washington. "During her first four years in Washington, Sen. Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers nearly 90 percent of the time," Hassan said at a recent Democratic unity breakfast. It’s a line straight from one her ads that aired earlier this month. Politifact decided to take a look. The Koch brothers have become well known-names in politics. The men own Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan.-based parent company of several manufacturers and energy companies, like paper maker Georgia-Pacific and refinery Flint Hill Resources. But they have also waded in politics. The brothers’ financial backing helped to found Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group that has spent millions backing Republican candidates in New Hampshire and other states. The brothers have never been elected members of Congress, nor have they ever cast a vote on the bills that came before Ayotte, a first-term U.S. senator elected in 2010. But the Koch Brothers know how to let their positions be known. Through a collection of organizations funded with their own money and contributions from donors, they wield massive political influence. Their funding and influence rivals the official Republican Party itself, and their aim is to "fundamentally reshape American public life around a libertarian-infused brand of conservatism," according to Politico. Hassan’s camp pointed us to the flagship of the Koch brothers political network, Americans for Prosperity, and the organization’s scorecard, which ranks lawmakers votes "for economic freedom" each session. AFP favors limited government, low taxes and less regulation. It ranks senators votes according to those stated goals, and picks votes for its scorecard that relate to federal spending, energy, entitlements and taxes, among other issues. Ayotte received a 89 percent score from AFP in the 2011-2012 session after voting for bills "to reduce spending back to 2008 fiscal year levels" and to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and against a bill increasing taxes on oil and gas companies, according to the scorecard. Ayotte received a 90 percent score from AFP for the 2013-2014 session. Averaged together, those scores would come to 89.5 percent, or rounded up to 90 percent, which Hassan claims. Hassan’s camp left out Ayotte’s most recent score, from the 2015-2016 session, in which the Republican received a 70 percent rating from AFP. Even so, the scorecard isn’t a vote-by-vote grade. It’s not like AFP tallied the results of 100 votes and agreed with Ayotte 90 percent of the time. The organization scored her and all Senators on a sampling of votes in line with its agenda. Many other votes Ayotte took never registered on the scorecard and could have run afoul of the opinions of either Charles or David Koch. So is it fair to equate the scorecard rank to voting "with the Koch brothers," as Hassan says? AFP’s Luke Hilgemann works with the group’s "federal affairs team," led by AFP Vice President of Government Affairs Brent Gardner and his staff, to pick votes that are included in the scorecard. "No other parties are involved in that process," said spokesman Levi Russell, director of public affairs. "Charles and David Koch do not play a role in developing the AFP scorecard." Our ruling Hassan said Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers "90 percent of the time" during her first four years in Washington. Ayotte earned a 90 percent rating during those years from an organizations the Koch brothers helped to found, Americans for Prosperity. But, the men don’t vote in the U.S. Senate and the organization said the brothers don’t play a direct role in choosing the votes. Further, Hassan only cited Ayotte’s first four years in office, ignoring her most recent grade. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-08658	Russ Feingold "has not worked anywhere outside of politics."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/14/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-ad-says-sen-russ-feingold-has-never-he/	Republican Ron Johnson, an Oshkosh businessman, has cast himself as an outsider in his bid for U.S. Senate, branding Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold as a career politician. It’s a common approach for first-time candidates and may play well with voters fed up with Washington. But in a television ad that began airing Sept. 8, 2010, Johnson’s branding iron burned a little hotter. The ad features five unidentified people -- ordinary Wisconsin residents, according to the Johnson campaign -- all tossing a variety of criticisms toward Feingold, including this one: "Russ Feingold is a career politician," a woman says. "Has not worked anywhere outside of politics." Feingold himself has copped to the "career politician" charge, saying at the Milwaukee Press Club in August 2010 he had chosen public service as a career and was proud of it: "I make no apologies for it." But the second half of the statement is a new charge. Is it true, as Johnson claims, Feingold has never had a job outside of politics? Feingold, 57, won election to the state Senate in 1982 at age 29, and served there until 1992, when he was elected to the first of his three terms in the U.S. Senate. That’s 28 years as an elected official and, if you start at age 18, nearly three-quarters of his adult life. But Feingold also was an attorney in Madison from 1979 to 1985, according to his U.S. Senate biography. He worked three years as a lawyer after graduating from Harvard Law School and another three years after being elected to the state Senate. Feingold worked for the firms of Foley & Lardner and La Follette Sinykin, which merged in 2000 with the Milwaukee-based firm Godfrey & Kahn. Seems cut and dried, right? Johnson campaign spokeswoman Sara Sendek acknowledged Feingold worked for the firms but said both "are involved in political work." She went on to say Feingold’s time "as a highly paid lawyer a quarter of a century ago hardly constitutes any sort of real world experience with a business or creating jobs." However, Sendek could not provide any evidence to PolitiFact Wisconsin showing Feingold worked on political items at the firms. We couldn’t find any, either. According to the Feingold campaign, Feingold worked as an attorney on litigation and had business clients, a point supported by attorneys who worked at the two law firms at the time. Neither firm could produce records showing the type of work Feingold did. But retired Foley & Lardner attorney Michael Laskis said Feingold did business litigation. And, according to Rick Bliss, managing partner of Godfrey & Kahn, attorneys from that firm who were at the old LaFollette firm when Feingold was there said Feingold was a trial lawyer. In short, Feingold has spent most of his adult life in politics, and he embraces the idea of being a career politician. But Johnson says Feingold never did anything else -- a point the Feingold disputes to the point of asking the ad be taken down. We rate Johnson’s statement False.

Malia’s court date for this imaginary charge is not Sept. 31. For one thing, she didn’t get arrested. For another, Sept. 31 doesn’t exist. The preposterous claim, published on TheAmericanNews.co, is among the latest of many false news stories about Obama’s two daughters, Malia and Sasha. Recently, we’ve fact-checked claims that Malia was suspended from Harvard and that Sasha was expelled from school. We rated both Pants on Fire. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image that accompanies the false article can be traced to a story we debunked last year. That Pants on Fire post claimed Malia was arrested for drinking, drugs and dog-fighting. At the time, Malia was edited into a collection of mugshots from an actual dog-fighting incident in South Carolina in 2013. A cropped version of that altered image appears with the new false claim. We found no evidence of the existence of a "notorious" drug dealer Christopher Turk mentioned in the story. A doctor named Christopher Turk is, however, a main character on the sitcom Scrubs. Malia is currently attending Harvard University, and Sasha is a senior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington. Neither has been suspended or expelled, and neither has been charged with cocaine possession. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-10233	"(Palin) supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/moveon/palin-wasnt-in-buchanans-brigade/	Gov. Sarah Palin's conservative credentials have excited the GOP base, and perhaps in equal fashion have ignited the passions of liberals. Palin remained Topic A during the Republican National Convention and her resume has been picked over by friends and foes alike. In the foe category would be MoveOn.org, the liberal activist group, which on Sept. 2 sent an e-mail to an estimated 3.2-million supporters, offering their views of Palin's flaws as a public official. One item caught our attention. The e-mail said Palin, Alaska's governor since 2006, "supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000." "This is information the American people need to see," the email said. "Please take a moment to forward this email to your friends and family." In making its allegation, Move.on picked up on a charge made by others, most notably Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a longtime Barack Obama supporter. The charge relies on a single Associated Press story from July 1999 about Buchanan's campaign stop in tiny Wasilla, Alaska, where Palin was mayor at the time. The article described Palin as "among those sporting Buchanan buttons." We won't delve into the question of whether Buchanan really is a "right-wing extremist." Those are the kinds of judgments voters can make for themselves. But the allegation that Palin was a Buchanan supporter might carry some weight, especially among Jewish voters, many of whom consider him to be anti-Israel. Wexler, in his charge, said Buchanan had "a uniquely atrocious record on Israel," and the Anti-Defamation League calls Buchanan a "racist, anti-Semite." So the question is this: Did Palin support Buchanan in 2000? No. Shortly after Buchanan's visit to Wasilla, and after the AP story, Palin wrote a letter to her local newspaper making clear that her appearance at the Buchanan event wasn't an endorsement of his candidacy. Published July 26, 1999, the letter said: "As mayor of Wasilla, I am proud to welcome all presidential candidates to our city. This is true regardless of their party, or the latest odds of their winning. When presidential candidates visit our community, I am always happy to meet them. I'll even put on their button when handed one as a polite gesture of respect. "Though no reporter interviewed me for the Associated Press article on the recent visit by a presidential candidate (Metro, July 17), the article may have left your readers with the perception that I am endorsing this candidate, as opposed to welcoming his visit to Wasilla. As mayor, I will welcome all the candidates in Wasilla." Not long after, Wasilla endorsed Steve Forbes' unsuccessful bid for the 2000 GOP nomination. The one complication is that Buchanan appeared on CNBC's Hardball on Aug. 30 and claimed that Palin and her husband had been supporters during is '96 campaign. "She was a brigadier for me in '96, as was her husband,'' Buchanan said. "She's a terrific gal. She's a rebel reformer." Buchanan called his supporters the Buchanan Brigades. But on Sept. 3, Buchanan told PolitiFact in St. Paul, Minn., that while he knew Palin attended his rally in Wasilla because of press accounts, he did not know if she actually supported him as a candidate in 2000 or previous campaigns. "I can't confirm anything,'' he said. Campaign finance reports on CQ Moneyline show she never donated money to Buchanan or Forbes. The McCain campaign is emphatic in refuting the charge. "Governor Palin has never supported Pat Buchanan," the McCain campaign said on its "Stop the Smears'' Web site, and called on Wexler to retract his comments. But Wexler spokesman Josh Rogin said that won't happen. "Buchanan says she was a supporter,'' Rogin said. Buchanan doesn't say that anymore. We may never be sure of Palin's position in 1996, but if she says she wasn't a Buchanan supporter and Buchanan says he can't prove that she was, we don't have much to go on. But for our purposes, the question of 2000 is more important because that's what Moveon.org alleges in a widespread e-mail. The letter to the editor that Palin wrote back in 1999 seems pretty clear to us. Even back then she wanted to make it clear that Buchanan wasn't her choice for president in the 2000 race, which leaves us with nowhere to go but False.

pomt-03456	Rhode Island "didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/19/charlene-lima/ri-state-representative-charlene-lima-says-rhode-i/	There was a lot of debate on the floor of the House of Representatives June 13, 2013, about the National Popular Vote bill. Once enough states ratify it -- and nine already have -- Rhode Island would be required to cast its Electoral College votes on behalf of the presidential candidate who, on a national level, gets the highest popular vote, regardless of who wins the presidential contest in Rhode Island. The proposal is designed to discourage candidates from focusing exclusively on battleground states such as Ohio and Florida. One opponent of the plan, which has already received the endorsement of both the House and Senate, was Rep. Charlene Lima, a Cranston Democrat. In her speech on the House floor, carried live on television, she spoke of the "fiercely independent" history of Rhode Island and offered this example: "We didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes. We never ratified that." PolitiFact Rhode Island did a double-take. So we don't have to pay our federal income taxes? Before we wrote to the government to demand a big refund, we called Lima. When we couldn't get through to her right away, we checked some history. It turns out that the 13th Amendment abolished slavery. It had nothing to do with the federal income tax. Rhode Island not only ratified that amendment, we were the second state to do so, on Feb. 2, 1865. The amendment that created the federal income tax was the 16th Amendment. It was ratified by 42 of the 48 states in 1911, 1912 and 1913. (Alaska and Hawaii were not states at the time). Rhode Island rejected it, so Lima is correct about that element of her statement. Then we got to the big question: If Rhode Island didn't ratify it, is Lima correct to say that Rhode Islanders don't have to pay income taxes? No more than Mississippi residents could continue to own slaves after it rejected the 13th Amendment in 1865. (It would take Mississippi another 130 years to formally approve that amendment.) Lima's statement "is wrong in so many different ways," said Jared Goldstein, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law. On the issue of paying taxes, the fact that Rhode Island did not ratify the 16th Amendment "does not matter in the least," he said. "Under the Constitution, an amendment becomes part of the Constitution upon the ratification by three-quarters of the states. Under the Supremacy Clause, the U.S. Constitution trumps any contrary state law, which means that states are bound by the Constitution regardless of whether they ratified every part of it. Otherwise, each state would only be bound by the parts of the Constitution that it agrees with, and there would be chaos." So it doesn't look as if we're going to get that refund. When we heard back from Lima, she said she might have named the wrong amendment, she does pay her federal income taxes and "I think people have to pay them." She said her comment was "kinda more tongue in cheek." After her statement on the House floor, she said, the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Helio Melo approached her. "He said, 'I wanted to get up on the floor and say, Don't listen to Rep. Lima,'" Lima said. On this issue, we agree. Rep. Charlene Lima had the wrong amendment and the wrong lesson from history when she said Rhode Island "didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes." Because her statement falls into the realm of ridiculous, we rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-06321	"Sixty-percent of the state retirees...don’t get Social Security.’’	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/13/kathleen-connell/rhode-island-aarp-head-kathleen-connell-says-60-pe/	Among the more vocal critics of the Chafee administration’s plan to overhaul the state pension system is the head of the Rhode Island chapter of the AARP. Kathleen S. Connell, a former secretary of state and one-time teacher, testified before a joint meeting of the Senate and House Finance Committees on Oct. 26 that the plan to suspend annual cost-of-living increases for retirees would be especially onerous for those who don’t collect Social Security. Responding to a question posed by Senate Finance Chairman Daniel DaPonte about how many retirees don’t get Social Security, Connell said: "I believe the figure is on the order of 60 percent of the state retirees -- which are the ones we are addressing -- don’t get Social Security.’’ Her statement prompted some head-shaking in the audience. So we decided to check it out. We contacted the Rhode Island AARP, and John Martin, the group’s spokesman, responded in an e-mail. "This has been called to our attention,’’ Martin wrote. Martin said that while Connell did, indeed, say "state retirees," she actually meant "state teacher retirees [emphasis added] who do not collect Social Security." That’s "around 50 percent," he said. (The figure, he said, is based on data from the state Retirement System and the National Institute on Retirement Security, a nonprofit policy research organization in Washington.) But teachers were never specifically mentioned during the exchange, and we think anyone listening would assume, as we did, that Connell was referring to all retirees in the state-run plans that were being discussed. So we still wanted to know the answer to the Senate chairman’s question: How many state retirees don’t receive Social Security? The facts Social Security, the federal insurance program signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is designed to pay a post-retirement income to workers who contributed to the program. In 1950, Congress expanded Social Security coverage to state and local government employees not covered by other retirement plans; in 1954, the act was amended again to make it available to all state and local employees, except for police officers and firefighters. But state participation was voluntary. Massachusetts, for example, declined coverage for its public employees. Rhode Island opted into the Social Security system for most state workers, but made local participation optional. Participation requires contributions from both employers and employees. Some communities chose not to join. Others did sign on. The result is a patchwork system of coverage. As far as we could tell, no single agency in Rhode Island knows the precise number of retirees in the state system who are covered by Social Security -- not even the state Office of the General Treasurer, according to its spokeswoman, Joy Fox. But we did manage to get a good estimate. Here’s how we did it. The state retirement system comprises five separate pension plans. The largest has 11,421 retired state employees and beneficiaries (generally spouses or children), according to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island June 30, 2010, actuarial report. All of them, Fox said, are covered by Social Security. The next largest plan covers teachers, with 10,213 retirees and beneficiaries, according to the same actuarial report. Based on the number of active teachers in each school district and the Social Security Agreements filed with the state, the treasurer’s office estimates that about half -- roughly 5,100 retired teachers -- are covered by Social Security. Teachers in 14 of the state’s 37 school districts -- including Providence, Pawtucket, North Providence, Warwick and Woonsocket -- are covered by Social Security, according to the Rhode Island Association of School Committees. Frank Flynn, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, whose members work for 11 of the 15 school districts, agrees with the treasurer’s estimate. After teachers, the next largest group of retirees in the state system -- just under 4,500 -- are local police, firefighters and municipal employees. The Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns reports its survey found that all municipal employees in Rhode Island are covered by Social Security. But that’s not the case with police and firefighters. In fact, several of the state’s larger, urban police and fire departments -- including Providence -- have no Social Security coverage, according to the League’s survey. With the help of one of our newsroom data gurus, we looked at the records of more than 4,000 retired municipal, police and firefighters and their beneficiaries (or 90 percent of that group) in the state system. We found that about 95 percent of them are covered by Social Security. So, all state employees, roughly half of all teachers and 95 percent of retired municipal, police and firefighters in the state retirement system get Social Security. The remaining two groups of retirees in the state system are judges and state police. All of the 81 retired judges and their beneficiaries get Social Security, according to Craig Berke, a spokesman for the state judiciary system. And none of the 266 retired state police are covered by Social Security. Add all the numbers up, and the share of retirees in the state-run plans who do get Social Security is about 78 percent. Even if we added in another 3,000 or so police and firefighters in municipally-run pension plans, almost all of whom don’t get Social Security, the overall percentage of those covered would still be 70 percent. (A week after Connell’s testimony, Mark Dingley, the state’s deputy treasurer, testified before the same committee that the share of current employees in state-run plans is about 75 percent.) The ruling Connell was clearly wrong when she said that 60 percent of "state retirees" don’t get Social Security. Our research found it’s about 22 percent. Connell’s spokesman said she meant retired teachers, not all retirees, although she didn’t make that distinction at the time. Even then, that number is 50 percent, not 60 percent. We rule Connell’s statement False. Correction: The initial version of this item reported that teachers in the City of Central Falls, R.I., were covered by Social Security. That was based on information from the Rhode Island Association of School Committees. After this item was published, the association said that it had made a mistake. In fact, Central Falls teachers are not covered by Social Security. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-06061	"My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-hes-adding-1-billion-new-education/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott asked the Legislature to send more money to education during his State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012 -- and he said he’s not kidding. "My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education," Scott said. "And I ask you to please consider that recommendation very carefully. On this point, I just cannot budge. … This is the single most important decision we can make today for Florida’s future." But the $1 billion isn’t purely "new" additional funding as Scott said. About $190 million is needed to pay for 30,000 more students expected for next year, and another $220 million goes to make up for a 3 percent drop in property values. Another problem with Scott’s claim to support "new" education funding: It doesn’t make up for budget cuts that Scott signed into law just last year. This hasn’t gone unnoticed by Democrats in state government. Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, called Scott’s fervor for education funding "new-found." "The bottom line is that we would still be funding education at a level hundreds of millions of dollars less than we did in 2007 if the governor’s proposal is passed. It won’t make up for the $1.35 billion that the Legislature cut from K-12 education last session," Rich said in a newsletter to constituents in December. We went looking for budget documents and news reports on the matter, and we soon confirmed last year’s education cuts. We even found evidence of the decline in Scott’s own budget documents on his Let’s Get to Work website. (See page 33 of this chart.) Scott’s data shows a few interesting trends. Starting with fiscal year 2003, total education funding climbed every year, reaching $18.75 billion in 2007. It then dipped to $17.92 billion in 2008, before climbing again to $18 billion in 2009 and $18.22 billion in 2010, thanks largely to federal economic stimulus funds. In 2011, funding dropped to $16.58 billion, according to interim calculations. Scott’s proposal to add state funds would push total funding to $17.15 billion in 2012. As Rich noted, that’s still below pre-recession levels. Scott is right that he wants to add roughly $1 billion in funding for schools this year, but we think it’s disingenuous to call that money "new" -- a descriptor that gives people a distinct impression that education funding is up. Some of that $1 billion in funding is to pay for new students and to close a gap created by lost funding from declining property values. And it doesn’t quite make up for the deeper cuts Scott signed off on a year ago. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-01-10T15:54:14	2012-01-10	['None']

pomt-04896	"Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/06/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-gun-violence-claimed-more-am/	War may be good for one thing: providing U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg with leverage for his argument that the United States needs stricter gun laws. Lautenberg, who is pushing to reinstate a federal ban on high-capacity ammunition clips in the wake of the deadly mass shooting last month at a Colorado movie theater, said, "our lax gun laws make it far too easy for murderers to commit acts of violence." "Here are the facts: Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. In support of the two wars, more than 6,500 American soldiers have lost their lives. During the same period, however, guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil," Lautenberg said in a July 30 op-ed article posted on NorthJersey.com. Lautenberg’s numbers are technically correct since 2001. In fact, he could have cited just a year of gun violence in the U.S. to make his point. But experts call his comparison flawed and misleading. "More pickles are consumed in New York City than in Rhode Island. Is that a good comparison? I don’t think so. Because there are way more people in New York City," said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the school of criminal justice at The University at Albany. The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks murders in the United States through its Uniform Crime Report program. Caley Gray, a spokesman for Lautenberg, cited that source -- which shows more than 8,700 people were murdered in the United States with firearms in 2010 -- to support the senator’s statement. Since 2001 -- the year the war in Afghanistan began -- more than 95,000 people have been murdered with a gun in the United States, according to the FBI data. Though those statistics do not include citizenship status, Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, said "my reaction is that you can safely assume that the vast majority of murder victims are U.S. citizens." That death toll is far higher than the number of U.S. military casualties from the nation’s recent wars. More than 6,500 U.S. military personnel have died in conflicts from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001, according to data from the U.S. Department of Defense. Gray said: "The numbers speak for themselves. The bottom line and the sad truth is that far more Americans are being killed by guns in their own neighborhoods than in deadly war zones." But Kleck called the senator’s comparison "foolish and misleading." "Taking account of the very different population sizes at risk, the risk of a gun homicide (or any kind of homicide) is enormously greater in Afghanistan than in the U.S.," Kleck said in an e-mail. "Obviously even one homicide is one too many, but the hinted suggestion that the risk of death from a gun is even remotely as high in the U.S. as in Afghanistan is absurd." Lizotte also criticized Lautenberg’s statement for focusing only on the deaths of U.S. troops. "Many more people were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq than Americans," he said. For example, a July 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service noted that in Afghanistan "11,864 civilians have been killed in the conflict since 2007, when the United Nations began reporting statistics, to the end of 2011." Our ruling Lautenberg said, "guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan," claiming that "more than 6,500 American soldiers" died while "guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil." Though Lautenberg’s numbers are mainly on target, three experts agreed that the senator’s statement is flawed largely because he uses raw numbers to compare two very different populations. Also, Lautenberg focuses solely on deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, when many more have died in both wars. We rate this statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12745	"The primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/01/thomas-perez/taxes-wealthy-pay-obamacare-dncs-perez-overshoots/	The morning after President Donald Trump promised to "repeal and replace Obamacare," Democratic party chief Tom Perez took a dig at Republicans for ignoring the good that the health care law does. "It's a lifesaver," Perez said. "If they had come in good faith during the Obama administration, we would have been more than open to fixing it. But that's not what they're about. They want it repealed. And here is why: the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act so that you can provide a big giveaway to the wealthy." Perez was focused on the GOP’s political motives, but our focus is on his assertion that taxing the wealthy is the primary means of paying for the Affordable Care Act. Perez is correct that tax hikes on individuals making over $200,000 per year and couples making over $250,000 are the largest single source of revenues under the law. But that ignores a larger piece of the financial picture: the spending reductions in Medicare. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the impartial analytic arm of Congress, savings from Medicare are projected to provide about $228 billion to offset the costs of the sweeping health care law. The tax on higher-income households delivers about $136 billion, between 2016 and 2020. Melinda Buntin, formerly at the CBO and now a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, took issue with Perez’s summary. "I would say that the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act was Medicare changes," Buntin told us. Under the law, Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors, is slated to grow more slowly than it otherwise would. It largely does that by limiting payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers. Over time, those limits add up. Joe Antos, a health care analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think tank, cautioned that there’s a lot of guess work in counting those dollars. "In terms of financing it's not just the revenue you collect, but it’s the reduction in other spending to offset your expansion in other areas," Antos said. The Medicare savings, for example, helped pay for the expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program to help the working poor. Marc Goldwein at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget put taxes on wealthier Americans into the context of the many pieces that go into the total package that is the Affordable Care Act. On top of the dollars from Medicare and taxes on the well-to-do, there are taxes on drug and medical equipment makers. "Taxes on high-earners cover one-fifth or maybe one-quarter of the ACA’s costs," Goldwein said. "That’s large, but I wouldn’t call it the primary financing mechanism." Antos said that Republicans seem to be fine with the trims in Medicare spending. "You can’t find anybody who says they want to get rid of those Medicare cuts," Antos said. "If Republicans were to eliminate those, they would have to go elsewhere to find those billions of dollars. In health care, there is no other place to go." If the Medicare spending trajectory is off the table, then the next big item would be the taxes on higher-income earners. We reached out to Perez’s office and did not hear back. Our ruling Perez said that "the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people." According to CBO estimates, those taxes are the largest single revenue source, but trims in future Medicare spending growth do much more to keep the Affordable Care Act in balance. Every analyst we reached said that the complete fiscal package includes both revenues and spending cuts and it is misleading to say that the taxes are the main means of financing the health care program. Perez gave only half the picture.

pomt-05619	Says under the new health care law "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/26/joseph-kyrillos/senate-hopeful-claims-obama-administrations-health/	For Joe Kyrillos, it’s clear "we must repeal ObamaCare." In a campaign e-mail, the Republican state senator and U.S. Senate hopeful made his case for taking the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- or as some call it, ObamaCare -- off the books. "The fears are unanimous. ObamaCare is too expensive. It is a government takeover of our healthcare system. Services will be diminished. The patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated. It will not make healthcare more affordable. And it will bankrupt small businesses," Kyrillos said in the March 15 e-mail. There’s a slew of claims in that paragraph, including PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year about the government takeover of health care, but one jumped out at us: "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated." To support the claim, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, Chapin Fay, first pointed to a survey of physicians that found more than half of the roughly 5,000 doctors who responded said health care reform would have a negative impact on their relationship with patients. But that doesn’t prove the relationship will be eliminated and a spokesman for the company that conducted the survey said Kyrillos’ statement is "a step further than what our survey would say." When asked for specifics from the law, Fay pointed to the "value-based payment modifier under the physician fee schedule." The modifier provides financial penalties or rewards to doctors serving Medicare patients depending on the quality and cost of the care delivered. In another e-mail he said: "To the extent that Medicare drives all health care services, one could make the argument that the relationship as we once knew it will be 'eliminated.’ Primarily due to two new federal bureaucracies - IPAB and Preventive Services Task Force." The 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, will recommend ways to prevent Medicare’s spending growth from exceeding targets. The board can’t recommend changes that would ration care or raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, among other measures. It will be able to decrease government payments to health care providers and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force makes recommendations on clinical preventive services to primary care clinicians. Under the new law, certain plans must cover recommendations made by the task force. Some experts expressed concerns about how such measures will influence the doctor-patient relationship, but it’s clear that relationship isn’t eliminated. Whether treatments are covered by insurance or result in out-of-pocket costs is another matter -- and not a new one. Robert Moffit, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the traditional doctor-patient relationship, if defined as a doctor recommends treatment and insurance pays for it, has been deteriorating. Moffit said the health care law "does change the practice of medicine," significantly, but he called Kyrillos’ language "a little too strong." Other experts said Kyrillos’ claim overreaches. "As I read the legislation these are all tools to strengthen the primary care infrastructure so that it can better support patient-physician relationships," said Ann O’Malley, a senior health researcher for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a research group cited by both Republicans and Democrats. O’Malley also said Kyrillos’ statement assumes the "existing system is set up so it’s in the best interest of patients, and it’s not." Judy Feder, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University who served in the federal health department under President Bill Clinton, said the measures Kyrillos highlighted "define some of the coverage and payment features but they are not in any way dictating the relationship between the patient and a doctor." Kyrillos’ campaign was not swayed. "The fact is that this law eliminates the ‘doctor-patient’ relationship and creates the ‘doctor-patient-government’ relationship," Fay said. Our ruling Under the Obama administration’s health care law, Kyrillos claimed "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated." That’s a hefty charge. And there’s little proof to substantiate it. Provisions in the health care law allow changes to payments to health care providers and influence what’s covered by certain insurance plans, but nothing in the bill prevents physicians and patients from making health care decisions together. Kyrillos may need to call a doctor after this ruling: Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Joseph Kyrillos	None	None	None	2012-03-26T07:30:00	2012-03-15	['None']
pomt-01513	"The state budget has increased almost $800 million a year in each of the last two years."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/22/jeff-amason/libertarian-mark-state-budget-claim/	Smaller government. Lower taxes. More freedom. That’s the mantra of the Georgia Libertarian Party, which, this year, is fielding candidates for a handful of state offices, including governor. In Cherokee County, attorney and Libertarian Jeff Amason is running as a write-in candidate for the District 21 House seat. That seat is currently held by Scot Turner, a one-term Republican from Holly Springs. Amason recently appeared on the Monica Perez Show on WSB radio to discuss his candidacy and priorities, including reining in state spending. "The state budget has increased almost $800 million a year in each of the last two years. You can only imagine what it might be in five years," Amason said. "We need to be funding essential programs. We don’t need to be funding every program out there." With the economy making a slow but steady recovery, we decided to fact check Amason’s budget claims. We contacted him, and he sent us budget figures for the state fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014, as well as for the current fiscal year, which started July 1. That data showed that the total state budget grew from $18.5 billion in 2012 to $19.3 billion in Fiscal 2013 and to $20.2 billion in 2014. That’s a jump of $800 million between 2012 to 2013 and a $900 million increase between 2013 to 2014. We confirmed the accuracy of Amason’s numbers using budget documents available at the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget website. (We didn’t compare the 2014 and 2015 budgets because the General Assembly will amend the 2015 spending plan in the legislative session that starts in January.) Helping to drive up the recent state budgets were increases in enrollment in public schools, Medicaid and the state’s health insurance program for children, as well as pension costs, according to state documents. Current spending levels are 26.7 percent above 2005 levels, not adjusted for inflation, an OPB report shows. In summary, Amason said the state budget increased nearly $800 million a year in each of the last two years. He was very close, if not conservative in his assessment.. We rate his statement True.

pomt-00495	Says Tammy Baldwin's record includes "opposing harsher punishments for criminals who commit violent crimes near schools."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/07/leah-vukmir/leah-vukmir-cites-old-vote-claim-against-tammy-bal/	Does Democrat Tammy Baldwin oppose tougher punishments for crimes that happen near schools? That’s what Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Leah Vukmir claimed in a June 1, 2018, news release. In it, Vukmir claimed that Baldwin’s record shows her "opposing harsher punishments for criminals who commit violent crimes near schools." The state senator, who is one of the two major Republican candidates hoping to face Baldwin in November, repeated the claim a few days later on The Jay Weber Show on WISN-AM. But is the claim as straightforward as it seems? Here’s the evidence: Baldwin’s 1995 vote The claim is based on Baldwin’s vote against Assembly Bill 159 in 1995. The bill called for increased penalties for those who commit violent crimes inside school zones. Vukmir’s news release, posted on her campaign website, includes a link to records that show Baldwin did vote against the bill, which passed 84-16. (Fifteen of the "no" votes were cast by Democrats.) At the time, Baldwin was a member of the Assembly representing Madison. The proposal was advocated by Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson who pushed for it in his budget plan. We could not locate any news articles from the time that included comments on why Baldwin voted against the measure. And campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt refused to comment on why Baldwin voted against the bill. Steve Walters, a longtime Capitol reporter who is now executive producer for WisconsinEye, noted that after the 1994 election the Assembly was under Republican control for the first time in 24 years. The following year, Senate control flipped between the two parties. The measure was passed when the Republicans had Senate control. At the time, Walters said, the Republicans -- including Scott Walker, then an Assembly member -- were passing a number of anti-crime bills. So the bill, and Baldwin’s vote, followed a pattern of Democratic resistance to Republican legislation. What did the bill do? The measure defined school zone as anywhere within 1,000 feet of a school, at bus stops and on school buses. Among the enhanced penalties that became law: -- Allowing judges to add 100 hours of community service to a sentence at their discretion. The community service addition was capped at 40 hours for children convicted of a violent crime who are 12 or 13 years old. -- Increasing the time in prison for felonies by five years and the penalties for misdemeanors by three months in the county jail. So, there is at least one instance where Baldwin voted against a bill that proposed stricter penalties for those who commit crimes in school zones. Other evidence But the same year Baldwin voted against Assembly Bill 159, she supported a bill that prohibited individuals convicted of a serious child sex crime from working or volunteering with children. And a year earlier, in 1994, Baldwin voted for Assembly Bill 194, which increased penalties for illegal drug dealing within 1,000 feet of a facility where youth are present. In recent years, as a member of the U.S. Senate, she voted in favor of two acts aimed at protecting children from sex offenders: the International Megan’s Law in 2015 and the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act in 2016. While these votes do not necessarily concern schools, Neidhardt argued that the single vote in 1995 does not accurately reflect Baldwin’s history of voting to keep children safe. This is not the first time we examined a claim Vukmir made against Baldwin based on a vote from more than 20 years ago. In the same news release, Vukmir claimed Baldwin opposed displaying the American flag, singing the national anthem and saying the Pledge of Allegiance in schools. We rated a tweeted version of the claim, which was built into a broader attack on Baldwin’s patriotism, Mostly False. That vote related to expanding existing requirements as they related to the flag and anthem, which is slightly different than the claim we are examining here. In this case, the measure created new penalty enhancements in school zones, so a vote against it more clearly represented opposition to the underlying idea from Baldwin. Our rating Vukmir said Baldwin's record includes "opposing harsher punishments for criminals who commit violent crimes near schools." That vote on Assembly Bill 159 did happen -- 23 years ago. But in using it as an example of Baldwin being out of step with public sentiment, Vukmir ignores other votes -- including ones from the time that had greater penalties for crimes related to children. That amounts to cherry picking. In our book, that rates Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Leah Vukmir	None	None	None	2018-08-07T06:00:00	2018-06-01	['None']
pomt-11253	Under Rahm Emanuel, "We’ve got tree trimmers making six figures."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2018/may/01/jamal-green/does-chicago-pay-tree-trimmers-top-dollar/	A community activist hoping to unseat Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel says some workers employed by the department charged with keeping the city clean are making $100,000 or more each year. In taking aim against Emanuel, 22-year-old Ja’Mal Green, a Black Lives Matter activist among a crowded field of potential challengers to the mayor’s re-election next year, is accusing the two-term incumbent of mismanaging city finances. "We also have to figure out how to be financially sensible on how we’re paying city workers," Green said in a recent WBEZ radio interview after questioning Emanuel’s allocation of special funding meant to promote investment in struggling parts of the city. "We’ve got tree trimmers making six figures." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Green went on to say he wants to save taxpayer dollars so the city can invest in public schools, mental health care services and affordable housing. Progressive messaging aside, however, Green’s claim got us wondering: Does the city really pay some tree trimmers six figures? A cut above It’s no secret the city of Chicago has faced scrutiny over high worker pay in recent years. A report by the Better Government Association found the number of city employees making $100,000 or more in base pay nearly doubled between 2013 and 2015, though no tree trimmers were part of that group. Meanwhile, a broader measure examined by the Chicago Sun-Times in 2017 that included overtime as well as base pay found one-third of city employees earned compensation in the six-figures. That report, however, did not highlight specific pay packages of tree trimmers. So where did Green’s numbers come from? When we reached out to his campaign, a spokesman provided us with a list of tree trimmers employed by the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation making at least $100,000 in total compensation. The spokesman said the names came from a database maintained by OpenTheBooks.com, which is run by Adam Andrzejewski, a self-styled conservative transparency advocate who unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination for governor. We found 13 trimmers with total pay listed at $100,000 or more in 2016 on OpenTheBooks.com, the latest year that database covers for the department. The figure includes overtime as well as base pay. Green’s spokesman said his candidate had stressed tree trimmers’ pay in part to draw attention to large sums some city employees are making in overtime. So we turned to 2016 city data to determine how much overtime dollars factored in to those paychecks. City payroll data show that every tree trimmer in the department made between roughly $74,000 and $76,000 in base salary that year, including the top-earning tree trimmers listed on OpenTheBooks.com. A separate city-maintained database measuring overtime catalogued the difference in pay that allowed some to reach six figures. It should be noted that Green’s critique seems somewhat out of sync with his pedigree as a political progressive, a point not lost on some of his allies. Chicago Ald. Ameya Pawar, 47th, a one-time Democratic candidate for governor, called Green out on Twitter, writing it was "amazing" to hear someone who had served as a 2016 presidential campaign surrogate for Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders argue to cut public-worker compensation. "Laborers, tree trimmers, sanitation workers who approach 100k after decades of service aren’t the ones driving income inequality," Pawar wrote. Grandfathered in Green’s claim about tree trimmers was wrapped in a broader critique of Emanuel’s fiscal leadership. And that’s where the analysis stumbles slightly. The high-earning city tree trimmers Green complains of were all hired well before Emanuel entered office in 2011 and are being paid under contract terms agreed to by the mayor’s predecessors. What’s more, in 2012, Emanuel and the union representing most workers in the Streets and Sanitation department reached a deal to operate under a multi-tiered pay structure that lowered starting pay for new hires by $13 an hour. The same deal also stipulated new workers would be more flexible in job assignments. They would be trained as general laborers able to shift between different tasks rather than as specialists. So all the tree trimmers that showed up in the 2016 employee database referred to by Green were veterans grandfathered into the designation and the higher pay scales associated with it. That said, Emanuel’s administration did retain more control over how much overtime work to dole out. And city data show that overtime spending for tree trimmers soared between 2012, when the cost-saving contract revisions were implemented, and 2016. In 2012, the city paid slightly over $268,000 in overtime for tree trimmers, with the biggest single payout to a worker of roughly $7,500. By 2016, the overtime total had more than tripled to over $907,000, with several workers getting between $24,000 and $32,000. Our ruling Green claimed that, under Emanuel’s leadership, "We’ve got tree trimmers making six figures." Both the source his campaign provided and the city data on which it was based indicate that a handful of tree trimmers employed by the city’s Streets and Sanitation department did make six figures after accounting for overtime pay in 2016, the last year for which all relevant data was available. Still, Green overstepped in ignoring the contract revisions Emanuel’s administration negotiated to gain flexibility in work assignments and reduce base salary for newly hired workers. The designated tree trimmers on the city payroll were all hired before Emanuel took office and get paid under contract terms agreed to years before he became mayor. That said, overtime costs for tree trimmers have soared under Emanuel, and that is why the total compensation for some city tree trimmers has hit the six-figures. Green gets most, but not all of his claim about tree-trimmer pay right, which is why we rate it Mostly True.

"Families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same. So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year," he said during his first State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010. "Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years," he said. "Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government programs will." We should point out that the largest parts of the federal budget are defense and the entitlement programs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Still, didn't Obama oppose a spending freeze during the general election? We decided to check it out. Obama's Republican opponent in the election, Sen. John McCain, supported a spending freeze. In fact, what he proposed sounds an awful lot like the one Obama is suggesting. We reviewed the transcripts of the three presidential debates and found McCain and Obama jousted over a spending freeze each time. • In the first debate, Obama and McCain answered a question about how the economic crisis would affect their proposals crafted before the crisis. After a bit of pressing, McCain suggested a spending freeze "on everything but defense, Veteran Affairs and entitlement programs. ... I think we ought to seriously consider (it) with the exceptions the caring of veterans, national defense and several other vital issues." "Would you go for that?" moderator Jim Lehrer asked Obama. Obama replied, "The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are underfunded. I want to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy doesn't make sense. (Obama was referring to money that goes to private insurers as part the Medicare Advantage program.) Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close." • In the second debate, a voter asked what sacrifices Americans should make to help the nation "get out of the economic morass that we're now in." McCain said, "I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate. I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working. I know a lot of them that aren't working. ... And I recommend a spending freeze that except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze. And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even know about until months later." Obama, on the other hand, said it was important "for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Sen. McCain about an across-the-board freeze. That's an example of an unfair burden-sharing. That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget." • Finally, the third debate, on cutting the deficit: McCain: "I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, okay? Some people say that's a hatchet. That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, okay? ... I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs." Obama: "Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. It's proposed periodically. It doesn't happen. And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work." Obama's team seems to have anticipated that these quotes would be revived. Before the State of the Union speech, one of the administration's top economists wrote a defense of the proposal for the White House blog titled "Budget Freeze-eology 101: Hatchets vs. Scalpels." Jared Bernstein, chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden, gave the following explanation for Obama's proposal: "There are two ways to do a freeze like this: (1) an across-the-board freeze on every program outside of national security; and (2) a surgical approach where overall totals are frozen but some individual programs go up and others go down. In short, a hatchet versus a scalpel. "During the campaign, you may recall that John McCain touted option 1 -- the hatchet approach of an across-the-board freeze. "The president was critical of that approach then, and we would be critical of it now. It's not what we're proposing. To the contrary, the entire theory of the president's proposed freeze is to dial up the stuff that will support job growth and innovation while dialing down the stuff that doesn't. Under our plan, some discretionary spending will go up; some will go down. That's a big difference from a hatchet." Bernstein, though, oversimplifies what McCain described during the debates. McCain said he would exempt other areas besides defense, and he said programs should have to compete for funding ("some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency"). Obama's answers, on the other hand, never gave any indication that he would embrace the idea of a spending freeze, something that he is doing now. So we don't find Bernstein's explanation convincing. We give Obama a Full Flop.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-27T21:24:55	2010-01-27	['None']
pomt-03391	Says spending in the fiscal 2009 budget was lower than spending in the fiscal 2014 budget	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jul/07/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-state-spending-was-lower-fy20/	Chris Christie has spent months hammering home how high New Jersey’s spending was when his gubernatorial challenger Barbara Buono chaired a Senate budget panel a few years ago. Now Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, is taking her shot at spending under Christie. Buono made her move at a June 26 Senate budget hearing when she spoke against Christie’s $32.9 billion budget for fiscal year 2014. The Legislature approved the plan that afternoon and Christie signed it two days later. Buono noted in her speech that the fiscal year 2009 budget crafted on her watch, when she chaired the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations Committee, spent less than what’s been approved for fiscal year 2014. We wondered if that was true, especially since Christie has frequently criticized spending levels when Buono helmed the budget panel, particularly for fiscal year 2008. But in this case, Buono’s claim about higher spending in Christie’s just-approved budget is accurate. Let’s review the numbers. Patrick Giordano, Buono’s chief of staff, said in an e-mail that Buono’s figures were confirmed by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. We reviewed an e-mail sent by David J. Rosen, the OLS budget and finance officer, to Giordano, and then confirmed the data separately with Rosen. The result? Spending in the fiscal year 2009 appropriations act was $32.86 billion, compared with $32.97 billion for the fiscal year 2014 spending plan, Rosen wrote to Giordano. That’s a difference of $108,491,000 – or one-third of 1 percent. So, Buono’s claim is correct: spending for the fiscal year 2014 budget is higher than fiscal year 2009. For context, let’s also look at spending under the fiscal year 2008 budget – the other spending plan that Buono helped craft during her chairmanship of the Senate budget panel. Buono referenced both budgets during her speech on the Senate floor. Former Gov. Jon Corzine had final approval of the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 budgets. Now let’s look at spending for every fiscal year since 2008: FISCAL YEAR TOTAL APPROPRIATIONS FY2008 $33.47 billion FY2009 $32.86 billion FY2010 $28.99 billion FY2011 $28.36 billion FY2012 $29.69 billion FY2013 $31.65 billion FY2014 $32.97 billion Sources: New Jersey Office of Legislative Services Summary Of Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 2008-2014 So state spending dropped from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, but state spending has increased in each of Christie’s budgets. It’s worth noting that the recession had a major impact on decreased spending from 2008 to 20009. The National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as beginning in December 2007 and ending in June 2009. New Jersey Senate Republicans spokesman Ben Sparks did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Buono said during a speech on the Senate floor about the fiscal year 2014 budget that its spending level is higher than spending under the fiscal year 2009 budget. Buono chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee when the 2009 plan was drafted and ultimately approved by Corzine. The OLS confirmed Buono’s claim, noting that spending for fiscal year 2009 was $32.86 billion, compared with $32.97 billion for fiscal year 2014. We rate Buono’s claim True.

pomt-14670	Says Bernie Sanders "has reversed his position on immunity" for gun manufacturers and sellers.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-gun-manufacturer-liability-bernie/	In the increasingly competitive Democratic primary for president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has spent months hammering Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided gun makers, sellers and trade associations with significant protection against lawsuits. Now, after Sanders clarified his position on the issue, she’s calling him a flip-flopper. Sanders, who represents the small, rural state of Vermont where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights on key legislation and sometimes sided with supporters of gun control. One of the primary examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill, which was enacted in 2005. A similar bill also passed the U.S. House in 2003. Sanders, then serving in the House, voted for it both times. Clinton called on Sanders to "stand up and say I got this one wrong" in a Jan. 8 interview on MSNBC’s Hardball. About a week later, Sanders released a statement on the gun-liability issue in the run-up to the Jan. 17 Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. In a news release, Sanders said, "I’m pleased that this legislation is being introduced," referring to proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to rescind portions of the 2005 law. "As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up," Sanders added. The Clinton camp portrayed this as a flip-flop during the Charleston debate. Clinton said, "I am pleased to hear that Sen. Sanders has reversed his position on immunity, and I look forward to him joining with those members of Congress who have already introduced legislation." The Sanders camp disagreed that this was a change of position. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver had told MSNBC, "This is not a flip flop, this is consistent with the position he held earlier in the campaign." So is Clinton’s portrayal accurate? We took a closer look. Sanders’ vote on the 2005 bill While the bill includes two relatively non-controversial provisions -- one on trigger locks and the other on armor-piercing bullets -- the most contentious elements of the 2005 bill, and the ones that drove overwhelming Democratic opposition at the time, deal with liability for gun makers and sellers. The official bill summary provides for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also provides a few exceptions, such as: • Cases where a person transfers a firearm knowing that a violent crime or drug-trafficking crime will be committed with it; • Cases where a seller is negligent or a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated the law; • And cases involving an injury caused by a physical defect with the weapon when it was used as intended. What Sanders and his campaign said prior to Jan. 16 On numerous occasions, Sanders or his aides have expressed comfort with his past vote. In June 2015, Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, told Politico, "I believe he would make the same vote" today. In October, at a Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Sanders said, "If somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer. That is not what a lawsuit should be about." Sanders continued to make similar arguments into January 2016. Asked by CBS whether gun manufacturers should be held accountable for gun deaths, Sanders said, "Of course not, that doesn't make any sense," he said, while adding that if guns fall into the hands of criminals, "Of course you hold the gun manufacturers liable." At the same time, Sanders has increasingly fine-tuned his stance, saying he’d be open to reconsidering his vote on the 2005 measure. In an October 2015 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders said he was "willing to see changes" in the gun-liability provision: "Can we take another look at that liability issue? Yes." Then, in January, a few days before the campaign issued its news release on gun liability, Sanders told a crowd in Iowa, "I think we should take another look at that legislation and get rid of those provisions which allow gun manufacturers to act irresponsibly." The Jan. 16 news release In the news release, Sanders expressed support for the Blumenthal-Schiff initiative to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law. The trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions would not be overturned. The sponsors said they will try to advance the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act as an amendment to an appropriations bill, according to the New York Times. On the Jan. 17 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders explained that in 2005, "there were things in (the bill) that I did not like and I was willing to rethink. We have rethought it. There's a bill apparently being introduced, I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it." Sanders did say in his news release that he will be proposing an amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law’s impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. This, he indicated, was consistent with his past concerns about the threat of lawsuits against small gun shops serving primarily rural areas of Vermont. Our ruling So is Clinton right that Sanders flip-flopped on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers? Sanders voted for the 2005 measure that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers. After months of Sanders and his staff defending the vote, Sanders’ position started to evolve in October. Sanders’ position three months ago -- that he would "take another look" at the liability question -- is consistent with his Jan. 16 news release saying he supported a proposal to rescind the immunity provisions. But to look back only to October doesn’t tell the full story, ignoring not only the 2003 and 2005 votes but also several instances in which Sanders or his staff defended those votes in interviews between June 2015 and early January 2016. That sounds like a flip-flop to us, so we rate Clinton’s statement True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-01-17T22:39:48	2016-01-17	['None']

pomt-11895	Says "46 percent of people believe major national news organizations fabricate stories about me."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/24/donald-trump/trump-says-46-people-think-media-make-news-about-h/	From the earliest days on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump regularly touted polls that underscored his popularity with the public. Nine months into his term, the pattern continues. "It is finally sinking through," Trump tweeted Oct. 22. "46% of people believe major national news orgs fabricate stories about me. Fake news, even worse! Lost cred." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump was citing a Politico/Morning Consult poll. It asked, "Do you believe the nation’s major news organizations fabricate news stories about President Trump and his administration, or not?" Nearly half of the respondents, 46 percent, said yes, they do fabricate stories. Another 37 percent said no, and 17 percent said they didn’t know. So Trump accurately cited the poll results. The next question is, are the numbers credible? Several people who study polling told us that while they wouldn’t take the number to be precisely accurate, it’s fair to say that the results capture a widely held belief. The greatest uncertainty about the Morning Consult poll is that it was conducted online. The big issue there is that, unlike traditional polling, it doesn’t reach people randomly. Without getting too technical, picking people at random from a big list is the standard tool that allows pollsters to say that the people they reached are a good mirror of the public at large. With online polls, pollsters use information about the people who fill out the survey and massage their response statistically to mirror the public at large. That might sound fishy, and experts raise many legitimate concerns. But it doesn’t mean that the findings are automatically wrong. The ugly truth is that neither approach is fantastic. "Pollsters employing both probability samples and non-probability samples are facing great challenges in measuring public opinion," said political scientist Adam Berinsky at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "While the Morning Consult poll is not a random sample poll, it is no better or worse than other online polls, and I don’t have any specific concerns about potential bias." That said, Berinsky said he’s noticed that Morning Consult "tends to lean a little pro-Trump relative to other polls." That difference shows up on the presidential approval question. The Morning Consult survey reported that 44 percent of the people approved of the job Trump is doing. The average polling result today is 39.5 percent. Michael Traugott and Josh Pasek at the University of Michigan, who have written about polling together, also see a skew in the Morning Consult responses, but like Berinsky, they take the results as roughly accurate. "Clearly some decent portion of the public does believe this," Pasek said. "Is it 46 percent? I don’t know. But it is not as though you can disregard this out of hand." The use of the word "fabricate" struck both researchers as odd. They wondered how people might interpret it. That’s one reason Traugott sees this response less as a measure of public mistrust in the media and more an expression of partisan preference. He noted that nearly three-quarters of Republicans in the poll said news organizations invent stories about Trump, while one-fifth of Democrats did. "America is very polarized and this is consistent with that," Traugott said. Morning Consult cites its relative accuracy during the presidential election as proof that its results are reliable. Traugott and Pasek said that’s actually an easier challenge than gauging what the public thinks about the media. In fact, a couple of weeks before it partnered on this recent poll, Politico posted a story about the growing trust in news. It cited a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found 48 percent of people had a great deal or some confidence in the press, a rise of nearly 10 points from the time of the election. A Quinnipiac survey reported 54 percent of respondents said they trusted the media more than Trump to tell the truth about important issues. That doesn’t make the Morning Consult poll wrong. What it shows is that how you ask a question changes the answers people give. Our ruling Trump said that 46 percent of people think news organizations fabricate stories about him. Trump accurately cited a recent poll result. The experts we reached said while the survey method is flawed, the problems aren’t big enough to invalidate its approximate findings. They cautioned against putting much weight on the exact number, which is generally in line with the country’s partisan divide. However, the survey tends to skew Republican and its results run counter to other recent polls showing that about half the public trusts the media to be fairly reliable, and as one poll found, more reliable than Trump. Given the softness of the number and that polls on related issues gave a different impression, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-06368	On George Allen's U.S. senate candidacy.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/nov/03/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-endorsement-george-allen-full-flop/	Some of the sharpest criticism of George Allen’s bid to regain his old seat in the U.S. Senate has come from Corey Stewart, a fellow Republican who is chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors. "George Allen would be a terrible candidate for the Republican party in 2012," Stewart said in a TV interview on Jan. 24, 2011, the day Allen announced his candidacy. "He's got the baggage, he ran a poor campaign in 2006, and he never acted as a conservative when he was in the U.S. Senate." At the time, Stewart was considering running against Allen for Virginia’s 2012 Republican senate nomination. He lauded Allen as a "great governor" from 1994 to 1998. But Stewart said Allen’s term in the Senate, from 2001 to 2007, was "mediocre." "He did nothing to control the expansion and the growth of the federal government during his tenure in the Senate,"Stewart said. He faulted Allen -- who lost his reelection bid in 2006 to Democrat Jim Webb -- for supporting budgets that increased debt and backing the expansion of Medicare. "George Allen is part of the problem, not the solution," Stewart said in an article that ran in The Washington Times on Dec. 28, 2010. In several interviews, Stewart even expressed revulsion Allen’s often-stated reverence for Thomas Jefferson’s views on limited government. "Frankly, it makes by stomach turn a bit because Thomas Jefferson would not have voted to expand the scope of the federal government," he said in the Jan. 24 TV interview. "Jefferson would be rolling over in his grave if he heard Allen quote him," Stewart said in a Jan. 25 article in The Washington Post. Let’s fast forward to Nov. 1, 2011, when Stewart, appeared at a news conference with Allen. "I hereby endorse and give my full support to George Allen for the United States Senate in 2012," he said. Stewart was asked about his characterization of Allen as a "mediocre" senator. "All in all, I’ve got to say that I retract that statement and I have to say he had a very good senate record," he said. What explains the change? Stewart, in a phone interview, said his negative comments about Allen earlier this year were fueled by his own interest in running for the Senate in 2012 -- an ambition he has since dropped. "Obviously, that colored my view," he said. "I’m an ambitious fellow, I’ll be frank about that, and at that point I was only seeing the bad (in Allen)." Although Stewart said he still does not agree with some of the votes Allen cast during his first term, he is convinced that Allen would compile a more conservative record if he is elected to the Senate again. "The country has changed," he said. "There’s been a huge wake-up signal sent by the Tea Party that they no longer want a wishy-washy Republican Party. They want a party that pares back the role of government and spending. George gets that." Stewart also said Allen offers the best hope in next year’s Senate race for defeating former Gov. Tim Kaine, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Stewart’s endorsement of Allen is not a difficult case for on our Flip-O-Meter. Anytime a politician totally recants an earlier position, as Stewart has done, we rate it a Full Flop.

pomt-10777	"First, he was in favor of my plan, now he's attacking it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/17/joe-biden/richardson-first-said-it-might-work/	Among the field of Democratic candidates, Sen. Joe Biden has had a detailed, long-standing plan for an Iraq exit that he's promoted at debates and other venues. The other candidates have discussed the feasibility of various points of his plan, particularly whether a decentralized government is the solution for bringing peace among the Sunnis, Shias and Kurds. Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico, has spoken favorably of the Biden plan at least twice at public forums. At an Aug. 19, 2007, debate, he said there was a serious need for a reconciliation process in Iraq, adding "I believe Joe Biden's plan has potential, a possible partition." But he also emphasized that, unlike Biden's plan, Richardson is in favor of full withdrawal. In a Christian Science Monitor story dated Sept. 26, 2006, Richardson said, "I would set a timetable for withdrawal. I would couple that with a political solution of the three ethic groups forcing them to have a political solution. … I would also study Senator Biden's federation [proposal]. I think that may be ultimately the right solution." But in October 2007, Richardson issued a statement harshly critical of the Biden plan: "Senator Biden's plan to leave troops in Iraq means his plan has very little chance to succeed. The parties will not even sit down in a meaningful way until we get all the forces out. … Using U.S. peacekeepers in Iraq would turn the guarantors into targets, thus plunging any settlement back into war." Richardson's early support for the Biden plan was not unequivocal – it included qualifications, such as saying the plan had "potential" and needed more study. But he also voluntarily praised the plan by name, and now he's singling it out for criticism. So we give Biden's flip-flop charge a mostly true rating.

pomt-04783	Initial efforts to strip airport contractors of their special diversity status "has no effect" on the contracts or the city’s diversity goals.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/24/sonji-jacobs/efforts-strip-airport-contractors-diversity-status/	The messy, high-stakes process of awarding millions of dollars in contracts to sell food and other stuff at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport managed to get even messier in recent months. Some winners received special consideration because they count as "disadvantaged" firms under federal law, or ones that are run by women or minorities who are small-business owners. But the Federal Aviation Administration says that four of these businesses don’t qualify as "disadvantaged" at all. It’s trying to strip them of their status and asked state officials to start the process. The state hasn’t, and things are at a standstill. But if proceedings did start, it would be business as usual for these "airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprises" or ACDBEs, said Sonji Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. It "has no effect on the concessions contracts or the city's ACDBE goals" Jacobs told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an Aug. 10 article. This perplexed us. This tangle with the feds sounds serious. Will the start of proceedings really have so little impact? PolitiFact Georgia asked Jacobs and others for more information, and we packed up the Truth-O-Meter for an excursion into the murky world of federal contracts, regulations and diversity goals. Bear with us. It’s complicated. Hartsfield-Jackson receives millions of dollars in transportation funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation for things such as upgrading runways or terminals. These dollars come with strings attached. The federal government requires the city-run airport to try to give "disadvantaged" small businesses a certain percentage of the aviation hub’s lucrative contracts. In Georgia, the state Department of Transportation figures out whether certain contractors meet the federal definition of "disadvantaged." Businesses gain this certification if "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51 percent interest and also control management and daily business operations," according to the federal Department of Transportation’s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization. Also, the net worth of owners and the money the business makes can’t exceed federal limits. If a disadvantaged business wins a city contract, it counts toward the airport’s diversity goals, which helps the city stay in the good graces of the federal DOT. If the airport doesn’t meet its goals, that may be fine as well. The city doesn’t have to meet a diversity quota, according to the regulations. It simply has to act "in good faith" to get there. But FAA officials think Hartsfield-Jackson contractors Atlanta Restaurant Partners, Vida Concessions Inc. and Hojeij Branded Foods fell short because minorities do not truly control them. The FAA also said the personal net worth of Mack II’s owner was too high, and he did not provide enough documentation. They ordered GDOT to begin decertification proceedings earlier this month. Now, back to our fact check. To prove that the start of decertification proceedings "has no effect on the concessions contracts or the city's ACDBE goals," Jacobs pointed us to federal regulations for the disadvantaged business program. We asked an FAA spokeswoman for her input. She referred us to these regulations as well. We took a look and found that they tell cities and others that receive federal transportation money that a business keeps its disadvantaged business status until proceedings are over: "A firm remains an eligible DBE during the pendency of your proceeding to remove its eligibility," Title 49 states. Since there is no change in status, there’s no change in whether the airport meets its disadvantaged business goals. The decertification process could take months. These businesses have a right to a hearing. If they lose, they can appeal to the federal DOT. If this fails, they can dispute the decision in federal court. Even if these four businesses lose their status, their contracts may stand. We found no regulation that states that the federal DOT has the power to order the airport to drop a contract if a business is decertified. It may, however, mean the city fails to meet its disadvantaged business goals, according to the regulations. Such a failure wouldn’t necessarily mean Hartsfield-Jackson will face punishment. "You cannot be penalized, or treated by the Department as being in noncompliance with this rule, because your DBE participation falls short of your overall goal, unless you have failed to administer your program in good faith," regulations state.

pomt-11295	"Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/apr/20/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-credits-obamacare-helping-pay-opioid/	The Affordable Care Act is helping people in Ohio get the treatment they need for opioid addiction, said U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. "Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act," he said in an April 9 speech to the City Club of Cleveland. This is a common talking point by Brown, who will face the winner of the May 8 Republican primary that features U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci and businessman Mike Gibbons, among other candidates. Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid as part of the 2010 federal health care law, and is one of the hardest hit states in the nation by the opioid epidemic. Experts have said that the program for the poor has helped treat those with opioid addiction. Brown was citing a valid study about the Affordable Care Act, but he didn’t precisely explain what the researchers found. We learned it is difficult to pinpoint how many have gotten this type of treatment as a result of the law. Affordable Care Act and opioid treatment Brown cited research by Harvard Medical School. The research, conducted by health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied, was released in January 2017 when Republicans were vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, though that didn’t happen. "Repealing the ACA — and its behavioral health provisions — would have stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses," the researchers concluded. Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, of whom about 222,000 have an opioid disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed. In Ohio, the researchers found that 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. (Brown said "right now," but this data is two years old.) About 151,200 obtained coverage through the Medicaid expansion and 69,225 obtained plans through the marketplace. While Brown specifically said that 200,000 were getting opioid treatment, the research was more broad, because it addresses addiction and mental health disorders in general. Sometimes Brown has more precisely explained that 200,000 figure, including in a press statement when the study was released. But at other times, he has said that 200,000 Ohioans were getting opioid treatment through the Affordable Care Act. One of the researchers confirmed for PolitiFact that the 220,000 figure referred to significant behavioral health or substance use disorder needs. "The data we had analyzed do not indicate how many in this group used substance use treatment services," said Glied of NYU. It’s clear that more broadly, Medicaid expansion has helped Ohioans seek drug treatment. Glied said that about half of all medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse treatment in Ohio is paid by Medicaid. Brown’s office spokeswoman, Jennifer Donahue, pointed to news reports showing that 500,000 low-income Ohio adults received mental health and addiction services under the state’s Medicaid expansion, including many for drug addiction. Donahue also cited news reports showing Republican Gov. John Kasich credited the Medicaid expansion for helping treat opioid addicts. Other health care experts, including the Kaiser Family Foundation, have expressed similar views that the Affordable Care Act will play a key role in tackling the opioid epidemic. Spokespersons for state departments of health, addiction services and Medicaid told us they didn’t have any data showing how many Ohioans had received opioid treatment as a result of the Affordable Care Act. However, between the time Ohio expanded Medicaid in 2014 through August 2017, more than 633,000 Ohioans with behavioral health needs had accessed services, including addiction treatment and mental health, through expanded Medicaid coverage. But we don’t know how many in this group received opioid treatment. The state data suggests that those receiving services may be even higher than the Harvard study, which was based on 2016 data, if we include additional years. Our ruling Brown said, "Right now in Ohio 200,000 people are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care Act." Harvard and New York University researchers concluded that about 220,000 people with addiction or mental health disorders had coverage through the Affordable Care Act, either through Medicaid expansion or purchasing insurance on the exchange, in 2016. But Brown oversimplified the study. The statistic is more broad than those who have received treatment for opioid addiction. Other state data suggest the number could be higher than 220,000, if we include multiple years. Brown’s general point that the Affordable Care Act has benefited people who need opioid treatment is supported by experts. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-07799	When it comes to taking cuts in tough budget times, Wisconsin "state workers haven’t had to sacrifice."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/18/club-growth/group-says-wisconsin-state-workers-havent-had-sacr/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s proposal to impose cuts on public workers without bargaining has become the latest flash point in a longstanding debate over the compensation for public employees. In lobbying for Walker’s proposal, the conservative advocacy group Wisconsin Club for Growth has launched a TV and radio campaign that argues state employees have been exempt from cutbacks even in the recession. The group’s TV ad uses a backdrop of newspaper headlines about job-saving union concessions at private firms -- Harley-Davidson, Mercury Marine and Sub-Zero Appliance. The ad notes Wisconsinites "all across" the state have accepted wage freezes, pay cuts and are paying more for health care. Then, over an ominous piano soundtrack, the narrator adds: "But state workers haven’t had to sacrifice. They pay next to nothing for their pensions, and a fraction of their health care. It’s not fair. Call your state legislator and tell them to vote for Gov. Walker’s budget repair bill. It’s time state employees paid their fair share, just like the rest of us." That’s a broad -- and powerful -- claim, that there has been no sacrifice from state workers. But is it true? Officials with the Club for Growth -- Deb Jordahl and R.J. Johnson -- told us the ad meant to highlight just two issues regarding state employee compensation: pension and health care payments. So we’ll start there. We covered some of this ground in a Feb. 8, 2011 item that evaluated a statement by Walker that "most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums and it would still be half the national average." We rated it True. The item found that unionized state workers pay about 4 percent to 5 percent of their health insurance premiums. In contrast, a Kaiser Family Foundation study put the employee share paid by state and local government workers nationwide at 25 percent for family coverage. Meanwhile, on pensions, most public workers in Wisconsin contribute nothing or very little to their pensions. Walker's plan would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs -- typically 5.8 percent of pay for state workers -- and at least 12 percent of their health care costs. That does not apply to police, firefighters and state troopers. Under the budget repair bill, public-safety unions would be exempt from the changes. They would continue to bargain for benefits under current laws while other unions would lose the right to bargain on benefits and working conditions. So the ad is on target in pointing out that the situation for state workers -- even after the Great Recession -- compares favorably to the private sector. But the pension and health care points are framed around the assertion state workers have not sacrificed at all. That’s a bigger question, and calls for a look backwards -- not just forward. On health care and pensions, state employees have been asked to give more -- though in modest amounts compared to the private sector. The portion of health premiums paid by employees more than doubled under then-Gov. Jim Doyle, from 2.5 percent to 5.6 percent in 2011. We looked at that when we evaluated a statement from Doyle, who said he "had to impose tougher cost controls on state employees" than any previous Wisconsin governor. We rated that statement Mostly True. On pensions, the vast majority of state employees paid nothing toward their pensions until January 2011, when they were required to contribute 0.2 percent -- two-tenths of 1 percent -- of their pay. But the most notable change for state workers has come on pay. The Club for Growth ad dramatically highlights "frozen wages" and "pay cuts" accepted by unions at the private companies -- and then says "state workers haven’t had to sacrifice." In fact, state workers have taken a hit on wages -- in the form of furlough days. To deal with his own state budget problems, Doyle required employees to take eight unpaid furlough days in both the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 budget years, saving an estimated $208 million over the two-year period. That's a 3.1 percent reduction in wages annually. The average pay per full-time equivalent state worker was $54,900, according to the latest census report on government payrolls. Doyle said he used the furlough days to avoid widespread layoffs -- the same argument Walker is using for his plan. Indeed, fewer than 150 state workers (not including the University of Wisconsin System) were laid off from 2007 through 2010, state figures show. That’s 0.4percent. That compares to the state losing more than 155,000 jobs overall since the recession began -- about 5.6 percent. Doyle also rescinded 2 percent raises for non-union employees in the 2007-2009 state budget. Under Doyle, raises averaged 1.21 percent per year. We found that was less than under the previous four elected governors dating back to 1971. Doyle also suspended merit awards in November 2008. In the previous two years, the state had given out 2,600 of those awards, totaling $11.4 million, according to the state Department of Administration. So state workers have in fact given up some pay, which is the definition of sacrifice. The Club for Growth officials note that the furloughs did not affect base pay going forward, and that Walker has said he will not continue furloughs in exchange for the pension and health care benefits cuts. "Plus they get to keep their jobs," Jordahl said of Walker’s plan. But, again, the ad argues for changes in the future. Its assertion is there was no sacrifice in the past. What’s the bottom line? The Club for Growth, lobbying for Walker’s plan to trim state employee compensation, claims state workers "have not had to sacrifice" while the private sector has reeled from jobs losses, pay cuts and increased responsibility for pension and health care benefits. Their claim as it relates to health and pension benefits -- the focus of Walker’s proposal -- is pretty much on target. But pay is also part of the equation -- a big part -- and on that score state workers took 3 percent pay cuts in the form of furloughs, among other wage-related cutbacks. On the Truth-O-Meter, the definition of Barely True is a statement that "contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That fits. And that is our rating of the ad’s "no sacrifice" claim. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Club for Growth	None	None	None	2011-02-18T15:13:23	2011-02-18	['Wisconsin']
pomt-09393	"War for the soul of the TxDems: 57% of Dem incumbents for Tx House LOST their primary."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/25/republican-party-texas/texas-gop-says-57-percent-texas-house-democrats-tu/	Democrats gained 12 seats in the Texas House in elections and thanks to one party switch from 2004 through 2008, though a seat went the other way in 2009 when an East Texas member switched parties. Now the Republican Party of Texas sees Democratic weakening in the results of this year's March primaries. That’s of interest because Republicans seek to widen their 77-73 House edge on Democrats in November's general election while Democrats hope they can win the three additional seats they need to gain the majority. In a Twitter post on the morning of March 10, the GOP states: "War for the soul of the TxDems: 57% of Dem incumbents for Tx House LOST their primary." Hold the horses: Did nearly six in 10 House Democrats lose re-election all of a hurry — and if so, where was that story told? GOP spokesman Bryan Preston told us the 57 percent figure, which the party repeated in a second Twitter post that day, reflects the fact that four of seven House Democrats who had opponents lost their primaries. The losers were Reps. Terri Hodge of Dallas, Al Edwards of Houston, Dora Olivo of Rosenberg and Tara Rios Ybarra of South Padre Island. But that's an incomplete way of analyzing the results. It overlooks 64 Democratic incumbents who didn't have opponents and were renominated and Rep. Norma Chavez of El Paso, who faces an April runoff. The 64 unopposed incumbents are set to stand for re-election in November. One Democratic incumbent, David Farabee of Wichita Falls, didn’t seek re-election. Punch line: Some 67 of 72 Democratic incumbents on the March 2 ballot qualified for the November ballot. Take them into account and the share of incumbents who lost their primary drops to nearly 7 percent. Preston reminded us, correctly, that in order to lose a primary "one must face a primary challenge, and of those state House Democrat incumbents who were challenged in the primary, 57 percent lost." If the party had included the word "opposed" in front of "incumbents," there'd be no confusion. It could have done so within the 140-character limit set by Twitter. Preston said: "If I had it to do over again, I would certainly throw 'opposed' in there." The GOP's item misrepresents the overall results for Democratic House incumbents. We rate the party's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15298	"We borrow a million dollars every minute."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/21/rand-paul/rand-paul-us-borrows-1-million-minute/	At a campaign rally in Houston, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., talked about one of his favorite dislikes: the national debt. "You have people in Washington who do things you would never, ever approve of," said Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, in his July 17, 2015, remarks. "I’ll give you an idea. Does anybody here think it’s a good idea to borrow money from China to send it to Pakistan? We borrow a million dollars every minute." Does the country really borrow a million a minute? We decided to check it out. To evaluate Paul’s claim, we considered the federal deficit -- the difference between the government’s revenue intake and spending, which in recent years has been negative. To raise cash to keep the government running under a deficit, the Treasury has to take on debt. There are 525,600 minutes in a year, so borrowing $1 million a minute would mean the government borrows $525 billion a year. The federal deficit in fiscal year 2014 was $483 billion. The Congressional Budget Office’s projected deficit for 2015 is $486 billion. So Paul’s claim is a little high -- by about $40 billion a year -- but not too far off. Of course, though, it’s not as though the country is literally borrowing $1 million every single minute. Though while the national debt is growing overall, the debt accumulates unevenly, in fits and starts, from day to day as specific bills come due. Let’s also add some context. While in recent years, the country has borrowed "a million dollars every minute," this is actually a big improvement from the rate during the Great Recession. Based on the same calculation we used earlier, the government borrowed more than $2.6 million a minute in 2009, at the height of the recession. That rate has slowed every year since. Additionally, the million-a-minute number doesn’t look so dramatic when you compare it to the fact that the U.S. economy generates about $33 million per minute in income, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in law, economics and the national debt at George Washington University Law School. Economists generally agree that debt and deficits are only meaningful as a percentage of a country's income, rather than as a raw number, Buchanan added. The Congressional Budget Office graph below shows the spike in federal budget deficit as a percentage of America’s gross domestic product over time. The longest bar (biggest deficit as a percentage of GDP) is 2009 -- at the height of the Great Recession. In the recovery period since, the deficit has declined, but projections show it possibly growing in the future. "The question should be how fast the debt is growing in relation to GDP. If GDP is growing faster, then the country can service the debt," said Linda Bilmes, a professor and expert in national budgetary issues at Harvard University. Our ruling Paul said, "We borrow a million dollars every minute." For the country to borrow $1 million a minute, the annual government deficit would have to be about $525 billion. In 2014, the deficit was $483 billion, and it’s projected to be $486 billion in 2015. So Paul’s estimate is a little on the high side. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13148	Says Ohio’s I-X Center "used to be a great plant," but "thousands of people of worked here, and they left" when their jobs were moved overseas.	false	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/31/donald-trump/trump-mistakes-exhibition-hall-abandoned-factory/	At a rally outside Cleveland, Donald Trump tried to tie his dire message about an outsourcing economy to the venue at which he appeared. "I want to thank Patrick Park and Ray Park, they own this building," Trump said in his introduction on Oct. 22 at the I-X Center, an exhibition hall near Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Brook Park, Ohio. "They do such a great job, it’s incredible and it’s an honor." He professed fondness for Cleveland, and said, "In 17 days we are going to win the great state of Ohio, and we are going to win the White House. Together we’re going to deliver real change that once again puts America first." Trump continued, "As an example, this used to be a great plant. Thousands and thousands of people worked here, and they left. So many people are leaving, so many people are closing their businesses and moving to Mexico and other countries. Not going to happen anymore, we’re going to tell you why, but not going to happen anymore." We wanted to know whether one of the prime convention sites for Northeast Ohio was formerly a hoppin’ manufacturing plant. Here’s what history told us. The I-X Center was originally built in 1942 for the U.S. Defense Department during World War II, according to Case Western Reserve University’s Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. It became known as the Cleveland Tank Plant or the Cleveland Bomber plant, and under General Motors it employed 15,000 people who built parts for the B-29 bomber. The plant closed when the war ended, and the city of Cleveland retained it as an exhibition hall and sales center before leasing it to National Terminals for the storage of soybeans. The facility resumed wartime service in 1950, when GM’s Cadillac Division chose it as the manufacturing site for Army tanks destined for battle in Korea. GM immediately employed 6,000 workers, but after two years of production, the Army rejected the Cadillac Tank Plant’s output due to a problem with the gun mechanism. After a redesign of the gun sight, the plant produced Walker Bulldog tanks used in the Korean war between 1953 and 1955. Production ceased on the Walker Bulldogs in 1959. Cadillac won a new military contract in 1960 to build the self-propelled T195 and T196 howitzer tanks and M114 armored personnel carriers. In 1965, GM shifted the management of the Cleveland Tank Plant to its Allison Division. It made M551 16-ton Sheridan tanks up to 1972, when the contract was completed and Congress decided against its renewal. The U.S. Defense Department sold the plant to the Park Corporation of Charleston, W.Va., in 1977, which opened it in 1985 as the I-X Center, calling it the "largest single-building exhibition facility in the world." Now, it appears to be the United States’ ninth-largest. Nowhere in the building’s history does it appear that manufacturing was transferred overseas. Military contracts kept the site active for its first 30 years, interrupted by a period in which it stored soybeans. In 1985 it became an exhibition hall, the function it serves today. About an hour after this fact-check was published, the Trump campaign responded in disagreement with our findings. "Mr. Trump used the history of the I-X center as a great manufacturing facility as an introduction to his hour long speech where he talked about issues impacting jobs in Northeast Ohio, and PolitiFact does its readers and its brand a disservice by running such misleading headlines and false ratings," said Seth Unger, the Trump campaign's Ohio spokesman. Our ruling Trump said that Cleveland’s I-X center was an example of a once-great plant, but "thousands and thousands of people worked here, and they left. So many people are leaving, so many people are closing their businesses and moving to Mexico and other countries." Trump’s lamentation of outsourcing isn’t historically accurate. The I-X Center was alternately called the Cleveland Tank Plant, and GM’s Cadillac and Allison Divisions built military bombers, tanks and personnel carriers there between 1942 and 1972. Production stopped when a military contract expired and was not renewed. Once acquired by the Park Corporation, it opened as an exhibition space in 1985 and has operated as one ever since. We rate Trump’s statement False.

pomt-10194	Obama's tax plan cuts taxes "for 95 percent of all working families."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/18/barack-obama/a-credit-for-workers-cuts-taxes-for-middle-class/	With a plummeting stock market grabbing headlines, Barack Obama tackled the economy in a speech in Elko, Nev. "Change means a tax code that doesn’t reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it," Obama said. He then went through a litany of his tax proposals, including, "I will cut taxes — cut taxes — for 95 percent of all working families." We've checked out many claims on taxes . It's a subject area that's ripe for distortion and attack. But with this affirmative claim, Obama appears to be on solid ground. The linchpin here is Obama's tax credit for workers, which is intended to offset payroll taxes. Single people can qualify for a $500 credit; married people filing together could get $1,000. Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts for people who make $200,000 or more if single and $250,000 or more as a married couple. His tax credits would phase out as they approach these incomes. Most people, though, don't make more than $200,000. In fact, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics, about 97 percent of all filers made less than that. Now it's into the nitty-gritty. Obama said his tax plan would reduce taxes for 95 percent of working families. We consulted the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which has created detailed models for how each candidate's tax proposal would affect American taxpayers. The center's complex model includes the indirect effects of certain tax policies, such as Obama's proposed rate increase for corporations. The Tax Policy Center's analysis does not specifically look at the subset of tax filers who are "working families." But the center can make the following statements about Obama's tax proposal, said principal research associate Bob Williams: • 95 percent of all tax filers (working and nonworking) will get a cut in their individual income taxes. • 95 percent of all families with children (working and nonworking) will get a cut in their total federal taxes. Every taxpayer has different individual circumstances, but if you make less than $200,000 a year and you work, we can't see how your taxes would go up under Obama's proposals. IRS data show that 97 percent of tax filers make less than $200,000, so there are even two percentage points worth of leeway there. We rate Obama's statement True. UPDATE: Since we published this item, the Tax Policy Center researched how Obama's tax proposals would affect workers. They concluded 94.3 percent of workers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan; read their research here . This item was also updated to include information on Obama's tax credit phase out.

pomt-06264	"By fiscal year 2013, the state is expected to wipe through [HOPE scholarship] reserve funds."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/28/stacey-evans/hope-fund-pace-run-dry/	Hope can bring about many things. At the Georgia Capitol, hope springs debate. In this case, we’re referring to the HOPE scholarship, which countless Georgia students have used to pay for their college education and is currently in a funding crisis. The state Legislature made significant changes to the HOPE program earlier this year to keep it sustainable, but some lawmakers are still not pleased with some of the new measures. State Rep. Stacey Evans, a HOPE scholar, recently penned an op-ed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution outlining her concerns about the program’s future. It first ran in the AJC’s Get Schooled blog. One line caught our interest. "By fiscal year 2013, the state is expected to wipe through reserve funds and be expected to make even larger cuts to the HOPE program," wrote the Democrat from Smyrna. "This is why it is essential that Georgia consider all new revenue sources to supplement lottery funds." No more reserve funds for HOPE? We wondered if the reserves were in that much trouble. Revenues for HOPE, which come from the state’s lottery, were usually comfortably more than how much the state spent and awarded in scholarships. But spending has caught up to revenues in recent years, as more Georgia students became eligible for the program. HOPE previously funded all public college tuition if students maintained a 3.0 GPA. It also provided some money for books and fees. The changes to HOPE now mean only the state's most accomplished students, about 10 percent of recipients, get full tuition awards. For other students, the scholarship amount depends on lottery revenue. No one gets money for books and fees. A report released on Nov. 4 suggested to us that Evans was way off the mark. The report, put together by the Georgia Student Finance Commission, showed the reserve fund would be at about $420 million by fiscal year 2013, which begins July 1, 2012, and ends June 30, 2013. The commission administers HOPE. Evans pointed us to a portion of Georgia state code, 50-27-13 (b)(3), to explain her point. In essence, it says if the HOPE reserve fund is less than 50 percent of the prior year’s revenues, then the state cannot dip into the reserves. The Nov. 4 report shows revenues, which the report calls "deposits," would be about $853 million by fiscal year 2013, which is slightly more than double the projected reserve fund of $420 million. "Essentially, $400 million is zero," Evans told us. "[The state] won’t have any reserves … unless the lottery makes more money next year." Georgia Student Finance Commission President Tim Connell confirmed that the state could not spend from the reserves if they fall below 50 percent. If the reserve fund falls below 50 percent of revenues, then the state would cut spending to get back to that 50 percent level. For example, if the reserve fund is below 50 percent of revenues by $5, then the state would cut its budget by $5. "Since you can’t use it, the reserves will be wiped out," Evans, an attorney, told us. "I really think it would be more misleading to let the public think there’s $400 million in reserves. … The truth is the money available for scholarships is wiped out." Evans believes the state should lower the percentage of how low the reserve fund in relation to actual revenues could be before officials are prohibited from dipping into it to help pay for the HOPE program.

pomt-10374	John McCain "opposed legislation to fund levees and flood control programs, which he considers pork."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/25/barack-obama/he-didnt-brand-them-all-pork/	Sen. John McCain has a reputation as a loud critic of political pork, especially the projects that get stuffed into Congress' periodic water bills. McCain says the water projects are overly political, which means Congress approves low-priority or marginal projects simply so members can bring home the bacon. McCain's reputation as a reformer has bolstered his image as a fiscal conservative. But it can also be a liability, particularly when flood victims are complaining that the federal government didn't do enough to prevent a disaster. And it's not just McCain. The existing Army Corps of Engineers process has been widely criticized in government reports and audits for exaggerating the benefits and underestimating the negative effects of water projects and not getting its priorities straight. During a June 21, 2008, address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Miami, Sen. Barack Obama branded McCain a cheapskate who views every local project as "pork," and chastised McCain for visiting flood victims in Iowa while opposing funding for projects to prevent such disasters. "Both Sen. McCain and I have traveled recently to the areas that have been devastated by floods, and I know that Sen. McCain felt as strongly as I did … enormous sympathy for the victims of the recent flooding," Obama said. "And I'm sure they appreciated the sentiment, but they probably would have appreciated it even more if Sen. McCain hadn't opposed legislation to fund levees and flood control programs, which he considers pork." Obama was referring to McCain's opposition to a water resources bill that Congress debated last year that would have authorized $23.2-billion for more than 900 Army Corps projects and studies. The legislation included $3.9-billion for a system of new locks and dams and environmental restoration for the upper Mississippi River and Illinois waterway system. The bill also carried an "earmark," inserted by members of Iowa's congressional delegation, to funnel $6.9-million into work on the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers, the spot where a levee break the weekend of June 14 and 15 forced an evacuation and heavily damaged several dozen homes and businesses. It's true that McCain was out front imploring his Senate colleagues to vote against a final agreement on the bill, arguing that it would increase the Army Corps' backlog of unfinished projects by $23.2-billion. Echoing statements from earlier debates on previous water resources legislation, McCain on Sept. 24, 2007 said, "It is time that we end this process of blind spending, throwing money at projects that may or may not benefit the larger good. Shouldn't we be doing all that we can to reform the Corps and ensure that the most urgent projects are being funded and constructed? Or are we more content with needless earmarks — too often at the expense of projects that are of most need?" Congress didn't heed McCain's advice and subsequently adopted the agreement in an 81-12 vote. President Bush then vetoed the bill, citing some of the same concerns McCain raised. The House and Senate overrode the veto in November 2007, marking the first time Congress enacted a law over Bush's objections. Both McCain and Obama were busy campaigning and missed the votes. While Obama correctly identifies one area where McCain has criticized politically sensitive local spending priorities, he is not telling the entire story. Earlier in the year, McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., unsuccessfully proposed amendments to the water resources bill that would have established independent reviews to prioritize federal water projects according to the ability of each to reduce the risk to human life, property and the environment. In calling for the changes, McCain cited instances of botched oversight, including one 2002 case in which costs associated with the Sacramento River Flood Protection Project in California rose from $114-million to $500-million. McCain said changing the process as he and Feingold proposed would have ensured that the levees that failed in Iowa and Missouri would have been given highest priority and would have been fixed first. But McCain has been far more willing to talk about bad projects than exemplary ones, which allows Obama to portray his position in broad strokes. Moreover, McCain over the past decade has a history of missing votes on or voting against the annual spending bills that fund some of the water and energy projects. That, too, gives credence to Obama's charge that McCain is categorically opposed to levee and flood control efforts. McCain's campaign responded by portraying Obama as resistant to true reform efforts. It noted the Illinois senator voted against the first attempt to prioritize the Army Corps work in May 2007 — a sign, it said, that Obama was willing to put parochial interests over life-saving flood mitigation. As further proof, McCain's campaign noted that Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. — one of Obama's most fervent campaign supporters — allied herself with McCain and Feingold's effort. McCain was out front in urging the Senate to reject the water resources bill and he has been consistent in branding the government's process for funding those projects to be an exercise in pork-barrel spending. But McCain is not just a naysayer on water projects, he has been advancing an argument about how spending priorities are set for water projects. And proposing a way to change it. We find Obama's claim to be oversimplifying McCain's record and his position on water project funding and we rate it Half True.

pomt-14026	"It was allowed," referring to her email practices.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/31/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-hillary-clintons-claim-her-email-pra/	Hillary Clinton is sticking to her defense that her use of a private email server while secretary of state was "allowed," despite a critical independent audit that found it really wasn’t. In a May 26 interview, ABC reporter Liz Kreutz asked Clinton about her decision to use a server located in her New York home instead of a government email, as well as the audit, which was conducted by the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General. "But this report said that you, quote, 'had an obligation to discuss' using your personal email and that you didn’t," Kreutz said. "So how can you really say that it was allowed? Was it an error of judgment?" Clinton replied: "Well it was allowed, and the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice. Having said that, I have said many times that it was a mistake, and if I could go back I would do it differently." Since the news of Clinton’s email came to light in 2015, she has argued that she "complied with every rule" and that the practice was "allowed." We haven’t yet put the issue on the Truth-O-Meter because there were too many unknowns. But the inspector general’s report has clarified some of those unknowns and demonstrated that Clinton’s exclusive use of personal email was, in fact, not allowed. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon told PolitiFact that in this specific interview, Clinton was making the point that some personal email use is permitted. She wasn’t disputing the inspector general’s finding that her exclusive use of personal email was not permitted. But for anyone unaware of that nuance — say, the average voter — it sounds like Clinton is defending her email practices as a whole, as something that was fully permitted by the State Department, which is the argument she has been making all along. And that’s just not right. The gist of the problem is that Clinton never asked anyone if she could use her personal email setup. And the report seems to find that if she had asked, the policy was clear that such a request should have been rejected. "The private email server was only allowed in the sense that no one managed to prevent it from happening," said John Wonderlich, director of policy at the Sunlight Foundation, which promotes government transparency. First of all, the State Department’s policy as of 2005 (Clinton joined in 2009) is that all day-to-day operations are to be conducted on the official State Department information channel. Clinton never once used this State Department email system. And if an employee needs to use a personal email for conducting official business, he or she has an "obligation" to consult with the chief information officer and the assistant secretary for diplomatic security. However, Clinton did neither. These two offices told the inspector general that they "did not — and would not — approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business, because of the restrictions in the (Foreign Affairs Manual) and the security risks in doing so." She also didn’t consult the Bureau of Information Resource Management, which she was supposed to do if she needed to send sensitive but unclassified information over non-departmental channels. Many of her emails contain this kind of information. Further, Clinton needed to show that her personal email had the proper security features to send sensitive but unclassified information. While Clinton has said her private server was secure, she did not formally demonstrate this to the State Department. Clinton also didn’t comply fully with records management expectations. Notably, she did not ensure that her work-related emails were preserved on the State Department system in real time, nor did she surrender them when she left office. The inspector general and the National Archives and Records Administration say Clinton’s retroactive turnover of 30,000 emails has mitigated this problem somewhat, but the record is incomplete — with certain chunks of time and correspondence missing from her email vault. Fallon pointed PolitiFact to a May 26 CNN interview where Clinton said that at the time she made the decision to use a private server, she "thought it was allowed." And campaign chair John Podesta wrote in an email to supporters: "Had Secretary Clinton known of any concerns about her email setup at the time, she would have taken steps to address them. She believed she was following the practices of other Secretaries and senior officials." But it’s hard not to be skeptical of the narrative that Clinton was ignorant of the rules when the assistant secretary for diplomatic security sent a memo directly to Clinton in March 2011 that urged employees to "minimize the use of personal web email for business," citing cybersecurity concerns. Three months later, a similar email went out to all staff, sent under Clinton’s name. According to the audit, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security employees tried to get Clinton to use a department-issued BlackBerry smartphone as soon as she took office, but they were unsuccessful. In fairness to Clinton, the inspector general found 90 individuals in the State Department who used their personal email for business. One of her predecessors, Colin Powell, also used personal email exclusively. However, the rules regarding email records preservation were a lot less clear under Powell, who served from January 2001 to January 2005, than under Clinton. And the rules became even more explicit in 2014, after Clinton left office, clearly stating that "personal accounts should only be used in exceptional circumstances." In any case, experts said Clinton should have known better. "Given that the secretary of state was responsible for promoting State Department policies and enforcing them, she should be precluded from claiming she did not know about or understand them," said Douglas Cox, a law professor at City University of New York who studies records preservation. Our ruling Regarding her decision to use a private email server, Clinton said, "It was allowed." No one ever stopped Clinton from conducting work over her private email server exclusively. But that’s not the same thing as it being allowed. Offices within the State Department told an independent inspector general that if she had asked, they would not have allowed it. The report from the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General shatters one of Clinton’s go-to phrases about her email practice.

pomt-12256	Says Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Milton Hirsch "is constantly overturned."	false	/florida/statements/2017/jul/11/richard-corcoran/richard-corcoran-fails-prove-claim-miami-judge-mil/	Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran disagreed with a ruling by a Miami judge that Florida’s updated "stand your ground" self-defense law is unconstitutional. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Milton Hirsch ruled that state legislators overstepped their authority in modifying the law earlier this year to force prosecutors to disprove a defendant’s self-defense claim at a pre-trial hearing. Any such change should have been crafted by the Florida Supreme Court rather than the state Legislature, he ruled. Hirsch’s July 3 ruling doesn’t apply statewide, but it does start the process that could ultimately lead to Florida Supreme Court review. Corcoran, a Land O’Lakes Republican and lawyer, laid out his opposition to Hirsch’s ruling in three tweets: "It is the role of the Legislature to write the laws that govern how Floridians may exercise their statutory and constitutional rights. The Florida House will continue to stand with ordinary citizens who exercise their right to self-defense. There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned. We look forward to this decision being reversed on appeal." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Corcoran’s spokesman provided no data about how often Hirsch is overturned. Instead, Fred Piccolo pointed to a handful of cases in which Hirsch had been overturned and one case that remains pending in appeals. "The speaker used the term ‘constantly overturned’ -- which is not quantifiable," Piccolo said. "But the insinuation is that the judge has been overturned on substantive/controversial issues often." Judge Hirsch’s record on appeals Hirsch has handled thousands of cases since he was elected in 2010. PolitiFact searched for Hirsch’s individual rulings in the Third District Court of Appeal and found that he was upheld about 160 times. We found that the appeals court overturned Hirsch six times. In six other cases he was upheld in part and reversed in part. (In a couple of other cases, the appeals court was critical of actions by Hirsch. The court disagreed with his ruling as a substitute judge in one case, and in another case the court said he should have granted a prosecutor’s motion to recuse himself.) (Hat tip to Carolina Bolado, a writer for Law 360, who looked at Hirsch’s appeals record first.) We sent a summary of our findings to a spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade courts, Eunice Sigler. She didn’t dispute our overall findings but offered caveats related to a couple of cases, including that in one case the appeals court reversed based upon a Florida Supreme Court decision that occurred after the judge ruled. We interviewed five law professors and all of them rejected the idea that Hirsch is "constantly overturned." Stetson law professor Charles Rose described Corcoran’s statement as "scurrilous." "I don’t think there is any credible evidence that the judge is prone to being overturned," he said. "A comment on how often a judge is overturned is an example of what we teach as ‘pivoting.’ When you are losing an argument you are making, you want to pivot and change the conversation." The fact that a judge has been appealed doesn’t mean the judge is right or wrong, Rose said. There is a valuable purpose in the appeals process. "If judges weren’t willing to be overturned, the law couldn’t grow and change to reflect society," he said. University of Florida professor Darren Lenard Hutchinson said it would be extremely rare for a trial judge's rulings to be "constantly overturned." "Doctrines in federal and state courts often require appeals courts to extend deference to lower courts, particularly regarding findings of fact," he said. While judges and lawyers keep an eye on overturned cases, a more interesting question is whether a judge takes a stand on high-profile controversial legal issues, said Nova professor Megan Chaney. "This just means he has the courage to do his job and force the appellate courts to clarify the law where it is unclear or potentially unconstitutional," she said. Corcoran cited Hirsch’s rulings in a handful of notable cases Piccolo pointed to an article in the Miami Herald that summarized some of Hirsch’s other high-profile rulings including some that had been overturned. Here is a summary: State vs. James Lacroix: In March, Hirsch ruled that Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez’s decision to allow county jails to hold undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation by federal agents was unconstitutional. The county is appealing. State vs. Gaiter: In 2016, Hirsch ruled that a new death-penalty sentencing structure was unconstitutional because it didn’t require a unanimous jury verdict. The Florida Supreme Court ruled the same months later in a separate case. State vs. Bailey: An attorney stole $700,000 from a trust account. Hirsch sentenced him to probation only. The court reversed Hirsch and called for the imposition of a prison term. State vs. Borrego: A prosecutor made a motion for Hirsch to recuse himself based on his comments about fingerprints in another case, but Hirsch suggested that the prosecutor file a motion to disqualify him. The appeals court ruled that Hirsch should have granted the prosecutor’s motion. Hall vs. Ryan: Hirsch, acting as a substitute judge, released a man convicted of child abuse accused of violating probation on his own recognizance on the condition that he stay away from a minor. The appeals court ruled that Hirsch didn’t have jurisdiction to revisit the presiding judge’s decision to hold the defendant in custody without bond. State vs. Washington: When a Tampa federal judge ruled in 2011 that Florida's drug law was unconstitutional, Hirsch was the only local state judge to follow suit, the Herald wrote. He tossed out more than two dozen cases, but Miami's appeals court later reversed Hirsch. Our ruling Following Hirsch’s ruling in a "stand your ground" case, Corcoran tweeted "There's a reason this judge is constantly overturned." But Corcoran didn’t point to any data about how often Hirsch has been overturned after ruling in thousands of cases since 2010. Instead, Corcoran pointed to Hirsch’s rulings in six other cases. Corcoran is exaggerating when he suggests this handful of cases constitutes being "constantly overturned." We found Hirsch had been upheld about 160 times and overturned six times and then affirmed in part in another six cases. We rate this claim False.

pomt-05047	"Unemployment rate dropped in every state that elected a Republican gov. in 2010"	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/11/john-robitaille/former-ri-gubernatorial-candidate-john-robitaille-/	In his 1906 autobiography Mark Twain wrote "figures often beguile me" in describing their persuasive ability to mislead. John Robitaille, a 2010 Republican candidate for governor in Rhode Island, cited a beguiling statistic when he Tweeted: "Unemployment rate dropped in every state that elected a Republican gov. in 2010" That sure sounded authoritative. We wondered whether it was true and, if so, was there more to the story. Robitaille told PolitiFact his claim came from an item he saw on the website of the late Andrew Breitbart, a conservative blogger and commentator. Indeed the Breitbart blog, quoting an analysis done by Examiner.com -- a Denver-based media company that operates a network of local news websites -- says that in 2010, 17 states that had elected Republican governors had seen a drop in their unemployment rate since January 2011. The website nods to the fact that the unemployment rate also dropped in seven out of eight other states that elected Democratic governors. In fact, we also found that the unemployment rate has fallen in every state but one (New York) in the last year, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. So, in other words, despite the implication in Robitaille’s shorthand claim, there’s no apparent link between the party affiliation of the governor and a decline in the unemployment rate. But it’s worth scrutinizing the assumption that any new governor would have an immediate effect on a state’s unemployment rate. In rating claims like these in the past, PolitiFact has interviewed experts who say it's a stretch to blame -- or praise -- a governor for the complex things that happen in a state economy. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job." "A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder," said Burtless. "The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began." (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Despite this, let’s play devil’s advocate and assume a causal relationship exists between new governors and the unemployment rate. There were 37 gubernatorial races in 2010. In 11 races, the incumbent won and in Rhode Island, Lincoln Chafee, an independent, won. Robert Elliott, the author of the Examiner study, said in an email that he focused on the remaining 25 races because he wanted to compare "new Republican governors vs. new Democratic governors." Overall, he found that in the 17 states that elected Republican governors, the average drop in the unemployment rate was 1.35 percent, compared to an average drop of 0.95 in the eight states that elected Democratic governors. But comparing the newly elected governors from both parties doesn’t make much sense, since some replaced governors of the opposite party and some replaced governors of the same party. Let’s look at just those governors who replaced someone from the opposite party -- cases in which their opportunity to make policy changes would arguably have been most stark. Each of the five Democrats who replaced Republicans actually had a record as good or better than their predecessor over an equivalent period of time. In two cases -- California and Connecticut -- unemployment went up under the Republican predecessor and fell under the Democratic successor. The average decline under the Republican predecessors was 0.3 percentage points, compared to 1.16 percentage points for the Democratic successors -- a decline four times as fast as under the Democrats. Meanwhile, it’s true that in 9 of the 11 cases in which a Republican replaced a Democratic governor, the unemployment-rate decline was steeper under the Republican successor. But the overall differences were modest. The average decrease under the Republican successors was 1.19 percentage points, compared to 0.95 percentage points under the Democratic predecessors. Let’s now look at the six cases in which Republican governors succeeded Republicans in 2010. The predecessor Republicans saw average unemployment decreases of 0.71 percent, a rate that was exceeded by the successor Republicans, who saw unemployment drop by 1.6 percentage points. So Republicans who succeeded Republicans did significantly better than Republicans who succeeded Democrats -- not what you’d expect if the Republicans had some magic formula for success. Meanwhile, the Republican predecessors were less successful than the Democratic predecessors in reducing unemployment, a theme that runs counter to the Examiner study. Our ruling John Robitaille’s Tweet that the unemployment rate had dropped in every state that elected a Republican governor is true as far as it goes. But it is also true that the unemployment rate dropped in seven of the eight states that elected Democratic governors in 2010. The fact that the unemployment rate dropped less than one-half of a percentage point more, on average, in those states that elected Republican governors hardly seems to support the Examiner headline of: "New Republican governors rapidly bringing down unemployment in their states." Particularly when experts question whether new governors can have any direct impact on an unemployment rate. Considering the unemployment rate has fallen in 49 states in the last year, that’s stretching the statistic pretty thin. We find Robitaille’s claim "is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context," our definition of Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Data from the Australian Institute of Criminology shows the rate of homicide victims dying from a gunshot wound has dropped since the reforms came into force, but not consistently in every year. ABS data indicates the rate of assault by firearm causing death has also declined since the reforms, but not in every year. Data from the ABS also indicates the rate of suicide by firearm fell by 67 per cent from 2.1 deaths per 100,000 of the population in 1996 to 0.7 deaths in 2014. However, experts consulted by Fact Check said the impact of Mr Howard's reforms on those declines is debatable. Some research argues the reforms did not significantly influence firearm homicide rates or already falling rates of firearm suicide. Other research argues the reforms accelerated the rates of decline, with one study suggesting firearm suicides dropped by 74 per cent from the 1990-95 average following the buyback scheme. While it is accurate for Mr Howard to assert that gun-related homicides and suicides have dropped since his reforms were implemented, there is more to it. Studies on the impacts of his reforms have come to varied conclusions and experts contacted by Fact Check said other factors would have influenced the drops, even though the reforms are likely to form part of the story.

pomt-12964	"Unlike California, we in Florida welcome driverless cars - no permit required."	true	/florida/statements/2016/dec/28/jeff-brandes/florida-no-permit-needed-driverless-cars-florida-s/	Uber hit the road with self-driving cars in San Francisco in December, but California regulators quickly hit the brakes. In Florida, state Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, saw an opening for the Sunshine state. "Hey @Uber, unlike California we in Florida welcome driverless cars - no permit required. #OpenForBusiness #FlaPol," Brandes tweeted Dec. 22. Brandes, who has been advocating for laws to allow driverless cars, is correct that Florida does not require a permit to operate or test a driverless car. But that doesn’t mean people should expect to hitch an automated ride any time soon. Driverless car laws Several car companies are developing fully autonomous or self-driving cars operated by computers and testing them in some states. But it could be several years before they are broadly publicly available due to the cost, questions about liability and the technology and as state government officials grapple with oversight. In September 2016, federal transportation officials issued loose guidelines for driverless cars which gave companies the green light to push ahead. The rules included safety standards and called for states to come up with uniform policies. Some states have already done so. Since 2011, eight states -- Nevada, California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah -- and the District of Columbia have passed legislation related to autonomous vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Governors in Arizona and Massachusetts issued executive orders related to autonomous vehicles. Legislation has failed or is pending in several other states. The law is more strict in California than Florida. California passed a law in 2012 that allowed the testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads. Companies must apply for state permits and put up a $5 million bond. About 20 companies, including Tesla, Google and Mercedes-Benz, have been granted such permits. California revoked the registration of 16 Uber cars in December 2016 because the state said Uber lacked required permits. Uber complied but argued it didn’t need the permits because the vehicles required monitoring by a person in the car. While California’s law requires a permit, that’s not the case in Florida. "Florida has the least restrictive active state laws for the operation of autonomous vehicles," said John Terwilleger, an attorney at Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart in West Palm Beach. Terwilleger represents a company that is involved in developing and using autonomous vehicles in Florida. In 2012, the Florida Legislature passed a law co-sponsored by Brandes that allowed a person with a valid driver’s license to operate an autonomous vehicle. Before companies could test autonomous cars, they had to submit proof that they had $5 million in insurance. But in 2016, the Florida Legislature passed new rules that eliminated some of the previous requirements, including the $5 million in insurance. The new law also got rid of the requirement that a human operator be present in the vehicle, as long as an operator can be alerted in case of technology failure and stop the vehicle. Since there is no permit for autonomous vehicles, the state has no information regarding how many Floridians own one, said Beth Frady, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. Florida law treats an autonomous vehicle in the same manner as any other motor vehicle operating on our roads, said Chris Spencer, a spokesman for Brandes. "There are no requirements for additional permitting, licensing, or approval from any state or local government body to operate an autonomous vehicle on our roads," he said. That’s still the case, even though Florida was the location of the first fatality involving a self-driving car. In May, Joshua Brown, was killed when his Tesla while on autopilot crashed into a tractor-trailer in Williston. Taking a ride without a driver While Brandes is correct that there is no special permit requirement, don’t expect driverless cars to flood Florida roads anytime soon. When Florida required testers to provide proof of insurance until that provision was dropped earlier this year, only one did. Brandes’ tweet was a shout-out to Uber, so we checked on Uber’s autonomous car plans. Currently, Uber only operates self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, but they still have a human in the driver's seat, said Javi Correoso, an Uber spokesman for Florida. Uber moved its San Francisco cars to Arizona but hasn’t started operating them yet. Another hurdle to Uber’s autonomous cars in Florida is that Uber’s human-driven cars aren’t everywhere in Florida. Only a handful of jurisdictions specifically allow Uber: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Hillsborough counties, as well as the cities of Gainesville and Tallahassee. Correoso said that Uber wants a statewide law to allow for Uber before it would move ahead with driverless cars in Florida. "Until Florida passes statewide regulations, we haven’t even started the process of bringing this technology to Florida," he said. Our ruling Brandes tweeted, "Unlike California, we in Florida welcome driverless cars - no permit required." Florida does not require a permit to operate driverless cars. California requires companies that are testing such cars to get a permit. Although Florida law welcomes driverless cars, we found no evidence that they are commonly used in Florida. Brandes’ comment is accurate, and we rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/233ecdc6-d73c-42fc-8c11-25c35e0380bb	None	Jeff Brandes	None	None	None	2016-12-28T15:00:00	2016-12-22	['California']
pomt-01559	"The Republican Party has the worst reputation in American polling of any political party in history."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/12/maria-cardona/liberal-pundit-gop-has-worst-reputation-american-p/	On CNN’s State of the Union Sept. 7, the political roundtable never strayed far from talk of the upcoming midterm elections. By most accounts, Republicans stand a good chance to retake the Senate. But Democratic strategist Maria Cardona argued that Republicans aren’t actually in the best shape. "Right now we're talking about Democrats perhaps keeping the Senate," Cardona said. "Five months ago, Republicans were swearing up and down that they were going to take over the Senate." "So, let's also keep in mind that in all of these districts and states the Republican Party has the worst reputation in American polling of any political party in history." That’s a big claim, so we wanted to check where the current iteration of the Republican Party stands in relation to American polling history. Party favors Cardona told us that she took her talking point "from an aggregate of polls from the last year where polling for Congress in general has been at historic lows." "In most of those polls, the Republican Party is polling at much lower levels than the Democratic Party," Cardona said. "Polling at much lower levels" in Cardona’s case refers to the "favorable/not favorable" rating of Republicans. There are other ways to ask how poll respondents how they feel about parties -- a poll paid for by NBC and Wall Street Journal, for instance, asks about positive and negative impressions. But we think the favorable/not favorable measure is widely understood and accepted. And by that measure, the Republican Party recently did hit a record low. In the October 2013 Gallup poll, conducted during the government shutdown, 28 percent of respondents said they had a favorable view of Republicans while 62 percent said they had an unfavorable view. The results were both a record low for a favorability rating and a record high for an unfavorability rating since Gallup began asking the question in 1992, among Democrats or Republicans. Likewise, the Pew Research Center’s lowest recorded favorability and highest recorded unfavorability belong to the Republican Party, in two separate 2013 polls. Pew’s data, like Gallup’s, goes back to 1992. CNN reported a record low for both Republican and Democratic favorability (32 and 43 percent, respectively) in October 2013, although we could only find CNN data going back to 2006. For context, the same Gallup poll that recorded record unfavorability for Republicans showed 43 percent favorability for Democrats against 49 percent unfavorability -- better, but still bad. It's important to note that the polls have shifted in the past year, however, and Republicans have bounced back from their low watermark. Gallup’s April 2014 poll had Republican favorability at 34 percent against 59 percent unfavorability. The Democratic Party also polled slightly better than it did in October, with 44 percent favorability and 50 percent unfavorability. Pew’s most recent poll also showed a similar improvement for Republicans, with Democratic favorability and unfavorability holding steady. As far as we can tell, CNN hasn’t asked the favorability question since October. Polling history is recent history "In history," in our minds, implies a period of time longer than just the last two decades. But looking at political parties’ reputations further back is difficult. Scientific polling -- meaning polls with random sampling -- started in earnest in the mid 1930s, when George Gallup founded the American Institute of Public Opinion. Gallup’s innovation was to apply statistical methods from the social sciences to the more informal surveys that had existed long prior, and which often gave unreliable results. Polling then, though, was nowhere near as big as it is today. "From the mid 1930s to the early 1970s, there were only a few pollsters in the business releasing public polls," said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Those polls used mostly in-person sampling, which isn’t completely comparable to the telephone sampling done today, Bowman added. Bowman told us that there’s no easy analogue from those early polls to the "favorable/unfavorable" question asked today, but noted that the post-depression period, the mid 1970s, and the early 1980s were all marked by a low public opinion of the political parties and government in general. Our ruling Arguing that the Democrats stand a chance in the upcoming midterm elections, Cardona said, "The Republican Party has the worst reputation in American polling of any political party in history." According to Gallup, CNN, and Pew, that was case roughly a year ago -- but now now. In late 2013, Gallup had Republican favorability at 28 percent, and Republican unfavorability at 62 percent. Both of those are records for either major party. There are two major caveats, though. First, polls only started asking the "favorable/unfavorable" question about political parties in 1992, and there’s no good analogue before then; looking back to 1992 doesn’t quite warrant "in history," as Cardona phrased her claim. Second, the Republican Party has bounced back from their low watermark in the most recent polls. Cardona's claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-01328	"Money towards the Ebola vaccine is basically cut in half to what it was. More cuts are coming under the congressional sequester."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/24/stephanie-cutter/stephanie-cutter-ebola-vaccine-research-was-cut-ha/	If you’re tracking news of the Ebola virus, you’ve probably heard accusations that budget cuts are responsible for the lack of a vaccine. National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins told Huffington Post that "we probably would have had a vaccine in time" for the Ebola outbreak were it not for a 10-year drop in federal research dollars. (PolitiFact explored that idea.) His colleague, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, contradicted Collins on the Oct. 19 edition of Meet the Press. When host Chuck Todd asked if Collins’ comments about budget cuts driving the absence of a working vaccine was "hyperbole," Fauci said he did not agree with Collins. "You can't say that. I think you can't say we would or would not have this or that. Everything is slowed down. But I wouldn't make that statement," Fauci said. Later in the Ebola-centric episode, Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter picked up on Fauci’s statement that research slowed with funding. "In fact, money towards the Ebola vaccine is basically cut in half to what it was," she said. "More cuts are coming under the congressional sequester." We wanted to know if funding for an Ebola vaccine had been cut in half from "what it was" and if more cuts were coming under the sequester. Cutter did not respond to our query. How much we spend on Ebola vaccine research The National Institutes of Health, which houses Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is the biggest source of medical research dollars in the world. In-house scientists work on some projects, while other grants are doled out to scientists at research institutions and universities. These research agencies have had cutbacks just like the rest of the federal bureaucracy, including in biomedical research. The government put a big emphasis on these illnesses in 2001, as officials grew more worried about bioterrorism threats like anthrax and smallpox. The NIH’s specific research into Ebola virus prevention and treatment is also lower than it once was, though whether it was "half as much" depends on a subjective, selective timetable. A spokeswoman for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided a breakdown of the agency’s Ebola research since 2003, including vaccine-specific expenses. (These numbers exclude stimulus dollars and are not adjusted for inflation.) The chart below shows the trend in the agency’s spending on research into an Ebola vaccine, therapeutics (or treatments), as well as total Ebola research spending, which folds in those categories and also includes basic research into how the disease works and diagnostics (complete chart data here). Since Cutter specified Ebola vaccine research, let’s focus on that (it’s the blue line). It’s hard to say what normal spending in this area is, as dollars have fluctuated between a low of $11.6 million to a high of $37.2 million depending on the year. But if you compare 2010 spending to 2014 spending, spending indeed dropped by more than half, falling from about $37.2 million to $17.7 million. The 2009-10 fiscal year was one of higher-than-usual spending. The year before, spending was $20.8 million. The story for total Ebola research spending by NIH is similar, reaching a high of $59 million in 2006 before falling, peaking again in 2010 and then trailing off amid recession fallout. No doubt, research money has not kept up with rising research costs, especially in the recent austere budget climate. The sequester and cuts to come Let’s compare spending before and after the sequester that Cutter mentioned. Remember that funny word, sequestration? It hasn’t been in the news much, but it’s not going away, and it has a big influence on whether the NIH keeps funding things like Ebola research at substantial levels. (See PolitiFact’s guide here.) The sequester is the result of a 2011 disagreement between the White House and Congress over how to solve the debt ceiling problem. Because a congressional "super-committee" failed to come up with $1.2 trillion in targeted cuts, across-the-board spending cuts of 5 percent went into effect in 2013. An agreement reached by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in December 2013 offered slight relief from the sequester, setting budget caps for 2014 and 2015 discretionary (non-military) spending that exceed the amount required by the sequester. In the 2011-12 fiscal year, before the sequester, spending on Ebola vaccine research was $22.5 million. In 2013, after the sequester, this spending fell to $17.2 million. It picked up slightly to an estimated $17.7 million in 2014. Clearly, budget cuts are leading to reduced dollars for finding an Ebola vaccine. But it is not half of its pre-sequester amount, so Cutter’s statement is an overstatement by this measure. What does this mean for future medical research? Spending will surely remain tight and will still be outpaced by the cost of research. But exactly what continued austerity means for Ebola research also remains to be seen. Of the many diseases affecting or feared to affect Americans, Ebola was not one, so it was not given a super-high priority in past National Institutes of Health budgeting. Congress provides the funding for NIH, but agency leaders make the call on which research gets what level of funding. The NIH has generally tried to make its budget cuts even across its more than two dozen sub-institutes that focus on specific disease research, said Benjamin Corb, American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology director of public affairs. If this trend holds, Ebola research will likely take another cut, though spending priorities could change in the face of the dangerous outbreak in West Africa. Already, the agency has pushed ahead with some close-to-finished treatments in effort to respond to the disease, such as the ZMapp drug that was used to treat two American missionaries who contracted Ebola but has not yet been produced in large supply. The spending cap for the 2014-15 fiscal year is essentially flat, so spending will still be tight for all research, said David Reich, a former House Appropriations Committee staffer and consultant to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. If inflation is factored in, it’s certainly a cut, he said. "We don’t know where they’re going to be until the process is finished," he said. An NIH spokeswoman said the agency did not yet know how sequestration would affect Ebola research. Experts caution that more money for Ebola research would not necessarily mean more results, though they agree that more money would have probably led to more developed testing of products. Our ruling Cutter said, "Money towards the Ebola vaccine is basically cut in half to what it was," and "more cuts are coming under the congressional sequester." Whether money for the vaccine was cut in half depends on the metric you use. It’s true if you compare 2010 to the 2014 estimate, when vaccine research spending fell from $37 million to $17.2 million, but not if you use other parameters. The financial picture for the NIH is not expected to substantially brighten any time soon amid constraints from budget-control measures, though given the emergence of the threat in the United States and the massive attention to the issue, Congress and the president could choose to increase funding for Ebola going forward.

pomt-14088	"By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/17/minka-kelly/elephant-killed-time-you-down-cup-joe/	By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks, according to an image shared by actress Minka Kelly. Kelly (Friday Night Lights) posted the statistic by the International Fund for Animal Welfare on her Instagram, along with a note urging her followers to sign IFAW’s petition asking wildlife authorities to list African elephants as endangered and give the species more protections. "#Elephants are being killed at an alarming rate, both by #ivory poachers and by wealthy American trophy #hunters," Kelly wrote May 10. "It's estimated that on average, an #elephant is killed every 15 minutes for its ivory. That's 96 animals a day!" Is it true that elephants are killed at the rate it takes to down a cup of joe? The estimate is derived from a reputable academic study, but IFAW is oversimplifying the complexities of that research to score a good soundbite. Every 15 minutes Beth Allgood, IFAW’s director for U.S. campaigns, told us the 96 elephants figure comes from a 2014 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study that provided the first reliable continent-wide estimate of illegal kills. The researchers used data at carcass-monitoring field sites maintained by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to model the Africa-wide number of illegal elephant deaths. The study determined the percentage of elephants estimated to be killed by poaching. It then took that percentage and applied it to current estimates of the total number of African elephant species total. The study used two different approaches to calculate the total number of African elephants killed over three years — reaching 99,997 in one version and 101,784 in the other. (For context, the entire species had an estimated population size of 420,000 to 650,000 in 2012.) Averaged over three years, that’s an annual rate of 33,630 elephants, researchers said. That's a daily rate of 92 elephants (not 96) or the equivalent of one elephant illegally poached every 15 to 16 minutes. We spoke to the lead author of the study, George Wittemyer of Colorado State University, about his findings and the IFAW claim. Wittemyer said the IFAW calculation was "plausible," but he also said that "confidence intervals around the numbers are a bit wide." In other words, IFAW is taking a fairly shaky estimate and describing it as a certainty. The better take-away from the paper is the order of magnitude (tens of thousands of elephants killed per year), rather than exact figures, said Julian Blanc, the data analyst for CITES’ elephant monitoring program. "I therefore cannot vouch for the ‘96 elephants a day’ figure," Blanc told us. About that coffee comparison Whether that translates to one elephant "by the time you drink your coffee" depends on if you sip or chug. Yes, we understand the line is a rhetorical flourish, but hey, we’re fact-checkers so we conducted an unscientific Twitter poll to gauge caffeination speeds. Out of nearly 2,200 respondents, a third said it takes them 15 minutes to finish their java. For these coffee drinkers, that does correspond to one elephant poached by the time they’re done. But for a third of respondents who drink faster, the claim doesn’t hold up. And for the other third who were more indolent, the claim actually lowballs the amount of elephant deaths. Ivory and elephants Various wildlife groups list demand for ivory as one of, if not the, main reason for the decimation of African elephants. But recent reports suggest poaching may be on the decline, which may push this coffee factoid further from reality. When Europeans began colonizing Africa in the 1800s, there were an estimated 26 million elephants before the world gained an appetite for their tusks. Americans consumed 200 tons of ivory — used to make combs, art, pool balls and piano keys — per year in the early part of the 20th century and the elephant population had declined to an estimated 10 million. According to the first comprehensive survey of the species conducted by zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the population had dwindled to 1.3 million in 1979 and fell to 600,000 within a decade. This poaching crisis, said Allgood of the IFAW, led CITES to ban the international ivory trade in 1989. Then the overall elephant population rebounded from just 286,000 in 1995 to 472,000 in 2007 before a resurgence of the crisis. According to a CITES report, illegal ivory trade activity and the weight of the ivory more than doubled since 2007 as a result of rising demand from growing Asian economies. The area hardest hit has been Central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, where illegal sales help fund war and terrorism. Today, the outlook looks slightly brighter for elephants as killings have declined since the peak in 2011, CITES reports. That’s important to note for two reasons. First, the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences study cited by IFAW includes the peak year of 2011. Second, a decline in more recent years would knock down the total number of elephants poached. Furthermore, China, the world’s biggest ivory consumer, and the United States agreed to enact a complete ban on ivory in the fall of 2015. Our ruling Kelly said, "By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks." The group behind this claim, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, is trying to draw attention to a real problem by boiling down complex research into a simple-to-use factoid. But they are testing limits of the research they’re citing. The study measured three years and estimated that about 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers in that time period. Experts caution against taking those figures -- which rely on estimates -- and boiling them down in the way IFAW did. And since that study concluded, other research suggests that poaching has declined. And, it should be obvious, but this only really matters if you take 15 minutes to drink a cup of coffee.

pomt-07251	Says that in the last five years, Texas "created more jobs than all other states combined."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/29/texas-public-policy-foundation/texas-public-policy-foundation-says-texas-created-/	The president of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, Brooke Rollins, touts Texas’ economic strength in a TV ad that aired in April and May, saying that "in the last five years, we’ve created more jobs than all other states combined." After a reader asked us to check Rollins’ claim, Joshua Trevino, a foundation spokesman, pointed us to information the foundation culled from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly employment data — specifically, figures from the Current Employment Statistics series, which is calculated using a broad survey of employer payroll data. First, the foundation identified those states where the number of jobs had grown between January 2006 and January 2011. There were only 10 states in that group. Texas ranked No. 1, with an increase of 545,900 jobs, from about 9.93 million to about 10.47 million. The other nine states, ranging in size from Louisiana to Wyoming, had a combined jobs increase of 183,700. However, that's not to say jobs weren’t lost in Texas during those years. Employment numbers fluctuate. At the state’s most recent peak, in August 2008, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs. About a year later, with the recession in full swing, Texas had about 400,000 less. Next, we asked the Texas Workforce Commission about the foundation’s claim. Lisa Givens, an agency spokeswoman, sent us a 50-state comparison of job growth also using monthly BLS figures. However, Givens’ accounting covered a more recent five-year period, March 2006 to March 2011 — numbers for which were still preliminary. Nine states, including Texas, had more jobs in March 2011 than in that month five years earlier. And Texas’ gains far outpaced the combined total for the other states: 539,500 vs. 134,400. So, the foundation’s figures stand up — in the way that such figures are often analyzed, including by PolitiFact. Unsaid is that this gauge defines job creation as a net increase in employment. That means the foundation’s analysis only takes into account the number of jobs created in excess of the number lost over a five-year period. But new jobs also sprung up in the other 40 states, although they were offset by greater losses. Is it fair to assess job creation without including them? We’ve gone back and forth on that question. In September 2010, we rated True the statement by Gov. Rick Perry that Texas had "created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined." To come up with that number, Perry’s campaign also looked at net job growth, although over a longer time period: January 2001 to June 2010. During our research of the Perry statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, told us that the governor’s statement was correct. We touched base with her again on the foundation’s TV statement, which she said has a legitimate basis. However, in January 2010, we rated False a statement from Perry that "approximately 70 percent of the jobs created in the U.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas." We found that the Texas Workforce Commission, like the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had restricted its comparison to the states that experienced a net increase in employment; during the specified time period, there were 14 total, including Texas. While we researched that item, Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us that excluding all those states with net job losses — and disregarding any jobs gained in those states — exaggerates the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. "To say it's misleading is to be kind," Brandi said. "It's just not true." The Truth-O-Meter score so far: one ruling that favors net increases in employment as a valid gauge of job creation — and one that doesn’t. Seeking more clarity, we turned to Jason Faberman, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has written an article on the BLS data sources. He agreed that it could be misleading to consider only net increases in jobs as "job creation." But, he said, the public is accustomed to hearing it discussed that way. "When most policy, political and media people refer to jobs ‘created’ or ‘added,’ they are referring to the net gain in employment over some period," Faberman said. Givens, at the workforce commission, told us that when the agency refers to net employment gains, it says jobs were added rather than created. What happens if you look at total jobs created, not just the net gain? Then Texas is no longer No. 1. The BLS keeps annual data, starting from April 1 each year, on total private sector job gains and losses. During the most recent three years — 2008, 2009 and 2010 — California gained an average of 1.3 million jobs annually, while Texas posted an average of 935,000 jobs. However, California also lost an average of 1.8 million jobs while Texas lost 992,000. However, Abbot cautioned that gross job numbers generally reflect a state’s population, meaning that big states would post bigger numbers than small ones. "There’s no way that a Kansas could compare with a Texas," Abbot said. Faberman agreed that comparing gross job gains isn’t the best way to fact-check the foundation’s statement. Instead, he suggested comparing Texas’ net employment change with that of the whole country, minus Texas’ share. What we found: In January 2011, the United States, excluding Texas, had 5.3 million fewer jobs than it did in January 2006 — the five-year period used by the foundation. That compares with the 545,900 increase that Texas experienced during that time. So, by Faberman’s measure, Texas outperformed the rest of the country. We came across another way of thinking about job creation in an Aug. 24 blog on the Houston Chronicle’s website. According to the post, an unidentified economist noted that any "raw job count would naturally favor" Texas in a comparison with other net-gain states and asked what would happen if the size of the states’ job forces were factored in. The Chronicle did that by calculating the percentage increase in the states’ jobs between July 2009 and July 2010, and Texas still came out on top — but barely. Inspired by the Chronicle, we looked again at the 10 states with net job gains over the last five years. Texas’ gains represented a 5.5 percent increase in employment from January 2006 to January 2011. For the nine other states, their total increase of 183,700 jobs was a 2.5 percent increase. However, comparing the states individually, two had larger percentage increases than Texas: North Dakota (10.6 percent) and Alaska (5.7 percent). Another factor that changes — even reverses — the job creation numbers is the time frame. The longer the time frame, the better Texas’ numbers look. Comparing employment in a single month in 2006 with the same month five years later, Texas’ job numbers grow. Shorten the time period to three years, and Texas shows a net loss in jobs, going from 10.56 million jobs in January 2008 to 10.47 million in January 2011. So what’s our (latest) ruling on job creation? The foundation’s claim that Texas "created more jobs than all other states combined" stands up — considering only those states that had net job gains over five years. That’s the methodology usually used to define job creation in public discourse. But the foundation’s analysis disregards the 40 states where millions of jobs were created but were outnumbered by losses. And looking at the percentage increase in jobs relative to the size of each state’s work force — another telling statistic — two other states experienced greater gains than Texas. We rate the foundation’s statement as Half True.	None	Texas Public Policy Foundation	None	None	None	2011-05-29T06:00:00	2011-04-25	['Texas']

pomt-02637	Alex Sink "used a taxpayer-funded plane so she could get to a vacation in the Bahamas."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/17/national-republican-congressional-committee/gop-says-alex-sink-used-state-owned-airplane-get-v/	With the matchup now set for a March 11 special election for the U.S. House, the National Republican Congressional Committee has launched some familiar attacks against Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate and a former Florida chief financial officer. In a new Web ad released Jan. 15, the GOP resurrects charges from the 2010 gubernatorial race, when Sink lost to Republican Rick Scott. The new ads remind voters that Sink had once caught flak for using state airplanes. "She used a taxpayer-funded plane so she could get to a vacation in the Bahamas," the video charges. It also lists a few other flight-related claims to bring the attack in for a landing. The state airplane episode was a big deal for Sink during her 2010 campaign, and the claim that she used the plane to get to the Bahamas was designed to cause her turbulence again. So we buckled our seat belts and looked at whether the NRCC had done its pre-flight preparations correctly. Frequent flyer Alex Sink was in the middle of her 2010 gubernatorial run when the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald produced a report detailing her apparent use of state airplanes for personal and campaign use. The June 2009 report focused on Sink, then serving as CFO, and Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum, who was also running for governor, eventually losing the Republican primary to Scott. The Times and the Herald reported that Sink’s state-provided air travel had cost $413,334 between January 2007 and June 22, 2009. State law requires Cabinet members to maintain a legal residence in Tallahassee, and both Sink and McCollum had second homes in the capital. But the law prohibited them from using a state plane to commute to and from their residences in other parts of the state. The report prompted an ethics complaint against both politicians (and against then-Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican, prior to that). Sink was accused of misusing the planes for personal flights and campaign stops and for diverting flights to Tampa airports so she could travel to her home in Thonotosassa. The NRCC’s Web ad refers to the subsequent Florida Commission on Ethics investigation. In addition to a trip to the Bahamas, the ad said, she "spent $400,000 of taxpayer money to fly around the state" and "used the plane to attend political campaign events." There is a really big caveat here, however. The ethics commission found no evidence of wrongdoing by Sink (or by any of the other two politicians, for that matter). Former Assistant Attorney General Craig B. Willis was hired as a special advocate. He concluded that no state statutes had been violated, because there was no evidence of what he called "wrongful intent." The commission’s investigation found that reimbursement guidelines for transporting family and attending campaign events had been met, and that Sink’s use of the planes didn’t constitute misuse of state resources. Furthermore, Willis found that between July 2005 and June 2009, the term "aircraft" had been removed from a portion of a state statute that defined commuting for official state business. Willis noted that this left questions about whether the restrictions about commuting even applied to flying on the state planes. Ultimately, the complaint was dismissed. While using state aircraft to commute between a politician’s home and Tallahassee was normally not allowed, flying an official to a state function and back was allowed. The commission found 58 of Sink’s approximately 250 flights on state planes started or ended at either Tampa International or Vandenberg airport (which changed its name to Tampa Executive Airport in 2009). She had paid for about 190 commercial flights home during the time span in question. Sink said during the investigation that flying to one city for an official function with a stop at the official’s home or other desired destination, either to pick her up or drop her off, was "common practice" among high-ranking officials. Sink’s Chief of Staff Jim Cassady said her office considered the diverted flights acceptable if she had business in the destination city for pickup flights, or in the originating city for dropoff flights. Mike McClure, manager of the Department of Management Services Bureau of Executive Aircraft Operations, told the commission that the difference in cost when diverting a flight in this way was minimal. A March 3, 2009, audit of the department by state Inspector General Steve Rumph found that DMS billing procedures were "adequate," but suggested the department clarify its policies and begin requiring officials to certify travel was for official business. The audit also said that Sink, McCollum and Kottkamp had been taking trips that weren’t obviously for business and that the practice should be ended. Rumph’s audit noted the inconsistencies in the statutes that may have led to confusion about the use of the aircraft. This led to officials using the planes for trips without official business purposes. The final version of the audit left out the inspector general’s findings that the trio had spent some $51,000 for ''unnecessary legs during business trips,'' of which $27,200 was attributed to Sink. DMS spokeswoman Cathy Schroeder said that portion of the audit was removed because the agency "did not have any manpower to further investigate that." When the commission asked Sink if she thought diverting flights to pick up her up or drop her off was an appropriate use of state resources -- even if it was common among top officials -- she answered, "Certainly it was, or else I wouldn’t have been doing it." Off to the Bahamas So what about Sink’s alleged trip to the Bahamas? On March 7, 2008, Sink and two staff members flew from Tallahassee to Miami to see the Florida International University's Wall of Wind exhibit and to make a keynote address at the South Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce When her official business was complete, Sink was entitled to a trip across the state to Tallahassee, but instead she diverted the plane to Fort Lauderdale. She was catching a Continental flight to Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas -- where her husband Bill McBride owned a condo -- for a short vacation. One staff member went with her to Fort Lauderdale, then flew back to Tallahassee. Sink paid for the Continental flight. The diverted flight cost the state $248, according to the Department of Management Services. Because Sink and her staffer were aboard, Sink’s pro-rated cost for the trip to Fort Lauderdale was assessed at $123.75 by the DMS, but since she was returning from state business, she wasn’t charged. (For reference, a Super Shuttle shared van ride between airports is $45 and takes less than an hour; a nonstop van ride is $126 and a private, reserved car is $175.) There are no major commercial flights between the two airports, which are only about 25 miles apart. The NRCC told PolitiFact Florida that the ad wasn’t trying to accuse Sink of breaking any laws, only that she had squandered state resources by taking a state flight in order to catch a private flight to the Bahamas. The ad’s wording, which Sink has called "deceptive," is in fact somewhat misleading, as it could be interpreted as Sink taking a state plane all the way to the Bahamas. That would only be allowed if she were attending an official function there, not because she was going on vacation. In this case, she was diverting the state plane to an airport to get to a commercial flight, rather than Tallahassee. The commission’s public report, which was released in December 2009, found "no probable cause" that Sink had purposely violated any state laws in regard to the Bahamas episode. The report did recommend that the Legislature should probably amend the law to be more specific about how the planes should be used. In essence, the commission declared the law was too vague to definitively find any wrongdoing on Sink’s part. After Scott defeated Sink in 2010, the newly elected governor kept to a campaign promise and sold both planes, a 2003 Cessna Citation and a 2000 King Air. This put 11 pilots and support personnel out of work. Scott, a millionaire businessman, uses his own private jet to attend official functions. Our ruling The NRCC said in its ad that Sink "used a taxpayer-funded plane so she could get to a vacation in the Bahamas." It’s true that she was headed to a vacation in the Bahamas, and it’s also correct that she took a state plane to reach her flight from the mainland after finishing her official business in Miami. What’s not so obvious from the ad is that Sink was cleared of any violations of state law, and that her diversion of the flight headed back to Tallahassee was common practice at the time among senior officials. Even if the flight took her only 25 miles, it still can be construed as Sink’s using the plane to "get to a vacation in the Bahamas." However, we think most reasonable people would read this phrasing as suggesting that Sink took a state plane all the way to her island destination, which she did not. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2014-01-17T15:28:40	2014-01-15	['The_Bahamas']
pomt-09255	Under the Arizona immigration law, police are required to check immigration status if someone's "lawn is overgrown" or if a dog is "barking too loudly."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/04/kyrsten-sinema/under-arizona-immigration-law-overgrown-lawns-bark/	The controversy over a hard-line immigration law signed by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, shows no signs of ebbing -- despite a last-minute change to the law's language designed to placate critics. The law, which would go into effect in 90 days, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. One of the key questions has been what standard law enforcement officers must use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Critics have argued that trivial justifications could lead to immigration status checks that could get someone deported. On April 30, Brewer signed a package of changes to the law that were intended to clarify what sorts of actions could trigger immigration-related questions. Here's the new version of the language telling police the circumstances under which they will be expected to check on an individuals' immigration status: "For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation." By replacing the broader phrase "lawful contact" with "lawful stop, detention or arrest," the new version may have eased one worry expressed by critics of the bill -- that police could use such innocuous pretexts as someone asking an officer for directions or being a victim or a witness of a crime to trigger an immigration status check. But some say that a different addition to the law may actually expand the grounds for questioning people about their immigration status. The new version added the phrase "in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state." Before this change was made, the law did not specify that police could use the enforcement of county, city or town laws or ordinances as the trigger for asking immigration-status questions. Brewer's office did not return a request for comment. But Paul Senseman, a spokesman for the governor, told the Arizona Republic that such changes simply clarified the law's original intent. "What we were always talking about and have always been talking about are things like discharging firearms, alcoholic beverages in the park or speeding in a school zone," he told the newspaper. But critics -- including Arizona state Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, appearing on the April 30 edition of MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- seized on the change as significant and worrisome. Sinema told Olbermann that the final round of changes "actually make the law more onerous and even more unconstitutional, if that can even be imagined." Olbermann brought up the idea that "police contact over violations for local civil ordinances can trigger questioning on immigration status. You've identified that as a major problem with this. What is the problem?" Sinema responded, "Well, that's the key problem, because, previously, the sponsors of this legislation indicated that it was solely to apprehend people who were suspected of committing criminal acts. But now, when police officers encounter someone whose lawn is overgrown or who perhaps has a dog that's barking too loudly, they'll be required to inquire into their immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe they may be undocumented. That is incredibly concerning and a massive expansion of this law." We decided to focus on whether something like an overgrown lawn or a loudly barking dog could trigger an immigration check. For background's sake, this is our second attempt in a week to analyze the Arizona law. We first addressed the law in a pair of rulings on April 28, 2010, before the most recent changes were made. We're now attempting another pair of rulings -- this one, and a separate one on racial profiling. We believe that checking Sinema's claim requires an answer to two questions. First, are overgrown lawns and loudly barking dogs the type of violations typically covered by municipal laws or ordinances in Arizona? And second, if the answer is yes, could such violations serve as the trigger for an immigration check? To answer the first question, we called Ken Strobeck, the executive director of the League of Arizona Cities and Towns. Strobeck told us that such violations are indeed common in Arizona municipal codes. He said that while such violations are ordinarily enforced by unarmed code enforcers rather than by armed, trained police officers, there is nothing in the Arizona law to prevent a police officer from using an unmowed lawn, or some other civil violation for which they make a stop, detention or arrest, as the trigger for an immigration status check. The expansion of the law to municipal ordinances gives police "virtual carte blanche to ask for documentation," said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, adjunct law professor at Cornell University. The language on municipal ordinances may be new, but the original version of the law had already established a low threshold for asking immigration-related questions. For instance, the law would have allowed police to use traffic stops as a justification to ask immigration questions. Traffic stops are a well-used, and legal, way for police officers to enforce other laws. They can be used to test for drunken driving, or to catch violators of vehicle laws, such as those against broken taillights. "Someone who has committed no crime -- and indeed, for whom there is no reasonable suspicion of a crime -- could be subject to a lawful 'stop' at such checkpoints, and under the Arizona law could, upon reasonable suspicion, be asked for identification," said Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California-Irvine. And what might constitute "reasonable suspicion"? "Officers can use traffic stops to look for people who have invalid licenses, and invalid licenses for people who do not speak good English will be proxies for reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alien," said Stephen Saltzburg, law professor at George Washington University. In 1996, he said, the Supreme Court ruled in Whren vs. United States that it was permissible to use traffic laws to enforce drug laws. Similar stops for immigration laws, Saltzburg said, are "also likely to be upheld" if challenged under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against improper search and seizure. Meanwhile, in an effort to curb day-laborer gathering points -- the ad-hoc spots where illegal immigrants have often offered themselves as informal laborers -- both versions of the law have made it unlawful for illegal immigrants "to knowingly apply for work (or) solicit work in a public place," including through "verbal or nonverbal communication by a gesture or a nod that would indicate to a reasonable person that a person is willing to be employed." So, anyone making a gesture or a nod in a public place could fall under suspicion of violating these laws -- which in turn could open the door to questioning about one's immigration status. But on the narrower question Sinema raised -- about overgrown lawns or loudly barking dogs triggering an immigration check -- our experts say that she is on pretty safe ground. She exaggerates when she says that such violations could require law enforcement officers to "inquire into their immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe they may be undocumented." The law has a few more hurdles than that. It says that "a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation." And of course, there's no way of knowing yet whether law enforcement officers will actually use the full extent of their powers. Still, she's correct that relatively minor violations could open the door to immigration questioning. So we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-14875	Says President Dwight Eisenhower "moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/11/donald-trump/trump-eisenhower-deported-15-million-immigrants/	Real estate mogul Donald Trump reiterated his proposal to deport the country’s illegal immigrants at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis. History says his plan would work, Trump said. "Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him. ‘I like Ike,’ right?" Trump said in the Nov. 10 debate hosted by Fox Business Network. "Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn’t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back." Eisenhower did oversee a 1950s campaign that deported undocumented immigrants. But did he really move that many in one operation? The dragnet Beginning in World War II -- during a severe shortage of workers on the home front -- the federal government instituted the Bracero program, which brought Mexican workers into the United States to fill jobs that would not otherwise be filled. The Braceros were in the country legally, but the government often looked the other way when companies illegally brought their own Mexican workers into the country. In 1954, workers brought in outside the Bracero program, combined with Mexicans who had crossed the border illegally on their own, were the targets of a program called -- and this is really what it was called -- "Operation Wetback." The intention was to target illegal immigrants, though some U.S. citizens of Mexican ancestry were also caught up in the dragnet. Determining the number of people who were deported in "Operation Wetback" is tricky because some people who would have otherwise been subject to deportation were expected to leave the country "voluntarily" (or self-deportation). We came across estimates of forced removals ranging from 250,000 to 1.3 million. "The (U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service) claimed as many as 1.3 million, though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total," according to the Texas State Historical Association’s online handbook, produced in partnership with the University of Texas at Austin. The case of California is a good example. The INS (which was reorganized out of existence in 2003) said 540,000 people were to be deported from California alone during the campaign, said Don Mitchell, a geography professor at Syracuse University. But at least 485,000 would have had to deport themselves, and there’s no evidence that they actually returned to Mexico in those numbers. Kelly Lytle Hernandez, a history professor at the University of California Los Angeles, puts the maximum number of people actually deported during the operation at 250,000. The vast majority of the program took place during fiscal year 1955, which registered just about 254,000 apprehensions total, she wrote in a 2010 report. Re-entry What about Trump’s point that authorities deported people to more southern locations in Mexico to stop them from easily re-entering the United States? In earlier 20th century immigration control efforts, Border Patrol found that deporting immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border allowed them to easily cross back into the United States, according to Hernandez’s paper. Starting in the 1940s, the United States would take deportees to the border, and from there Mexican authorities would take them to the country’s interior either by train or boat, primarily. This continued during Operation Wetback, so Trump has a bit of a point there. It’s worth noting that transportation conditions for the deportees bordered on inhumane in some cases. According to historian Mae M. Ngai, 88 people died in a July deportation round-up because of the heat. But attempts to relocate people to the Mexican interior did not always stop them from returning to the United States, Mitchell said. Many returned illegally or legally as guest workers. "It is absolutely the case that sending folks to the interior did not stop them from returning," he said. "It might be the case that some were discouraged, but others returned." Further, the operation was more about policy changes that actually allowed more opportunities for immigrants to gain legal status through work visas than it was about deportation, Hernandez told PolitiFact. The campaign would have been "a complete failure" had it not been for the guest worker program that accompanied it, wrote Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh noted that low levels of undocumented immigration in the 1950s was more likely a result of the guest worker program, rather than the 1954 deportation campaign. The guest worker program ended in 1965. "On the whole, though, Trump’s comments are undoubtedly an exaggeration and a bit of a twist on the facts," Mitchell said. Our ruling Trump said President Eisenhower "moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country." Trump is referring to a 1954 campaign known as "Operation Wetback." While the idea that the operation resulted in more than 1 million deportations is not pulled out of thin air, historians widely cite that number as far too high for a variety of reasons -- including the fact that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants would have had to self-deport. Also, it wasn’t just a deportation program. The campaign accompanied more legal immigration opportunities. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-04086	"It costs $10,000 a year to keep a child in school; it costs $30,000 a year to keep someone in prison."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/18/john-kitzhaber/does-oregon-spend-10000-year-student-30000-inmate/	In his annual address, Gov. John Kitzhaber called on lawmakers to make a range of difficult decisions in order to put more money into schools. The actions include reducing the costs of health care and corrections. State forecasters estimate the prison population will grow, in part due to tougher sentencing measures and in part due to overall population growth, at an extra cost of $600 million over the next 10 years. The governor said most of the beds will be occupied by nonviolent offenders. Kitzhaber acknowledged that politicians don’t like to appear "soft on crime." But he asked them to keep two numbers in mind as they go forward. "It costs $10,000 a year to keep a child in school; it costs $30,000 a year to keep someone in prison," he said. "If we are unwilling to act on this issue, in this upcoming legislative session, we will by default be choosing prisons over schools." Obviously, it’s more expensive to house and feed an inmate than to teach a child. One is a round-the-clock operation; the other isn’t. But are the governor’s numbers right? Is there a 3-to-1 ratio? We figured this would be a simple check. Right away, through the magic of the Internet, we found a news report from 2012 in The Oregonian that stated that "the state spends an average of $30,000 a year to house, feed and care for an inmate." Of course, PolitiFact Oregon is all about primary sources, so we went to the Department of Corrections, where we found a quick facts page.It states that the daily cost of housing an inmate in the 2011-13 budget period is $84.81 -- which comes out to nearly $31,000 a year. The governor’s Commission on Public Safety reports a slightly lower number still in the ballpark -- $82.48 a day or $30,105 a year. The cost is for "security, health care, food, recidivism reduction programs like mental health and drug treatment, and other operational costs, but excludes community corrections grants, debt service, capital construction, and new prison start‐up costs." (The $82.48 figure is the same as in a Legislative Fiscal Office analysis of the Corrections budget, dated September 2011. What we’re trying to say is that both per day breakdowns come from the same source, the state.) OK, one number down, another to go. The Oregon Department of Education also has nifty numbers, including spending per pupil. In 2010-11, operational expenses were nearly $9,400 per student, statewide. (Capital spending per child was $777, but we’re going to stick with the $9,400 figure because the corrections cost does not include capital spending.) The costs range, of course, from $27,947 apiece for 35 students in the Burnt River School District in Baker County to $5,566 in the Scio School District in Linn County. Portland Schools, the largest in the state, spends about $11,830 per student. We should note here that prosecutors are not enthusiastic about Kitzhaber’s plans to "reform" public safety, and say that the Oregon’s corrections system is fine as is. John Foote, Clackamas County’s district attorney, served on the governor’s public safety commission and submitted a minority report supported by district attorneys, the association of chiefs of police and the state sheriffs’ association. We contacted Foote. He concurs on the math, but he says Oregon is considered a high cost state, in that we don’t incarcerate a lot of people but the cost is high when we do. The obvious fix, he says, is to lower the daily cost of incarceration. Are we very high on daily costs? That’s a perfectly fine question for another PolitiFact. In this PolitiFact, we’re checking Kitzhaber’s math. Kitzhaber, in his State of the State speech, implored lawmakers to work with him to boost spending for children and families, including more money into classrooms. As part of that initiative, he proposed lowering costs in health care and in prisons, as well as taking a hard look at tax expenditures and public pension reform. He asked lawmakers to keep two numbers in mind: $10,000 to keep a child in school, versus $30,000 to keep an inmate in prison. The average operational cost of educating a child is even lower, on statewide average, further underscoring his point. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01647	"Nazi imagery [was used] by the Block for Governor campaign to describe supporters of Allan Fung for Governor."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/24/allan-fung/allan-fung-says-ken-blocks-campaign-compared-fung-/	Who would have thought that the battle between Republicans Allan Fung and Ken Block in the race for governor would slip into a debate over Nazis? But it did, thanks to a Facebook posting. On Aug. 18, Fung's campaign manager and spokesman, Patrick Sweeney, issued a statement complaining of a "disgusting and offensive campaign tactic." The tactic? "The use of Nazi imagery by the Block for Governor campaign to describe supporters of Allan Fung for Governor." "The Block Campaign's comparison of Fung supporters to Nazi soldiers is an unconscionable tactic," the release said. What’s this all about? It begins with a message that the Fung campaign says it spotted on the personal Facebook page of a man named Peter Godon, who lists his hometown as North Smithfield. It includes two, side-by-side images. One shows the torso of a woman wearing a blue T-shirt that says, "Girls Just Wanna Have Fung," a play on the Cyndi Lauper song. The other shows a drawing of a man in a Nazi uniform. The message above the images: "Can you spot any difference in their actions?" The Fung campaign then issued the news release calling the posting "disgusting and offensive,"and included the Facebook posting as part of the news release, which can be seen in the notes section of the Fung For Governor Facebook page. In the news release, Sweeney was quoted as characterizing Godon as "a contributor and key supporter of the Block campaign" and he alleged that the Block campaign was comparing Fung supporters to Nazis. When we looked for the original Facebook posting on Aug. 20, we could not find it. The key point we are checking is whether the Block campaign had any role whatsoever in the posting of the image. We checked the Block Facebook page and didn't see the image posted there, so we wondered whether the Block campaign was really equating Fung supporters with Third Reich soldiers. We emailed Sweeney asking for his evidence that Godon represented the Block campaign. While we were waiting, we asked Block spokesman Jeff Britt about Godon's role in the campaign. He said Godon had worked as an unpaid volunteer putting up signs, who only got reimbursed for expenses. Britt produced records showing that on three dates in May, July and August, Godon was reimbursed a total of $122.61 for white panel boards, hardware and posts he purchased at Lowe's and Home Depot. The latest campaign finance records on file with the Rhode Island Board of Elections show that Godon contributed $100 to Block on Jan. 20, 2014 and wrote a second check, for $25, that was received on June 2, 2014. Donating $125 to a campaign, even if you also volunteer to put up signs, doesn't exactly make you a "key supporter" in a multi-million dollar campaign. We emailed Godon and left a message on his home answering machine seeking information, but received no reply. Britt called the posting "tasteless" and said that by the time he looked for it on Godon's page, late on Aug. 18, it was gone. "It had not been posted on our page. If it had shown up on our Facebook page, we would have taken it down," he said. "And if you take it in the context that Ken Block is Jewish, nobody in our campaign is going to be making Holocaust jokes." When we got through to Sweeney, he said, the posting "just got brought to my attention so we put out something quick on it." He said he wasn't sure who raised the matter and contended that, "I don't think we said anything in our release that the Block campaign posted anything. As a matter of fact, I know we didn't say that." The next day, Fung spokesman Robert Coupe emailed us to again say that Godon "was in fact a key supporter of the Block campaign" because of the $125 donation, the $122.61 reimbursement, the fact that Godon posted photos of himself online with Block at a fundraising event, the fact the Godon has frequently posted messages on social media advocating for Block or attacking Fung, and he appeared in Block's "Town Hall" television commercial. We checked the 30-second commercial. Godon is shown as an attentive audience member for one second. Our ruling Allan Fung, represented by his campaign manager, said in a news release that Ken Block's campaign compared Fung supporters to Nazi soldiers. The Fung campaign could offer no meaningful evidence that any official with any authority in the Block campaign was involved in creating or posting the bizarre message. To suggest that being an unpaid volunteer, donating $125 to a campaign, and showing up for one second as an extra in a campaign commercial makes you a "key supporter" of a candidate is a huge stretch. And to suggest that a posting on a personal Facebook page by a supporter of the campaign automatically represents the opinion of the candidate or the candidate's campaign is an equally large contortion.

pomt-14601	"Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that (gun ownership) database."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/feb/04/loretta-sanchez/sanchez-makes-pants-fire-claim-about-california-gu/	Critics have repeatedly attacked California Attorney General Kamala Harris for what they say is her slow progress investigating gun owners who are legally prohibited from having them. In 2001, California created the nation’s only database to identify these gun owners, including the mentally ill and those subject to domestic violence restraining orders. It allows the seizure of weapons by law enforcement from people in the prohibited categories. There’s no record of anyone questioning the existence of the database, which has been praised by gun control advocates. But a decade after it went into effect, the tracking system has a backlog of thousands of cases. Enter Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The Orange County congresswoman is Harris’ closest competitor for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats. Sanchez told Capital Public Radio during an interview in January 2016 that Harris has squandered state resources, and hasn’t even produced a database. "So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn’t be able to purchase guns – by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database," Sanchez said. We decided to focus on whether the database exists, and check on how the state funds have been spent. #ICYMI: See & hear the words that put @LorettaSanchez on the hot seat. #PantsOnFire: https://t.co/HEY8WGisUz pic.twitter.com/pBIkGNvYHd — PolitiFactCalifornia (@CAPolitiFact) February 12, 2016 Our research The database is officially called the Armed Prohibited Persons System, or APPS. It was created in 2001 after the Legislature passed SB 950, a Republican-authored bill, in response to gun violence across the nation. It cross-references all handgun and assault weapon owners in California against criminal records. It’s designed to check for individuals who legally purchased or registered a firearm but later committed a crime that would prevent them from owning the gun. Law enforcement agents are charged with tracking down the individuals and trying to confiscate their weapons. The database became active in December 2006, according to Harris’ office, or four years before she was elected attorney general. In this Nov. 16, 2012 Associated Press file photo, California Attorney General Kamala Harris speaks during a news conference in Los Angeles. While the database is not public, it is real. It’s been tied to a court challenge and is the subject of reports by the Attorney General’s Office, articles by the press, and letters by gun rights groups and gun control advocates. "Yes. It does exist," said Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s Office. "These (enforcement) agents are working these cases every day. … It’s definitely a lot of work. It’s time consuming." "The database absolutely exists," added Mike McLively, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. We asked the Sanchez campaign to explain her claim. A campaign spokesman argued that it’s correct — if you add words that greatly change the original statement: "To date, we don’t have that database as it was promised by the (State) Department of Justice in 2013," the spokesman wrote in an email. As a refresher, here’s what Sanchez said originally: "Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database." Still a backlog? It’s a clear misstatement to say "we don’t have that database." But we wanted to see what progress Harris has made reducing its backlog, to better examine Sanchez’s claim that "nothing was done" and that "$25 million was spent." In 2013, the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown approved $24 million in additional funds to reduce the long list of cases. It had grown to more than 20,700 at the time, according to Harris’ office. Earlier that year, a Harris aide seemed to suggest that the backlog could be eliminated in a single year, according to news reports from the time. That same year, the attorney general pledged to hire 36 enforcement agents with the money. Two years later, only half as many had been hired due to what Harris’ office called "hiring challenges." And while state investigations helped clear nearly 7,000 names off the list, the overall backlog had shrunk by only one-fifth during that time, to about 17,500, according to a March 2015 report by the Attorney General’s office. A sample of the firearms seized through the state's APPS program. Photo courtesy California Attorney General's Office. Republicans in the Legislature criticized Harris for what they said was slow progress. Sanchez’s comments about the database came five days before the Attorney General’s Office issued another report on the program. It said the list is now down to about 12,700 cases, which the office called "a historic low." The report makes clear that the list is not static. More than 20,000 people were added to it during the past two and a half years, while about 7,800 dropped off due to death or other reasons. SOURCE: California Attorney General's SB 140 Supplemental Report of the 2015-2016 Budget Package. The above figures represent the end of fiscal year numbers. *This data represents the first six months of FY 15-16. Since the additional funding was approved in 2013, state agents have removed more than 20,500 people, and doubled the average number of guns seized per year, according to the most recent report. The office has spent $15 million of the $24 million, according to the Attorney General’s Office. The office’s authority to spend the remainder expires May 1, though Harris has asked the Legislature to create a permanent funding stream for the program. Our ruling Rep. Loretta Sanchez said in a recent interview that California Attorney General Kamala Harris has done "nothing" to address a backlog of cases in a high-profile gun ownership tracking system. The database allows law enforcement to seize guns from people with criminal records and mental illness. "So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn’t be able to purchase guns – by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don’t have that database," Sanchez said. Not only does the program exist, but some progress has been made. The backlog has been cut from more than 20,000 cases to 12,700. That’s after Harris’ office spent $15 million of $24 million allocated by the Legislature and governor. Some continue to argue that the cases should be cleared more quickly, citing the mass shootings that have continued across the country. But there’s no denying that the Attorney General’s Office, under Harris, has put a dent in the backlog, allowing for the seizure of thousands of guns. And that’s far from "nothing." While there’s room to criticize the pace of the program, Sanchez’s statement amounts to a complete misrepresentation of reality. We rate the claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-09417	"There is no precedent for what the Democrats are doing with this deception. ... We have never written a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/17/cliff-stearns/stearns-says-house-democrats-trample-procedures-he/	Ever heard of "deem and pass"? It may sound like a football play, but it's actually House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's favored procedural maneuver to pass health care reform in the lower chamber. Such legislative gymnastics have Republicans up in arms, including Florida Rep. Cliff Stearns, who lamented the tactic on the House floor. "There is no precedent for what the Democrats are doing with this deception," he said on March 15, 2010. "We have never written a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist." Stearns is talking about a series of procedural tools that House and Senate Democrats plan to use to pass their health care overhaul. He and his fellow Republicans say the unprecedented move flouts congressional rules and may even be unconstitutional. We'll leave questions of unconstitutionality to the lawyers. For this fact-check, we're going to look at whether Stearns is correct that there is no precedent for the Democrats' efforts and that Congress has "never written a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist." But before we can decide if he's correct, here are some essentials for understanding the arcane world of congressional procedure. Listen up, because you're going to be hearing these terms thrown around a lot as Congress gears up for a showdown on the health care overhaul. Reconciliation: Bills considered under this procedure cannot be filibustered; they only need a simple majority to pass. Reconciliation was created as part of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act in an effort to make it easier to bring revenues and spending in line with caps set by the annual budget resolution. While the founders of the procedure did not envision it as a way to fast-track policy legislation, Congress has nevertheless used it to pass non-budget-related measures, including welfare reform in 1996 and changes to Medicare and Medicaid. "Deem and Pass:" This phrase refers to a House tactic that allows it to pass a bill without actually having a roll call vote on the legislation; it is technically known as a "self-executing rule." Here's how it works: The House Rules Committee is in charge of writing rules -- a playbook of sorts -- for floor debate. The rule dictates what amendments can be offered to a given bill and how long the bill will be debated, for example. A self-executing rule is essentially a two-for-one special; when the House votes to adopt a self-executing rule, it simultaneously adopts a separate bill or amendment, which is specified in the rule itself. In short, the House "deems" another bill to be passed as soon as it adopts the rule. The House and Senate have both passed versions of the health care bill. There are big differences between the two, so typically the two chambers would pick a handful of lawmakers to hash out those discrepancies in something called a conference committee. Then, the House and Senate would vote once again on the final product, called a conference report. But Senate Democrats lost their 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority in January 2010, when Republican Sen. Scott Brown won a special election in Massachusetts. That means Senate Republicans could effectively block a conference report. Complicating the process is the fact that a number of House Democrats don't like the Senate bill. Among other things, they oppose a tax on Cadillac insurance plans and a special Medicare perk for Nebraska. So, where does that leave the Democrats? With one seriously complicated strategy to pass health care reform. Here's how the whole thing could go down: The Rules Committee will cobble together a self-executing rule for the House to consider the package of reconciliation fixes to the Senate bill -- for example, the elimination of special Medicaid subsidies for patients in Nebraska and other states -- but that also includes language that "deems" the Senate bill passed once the House adopts the rule. Meanwhile, the Senate parliamentarian has said that the Senate bill must be signed by the president before any of the House changes can be made. So, presumably, President Barack Obama will put his stamp of approval on the bill as soon as the House deems it passed. Then, the Senate will debate the package of reconciliation fixes already passed by the House. The package of fixes will only need a simple majority to pass, but there's still plenty that could derail the package. The tactic serves two purposes: It prevents House Democrats who don't like the Senate bill from ever having to vote on it, and it potentially solves the problem of making changes to the Senate bill without needing 60 votes to pass them. Republicans are calling foul. They say the Democratic strategy is unfair and potentially unconstitutional. "What's really remarkable about this whole business is that not only the American people rejected this plan but Democrats are so desperate to pass it that they're willing to trample on the traditional rules of the House and Senate and even trample on the Constitution of the United States to get it done," said Indiana Republican Mike Pence. But is it unprecedented as Stearns claims? In fact, self-executing rules are relatively common in the House. For instance, the chamber employed the procedure on Feb. 3, 2010, to adopt a Senate amendment to a resolution concerning increasing the statutory limit on federal debt. The procedure was used 36 times by the House Republican leadership between 2005 and 2006 and 49 times by the Democratic leadership between 2007 and 2008, according to Brookings Institution congressional scholar Thomas Mann, writing for Politico. Furthermore, the reconciliation process has been used over and over again for policy-related measures. For instance, in 1996 Congress used reconciliation to make big changes to welfare, including separating it from Medicaid. Norm Ornstein, another leading congressional scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed out that the Republicans used a very similar tactic to what the Democrats are now proposing in 2006. At the time, they used a self-executing rule to pass $38.8 billion in budget cuts without having to vote on an immigration measure. So, there's a whole lot of precedent for the individual tactics Democrats are proposing to use, though the specific combination of a self-executing rule and reconciliation is a bit unusual, said Jim Horney, a budget expert at the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. "There's nothing about [the process] that's dramatically at odds with the way things get done," Horney said. "With almost every bill, you can find some way in which the circumstances are a little different. But to imply that it's somehow a big departure from the way things are done could be wrong." Donald Wolfensberger served on the House Rules Committee for more than a decade, and was around when reconciliation was first used. He continues to follow Congress closely as director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and agrees with Horney and the other congressional experts we spoke with that there's precedent, but not for this specific tack. The 2006 instance mentioned by Ornstein is "the closest analogy" to what the Democrats are now proposing. "It would be pretty similar," he said. Wolfensberger also said it's the first time he's seen Congress write a "a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist," as Stearns said. On that point, Stearns is correct, he said; the president will not have signed the Senate bill before the House passes the package of fixes. So, that brings us back to Stearns' original claim. While the combination of a self-executing rule and reconciliation is a relatively novel combination of procedural tools, all the congressional experts we spoke with agreed that there are plenty of similar examples of what the Democrats are proposing to do, nor is the party flouting procedures that are already on the books. As a result, the first part of Stearns's claim is somewhat misleading. However, Stearns is correct that this is the first time Congress has ever written a reconciliation bill to amend a law that does not exist. As a result, we find Stearns' claim to be Half True.

pomt-02484	As state Commerce secretary, Mary Burke drafted, sponsored and promoted "budgets that raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds to finance huge spending hikes."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/19/republican-party-wisconsin/state-gop-says-burke-drafted-and-promoted-state-bu/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke’s attack on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s tax-relief plan drew a strong response from the state Republican Party. "While Millionaire Mary Burke has called Walker’s tax relief plan ‘irresponsible,’ the reality is she helped construct some of the most irresponsible budgets and policies in our state’s history," said Joe Fadness, executive director of the state party, in a Feb. 10, 2014 news release. "Burke promoted budgets that raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds to finance huge spending hikes." Fadness accused Burke, who was state Commerce secretary from 2005 to 2007, of "ignoring her record of drafting and sponsoring budgets that set Wisconsin on a downward spiral" under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. In the election, prepare to hear a lot from Walker and his allies about Burke’s ties to Doyle. In this item, we’ll examine whether Burke helped "draft" "sponsor" and "promote" budgets that "raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds." Burke’s role in budgets During Burke’s tenure as commerce secretary, Doyle signed a pair of two-year state budgets into law. The first budget was introduced Feb. 8, 2005. Burke began her job just one day earlier as Doyle’s pick to run the state’s primary economic development agency. Department budget submissions were due in fall of 2004 and were months in the making, so Burke would have had effectively no chance to affect the Commerce budget, much less Doyle’s entire blueprint. Jesse Dougherty, spokesman for the state GOP, said that cabinet secretaries should be held accountable for what the Administration puts forth. As evidence that Burke "promoted" Doyle’s 2005-07 budget, Dougherty pointed to an April 2005 Wisconsin State Journal interview in which Burke said that while politically independent, "I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely." Burke’s role in the second budget in question (2007-09) is somewhat clearer. She was responsible for and submitted the Commerce budget, but also spoke out enthusiastically in favor of a variety of initiatives in Doyle’s overall state budget, on taxes, education, worker training, health care and others. "Gov. Jim Doyle's 2007-09 budget is a smart, responsible budget for Wisconsin businesses. It is fiscally responsible, identifies our priorities for success, and invests in those priorities," Burke wrote in a 2007 Commerce newsletter. So while Burke’s department is not involved in drafting the overall state budget, the GOP says her actions as a team player give her a degree of responsibility over the overall final product. We agree that Burke "promoted" the two budgets, but "drafting" goes too far. Fiscal impact of those budgets Let’s look at the three GOP statements about the Doyle budgets that coincided with Burke’s tenure. "Raised taxes by billions": The budgets Doyle submitted included tax-policy changes that raised net taxes, cumulatively, by $1.35 billion (down $12.68 million in the first budget, then up $1.371 billion in the second). Examples of changes included increases in cigarette taxes, a new tax on oil-company earnings, and a new revenues tax on hospitals. The budgets Doyle signed, after legislators changed them, raised net taxes by $351 million, according to reports by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Big money, but not "billions" in either scenario. "Created high structural deficits": In criticizing Walker’s plan to return half of an expected surplus to taxpayers, Burke noted reports saying his plan would boost by about $100 million a potential $700 million shortfall -- or "structural deficit" -- heading into the 2015-17 budget. By contrast, the two Doyle budgets in question left much higher structural deficits -- $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion each -- than either of Walker’s two budgets. And, notably, Walker’s first budget actually created a small structural surplus for the following budget. "Raided funds to finance huge spending hikes": It’s been well-documented that Doyle and lawmakers repeatedly tapped segregated funds for roads, compensation in malpractice cases and other purposes in order to balance the state budget. Significant withdrawals occurred in the two budgets that overlapped with Burke’s time. Our rating State Republicans said that as state Commerce secretary, Burke drafted, sponsored and promoted "budgets that raised taxes by billions, created high structural deficits and raided funds to finance huge spending hikes." There are accurate elements here but some critical facts are ignored or misstated. Burke had a hand in budgeting, as any cabinet member would, and lauded two Doyle budgets, which did indeed leave high structural deficits and bust into segregated funds. But it’s a big overstatement to say she "drafted" two overall state budgets, especially given that the 2005-07 version came out just one day after she joined Doyle’s administration. In any event, those two budget proposals from Doyle raised taxes by $1.35 billion, not "billions" as claimed. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01304	Says Sen. Elizabeth Warren "lives in a $5.4 million mansion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/29/facebook-posts/critics-say-elizabeth-warren-lives-54-million-mans/	Nothing animates political discussions like the appearance of hypocrisy. And for some critics these days, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offers a tempting target. Warren, elected in 2012, has become a leader of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, decrying the excesses of Wall Street and income inequality. These efforts -- and the possibility that she could run for president in 2016 -- has made her a high-profile political figure. Here’s a social media meme we recently received: "Senator Liz Warren lives in a $5.4M mansion, claimed 'Native American' status to score a Harvard gig paying $350,000 to teach one class, and now lectures us that 'the system is rigged to benefit the rich.' " That’s a lot to chew on, so we’ll limit our analysis here to the claim that Warren "lives in a $5.4 million mansion." It’s a claim that mirrors others cited elsewhere in the media -- for instance, in an op-ed in the Boston Herald and in an article in the Huffington Post, both of which say Warren’s house is worth $5 million. But is it really worth that much? No. After plowing through public real estate data, we found that the house Warren shares with her husband, Bruce Mann, is worth less than half that -- though it’s located in a desirable neighborhood in Cambridge, Mass., so it’s still pretty expensive by most Americans’ standards. (Warren's staff did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) House values According to real estate records, Warren’s house -- a clapboard Victorian built in 1890 -- was purchased in 1995 for $447,000. Back then, the median sale price for a single-family home in Cambridge was roughly $300,000, so the house was definitely above average for the city at the time. The amount paid for the house in 1995 works out to just shy of $700,000 in today’s dollars. But it was a smart purchase. The house’s assessed value for 2015 was a bit over $1.9 million, and as is often the case, the expected resale value is higher. The real estate website Zillow.com estimates that the house’s value today is about $2.4 million. That’s well above the median price of homes currently listed in Cambridge, which Zillow says is $639,000, though in Warren’s immediate neighborhood, several houses have values exceeding $2 million and more exceed $1 million, according to Zillow. It’s worth noting that the use of the term "mansion" may be a bit of a stretch. The house has two bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths, and 3,728 square feet of living space. According to the Census Bureau, the median new home in the northeastern United States in 2010 had 2,392 square feet. So Warren’s house is bigger than average, but hardly Versailles. Indeed, almost half of the house’s $1.9 million in assessed value comes from the land, not the structure itself. And a key factor in the price growth likely stems from its location in a good school district, the easy access to fancy neighborhood amenities, and its close proximity to Harvard University, where Mann is a law professor, and where Warren taught before winning her Senate race. So where did the $5 million figure come from? A garbled financial disclosure report, most likely. Warren’s 2011 financial disclosure report, required of Senate candidates, listed the house as having a value of between $1 million and $5 million. This disclosure form only requires the candidate to gauge asset values within broad ranges, rather than a specific amount. Somewhere along the line, some authors started neglecting to mention that the $5 million figure was the upper range for the house, not its specific value. (Other articles were more careful.) A final note: Warren is wealthy by national standards, but so are a lot of other senators. In the most recent Roll Call survey of congressional net worth, Warren ranks 24th among senators with an estimated net worth of $3.66 million, and 76th among the 535 members of the House and Senate combined. So her net worth is well above average, but it’s nowhere near the congressional or senatorial top 1 percent. Our ruling The social media meme said Warren "lives in a $5.4 million mansion." Warren does live in a desirable neighborhood in an expensive urban center, which means that her house is much more expensive than that of most Americans. Still, the meme overshoots the facts of the case. The house’s estimated value is less than half of the stated $5.4 million, and calling it a mansion is a stretch.

pomt-09392	Says she was the “the only Democrat who voted against the Wall Street bailout."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/25/kathy-castor/castor-says-she-was-only-democrat-tarp/	With a new report calling her Florida's most liberal member of the U.S. House, Rep. Kathy Castor said the label doesn't fit because she broke with her party on a key issue: the bailout for financial firms. Castor, who represents portions of Hillsborough, Pinellas and Manatee counties, was quoted in the Tampa Tribune last month saying she was "the only Democrat to vote against the Wall Street bailout." Castor spokeswoman Ellen Gedalius told PolitiFact Florida that the partial quote omitted some important context. She said that the congresswoman was saying she was the only Democrat in Florida to vote against the Troubled Assets Relief Program, an emergency federal plan in the fall of 2008 intended to keep the financial system from collapsing. "The context was a discussion on the Florida delegation," said Gedalius, "so her comment about being the only Democrat to vote against TARP was in that context of being the only Florida Democrat to vote against it." Tampa Tribune reporter William "Windy" March, who wrote the story, said he did not want to characterize the quote or its context. "She didn’t explicitly say and I didn’t explicitly ask,'' he told Politifact Florida. Still, Gedalius' explanation matches our reading of the Tribune story. It is headlined "Rep. Castor disputes liberal ranking," and is primarily about her political leanings relative to other members of the Florida delegation to the U.S. House. The article attributed the ranking to the National Journal, an influential Washington-based publication that covers politics and national affairs. The TARP was proposed by President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who sought congressional approval for $700 billion to buy bad assets from the nation's banks. The first vote took place on Sept. 29, 2008, when the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bill in a stunning 205-228 vote. Ninety-five of the no votes came from Democrats, including Castor, who indeed was the only Florida Democrat to vote against it. The second vote came just days later when on Oct. 3 the House reversed itself, 263-171, in favor of another version of the same bill that had been approved by the Senate. Again, Castor was the lone Florida Democrat in the House to vote against the measure. This is what she said at the time: "After thoughtful consideration and review, I voted against President Bush's $700 billion bailout. The Bush plan does not provide sufficient help to middle-class families in the housing squeeze or taxpayer protections.” So Castor is right, with the caveat that she was referring to Florida Democrats. And so we rate her claim True.	None	Kathy Castor	None	None	None	2010-03-25T14:01:58	2010-02-27	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Wall_Street']
pomt-04565	Says there are "fewer jobs in America today than when Barack Obama became president."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/26/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-america-has-fewer-jobs-when-ba/	Missouri residents will head to the polls Nov. 6 to choose between re-electing their Democratic governor or tapping his Republican challenger for the job, but New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has another name for voters to keep in mind: President Barack Obama. At a Sept. 23 rally in the Show-Me State for Republican gubernatorial candidate Dave Spence, Christie told the crowd a vote for Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon is a vote for Obama. To make his case, the Republican governor argued that Nixon and Obama both have overseen job losses. "Gov. Jay Nixon’s path here in Missouri is identical to the president’s path," said Christie, according to a YouTube video of his speech. "Fewer jobs in America today than when Barack Obama became president, fewer jobs in Missouri today than before Jay Nixon became governor. "They are the same," Christie went on. "You vote for Jay Nixon, that’s a vote for President Obama. That’s not what Missourians want. You want Dave Spence as the next governor of Missouri." But Christie is off target in attacking Obama over job losses. Based on the most recent federal labor statistics, it’s accurate to say there are fewer jobs nationwide than there were in January 2009, when Obama was sworn in. But compared with February 2009 -- Obama’s first full month in office -- there has been a net increase of 463,000 jobs. Christie's claim also ignores the fact that the nation has created more than 3.4 million jobs over 23 consecutive months of employment gains. The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment. Let’s break down the numbers. Amid an ongoing recession, Obama took office in early 2009 at a time when the nation already had lost millions of jobs in the preceding year. The country continued to lose jobs each month until early 2010, when monthly job growth began to occur. As of August 2012, the nation had seen 23 consecutive months of growth in total non-farm jobs, including both public- and private-sector employment, according to the most recent seasonally adjusted data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those gains totaled more than 3.4 million jobs. The latest numbers show the nation had 133.3 million total jobs in August, representing the largest monthly total since January 2009, when Obama was sworn in. That figure is preliminary. How does that figure compare to when Obama became president? Well, compared to January 2009, there has been a net decrease of 261,000 jobs. However, when we start counting in February 2009 -- Obama’s first full month in office -- the numbers tell a different story. Fast forward to August 2012, and we find a net increase of 463,000 jobs. For an overview of total jobs and monthly changes between January 2009 and August 2012, check out the chart at the bottom of this page. Still, as we’ve noted in previous stories, it’s wrong to completely credit or blame a president -- or a governor for that matter -- for job gains and losses. There are multiple factors involved beyond the control of the chief executive. Our ruling At a campaign rally in Missouri, Christie said there are "fewer jobs in America today than when Barack Obama became president." If we start counting with January 2009, when Obama was sworn in, the governor’s claim is right. Between that month and August 2012, there has been a net decrease of 261,000 jobs. But that figure is misleading. Starting with February 2009, which was Obama’s first full month in office, there has been a net increase of 463,000 jobs. Overall, the nation’s employment picture has been steadily improving with 23 consecutive months of total job growth. Therefore, Christie’s claim "contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That meets our definition of Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e9298d92-d7fe-429b-b4ef-96596752dbe1 To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-00215	Says Andrew Gillum is running "from the FBI."	false	/florida/statements/2018/oct/12/republican-party-florida/no-evidence-andrew-gillum-running-fbi/	A Republican ad portrays Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum as a man on the run from law enforcement amid an FBI corruption probe in his city. "Andrew Gillum is running for governor and also from the FBI," the Republican Party of Florida ad says. That’s extremely misleading. But the ad goes on to level more specific charges. "Andrew Gillum has ties to an active criminal investigation. Gillum took possible illegal trips with lobbyists to New York and Costa Rica. More controversy concerning Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum. Gillum approved millions in grants for those same lobbyists. An ongoing corruption probe. Now Gillum refuses to disclose who has paid him." It appears unlikely that law enforcement will announce the results of their investigation before Gillum faces Republican Ron DeSantis in the race for governor. So some of the ad’s claims are speculative. In a related story, we will explain all of the ad’s allegations in depth. Here, we will fact-check the ad’s most inaccurate statement, that Gillum is running from, or somehow evading, the FBI. What we know about the FBI investigation The ad is wrong when it states that Gillum is running from the FBI. None of the news articles cited by the Republicans provide evidence that Gillum has run from the FBI. The only evidence publicly known is that Gillum has cooperated with an ongoing corruption investigation in Tallahassee. The investigation started in 2015, when FBI agents posed as businessmen identifying themselves as Mike Sweets, Mike Miller and Brian Butler. They spent months schmoozing Tallahassee city officials and those around them. The undercover agents said they wanted to invest in properties if they could get public funding. In June 2017, FBI agents delivered a subpoena to Tallahassee City Hall requesting thousands of pages of records from key players in city government. The records related to top local developers behind projects subsidized by the city’s Community Redevelopment Agency. The FBI issued more subpoenas through May 2018, and the city has turned over about 200,000 records. The Tallahassee Democrat broke the story about the FBI investigation on June 22, 2017. The next day, Gillum said he had already met with the FBI, and that the FBI told him he was not the focus of the investigation. "Last week, the FBI approached me about several people and businesses here in Tallahassee," Gillum said in a statement. "I spoke with them and told them they could expect both the city and my personal cooperation with the investigation. They assured me I was not the focus of an investigation and that they would be moving quickly with their work." Gillum met with the FBI without a lawyer present, he says. Barry Richard, Gillum’s attorney for a related state ethics commission complaint, told PolitiFact that the FBI has not asked for any subsequent meeting with Gillum or any documents from him. "There is no FBI probe of Gillum," Richard said. "The only connection is the FBI asked him some questions in his home and told him he wasn’t the focus." Steven R. Andrews, a Tallahassee attorney representing the city’s former manager — who testified before the federal grand jury — told Politico he believes Gillum is in the clear. Prosecutors never asked his client about the mayor, Andrews said. Law enforcement hasn’t commented to the media about the investigation. Our ruling A Republican Party of Florida ad said Gillum is running "from the FBI." The claim tracks back to a corruption investigation involving Tallahassee, where Gillum is mayor. But there's no evidence to suggest that Gillum is running from the FBI. After news of the FBI investigation became public in June 2017, Gillum said he met with the FBI the previous week. Gillum met with the FBI at his home without a lawyer, he says. His lawyer in a related ethics matter said that the FBI has not asked for a subsequent meeting with Gillum. We don’t know the full story behind the FBI investigation yet, because law enforcement have made no announcements about the case. But there is no evidence that Gillum has run from the FBI.

pomt-06632	Says the vaccine to prevent HPV can cause mental retardation.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/16/michele-bachmann/bachmann-hpv-vaccine-cause-mental-retardation/	After criticizing Texas Gov. Rick Perry for mandating a vaccine for school girls, Rep. Michele Bachmann added some scary charges: She claimed to have just met a woman whose daughter suffered mental retardation from the vaccine, that it has "very dangerous consequences" and that it puts "little children's lives at risk." In the CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, Bachmann blasted Perry for mandating a vaccine for school girls to guard against human papilloma virus, or HPV, which can cause cervical cancer. The vaccine can prevent the virus, but the virus is sexually transmitted, which makes the idea of requiring the inoculation of young girls controversial among some parents. Perry issued an executive order requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccination against HPV. The order included an opt-out, allowing exemptions if parents objected for philosophical or religious reasons. (Read more on the history of the executive order.) Critics raised two major objections to Perry's 2007 order -- that the state should not require vaccinations for sexually transmitted diseases, and that parents should be asked beforehand whether they wanted their children vaccinated. The Legislature overruled Perry's order, and during the presidential campaign, Perry has said he made a mistake by ordering the vaccinations without consent of the Legislature. During the debate, Bachmann suggested that the vaccine maker, Merck & Co., used political influence to get Perry's approval for the vaccine, Gardasil. She also suggested that the vaccine might be harmful to the young girls who received it, saying, "Little girls who have a negative reaction to this potentially dangerous drug don't get a 'mulligan'" -- that is, a do-over. Bachmann received applause for her attacks. But in subsequent interviews, Bachmann became more specific that the vaccine harmed children's health. Here's what she said in an interview on Fox News: "There's a woman who came up crying to me tonight after the debate. She said her daughter was given that vaccine. She told me her daughter suffered mental retardation as a result of that vaccine. There are very dangerous consequences. It's not good enough to take, quote, 'a mulligan' where you want a do-over, not when you have little children's lives at risk." And here's what she told NBC's "Today Show": "Well, I will tell you that I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa, Florida, after the debate," Bachmann said. "She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. It can have very dangerous side effects. The mother was crying what she came up to me last night. I didn't know who she was before the debate. This is a very real concern and people have to draw their own conclusions." So while Bachmann hedged somewhat that people can "draw their own conclusions," she still made a very clear suggestion that the vaccine can cause retardation and puts "little children's lives at risk." When asked about the remark on Sept. 15, 2011, in San Rafael, Calif., Bachmann continued to hedge somewhat, saying, "I didn't make any statements that would indicate I'm a doctor, I'm a scientist, or making any conclusions about the drug one way or the other." She added that she was merely relaying the concerns of a woman who was "very distraught." But Bachmann turned down a chance to apologize for her earlier comments. Soon after Bachmann made the claim, medical professionals raced to counter the notion that an HPV vaccination can cause mental retardation. The American Academy of Pediatrics, which includes 60,000 primary care pediatricians, released the following statement: "The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the Republican presidential campaign that HPV vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation. There is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement. Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all recommend that girls receive HPV vaccine around age 11 or 12. That’s because this is the age at which the vaccine produces the best immune response in the body, and because it’s important to protect girls well before the onset of sexual activity. In the U.S., about 6 million people, including teens, become infected with HPV each year, and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer. This is a life-saving vaccine that can protect girls from cervical cancer." Many in the medical community pointed to the vaccine's track record in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. This is a database co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration that tracks "adverse" health events following vaccinations, ranging from minor to serious. The database has limitations -- some adverse events may not be overlooked if VAERS isn't notified, and the agencies who run it caution that just because an adverse event happened, it doesn't mean that the vaccination was the cause. However, VAERS is the largest such database available, and measured by its standards, the HPV vaccine in question has fared well in terms of possible side effects: "As of June 22, 2011, approximately 35 million doses of Gardasil were distributed in the U.S. and VAERS received a total of 18,727 reports of adverse events following Gardasil vaccination. ... Of the total number of VAERS reports following Gardasil, 92 percent were considered to be non-serious, and 8 percent were considered serious. ... The vast majority (92 percent) of the adverse events reports following Gardasil vaccination have included fainting, pain, and swelling at the injection site (the arm), headache, nausea, and fever. Syncope (fainting) is common after injections and vaccinations, especially in adolescents. Falls after fainting may sometimes cause serious injuries, such as head injuries, which can be prevented by closely observing the person for 15 minutes after vaccination." The remaining 8 percent of adverse events included such serious ailments as Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a nervous system disorder, blood clots and even death. However, the official analysis of the VAERS data is that the incidence of Guillain-Barré did not exceed the level in the comparable population at large, that "most" of the people who experienced blood clots also had other risk factors for clots, and that analysis of the 32 confirmed deaths suggested that either the deaths had been attributed to other causes or that "there was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine." Notably absent is any mention of mental retardation. And the official conclusion based on the VAERS data is this: "Based on all of the information we have today, CDC recommends HPV vaccination for the prevention of most types of cervical cancer." As our friends at FactCheck.org also noted, a blue ribbon panel convened by the Institute of Medicine has released a report in August about adverse events and vaccines, including HPV vaccines. The experts did find "strong and generally suggestive" evidence that a different condition -- a serious allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis -- may be caused by the HPV vaccine. It also found four published reports of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, a neurological condition that could impair mental capabilities. But Joseph Bocchini -- the chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (Shreveport) and a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -- told FactCheck.org that even if the symptoms of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis mirrored those seen by the woman who spoke to Bachmann, the number of cases was too small to assign any causal connection to the vaccine. So, beyond anaphylaxis, the IOM panel did not find any causal evidence to link adverse events to the vaccine. We checked with a couple experts in pediatric medicine for their view on Bachmann's claim. They said there was no scientific evidence to support it, and they added that the HPV vaccine has undergone the full complement of safety testing that all vaccines must undergo before going on the market. "I have no qualms about advising this is a safe vaccine," said Christopher Harrison, a doctor and the director of the infectious disease research laboratory at Children's Mercy Hospitals in Kansas City, Mo. "The millions of doses that have been given make clinicians comfortable recommending and giving it." "I've given it to both my daughters," said Kenneth Alexander, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Chicago Medical Center. "It's as safe or safer as any vaccine out there." "This is an anti-cancer vaccine. We should be going to the rooftops and shouting 'Huzzah!'" said William Schaffner, chair of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Our ruling In several national television appearances, Bachmann said a woman reported her child had experienced mental retardation after receiving an HPV vaccination. We can't judge the specifics of that case -- neither the woman nor the daughter have been identified as far as we could find and skeptics have offered a reward if the victim can be found. But even if Bachmann's portrayal of what happened is accurate, it falls well short of the scientific standard for demonstrating causality between an inoculation and an adverse health event. Ongoing studies of tens of thousands of reported adverse events following tens of millions of inoculations have revealed only a small number of serious ailments, only one of which -- anaphylaxis -- had strong enough evidence to suggest a causal link from the vaccine itself. Since Bachmann made her claim, medical organizations and individual experts have come out strongly against her implication that the HPV vaccine can cause mental retardation. We rate her statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-09-16T17:21:50	2011-09-13	['None']
pomt-03855	"When (John) Brennan ... was asked directly … ‘Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?’ Brennan responded and said, ‘no, there is no limitation.’"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/12/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-cia-director-john-brennan-claimed-n/	When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., staged his historic filibuster over 13 hours on March 6, 2013, he said he just wanted answers. He wanted President Barack Obama’s administration to definitively say whether the use of armed drones could ever be justified on American soil. During his epic stand on the Senate floor, which only ended with the inevitable call of nature, Paul cited several statements made by administration officials that concerned him -- including one by CIA Director nominee John Brennan. "When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly, 'Is there any limit to your killing? Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?' Brennan responded and said, 'no, there is no limitation,'" Paul said during the first hour of filibustering. Paul's issue was about the possibility of drone strikes in the United States. After his filibuster, Attorney General Eric Holder addressed Paul's concerns in a letter. Holder wrote that the president does not have the authority "to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil." In looking over Paul's statements during the filibuster, we wondered: Did Paul accurately characterize Brennan’s answer about geographic limitations to drone use in the global terror fight? Did Brennan say there was "no geographic limitation?" We reached out to Paul’s office but did not hear back. Still, we found three instances of Brennan addressing that issue. In a speech in April 2012 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Brennan -- acknowledging the administration’s drone program for the first time publicly -- said drone strikes could be necessary outside of the battlefield. At the time he was Obama’s point person on counterterrorism strategy. "There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat," he said. In February 2013, ahead of hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to confirm him as CIA director, Brennan reiterated that belief in response to written questions. Question: "Would you support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of ‘hot’ battlefields and codify the standards for the conduct of targeted strikes, including through the use of remotely piloted aircraft? Why or why not?" Brennan replied: "On your question about whether I would support legislation to authorize the use of force outside of ‘hot’ battlefields, I believe we currently have the authority to take action in such circumstances against al-Qaida and associated forces. As Jeh Johnson, the former General Counsel of the Department of Defense, indicated in a lecture at Yale Law School in February of last year, the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force does not contain a geographical limitation. Consequently I do not believe additional legislation along these lines is necessary." And in more written questions after his confirmation hearing, Brennan was again asked about "geographical limits" on the administration’s drone strikes. He noted, in part, "the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, ‘neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.’" But he went on to say: "This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nation’s sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States." We ran this issue by Paul Pillar, a former CIA official who now teaches at Georgetown University. He responded: "Sen. Paul's comment is a generally correct characterization of Brennan's answer regarding the absence of any geographic limitation on the administration's authority to conduct strikes. Brennan's further remark about other considerations coming into play is a way of saying that the administration does not wantonly conduct strikes around the world, but those considerations do not constitute a ‘geographic limitation.’" Our ruling Paul said during the filibuster, "When Brennan, whose nomination I am opposing today, was asked directly, … ‘Is there any geographic limitation to your drone strike program?’ Brennan responded and said, ‘no, there is no limitation.’" We found three instances when Brennan cited legal opinion asserting no geographic limit on where the United States can use drones against terrorists. He did add that the absence of a geographic limit does not mean drones can be used "whenever or wherever" -- that international legal principles still apply. But we agree with Pillar that that addendum doesn’t amount to a geographic limitation. Paul’s characterization of Brennan’s comments is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-04909	"There are close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/03/sanford-bishop/congressman-nearly-900000-veterans-are-unemployed/	A recently posted YouTube video had your PolitiFact Georgia scribes worried about our men and women in uniform. It showed U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop of Albany objecting to parts of a bill setting the budget for the U.S. Department of Defense. He said it weakened labor laws that protect veterans and other workers from discrimination. Such changes would hit veterans hard. They’re already struggling to find work. "There are close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now," the Democrat said in the video posted July 23. Is that correct? We contacted Bishop’s office for more information. While the video was posted recently, the speech was made in December. Bishop’s motion to change the bill failed. Bishop’s press secretary, Maxwell Gigle, backed up the claim by sending us news releases from the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs and the congressman’s office. Two cited the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official keeper of labor data, as the source of their numbers. Each month, the agency conducts what’s called the Current Population Survey. This survey collects data on employment, earnings, work hours, demographics and related issues from about 60,000 households across the nation. The survey includes questions designed to track the employment status of veterans, which it defines as men and women who previously served on active duty in the U.S. military and were civilians when the survey was conducted. In 2011, an average of about 11.3 million veterans were in the workforce, according to the yearly report. Some 945,000 of them were out of work. Veterans of the wars waged after the 9/11 attacks had the hardest time. About 12.1 percent of them were unemployed last year. By contrast, unemployment among all veterans averaged at about 8.3 percent. The number of unemployed veterans has since dropped to 806,000, according to the BLS’ June 2012 figures. That’s 7.4 percent of the veteran workforce. When Bishop made his speech, the latest data available was from November, when 832,000 veterans were unemployed. Veterans are faring better than U.S. workers as a whole. In June, the unemployment rate for all workers stood at 8.2 percent, according to the BLS. In conclusion, Bishop said in his speech before Congress that there were "close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now." This number is a bit lower than the yearly average and higher than the latest unemployment figures available at the time. His statement rates a True on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-00119	Says Sen. Claire McCaskill was named "most likely to be the most unpopular senator in the United States for four months in a row!"	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/28/missouri-gop/mccaskill-isnt-popular-gops-claim-shes-worst-doesn/	The GOP wants to position Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., as unable to represent more conservative ideals in this firmly red state. "Congrats to @clairecmc for being named most likely to be the most unpopular senator in the United States for four months in a row! Quite an accomplishment! #MOSen," the party tweeted Sept. 10 as part of its support for challenger Josh Hawley. Being named as the least popular senator in the country would be an unwanted title, so we wanted to check into the Missouri GOP’s claim. Morning Consult and its polls We reached out to the Missouri Republican Party multiple times by email and received no reply. But small text in the tweet’s photo credited the claim to a Morning Consult poll. Morning Consult is a technology company that works in collecting and understanding data. It has a newsroom section that focuses on data reporting, like data from senator approval rating polls. The Morning Consult poll in question shows the 10 top-ranked and bottom-ranked senators in the country. Each senator’s percentage rankings have a different margin of error, ranging from 1 to 6 percentage points. The margin of error for McCaskill’s is 1 percentage point. Morning Consult’s methodology has various aspects to it. Surveys are sent out online to registered voters in each state. The questions asked of each respondent only included subjects about their voting preferences and specifics about their state’s senator. For Missouri, each poll received between 7,000 and 9,000 responses from registered voters. Party affiliation of the voters is not broken down by state. The poll is conducted quarterly, not every month, as readers of the GOP tweet might think. And it doesn’t rank which senator is the "most likely to be the most unpopular senator." The polls contain approval, disapproval and unknown/undecided ratings. McCaskill was the fourth-least popular senator in the nation in the July 25 poll. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the least popular. In Morning Consult’s April and July quarterly polls McCaskill had a 44 percent disapproval rating. Her approval rating dropped by 1 percentage point to 39 percent from April to July. Morning Consult more frequently updates the poll for the 10 incumbents in highly competitive races. The September update, released before the tweet, showed McCaskill had a 46 percent disapproval rating, the highest among the other selected senators on the ballot in 2018. The poll also has a question in which voters are asked if they think it is time for someone new. McCaskill received the second-highest ranking of respondents saying yes, at 53 percent. That was behind Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, another Democrat, at 54 percent. The current picture The tweet is more than a month old, so we wanted to look at the most recent ratings. As of the most recent update Oct. 3, McCaskill was up to a 48 percent disapproval rating. McCaskill’s disapproval rating has been increasing since the 44 percent in July, but has never eclipsed McConnell to be the senator with the worst disapproval rating. McCaskill’s time for a new person rating has also gone up to 54 percent from the October update, but it is still behind Nelson’s by one percentage point. Morning Consult has also released its third-quarter senator rankings, and McCaskill is now the third-least popular. Although they do show that McCaskill has climbed up one rank, she is still not the most unpopular senator. Experts weigh in on Morning Consult polls Polling experts we talked to noted that registered voters are more likely to be Republican, which could lead Democrats on Morning Consult polls to have inflated disapproval statistics. Cliff Zukin, Rutgers University professor of political science and public policy, brought up that the results from the surveys are brought from volunteer responses, which is not as accurate as a true scientific sampling method. Because the respondents would volunteer to answer the survey, it is not as representative of the underlying population as a completely random sampling method would be. Claiming that disapproval rating and being the "worst" are not as linked as one might think. Kenneth D. Wald, University of Florida professor emeritus of political science, claimed that politicians making decisions on polarizing topics will usually increase their disapproval rating as they would upset a some group of people. Our ruling The Missouri GOP said, "Congrats to @clairecmc for being named most likely to be the most unpopular senator in the United States for four months in a row!" The tweet is sloppily worded as there is no such designation for being named "most likely to be the most unpopular senator." McCaskill’s popularity is low among her peers up for re-election. But she isn’t the most unpopular. McConnell held that position in July and has kept it through to October. When compared to certain vulnerable incumbents, she does have the highest disapproval rating in the country. The Missouri GOP tweet said that she is the most unpopular senator in the country, which does not reference solely incumbents running for re-election. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-14190	"She is the only candidate who has stood by our community and immigration reform from the beginning."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2016/apr/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-reaches-too-far-immigration-claim/	In a new radio ad in Spanish, Hillary Clinton's campaign champions her work on immigration reform and says she's been "standing with Latino families in Rhode Island and across the country for her entire career." "In Rhode Island, we come from all over. Our diversity is our strength," the campaign says in the ad. The announcer continues, "She is the only candidate who has stood by our community and immigration reform from the beginning." Ahead of Tuesday's primary, we thought this was an important issue to nail down. Has Hillary Clinton stood by Latino voters "from the beginning"? Is she the only candidate who has? Let's tackle the Republicans first. Ted Cruz In an interview with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News in February, Ted Cruz said he would forcibly deport all of the country's undocumented immigrants by sending "law enforcement to apprehend them and send them home." He backs plans to build a U.S.-Mexico border fence, and wants to end birthright citizenship, according to an NPR report. We emailed Ted Cruz's campaign three times and asked for more information. They never got back to us. John Kasich At an August town hall meeting in New Hampshire, Gov. John Kasich said "it is not practical nor is it I think desirable" to deport immigrants en masse, The New York Times reported. But Ohio, where Kasich is governor, is part of a multi-state lawsuit blocking President Obama's 2014 executive order that would offer temporary legal status to millions. We exchanged 14 emails with Rob Nichols, Kasich's press secretary, hoping for clarification. He said we're "testing the wrong part of the sentence" and declined to provide information about Kasich's record until we established what Clinton meant by "from the beginning." We told him what she meant — the beginning of her career — and he said "If I can prove that Hillary hasn't always stood by that community, why wouldn't that suffice?" and then asked "Why do we matter?" Then he stopped responding. Donald Trump Well, there's the wall. Also his insistence that Mexico is sending the United States "drugs, crime, and rapists." Enough said. Bernie Sanders Sanders has a strong record on immigration issues, Warren Gunnels, his senior policy advisor, replied. Sanders supports "comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows," the senator said in a MSNBC Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire in February. He voted for the Dream Act in 2010, which would have legalized immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. He also supported the so-called "Gang of Eight" bill in 2013. This bipartisan legislation created a path for people already in the United States, focused on reducing visa backlogs, and improved work visa options for low-skilled workers. While he was in the House of Representatives in the '90s, he voted against House Amendment 778, which would have to prohibited undocumented people's access to Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency food and shelter programs. He voted for Amendment 968 to H.R. 2202, which removed a section barring "illegal aliens from receiving public assistance." In 2006, he voted against the Immigration Law Enforcement Act, which allowed local police to aid in "enforcement of immigration laws, to provide for effective prosecution of alien smugglers, and to reform immigration litigation procedures. Hillary Clinton We asked Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Hillary for America, to provide evidence to substantiate the ad's claims. Schwerin told us that while in law school, Clinton worked with Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children's Defense Fund. She completed research on education and health of migrant children that would later be used in Senate hearings investigating the living and working conditions of farm workers. He also told us about her job on George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, where she worked closely with Franklin Garcia, a well-respected union leader, registering Latino voters in south Texas, which was chronicled in a Buzzfeed article about her ties to the Latino community. While serving in the Senate, Clinton co-sponsored the Safe, Orderly, Legal Visas and Enforcement Act of 2004 with Sen. Edward Kennedy. Clinton co-sponsored the Dream Act in 2003, 2005 and 2007, which helped give immigrant students access to higher education, among other things. As Secretary of State in May 2011, Clinton called immigrants a "source of vitality" for the U.S. at the Council of the Americas 41st Washington Conference. She also supported Obama's commitment to comprehensive immigration reform during those remarks. During the campaign, Clinton has stressed that Sanders voted against the comprehensive immigration reform bill brought by Arizona Sen. John McCain and the late Sen. Kennedy six times. She voted yes. But, explaining that vote in 2007, Sanders said "it made no sense" to bring millions of "guest workers" into the country when it could drive down wages of U.S. employees. Gunnels, in a recent email, said Sanders also thought the bill "lacked badly needed protection" for immigrant voters and noted that Hispanic advocacy groups such as The League of United Latin American Citizens, The Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, and The American Immigration Lawyers Association also opposed the bill. Drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants is another issue that flared on the debate stage last month in Miami. Clinton says she supports opening up driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. So does Sanders. But in 2007, as Sanders pointed out in the debate, Clinton said as president she would not support that. Our ruling Hillary Clinton has long supported the immigrant community: from law school to the Senate to the Cabinet, and she's built a strong record of what her ad calls "immigration reform." She may well have been at it "from the beginning," but to say she is the "only" candidate supporting "immigration reform" over a career is to minimize Sanders' position on the issue. Hillary's campaign can trace her support back to law school. As for the "beginning" for Sanders, we don't know what positions he took as a young socialist, but we can track his immigration record back to beginning of his legislative career in Washington. Sanders' voting record and his immigration reform plan show consistent support for a path to citizenship, despite his opposition to the 2007 bill. And remember, Clinton herself seemed to stumble on drivers' licenses in 2007. Because the statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01654	Says Iowa Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst "would privatize Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/21/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-ad-says-iowa-gop-candidate-joni-ernst-b/	The news networks may be focusing on protests in Ferguson, Mo., the rise of the extremist group ISIS in Iraq and the spread of the Ebola virus in west Africa. But on television screens in the heartland, the fiscal future of Social Security is attracting significant notice, at least where campaign ads are concerned. We recently checked claims by a Democratic House candidate and a Republican-aligned advocacy group that told less than the full story about where members of Congress stand on the question of raising the retirement age for receiving Social Security. Now we’re looking at a claim in Iowa’s highly competitive open-seat Senate race, where the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -- the party’s Senate-campaign arm -- has opened up a new front against Republican nominee Joni Ernst. The ad opens by spotlighting Ernst’s endorsement from (and grateful words for) former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has become an icon for some conservative Republicans but a polarizing figure for many Democrats. "Joni Ernst would be another tea party vote in the Senate," the ad says in part. "Ernst would privatize Social Security. ... Palin, Ernst: Too extreme for Iowa." We wondered: Is the ad correct that Ernst "would privatize Social Security"? We decided to take a closer look. A primer on privatization First, some background about Social Security privatization. Currently, Social Security benefits for today’s recipients are paid from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have advocated turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is that retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that the beneficiary could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither is possible under the current Social Security program. One of the most high-profile proposals along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into "personal retirement accounts." Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation. A few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress. These two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom -- that changing the way Social Security operates is the "third rail" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. For this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term "privatization" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology. What Ernst said The visuals in the DSCC ad offer a footnote to support its claim about Ernst -- a primary debate aired on KCCI, the CBS affiliate in Des Moines. Here’s the full text of what Ernst said during that debate in response to a question about the future of Social Security: "I do think we have to keep the promises that are made to today's seniors, absolutely. So to do this, we do have to reform Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And the way we do that with Social Security is by looking at transitioning our younger workers onto individual plans or individual savings accounts, whether that’s tied to the market, whether it’s based on interest rates -- however we want to do that, we can have that discussion. But the way we are protecting our seniors is by transitioning our younger workers. And we can do that, but we have to keep our promises to seniors." This passage makes clear that Ernst is open to the idea of a "market"-based Social Security overhaul. However, there’s reason to believe the ad goes too far in how it describes Ernst’s stance. Where the ad goes too far One stretch in the ad involves the words "would" and "privatize." Ernst was vague about specifics, relying on phrases like, "however we want to do that" and "we can have that discussion." The issues page on her campaign website is similarly vague. "Joni believes strongly that Social Security and Medicare must be preserved and protected for our seniors of today and tomorrow. She opposes any efforts to change the promised benefits for today’s seniors. At the same time she supports reforms that will strengthen both Social Security and Medicare to ensure the long-term health of both programs for her daughters and grandchildren and their generations." Would she make private investments optional and valid for only a portion of the taxes paid into the system, as was the case under both the Bush and Ryan plans? Based on Ernst’s public comments, it’s impossible to know. Ernst’s decision to avoid the term "privatization" and keep under wraps whatever roadmap she favors may amount to a dodge, but it’s what she’s advocating, and the ad ignores that nuance. Meanwhile, the second problem is that Ernst specifically limited her proposed reforms to "younger workers," emphasizing that "we have to keep the promises that are made to today's seniors." The ad doesn’t note that limitation -- an omission that’s only exaggerated by the fact that the ad uses an image of a senior citizen, rather than a younger worker. Our ruling The DSCC said Ernst "would privatize Social Security." In the KCCI debate, Ernst did say pretty clearly that she supports "reform" for Social Security in order to keep it fiscally sound over the long term. However, by using the word "privatization," the ad overstates the degree of clarity in the policy changes Ernst says she supports, while also glossing over the fact that she limited her proposed changes to "younger workers." The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2014-08-21T16:56:50	2014-08-18	['None']

pomt-09952	Cheney is "disagreeing with President Bush's policy. President Bush stated repeatedly to international audiences and to the country that he wanted to close Guantanamo."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/26/colin-powell/colin-powell-bush-cheney-gitmo-differences/	In a much anticipated interview on CBS's Face the Nation on May 24, 2009, former Secretary of State Colin Powell fired back at former Vice President Dick Cheney's public criticism of President Barack Obama's decision to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In a speech on national defense on May 21, Cheney said Obama's announcement of his intent to close Gitmo "came with little deliberation and no plan" and might result in terrorists being brought to the United States. "The administration has found that it's easy to receive applause in Europe for closing Guantanamo," Cheney said, "but it's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and America's national security." Cheney has argued that Guantanamo needs to stay open. "If you didn't have it, you'd have to invent it," Cheney said in a Fox News interview on May 12, 2009. "It's a good facility, it's an important program, and we ought to continue it." But Powell said on Face the Nation that position runs counter to that of Cheney's old boss, President George W. Bush. "Mr. Cheney is not only disagreeing with President Obama's policy," Powell said. "He's disagreeing with President Bush's policy. President Bush stated repeatedly to international audiences and to the country that he wanted to close Guantanamo. The problem he had was he couldn't get all the pieces together. "Secretary Rice, Secretary of State Rice and Secretary of Defense Gates had come forward with plans, but the plans ran into difficulties with Department of Justice and others. "So it is a complex problem, and President Bush wasn't able to close Guantanamo on his watch. And President Obama came in saying he would close Guantanamo, and he has run into some of those same sorts of problems. So I think we need to kind of take the heat out of this issue." Powell is correct that several times during 2006 and 2007, President Bush publicly expressed his desire to close Gitmo. Here are a few examples: * "I’d like to close Guantanamo. But I also recognize that we’re holding some people that are darned dangerous, and that we’d better have a plan to deal with them in our courts." — Bush in a White House news conference on June 14, 2006 * "I'd like to end Guantanamo. I'd like it to be over with." But, he said, there are some "cold-blooded killers" who need to be tried in U.S. courts. The United States is "not going to let people out on the street who will do you harm." — Bush in a speech after talks with European Union leaders at a one-day summit in Vienna, June 21, 2006. * "I did say it should be a goal of the nation to shut down Guantanamo. I also made it clear that part of the delay was the reluctance of some nations to take back some of the people being held there. In other words, in order to make it work, we've got to have a place for these people to go. ... We are working with other nations to send folks back. Again, it's a fairly steep order. A lot of people don't want killers in their midst, and a lot of these people are killers. "Secondly, of course, we want to make sure that when we do send them back, they're treated as humanely as possible. The other issue was whether or not we can get people to be tried. One of the things I'm anxious about, want to see happen, is that there to be trials. Courts have been involved with deciding how to do this, and Defense is trying to work out mechanisms to get the trials up and running. And the sooner we can get that up and running, the better it is, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want to make any predictions about whether Guantanamo will be available or not. I'm just telling you it's a very complicated subject. "And I laid out an aspiration. Whether or not we can achieve that or not, we'll try to. But it is not as easy a subject as some may think on the surface." — Bush in a news conference Aug. 9, 2007 So Bush had an "aspiration" to close Gitmo. But by the fall of 2008, the New York Times reported, Bush became resigned that "closing Guantanamo would involve too many legal and political risks to be acceptable, now or any time soon," according to senior administration officials. And, obviously, it did not close. Powell isn't entirely correct when he says Cheney is disagreeing with Bush's policy. Bush always qualified statements about his desire to close Gitmo with warnings that legal complications presented huge obstacles. And ultimately, Bush decided those complications meant that Gitmo remained necessary and had to remain open. That's an awful lot like what Cheney has been saying. It's one thing to say you want to close Gitmo, Cheney said last week, "but it's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and America's national security." So yes, Powell is right that Bush said he wanted to close Gitmo. But it's not as simple as Bush wanting to close Gitmo and Cheney wanting to keep it open. Because, in fact, Bush did leave it open. Bush said legal issues — and the fear of terrorists being brought to the United States — led him to keep the facility open. Again, that sounds like what Cheney has been saying.

pomt-07983	On whether the state should privatize the Ohio Turnpike.	no flip	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/19/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-hasnt-dismissed-privatizing-ohio-t/	Privatizing the Ohio Turnpike did not become an issue in last year's gubernatorial campaign, mainly because it was a subject on which incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland and Republican challenger John Kasich seemed to agree. Neither candidate advocated it. In contrast, four years earlier, GOP candidate J. Kenneth Blackwell proposed leasing the turnpike to a private entity for 99 years. The proposal echoed a deal by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, earlier in 2006, to lease the 157-mile Indiana Toll Road for 75 years to a Spanish-Australian consortium for a one-time payment of $3.85 billion. Strickland, who had called Blackwell's plan "irresponsible" and "a gimmick," said: "I don't think the people of Ohio want to take a critical major infrastructure and turn it over to a private entity and thereby relinquish control over decisions regarding that infrastructure going forward for 50 or more years." The question was put to Kasich when Daniels joined him campaigning in Cleveland last July. Kasich said that privatizing the turnpike "doesn't make a lot of sense" because it would not be financially wise. He said, "The problem right now with considering privatizing the turnpike is you don't get any money for it. The capital markets are very terrible." Significantly, Kasich did not reject the concept as a matter of principle. But saying that the idea didn't make sense, and that there were problems with even considering it, he seemed to take the issue off the table. Recently though, now-Gov. Kasich has again discussed the idea. Exactly a month after being elected, he said he and his advisers were studying the idea, although the timing was probably not right. "Everything's on the table," he told reporters Dec. 2 after speaking at the annual meeting of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. "You could do a lease of the turnpike. That's an entity up there that has had a life of its own. We of course are going to look at that." He said the sort of payment received by Indiana would be "beyond reach," and "So what? It would be billions, it would be more than one." Kasich knew the suggestion would raise eyebrows -- "This will get me a lot of nice phone calls," he said -- and spokesman Rob Nichols pushed the idea to the breakdown lane to defuse it. Leasing the turnpike "could have made sense years ago," Nichols said. "It would be foolish now. We wouldn't get our money's worth in this market." Early this month, however, shortly before being sworn in, Kasich again was talking about leasing the 241-mile turnpike, which ended 2010 with a record $250 million in revenue. "If we look at the turnpike and find out we’re in a bad market and we’re not going to get the number we want — and I have a number in my head as to what will work — if we don’t get the number, then we’re not going to do it," he told reporters at a news conference. By saying he has "a number in my head as to what will work," Kasich showed the idea isn’t dead. He made it sound like for the right price, a deal could get done. So has the governor changed his position? Kasich downplayed the idea of privatizing the turnpike last summer during the campaign (while explicitly endorsing privatization in other areas), and he said the time was not right to consider it. But it’s important to note he didn’t completely dismiss the idea. Rather, he noted that the market wasn’t ripe for such a move. His post-election remarks indicate the idea is clearly in play. But he’s still noting that certain conditions would have to exist -- "If we don’t get the number, then we’re not going to do it." To us that seems pretty consistent. That's why we rate his position on privatization of the Ohio Turnpike as a No Flip on the Flip-O-Meter. Comment on this item.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-01-19T06:00:00	2011-01-07	['None']
pomt-05656	"We have $60 billion in 2010 in Medicare fraud."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/20/brendan-doherty/rhode-island-congressional-candidate-brendan-doher/	Brendan Doherty, the retired superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police turned Republican congressional candidate, recently sat down for his first long television interview since jumping into the race against incumbent Democrat David Cicilline last year. In an appearance on Channel 12 (WPRI) "Newsmakers" on March 11, Doherty answered questions on everything from the Bush tax cuts to Iran’s nuclear program. Early in the show, co-host Tim White asked Doherty how he would tackle the nation’s budget deficit if he were elected. "What specifically would you cut?" White asked. "And please do not say waste and fraud, which is something everyone always brings up but is really a drop in the fiscal bucket." Doherty then proceeded to talk about, well, waste and fraud. "We’ve had a tremendous amount of waste in the federal government," Doherty said. "We have people that are gaming the system … We have $60 billion in 2010 in Medicare fraud." That sounded to us like a huge amount. If Doherty’s claim is true, it would support his contention that taxpayers could actually save a lot of money if waste and fraud are reined in. Other fact-checkers have looked at Medicare fraud estimates. Politifact National gave Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn a Half True ruling after he claimed that the country spent $80 billion a year on fraudulent Medicare payments. While we waited to hear back from Doherty’s campaign, we did some research. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) -- the investigative arm of Congress -- has since 1990 labeled Medicare a "high-risk program," because of the ample opportunities for error and abuse in the system that covers 47 million elderly and disabled Americans. The GAO issued a report a year ago that gave a total figure for "improper payments" for 2010 of $48 billion. That was the equivalent of 9.4 percent of the $509 billion in total spending that year for Medicare. The GAO pulled the figure from the Fiscal Year 2010 financial report for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicare and came up with an estimate for improper payments based on a random sampling of 82,000 Medicare claims. The GAO report did not include questionable payments made under Medicare’s Part D prescription drug program, for which no estimate was provided by HHS -- so the total amount of improper payments is likely higher. The report defines an improper payment as "any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount [including overpayments and underpayments] under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements." Typical types of fraud that fall under the umbrella of improper payments include billing for services that were not provided or were not medically necessary, over-billing for services, paying kickbacks and stealing providers’ or patients’ identities. It’s important to note that the $48-billion figure cited by the GAO is for all "improper payments," not just the fraud that Doherty is targeting. The GAO report did not isolate the amount of money spent specifically on fraudulent Medicare payments because the Department of Health has no method to detect or measure fraud. But officials do believe that the level of fraud is high. In May 6, 2009 testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Daniel Levin, HHS inspector general, estimated that "more than $60 billion each year" is lost to health care fraud, citing a figure from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA), a group that includes members from private insurance companies, law enforcement and government agencies. Many media outlets and critics of government health care programs have used that $60 billion figure when describing the extent of Medicare fraud. Doherty’s campaign referred us to several news stories that cite the number, including pieces by 60 Minutes and USA Today that both quoted Attorney General Eric Holder. But those stories used an incorrect description of the number because it covers the entire U.S. health care industry, including public and private providers, not just Medicare -- a big distinction. We watched the 60 Minutes piece cited by Doherty’s campaign. Like other media reports, it does not give an attribution for the $60-billion figure. The USA Today piece with the $60 billion figure cites a speech at a national conference by Holder as its source of the information. In a transcript we found of the speech, however, Holder made it clear he was referring to fraud for the entire health care industry -- not just the Medicare fraud Doherty was talking about. The NHCAA generally estimates that fraud accounts for 3 percent of all health care spending. So in 2010, when the country spent $2.3 trillion on health care, the cost of fraud was estimated to be $69 billion, according to the association. It did not come up with a specific figure for Medicare, but if we use its 3 percent estimate, then Medicare fraud would have amounted to about $15 billion in 2010 -- a quarter of Doherty’s figure. The NHCAA also cites an estimate from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that fraud amounts to between 3 and 10 percent of total spending on health care annually. If Medicare fraud were as high as 10 percent, it would have totaled about $51 billion in 2010 -- still less than Doherty’s estimate. Others have come up with higher estimates for health care fraud, but none have isolated a number for Medicare. They include Malcolm Sparrow, a former fraud investigator and detective chief inspector with the British police service who is now a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He is the author of "License to Steal," a book on health care fraud, and has testified before Congress on Medicare fraud, waste and related issues. Sparrow believes the amount of health care fraud is much higher than the 3 percent, or $69 billion, estimate by the NHCAA, but in an email to us he emphasized that there are no "valid estimates" for Medicare fraud. Our ruling Brendan Doherty said there was $60 billion in Medicare fraud in 2010. The truth is, nobody really knows how much money is spent on fraudulent Medicare claims. Even the government agency that regulates Medicare has not -- and apparently cannot -- come up with a firm figure. While experts say the amount of fraud in the entire health care system could range from $69 billion to hundreds of billions of dollars, only the GAO study isolated improper payments for Medicare specifically. Its $48-billion estimate, which also includes wasteful spending, is $12 billion -- or 20 percent -- less than Doherty’s number for fraud alone. Doherty’s campaign didn’t pull the $60 billion number from thin air. Staffers found multiple reports using that figure from credible media outlets. But those media outlets used it inaccurately. It’s understandable why Doherty believed those reports -- especially for a number that’s pretty squishy -- but if stamping out waste and fraud is indeed one of the core issues of his candidacy, he at least should have gotten his information from a first-hand source. We rate Doherty’s statement Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-06852	Says Democrats cut $35 million from the state budget for Information Technology improvements.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/04/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-claims-democrats-cut-35-million/	At a Monday news conference in Bergen County, Gov. Chris Christie criticized Democratic legislators for cutting $35 million from the state budget for Information Technology upgrades, and suggested they restore the funding. "What would have been helpful is if they wouldn’t have taken the $35 million out of the budget that I submitted to improve our Information Technology and computer systems," Christie said in response to a question about Democrats’ plans to hold hearings on the recent computer problems at motor vehicle offices. When a reporter told Christie that Democrats have claimed the amount was $5 million or $5.5 million, the governor responded: "No. Thirty-five million that was put in to improve our infrastructure at all levels, not just MVC, but across the state. Which they took out. Now that things are going bad, they’re trying to change the numbers and change the story. The fact is, this is what happens when you rush and do a budget in the last week." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie was wrong about the budget cut -- nearly seven times wrong. Instead of $35 million, the Democratic-controlled Legislature cut $5.5 million for Information Technology upgrades from the budget for fiscal year 2012. In fact, the governor’s office had listed those $5.5 million in budget reductions in a July 13 press release. That press release was distributed via an email from the governor’s office. Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts on Tuesday acknowledged the governor’s mistake in an email: "The Governor was speaking to the total amount appropriated for IT, while Democrats actually zeroed out $5.5 million in spending for IT improvements and modernization," Roberts wrote. "The point remains the same - the Governor is calling on the Legislature to send him a supplemental to restore the funding they eliminated so that the Administration can make the investments and upgrades needed to keep the state’s computers up to par with the needs of New Jerseyans," Roberts said in the email. The Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee is scheduled to discuss the recent computer failures at a meeting today in Lodi. Now, let’s explain those funding cuts. The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services last month released a budget analysis showing the differences between Christie’s budget proposal, the budget approved by the Legislature and the final budget signed by Christie after making various line-item vetoes. According to that analysis, the Legislature cut funding from Christie’s proposal for three IT projects in the Office of Information Technology, which handles IT systems throughout state government. Those cuts remained in the final budget signed by Christie. Tom Hester Jr., spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, said the Assembly is willing to discuss restoring the IT funding. Derek Roseman, spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said any discussion on such a restoration must be part of broader negotiations to reverse cuts made by the governor. But Roberts’ statement left us asking more questions. Roberts said the $35 million was in reference to "the total amount appropriated for IT." But according to the fiscal 2012 budget, the total state appropriation for the Office of Information Technology is about $51.2 million. Andrew Pratt, a spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury, clarified that the governor was referring to roughly $38 million of that money, which goes toward computer-related services. That funding is not broken up by state agency, Pratt said. The real issue is the state needs to upgrade its computer systems, Pratt argued. "We really have to do something here," Pratt said. Let’s review: In the wake of computer problems at Motor Vehicle Commission offices and other state agencies, Christie claimed the Democrats had cut $35 million for Information Technology improvements. But a Christie spokesman acknowledged the actual cut was $5.5 million. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02074	"Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/23/chain-email/rumors-third-barack-obama-term-are-satire-passed-t/	Who says President Barack Obama -- facing weak approval ratings, a tough midterm election and growing outrage over problems in veterans’ health care facilities -- is in the dumps? He’s headed to a third term! Or at least that’s the claim now bouncing around the Internet. A reader recently emailed us to ask if we could check out something they’d run into online -- a story titled, "Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run." As we'll see, it's another case of a satirical article being passed off as real. The article with a Washington dateline began, "President Barack Obama shocked the country this morning with news that he is running for a third term." It went on to quote Obama at a press conference saying,"‘I can’t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever. We’ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you’re getting." The article then quoted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., telling CNN that he opposes Obama’s decision. "This defies everything the Constitution stands for," Paul is quoted as saying. "We can not let this man have a third term." The problem facing Obama, according to the article, is the 22nd Amendment, which prevents presidents from running for more than two terms. It was ratified in 1951. However, the article suggests that Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., has "recently introduced" a measure to abolish the 22nd Amendment -- which is "exactly the kind of news that makes an Obama 2016 Presidential run possible." The article closes with a comment from Paul Horner, purportedly an administration spokesman. "Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016 and then we’ll all be able to enjoy this great man for another four years," the article quotes "Horner" as saying. "Things could not get any better for the American people. I’m so stoked!" So is Obama really going to get around the Constitution to run for a third term? Nope. In fact, people passing along this story by email appear not to have noticed that it comes from a satire site called the National Report. The site’s tongue-in-cheek disclaimer says, in part, that "the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report." The urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer said, "National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental." As it happens, FactCheck.org has been debunking similar "third-term" claims since 2009 -- the first year Obama was in office, when he was still three years away from running, legally, for his second term. These earlier chain emails tended to focus on the amendment by Serrano. The National Report satire piece is correct to say that Serrano has introduced such legislation, but it’s hardly as recent a development as the article suggests. As FactCheck.org noted, Serrano introduced a similar measure numerous times during the presidencies of Bill Clinton (1997, 1999 and early 2001) and George W. Bush (2003, 2005 and 2007), with each bill dying in committee without coming to a vote. "I introduce it as a matter of principle," Serrano told FactCheck.org. "I do not believe there should be term limits for any elected official. Elections should be the deciding factor. I do not receive advice or support on this bill from the White House or any other source." The current version of Serrano’s repeal bill has, as is typical, attracted no co-sponsors and gone nowhere in committee. No one should be under the illusion that this is an idea going anywhere soon. We asked a White House spokesman if he wanted to comment. He politely declined. Our ruling A chain email now circulating links to an article headlined, "Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run." The article comes from a satire website, and even if Obama wanted to do an end run around the constitutional prohibition, the vehicle to do it -- Serrano’s bill -- has no hope of passage, much less any chance of ratification in three quarters of the states.

pomt-03148	"7 out of 10 Oregon families living in poverty have at least one parent who works."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/11/oregon-center-public-policy/do-7-out-10-oregon-families-poverty-have-working-p/	A common and perhaps reasonable assumption is that people who are poor don’t have jobs. But in an Aug. 7, 2013, infographic on its website, the left-leaning Oregon Center for Public Policy wrote that "7 out of 10 Oregon families living in poverty have at least one parent who works." Was this the debunking of a common myth about those in poverty? Do a full 70 percent of Oregon families in poverty have a parent who works? We first rang Chuck Sheketoff, the executive director of the Silverton-based center, who said that the figure was part of the center’s June 27, 2013, "Working But Still Poor" fact sheet. "Work is not a sure path out of poverty," it said. A pie chart on the second page says that 69 percent of families in poverty were "working families," composed of 22 percent who had "at least one parent working full time" and 47 percent who had "at least one parent working less than full time." About 31 percent of the families had no parent working. The numbers were from the center’s analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2011 American Community Survey data. Sheketoff pointed us to Jason Gettel, the center’s policy analyst who crunched those numbers. Gettel explained that he used DataFerrett, a free data analysis program promoted on the Census Bureau’s website. DataFerrett allows users to analyze all of the survey responses to carve out data in different ways. "We wanted to see what proportion of families in poverty had a worker present to show that people do live in poverty despite the fact that they work," Gettel said. "They’re there because some jobs pay too little, or they’ve been laid off for some period of time, but not because they don’t put forth a work effort." Gettel walked us through DataFerrett and showed us how he selected certain variables in order to limit the survey responses to arrive at the "7 out of 10" number. He limited the data to only the Oregon families who are in poverty with a related child. He then searched for types of work experience by different family members, such as "householder worked full-time in the past 12 months and spouse worked full time in the past 12 months" or "female householder worked less than full-time in the past 12 months and no spouse present." Finally, the numbers were weighted to more accurately reflect statewide numbers, since the American Community Survey does not count as many people as the 2010 U.S. Census. The analysis showed that there were 437,991 families with children in Oregon. Of those, 86,255 were in poverty. This is the pool of Oregon families we would use for further calculations. Next we did some simple addition and subtraction. We first added up the 3,042 families where neither the householder nor the spouse worked; the 4,429 families where single male householders did not work; and the 19,339 families where single female householders did not work. This showed us that 26,810 of the 86,255 Oregon families with children had a parent who did not work in the previous year, roughly 31 percent. Put another way, 59,445 Oregon families with children in poverty — 69 percent — had a parent who worked at least part time in the previous year. It’s worth noting here that the Census data only breaks down work experience by three different types and only over a 12-month period: full-time work, less than full-time work, or no work. That means somebody who last worked a one-month retail job during the 2012 holiday season would qualify as a less than full-time worker. We’re not sure that most people count that as a parent who works. Indeed, government officials generally categorize people unemployed for six months or longer as "long-term unemployed." We also want to note that "poverty" is defined as the federal poverty threshold. For 2011, that threshold was $18,123 for a single parent with two children and $22,811 for a two-parent family with two children. The threshold varies depending on the number of adults and children and whether the adults are under 65 years old. Next we wanted to verify that Gettel had used the right variables to arrive at the right numbers. DataFerrett, to put it nicely, is not the most intuitive program for the average user. We called the U.S. Census Bureau, where a survey statistician in the poverty statistics branch also used DataFerrett to check our variables and numbers. "The process that was used was the correct process," said Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman. "The end result was this 69 percent figure." Lastly, we wondered if similar studies had been done. Again, we turned to the Census Bureau. One table indicated that nearly 64 percent of Oregon families with income below the poverty level in the previous year had a worker in the family. Those data were from the 2011 American Community Survey. Another 2011 Census table based on national data showed that, of the 33.1 million people in families in poverty, 21.1 million individuals were in families with at least one worker — about 64 percent. Neither of those studies was limited to families with children. We looked at some other studies, too, and saw similar percentages. None of these studies is a perfect apples-to-apples comparison to the Oregon Center for Public Policy’s data, but they show that the Oregon center’s numbers are within range of what similar studies have found. The Oregon Center for Public Policy wrote that "7 out of 10 Oregon families living in poverty have at least one parent who works." We checked Gettel’s analysis and confirmed his results. We also confirmed the analysis and numbers with the U.S. Census Bureau. While the numbers are accurate, under the survey design, somebody classified by federal employment officials as "long-term unemployed" could be counted as working under the Census definition. We think that’s an important clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Oregon Center for Public Policy	None	None	None	2013-09-11T06:00:00	2013-08-07	['Oregon']

pomt-03903	"There are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips" because of sequestration.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/01/arne-duncan/arne-duncan-says-teachers-are-losing-jobs-because-/	We’ve heard that sequestration could delay airline flights, that kids might not be able to get vaccines, or attend pre-school. In another doomsday warning about what the sweeping cuts to federal spending could mean, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan says the sequester has already put teachers out of a job. "There are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips, who are getting notices that they can't come back this fall," Duncan said on Face the Nation on Feb. 24, 2013. Most funding for public schools comes from state and local government tax revenue. But money for special education and Title I, which supplements the costs of educating poor children, is handed down from the federal government. The White House says Title I would take a $725 million hit if sequestration goes into effect. Special ed programs could lose $600 million. But does that mean teachers are "literally … getting pink slips"? Districts under fire If you read your local newspaper, you’re probably already aware that school districts have been in a financial bind for several years, largely due to the recession. The bad economy depressed real estate values and shrunk tax revenue, which in turn reduced the tax money that school districts could spend. Now, with the potential loss of federal dollars because of the sequester, local school districts again stand to lose some important revenue. But it’s important to bear in mind that there is no direct cause/effect relationship between federal cuts and school staff reductions. Local districts decide what to keep and what to cut; a federal budget cut does not dictate that teachers be laid off. That said, a spokesman for the Department of Education pointed us to numerous examples of districts around the country that are bracing for difficult decisions, including letting teachers go: • Officials with Great Falls Public Schools in Montana are preparing a list of planned layoffs to the school board, including 20 teachers who could be at risk. • In New York, the Utica School District is already facing staff reductions for next year -- plus another 12 to 15 teacher cuts under sequestration. • The Erie School District in Pennsylvania estimates it will have to lay off a minimum of 10 elementary teachers if federal money is axed. "Jobs are the biggest line item in their budgets," said Education Department spokesman Massie Ritsch. "It’s really hard to make up for it without cutting into personnel in some way." Notice, though, that those districts expect to have to make those cuts. They haven’t made them yet. One county in West Virginia After his appearance on "Face the Nation," reporters pressed Duncan for examples of school districts where pinks slips had already been handed out. He named Kanawha County in West Virginia, but insulated it in the caveat, "whether it’s all sequester-related, I don’t know." The Washington Post sought to verify Duncan’s story by talking to Kanawha County school officials. Pam Padon, who directs the county’s federal programs, said 104 teachers had received transfer notices -- a necessary step before their positions can be eliminated. "It’s not like we’re cutting people’s jobs at this point," Padon told the Post. What’s more, those notices had more to do with a change in how West Virginia allocates federal funds designated for poor children, the Post reported. Padon estimated that, of the 104 positions on notice, five or six jobs would ultimately be lost. "The major impact is not so much sequestration," she said. "Those five or six jobs would already be gone regardless of sequestration." The Post’s Fact-Checker separately gave Duncan’s claim four Pinocchios, its worst rating. Ritsch, the education department spokesman, urged us to call Kanawha Superintendent Ron Duerring. He told a totally different story than Padon had. As far back as last fall, Duerring said, he directed his staff to start preparing for tighter conditions under sequestration. "As it got closer to our personnel season (the time when school staff must be notified if their jobs are changing), it became very clear ... that it was going to happen. But the next question was how much of a percentage was that going to be," Duerring said, adding that the federal cuts are likely to mean 14 layoffs next school year and even more the following year. Asked to explain why Padon offered such a different version, Duerring said, "she was just answering what she thought." He said he talked publicly about the effects of sequestration at school board meetings throughout the fall and in monthly meetings with principals. But he could provide no documentation that such preparations were being made that long ago. Also, we found stories in two different local newspapers appear to support Padon’s version of why the 104 notices went out -- a change at the state level. A Jan. 7, 2013, story in the Charleston Gazette said the county was preparing for the squeeze "because of a request by the state Department of Education, a new accountability system could be on the horizon for West Virginia schools that would require counties to set aside 20 percent of their budgets for their lowest-achieving schools." The statement was attributed to Padon. And the Charleston Daily Mail reported that "the potential implementation of new Title I standards at the state level could mean putting about 100 teachers on ‘transfer’ status, Padon said." Neither story -- nor others reporting on school board meetings last fall -- mentioned sequestration. Our ruling Duncan said that because of the threat of sequestration "there are literally teachers now who are getting pink slips." That conjures images of hundreds or even thousands of teachers who have already been fired. But the lone example of actual pink slips is the West Virginia district. And officials there provide a contradictory explanation for why 104 teachers are being notified their jobs might be transferred, and eventually eliminated. The other districts held up by education officials haven’t fired a single teacher because of sequestration. Ritsch, Duncan’s spokesman, said that distinction hardly matters: "Whether they’ve got a pink slip in hand or one is coming in two weeks, the basic point is the same -- their jobs are at risk." Maybe so. But that’s not what Duncan said, which is that teachers right now are being shown the door. We rate his statement Mostly False.

"Then when you’re under … guillotine, shoot them, leave them in a room with a toddler with a gun, anything. It’s just so easy to take human life. It’s ridiculous." David Frum of The Atlantic tried to bring the conversation back toward seriousness, saying "we’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation." Maher jumped right back in. "We're fifth in the world," Maher said. "Behind China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia." Maher’s claim is pretty close. (We’re examining Frum’s claim in a separate fact-check.) It comes from a report by Amnesty International, which attempts to count the number of state-sponsored executions per country, per year. In its most recent report, which covers 2013, Amnesty International found that governments in the United States executed 39 individuals (16 of them in Texas). We corroborated the 39 total executions through the Death Penalty Information Center. The number of executions in the United States in 2013 was down from 2012, when there were 43 executions. Here's a list of U.S. executions by year: (Death Penalty Information Center) How does that rank worldwide? A majority of countries do not use or prohibit the use of the death penalty. Of those that do, exact data is difficult to find in some cases. But according to Amnesty International’s best estimate, the United States indeed ranks fifth -- behind China, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. (Amnesty International) The one caveat in Amnesty International’s report is that it admits that its execution totals are just estimates and that the real number of executions are not known. The group says that the countries ranked right below the United States -- Somalia, Sudan and Yemen -- all could have execution totals higher than the reported number. That, in theory, could push the United States down the list. At least one country not listed likely does outpace the United States, Amnesty International says. The group did not attempt to tally the number of executions in North Korea, but believes the country executes more people than the United States. "While reliable reports indicate that at least 70 executions were carried out in North Korea, Amnesty International believes the true figure to be much higher," the group wrote in its report. If true, that would make the United States sixth. "Amnesty's numbers are reliable as minimums but understate totals for places like (China)," said Franklin Zimring, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the death penalty. "The fuzzy part in international comparisons is when do state killings become judicial or legal executions. You correctly zero in on the one nation that probably pushes the U.S. to No. 6 in Maher's hall of shame, North Korea." Our ruling Maher said the United States is "fifth in the world" in executions. He’s for the most part accurately citing a report from Amnesty International. The only real caveat is that group doesn’t include North Korea on its list because it can’t determine how many executions were performed there (though they think there were more than the United States). That would rank the United States sixth in the world. To us, that doesn’t really diminish Maher’s point. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02434	"The (Russian) ruble is already going down."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/02/john-kerry/john-kerry-tells-cbs-viewers-russian-isolation-com/	American and European leaders find themselves scrambling to respond to Russia’s deployment of troops in the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine. With military action on no one’s wish-list, diplomacy and economic sanctions are the only moves effectively in play. Secretary of State John Kerry said on CBS’ Face the Nation that he had been on the phone with his counterparts among the G-8 nations. "Every single one of them are prepared to go to the hilt in order to isolate Russia with respect to this invasion," Kerry said. "They’re prepared to put sanctions in place, they’re prepared to isolate Russia economically, the ruble is already going down. Russia has major economic challenges." This fact-check zeros in on the value of the Russian ruble. It has declined but partly because that’s what the Russians wanted. A big drop In the early part of 2013, the ruble was worth 3.3 U.S. cents. Today, its value has tumbled by 15 percent, to 2.8 cents. A little less than half of that fall came in January as the situation in Ukraine deteriorated. Here’s the picture over the past year, taken from the currency exchange service XE.com: There is no question that the violence and political turmoil in Ukraine took a toll on the ruble. Russian banks have about $28 billion in loans in the country. Before the Russian troops moved in, investors were already worried. Last week, two of the largest banks in Russia said they would suspend any new lending in Ukraine. But the ruble’s decline has deeper roots. In 2010, the Russian Central Bank announced it wanted to get out of the business of setting the ruble’s value on the international market. It had in mind a gradual glide path for the currency’s fall, and in October, it gave the ruble even more leeway to drop further. The country’s economy grew less than 2 percent last year, and it has struggled to keep inflation in check. "The ruble got pretty over-valued in the big energy boom from 2001-08," said Mark Adomanis, a management consultant and contributor to Forbes. That hurt Russian manufacturing and letting the ruble fall potentially could help. "With a weaker ruble Russian goods become more competitive on international markets," Adomanis said. That said, a free fall is not what the Russian Central Bank has in mind. In January, the bank signaled that it would step in to prop up the ruble. But the overall policy remains the same. Our ruling Kerry said the ruble is going down, and it is. The Russian currency has lost about 15 percent of its value against the dollar since early 2013. It is not all because of the situation in Ukraine, however, a fact that viewers may not have picked up on by hearing Kerry's statement. The currency’s decline is also part of Russian policy to reduce inflation and make domestic manufacturers more competitive. There’s a little more going on here than Kerry’s statement would suggest.

pomt-14163	"Today President Obama said there will NOT be a National Day of Prayer in May."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/29/facebook-posts/another-lie-wont-die-multitudes-say-obama-has-canc/	Some falsehoods refuse to die, coming back long after they've been disproven. The latest is making the rounds on Facebook, a resurrection of the claim that Barack Obama has canceled this year's — and perhaps all subsequent — National Days of Prayer. This post was typical: "Today President Obama said there will NOT be a National Day of Prayer in May because he doesn't want to offend anyone. If this decision offends you as it does me, we need the President to know just how many Christians are offended. If you are offended, please copy and paste. Those who name Jesus Christ as their Lord God and Savior have too long allowed the world to take Him out of everything! Once again, never worried about offending Christians. I am sick and tired of our president that does everything to offend Christians but does everything he can to appease Muslims." When we spotted this on April 26, it was clear that a lot of people were bearing false witness, cutting and pasting the various forms of this post. One version reported that "President Obama has decided that there will no longer be a 'National Day of Prayer,' " suggesting he had somehow managed to kill it forever. This year's National Day of Prayer is scheduled for Thursday, May 5. A president can no more cancel it than the Grinch can cancel Christmas. It's written into law. More to the point, Obama has never shown an inclination for canceling it at all. This warning has been sounded every year since 2009, according to our friends at Snopes. The day was inaugurated in 1952, without setting a specific date. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan made it the first Thursday of May. Obama issued an official proclamation for the day in 2009 and has done so again in every subsequent year. Last year's proclamation is on the White House website. Although Obama has not publicly participated in the celebration, he been involved in other prayer events. Most notably, Obama has spoken several times at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, giving speeches that reflect upon his own Christian faith. And in 2010, when a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that the event was unconstitutional, the Obama White House nonetheless announced that the president still "intends to recognize a National Day of Prayer." Facebook readers didn't have to go to Snopes to find stories debunking this tenacious tall tale. FactCheck.org tried to smite it in 2010. PolitiFact New Jersey attempted to slay it when it was part of a chain email message in 2012. We were heartened that a few Facebook posters did their homework and tried to stem the tide of misinformation. "We do a disservice to the gospel when we post inaccurate information which we have not fact-checked," said one person. "We serve a God who is the Way, the Truth and The Life, the least we can do is make sure what we post is truthful as well. Again, consider the source and research a little deeper, your witness can be jeopardized if you don't." Amen to that. Our ruling Widely shared Facebook posts contended that, "Today President Obama said there will NOT be a National Day of Prayer in May." For those who got on Facebook and tried to share the truth, we applaud you. If you found yourself overwhelmed by all the people who were immediately convinced that the bad information was true, welcome to our world. And for those of you who reposted the claim without checking, we bestow on you a collective Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4598d5c4-6083-4cd3-9fa5-c6bb9b8dcdb2	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2016-04-29T10:23:51	2016-04-26	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-07436	Says he couldn't keep a 42-inch redfish he caught because of fishing rules.	true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/22/adam-putnam/adam-putnams-big-catch-got-away-because-he-had-no-/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott and members of the Cabinet returned from a two-day tour of the Panhandle in which the four Republicans participated in a fishing tournament to help promote Florida's seafood industry. And fishing, naturally, means fishing stories. "I caught a 40-inch redfish, and I caught 26 of them in all, and we took them back to a restaurant and cooked and ate them. It's great here," Scott told reporters after the fishing expedition off Panama City on April 20, 2011. You can almost hear "... THIS BIG," right? Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, who caught a 7.6-pound redfish, was the official winner of the tournament. Scott came in second by catching a redfish that weighed in at 6.5 pounds, Attorney General Pam Bondi finished third with a 2.05-pound redfish and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam wound up last with a fish that weighed in at 1.9 pounds, according to the Palm Beach Post's Dara Kam. The results produced a flurry of activity on Twitter. "Congrats to @JeffAtwater. For the record, I caught the most variety--6 reds and a blue fish :)," Bondi posted on her Twitter account, @PamBondi. Putnam's poor showing prompted a question from St. Petersburg Times reporter Katie Sanders. Via Twitter, she wrote Putnam, "@adamputnam, what happened?" He responded a few minutes later. "@KatieLSanders I caught one that was 42 inches but had to toss it back, because it was over the size limit." Later, he tweeted again, with a link to a photo: "If they let me bring this one in, I could have won the Cabinet fishing tournament." Many Floridians like to eat redfish, but we're not sure all have caught one before. So we wanted to see if Putnam had his fish regulations right. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, a group controlled by the governor, approves fishing rules for the state. The commission has rules in place for the fishing of redfish, which are also called red drum fish or red bass. Putnam has it right. Fishermen can only harvest (or keep) redfish that are at least 18 inches long, but no more than 27 inches long. Fishermen can keep only one redfish each day. The rules are in place to prevent the overfishing of redfish. The maximum is in place specifically to protect spawning redfish. If you're following this, that means that Scott -- based on what he told reporters -- broke the fishing rules. But the Governor's Office later told Orlando's WESH-TV that Scott misspoke. Each angler brought back one fish, and Scott's 40-inch monster was tossed back into the Gulf of Mexico, a spokesman said. And that means Putnam was right when he said he couldn't keep his 42-inch redfish because state fishing rules prohibit it. We rate this claim True.

pomt-05390	Says Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposal "would effectively double the interest paid out on existing and future student loans."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/06/loretta-weinberg/loretta-weinberg-said-house-republican-budget-woul/	A Democratic lawmaker wants Gov. Chris Christie to use his time on the national stage to voice the concerns of New Jersey taxpayers. And the Republican governor should start by campaigning against a GOP budget proposal, Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said. "The governor could begin by using his newfound national political prominence to urge his party to reject the budget proposal put forward by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and recently approved in the House of Representatives along partisan lines," Weinberg (D-Bergen) wrote in an opinion column published April 30 on NorthJersey.com. "The Ryan budget would be devastating for the state and the nation," she said. "It would curtail Pell grants for New Jersey scholars who would otherwise be unable to afford higher education, and it would effectively double the interest paid out on existing and future student loans." With the debate over student loan interest rates still raging, PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether Weinberg’s portrayal of the potential increase was accurate. Mostly, it’s not. Let’s first note that PolitiFact National recently examined a similar claim by President Barack Obama’s campaign that "Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double." PolitiFact National rated that False because the statement referred to Mitt Romney, who has said he opposes allowing the rate to double. In our case, we are looking at the more narrow claim about the Ryan budget. The planned hike in rates stems from a law passed in 2007, when Democrats held the majority in Congress. That year, with bipartisan support, Congress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which gradually reduced interest rates for federally subsidized Stafford loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. There are two types of Stafford loans: subsidized loans don’t accrue interest while a student is in school, but unsubsidized loans do. The 2007 law only decreased interest rates for subsidized loans. But the law was temporary and if no legislative action is taken the rate returns to 6.8 percent on July 1. That increase would only affect students taking out new loans. It would not impact existing loans, as Weinberg said. Weinberg acknowledged her error, saying her point was "not well articulated." "It does not affect existing loans, but it does affect existing students who may need new loans," she said. So how does the House Republican budget proposal fit into this debate? The Republican plan, which serves as a blueprint, does not address how to extend the lower rate. Obama’s budget request includes a one-year extension. "The Ryan budget does not include any proposal to postpone the rate increase," said Jason Delisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation. But, he said, "the House Republicans did pass a bill to prevent the rate increase from happening and the Ryan budget isn’t legislation. It’s not a law." The House passed a bill on April 27 that funds the rate extension with money for preventive health care programs from the new federal health care law. A spokesman for the House Budget Committee said that extension is "fully compatible with the House-passed budget." The White House threatened to veto the measure because of how it is funded. Weinberg said the Republican bill "passed in a way that’s going to make sure that it’s not really going to pass." Democratic proposals to pay for the extension include ending a payroll tax exemption for some business owners and ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Our ruling Weinberg said that the House Republicans budget proposal "would effectively double the interest paid out on existing and future student loans." The Republican budget plan does not stop a planned increase in interest rates for federally subsidized undergraduate loans. But the potential hike, which would only affect new loans -- not existing loans, is the result of an expiration date built into a 2007 law. Those are "critical facts that would give a different impression." We rate Weinberg’s statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-03075	If sea levels rise six feet due to climate change, Waterplace Park in Providence and Wickford village would be swamped	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/sep/28/grover-fugate/ri-coastal-official-says-rising-sea-levels-climate/	A United Nations-supported panel of the world’s top climate scientists issued its latest assessment of the problem Friday, warning of potentially catastrophic consequences unless significant measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. Among other things, the report -- a summary of a longer study to be issued Monday -- warned that if emissions aren’t reduced, global sea levels could rise nearly three feet by 2100. Grover Fugate, executive director of Rhode Island’s Coastal Resources Management Council, expressed similar, and more dire, concerns during an interview on WPRI-Channel 12’s "Newsmakers" program, broadcast Aug. 23. Fugate warned then that some projections showed sea levels rising as much as six feet over the next 100 years. If that happened, he said, some of the state’s signature landscapes, such as Providence’s Waterplace Park and North Kingstown’s Wickford Village could be very different -- and smaller -- by 2100. "The upper end of that range is now looking like, more like, six feet," Fugate said. "Waterplace Park would essentially be gone … you look at places like Wickford, so the historic district in Wickford, a lot of that would be lost." Waterplace Pond instead of Waterplace Park? Wickford swamped? Was that a deep thought or shallow reasoning? We decided to wade in. Friday’s report from the climate panel is just the latest of numerous reports and studies of the effect of climate change on sea levels. In December 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and the Army Corps of Engineers prepared a report called "Global Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States National Climate Assessment." The report said that an increasing number of studies have shown satellite measurements indicating polar ice, mostly from Greenland in the north and western Antarctica in the south, has been melting more rapidly than was previously thought, in turn making sea levels rise faster and higher than past projections. The NOAA report warned the melting would increase sea levels, but the range it gave was higher than that described in Friday’s IPCC report. "We have a very high confidence (a better than nine in ten chance) that global mean sea level will rise at least 0.2 meters (8 inches) and no more than 2 meters (6.6 feet) by 2100," the 2012 multi-agency assessment said. Fugate said it was that "upper end" -- up to 6.6 feet -- that he was referencing. The University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography’s Sea Grant program has been interested in rising sea levels too. The program works with the state’s coastal municipalities to anticipate where sea levels may rise and how to cope with it. Jon Reiner, town planner in North Kingstown, said the Sea Grant staffers have analyzed what would happen in his community with the kind of sea-level rises Fugate cited. He said their analyses confirmed Fugate’s warning. A 6-foot sea level increase, Reiner said, would inundate more than 150 parcels of land in the Wickford area, as much as 5 percent of the town. Teresa Crean, a planner with the URI Sea Grant program, said the value of that lost land was about $80 million. In Providence, the effects of rising sea levels can be seen on a website of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that shows the foot-by-foot effects of rising sea levels. The interactive map doesn’t include storm surges or runoff, only what increases in sea level would do. According to NOAA, a 6-foot rise in sea level would submerge the walkway around the Waterplace Park pool and enough water would flow through the tunnel under Memorial Boulevard to put the Capital Grille and Bar Louie on their own waterfront. But according to the NOAA, Waterplace Park might be the least of the city’s worries. Even more vulnerable are the wharfs off Allens Avenue in the area between Sassafras Point and Henderson Street. Parts of the newly cleared Route 195 redevelopment area would flood, as well as the neighborhood around the Providence District Court Building. Our ruling Grover Fugate said Providence’s Waterplace Park and Wickford village would be flooded if sea levels rose six feet, "the upper end" of some climate change estimates. While Fugate’s high-end figure is double the estimate of the Intergovernmental Climate Change Committee, he was accurately quoting a figure that has been cited by four U.S. agencies that deal with oceans and climate. And federal, state and local planners and agencies agree that a six-foot rise would swamp significant locations in Providence, Wickford and elsewhere in coastal Rhode Island, as Fugate said it would.

Use real people, not phony sources."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-ny-times-source-didnt-exist-he-d/	Most Americans aren’t glued to Twitter over the Memorial Day weekend, but that didn’t stop a controversy this year, pitting President Donald Trump against journalists who cover the White House. On May 25, the New York Times published an article headlined, "Trump Says North Korea Summit May Be Rescheduled." The article included a line expressing an unnamed White House official’s skepticism that a summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un could be held on its originally scheduled date. "On Thursday, for example, a senior White House official told reporters that even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed," the article said. The following morning, Trump tweeted criticism of the New York Times story. "The Failing @nytimes quotes ‘a senior White House official,’ who doesn’t exist, as saying ‘even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed,’" Trump tweeted. "WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Reporters from multiple outlets began pushing back on the notion that the New York Times had fabricated a source. The White House, they said, had actually furnished the source that Trump denied existing. They said the official did indeed exist; in fact, he had conducted "an off-camera, not for broadcast, background briefing on North Korea," in the wording of the White House email that had announced it on May 24. The briefing had been held in the White House press room and was opened up to reporters elsewhere via a conference call line. Under the ground rules of a "background briefing," reporters cannot use the name of the specific official and instead must use a more vague descriptor. The New York Times published a story after Trump sent his tweet, headlined, "Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting." It said that the source referred to in the article "was in fact a senior White House official speaking to a large group of reporters in the White House briefing room." Margaret Talev, the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, tweeted that she shared her "colleagues’ conclusion." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com So what’s going on here? We did our own review. We found Trump was wrong in saying that the source "doesn’t exist" and was "phony." Evidence shows Trump's own White House arranged the briefing with the official. Did the source exist? Yes. This can be demonstrated by audio released on Twitter by Yashar Ali, a contributor to New York magazine and HuffPost. The clip offers the first minute and a half of the background briefing. (The audio is actually video of the press room’s empty lectern as it it records sound elsewhere in the room.) See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Some media outlets have not published the briefer’s name, including many outlets who participated in the briefing and felt they were bound by the original agreement not to publish the name. However, other outlets have subsequently published the name made available in the audio Ali tweeted. PolitiFact will reprint the briefer’s name for a few reasons: It is needed to full address the accuracy of Trump’s charge; the information is now readily available on the Internet; and we were not a participant in the original briefing and did not agree to keep it on background. The briefer was Matthew Pottinger, the National Security Council’s senior director for Asian affairs. Here’s a transcript of the audio segment Ali tweeted: White House press official: "This briefing’s going to be on background, off camera, not for broadcast. Pottinger here can be referred to as a senior White House official. He is deputy assistant to the president for Asia. And you can take it from here." Reporter: "Can you clarify that the president obviously announced in the letter that the particular time and date of the summit is called off. Later, he said it’s possible the existing summit could take place, or a summit at a later date. Is he saying it’s possible that June 12 could still happen?" Pottinger: "The main point, I suppose, is that the ball’s in North Korea’s court right now. And there's really not a lot of time. We've lost quite a bit of time that we would need in order to — I mean there's an enormous amount of preparation that's gone on over the past few months in the White House, at State, and with other agencies and so forth, but there's a certain amount of actual dialogue that needs to take place at the working level with your counterparts to ensure that the agenda is clear in the minds of those two leaders when they sit down to actually meet and talk and negotiate and hopefully make a deal. And June 12 is in 10 minutes and it's going to be, you know — but the president has said that he some day looks forward to meeting…" The White House declined to either confirm or deny to PolitiFact that Pottinger was the briefer. But the audio speaks for itself. Why Trump questioned the New York Times report Trump's underlying issue with the New York Times report might have to do with its paraphrase of what the official said. Pottinger was certainly skeptical that a summit could happen on the original date, but he never actually used the word "impossible" — which is the phrasing the New York Times’ article had used. The White House argues that Trump’s incredulity is justified because, despite the New York Times’ characterization, nobody said in the briefing that a summit would be "impossible." That said, the New York Times paraphrased Pottinger rather than quoting him, as Trump said in his tweet. That gives the newspaper a bit of wiggle room. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The Failing @nytimes quotes ‘a senior White House official,’ who doesn’t exist, as saying ‘even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.’ WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources." Trump is wrong that the senior White House official cited by the New York Times "doesn’t exist" and is "phony." In fact, the official in question, Pottinger, gave an authorized background briefing to dozens of reporters in person and via phone. The New York Times article that Trump criticized may have gone too far by paraphrasing Pottinger as saying that a June 12 summit would be impossible, since Pottinger didn’t use that specific word. However, Pottinger did express a significant degree of skepticism about the prospect of a June 12 summit. If that was Trump's gripe, it isn't what he said. The White House source did exist.

pomt-07088	Vern Buchanan "has been completely exonerated" in a Federal Election Commission action.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/24/vern-buchanan/rep-vern-buchanan-exonerated-fec-spokeswoman-says/	It's tough to be a campaign under scrutiny for illegal campaign contributions — investigations can take years, and even when they're over, true vindication is hard to come by. And while the investigations grind on, any findings by the Federal Election Commission stay confidential until the entire case is closed, making it harder to clear your candidate in the public eye. That's the situation faced by the team for U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Longboat Key, as it battles attacks by Democrats such as a June 13, 2011, radio ad saying "his old business was caught illegally funneling over $60,000 in campaign donations to Buchanan to influence his election." (We've rated the ad Mostly True in a separate fact-check.) But in a helpful turn of events, Buchanan's attorney recently managed to get approval to release two letters from the commission in a still-open case that say when it comes to Buchanan, the FEC will "take no further action." That prompted Sally Tibbetts, Buchanan's spokeswoman, to put out a news release June 13, 2011, declaring the "FEC Vindicates Buchanan." "The Congressman has been completely exonerated, as we knew he would be," it read. "These phony accusations have been exposed as dishonest and partisan attacks." We wondered: Do the FEC letters really leave Buchanan "completely exonerated"? The complaints The letters, from an attorney for the commission to Buchanan attorney Chris DeLacy, address a "matter under review," MUR 6054, which includes separate complaints that campaign contributions were illegally reimbursed by two Buchanan car dealerships. Buchanan had ownership stakes in Venice Nissan Dodge and Hyundai of North Jacksonville as at least some of those contributions were made, though he no longer owns either one. The basic allegation is that dealership employees, business partners and their family members made contributions to Buchanan's 2006 and 2008 campaigns, then were reimbursed by the companies. At Venice Nissan Dodge, two employees joined a complaint filed by a Washington group in 2008 against Buchanan and the dealership with the Federal Election Commission. Carlo Bell, the dealership's then-finance director, said the company's general manager pulled him into an office in 2005 with two co-workers and told them they needed to contribute to Buchanan's campaign for Congress. If they wrote campaign checks for $1,000, the company would reimburse them in cash. Bell, who said he was afraid he might lose his job if he refused, got the cash and wrote a check. David Padilla, a finance manager at Venice Nissan Dodge, said he was told by another manager in 2005 that Buchanan needed campaign contributions, and "that anyone who made a contribution would get his money back plus additional compensation." He said he was told that all of the managers were being asked to contribute, but he refused. In the case of Hyundai of North Jacksonville, the Buchanan campaign says it reported illegal contributions to the FEC. The commission went after the dealership and Sam Kazran, a minority owner who later bought out Buchanan's stake, for reimbursing employees and family members. The FEC now seeks a $67,900 fine from Kazran for the dealership's role. Whether Buchanan himself was involved in the illegal reimbursements is a point of dispute. Kazran says he was. Buchanan's team says he wasn't, and that the letters from the FEC show he has been "completely exonerated." The first letter, from February 2011, says that the FEC had found "reason to believe" that Buchanan had violated federal law by knowingly receiving contributions that had been reimbursed by Kazran and Hyundai of North Jacksonville. But after considering circumstances, it had decided to "take no further action and close the file" as it related to Buchanan. But the letter provided no reason as to why. The second letter, from March 2011, addresses "other allegations against Rep. Buchanan that were made in the complaint in this matter." The commission hadn't found "reason to believe" that Buchanan violated the law in those instances, and its decision to "take no further action and close the file" applied to them, as well. While the specific subject of the second letter isn't clear, Buchanan's team says the letter refers to the Venice Nissan Dodge complaint. 'No further action' So, what does it mean that the commission won't take further action? Is that the same as being exonerated? Does it clear Buchanan from accusation or blame? First a little background on the Federal Election Commission. No more than three of its six members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can belong to the same political party. But four votes are required for the commission to act. That's supposed to "encourage bipartisan decisions." It also means the commission frequently splits along party lines and doesn't take action. But it did get at least four votes to move forward against Buchanan in the Hyundai of North Jacksonville case, finding "reason to believe" he knowingly received tainted contributions. Larry Noble, general counsel to the FEC from 1987-2000, says that was the first chance the commission had to say there wasn't sufficient evidence — it could have said it had "no reason to believe" a violation occurred. Instead, the commission moved forward with a "reason to believe" finding, meaning it found the allegation credible enough for a full investigation. After the investigation, if it had decided there wasn't enough evidence, it could have found "no probable cause to believe" a violation took place. If the FEC had found either "no reason to believe" a violation occurred, or, later, "no probable cause to believe" a violation took place, Noble said that would have been akin to exonerating Buchanan. But it didn't. Instead, the FEC informed the Buchanan team it would "take no further action and close the file," which it could do for any number of reasons, including the difficulty or cost of determining whether a violation occurred or the likelihood the statue of limitations would pass, Noble said. And those reasons won't become clearer until the FEC releases the case file after it closes the matter for the rest of the people named in the complaints. In fact, very little is clear until that happens, other than that the commission decided to close Buchanan's file without declaring whether it believed he did or didn't violate the law. "'Take no further action' means they're not going to do anything else," said Mary Brandenberger, spokeswoman for the FEC. "It doesn't mean anything further than that." Still unknown Buchanan's attorney, Chris DeLacy of Holland & Knight, says that no matter what term is used, "the indisputable fact is the FEC reviewed the merits of the case and voted affirmatively and decisively to take no further action and close the file against Congressman Buchanan." That may be true. But any details that may further clear Buchanan won't be independently verifiable until the full case is closed. "We cannot comment on it at all till it's closed," Brandenberger said. "And I don't have record of it being closed." Melanie Sloan, the attorney behind the group that brought the Venice Nissan Dodge complaint against Buchanan in 2008, says, "I wouldn't use the word 'exonerated.'" "It's premature to make too many conclusions about what the FEC's going to find here," she said. "On Vern being exonerated, you just have to take his lawyers' word for it. ... There is nowhere where anyone with any authority has said that Vern Buchanan has been exonerated." The ruling Tibbetts said the FEC has vindicated the congressman, taunting Democrats as she declared he had been "completely exonerated." But a review of FEC procedure and discussion with an attorney who was general counsel to the FEC for more than a decade shows that's not exactly the case. It's true that the FEC has said it won't take any further action against Buchanan. And there may indeed be strong evidence in his favor in the confidential FEC case file — but that's not yet available. All we know now is that the FEC declined to make its strongest finding, that there was no probable cause to believe Buchanan violated the law. In other words, Tibbetts' statement contained an element of truth, but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01855	"Although the governor doubled the beach fees . . . all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isn't even getting the money for that."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/14/john-depetro/john-depetro-says-all-revenue-governors-beach-fee-/	Rhode Island dramatically hiked its beach fees in 2011. But according to WPRO talk-show host John DePetro, the state didn’t get any of that extra money. DePetro was talking about tourism on his July 7, 2014 show, when he told his audience this: "I got so much email from people again complaining just how high the beach fees are. And then we learn this year that although the governor doubled the beach fees, where I think it's 28 bucks if you're from out of state and you want to go to a Rhode Island state beach on the weekend. But on top of that, all the money, as we found out, is all going to an out-of-state company. The state isn't even getting the money for that." When we emailed DePetro, he said his source was a May 19, 2014, story on WPRI.com, "Out-of-state company scored when R.I. hiked beach fees." However, the talk show host is misreporting the facts of the story. Here's the nitty gritty: In 2009, the state went out to bid seeking a vendor to collect fees at the beaches. Propark America, a parking management company based in Hartford, Conn., got the five-year contract, which ends this year. Under the deal, Propark paid the state $1,880,857 for the right to collect fees at the seven state-owned beach facilities. If Propark collected more than that sum, it got to keep the rest until its profit hits $502,143. Beyond that point, once $2,383,000 in beach fees had been collected, the state got 80 cents of every dollar and Propark got 20 cents. Then, in 2011, the General Assembly approved Governor Chafee’s plan to raise money by dramatically increasing the beach fees, effective that July 1. Daily weekday rates went from $6 to $10 for residents and from $12 to $20 for non-residents. Weekend and holiday rates doubled, going to $14 for residents and $28 for non-residents. The price of a season passes also doubled. Seniors get a 50-percent discount. The state’s contract with Propark required the state to share 20 percent of the extra revenue. According to figures from Terrence Maguire, the Department of Environmental Management's assistant director for financial and contract management, Propark's revenue from the contract jumped from $581,039 in 2010 (the summer when the old fees were still in effect), to $734,963 in 2011 (when the old fees remained in effect through June 30). Propark's profit increased to $822,595 in 2012 (the first full year of the higher fees). Last year, the company took in $756,228. But the state was the biggest winner. Revenue from the beach fees, which had been $1.6 million before the increase, jumped to $2.2 million during the transition year and rose further to nearly $2.8 million in 2012. It declined to $2.5 million last year. As a side note, the big losers were the host communities of Charlestown, Westerly, Narragansett and South Kingstown, which initially got 27 percent of the money from the sale of daily passes, for a total of $558,000 in 2010. But in 2011, their share dropped to $344,000. The chief reason: the General Assembly cut the towns' share from 27 percent of the daily fees to 16 percent. But back to DePetro's point. Overall, from 2011 through 2013, Propark made an extra $571,000 because of the increase in beach admission fees. But contrary to DePetro’s claim, the state made nearly five times as much -- $2.6 million extra compared with 2010. The money goes to the state's general fund, not to DEM. One final point. DePetro is correct that Propark is an out-of-state company. However all of Propark's workers at Rhode Island beaches are Rhode Island residents, Maguire said. Our ruling John DePetro said emphatically that ALL of the beach parking revenue generated when the governor raised its fees went to a private company outside Rhode Island. First of all, the governor proposed the fee increase but he didn’t do it on his own. It got the approval of the General Assembly as well. Second, all of the new revenue did not and does not go to the private company. When the state raked in that extra money, Propark got 20 percent of the new revenue. The state might have wanted to take all the additional revenue, but its contract with the company collecting the fees required both to share in the extra revenue. The state got 80 percent of that additional money. DePetro cited WPRI as his source. But while they got the essential facts right, he did not. We rate DePetro's scorcher of a claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-11855	"Liberals in County Hall want our community to be a sanctuary county"	pants on fire!	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/03/new-york-republican-state-committee/republican-mailer-claims-democrats-are-trying-make/	A political mailer claims liberals in the Erie County Legislature want to make the county a "haven" for undocumented immigrants. The Republican mailer doesn't identify the liberals but says they want Erie County to be designated as a sanctuary county. Such counties allow undocumented immigrants to remain there without fear of deportation unless a serious crime is committed. The New York Republican State Committee sent the mailer to county residents urging voters to vote for Republicans in Erie County Legislature races on Election Day. "Liberals in County Hall want our community to be a sanctuary county," the front of the mailer reads. "Vote Republican, Tuesday, November 7th." The mailer also makes the claim of a "movement" to make Erie a sanctuary county. Is that true? What's this about? Democrats in the Erie County Legislature have not introduced legislation that would make Erie County a sanctuary county. "Neither the county executive nor any Democratic legislator ever introduced any legislation calling for Erie County to be a sanctuary county," said Peter Anderson, a spokesman for Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. We couldn’t find any legislation introduced by any legislator -- liberal or not -- that would designate Erie County as a sanctuary county. A spokesperson for the New York Republican State Committee said the mailer refers to legislation introduced by Republican Legislator Ted Morton in December 2016. Morton’s resolution would have reaffirmed Erie County as a non-sanctuary county. It would not have changed any law. But Morton’s resolution didn’t even make it to a vote in committee. Republican Legislator Kevin Hardwick, the chairman of the Legislature's Government Affairs Committee, told Spectrum News at the time that he didn’t think the issue was "a huge pressing problem in Erie County." So the resolution was tabled and never brought up again. One Democratic legislator, Patrick Burke, opposed the resolution because he thought Morton was creating a false narrative about undocumented immigrants in Erie County. Burke may have opposed Morton’s bill, but he did not publicly advocate for Erie County to become a sanctuary county. Our ruling A mailer from the New York Republican State Committee said "liberals in County Hall want our community to be a sanctuary county." There’s no evidence that’s true. In fact, the resolution the mailer is talking about was blocked by a Republican who controls the Government Affairs Committee. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-13509	"Sen. Rubio has the worst vote attendance record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/02/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-says-marco-rubio-has-worst-attendan/	U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy wasted no time attacking incumbent Marco Rubio’s voting record after handily winning the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. When Rubio challenged Murphy to six debates, the Jupiter Democrat countered that Rubio was more concerned about a future presidential run than serving in the Senate, something he said is proven by the senator’s record. "Sen. Rubio has the worst vote attendance record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years," Murphy said in an Aug. 31, 2016, statement. We’ve already noted that Rubio has had an exceptionally bad voting record among presidential candidates that served in the U.S. Senate, although not necessarily the worst. But where does he stand among Florida senators of years past? We checked the record to see if he had the worst absentee rate in almost half a century. Rubio’s record To check this claim, we turned to GovTrack, which keeps a record of votes by members of Congress. Because we’re going back "nearly 50 years," we had to look back to at least 1966. Senator Years served Roll call votes missed Absentee rate Marco Rubio (R) Jan. 3, 2011 — present 234 of 1,616 (through July 2016) 14.5 percent Bill Nelson (D) Jan. 3, 2001 — present 107 of 4,922 (through July 2016) 2.2 percent George LeMieux (R) Sept. 10, 2009 — Jan. 3, 2011 8 of 423 1.9 percent Mel Martinez (R) Jan. 3, 2005 — Sept. 9, 2009 53 of 1,574 3.4 percent Bob Graham (D) Jan. 3, 1987 — Jan. 3, 2005 201 of 6,222 3.2 percent Connie Mack III (R) Jan. 3, 1989 — Jan. 3, 2001 101 of 4,115 2.5 percent Paula Hawkins (R) Jan. 1, 1981 — Jan. 3, 1987 245 of 2,368 10.3 percent Richard Stone (D) Jan. 1, 1975 — Dec. 31, 1980 209 of 3,521 5.9 percent Lawton Chiles (D) Jan. 3, 1971 — Jan. 3, 1989 769 of 8,781 8.8 percent Edward Gurney (R) Jan. 3, 1969 — Dec. 31, 1974 293 of 2,759 10.6 percent George Smathers (D) Jan. 3, 1951 — Jan. 3, 1969 847 of 3,585 23.6 percent Spessard Holland (D) Sept. 25, 1946 — Jan. 3, 1971 243 of 4,951 4.9 percent Rubio’s overall absentee rate — the percentage of all the votes he’s missed during his first term — is 14.5 percent. That’s considerably higher than the 1.7 percent average absentee rate among all senators in the same time period. His counterpart, Democrat Bill Nelson, has a 2.2 percent absentee rate since 2001, and 3.3 percent since Rubio took office in 2011. As Murphy’s campaign said, the last senator from Florida to exceed Rubio’s rate was George Smathers, a Democrat who had a 23.6 percent absentee rate over his 18 years in office. We’ll note there was a significant uptick in missed votes during the end of Smathers’ last term, from 1966 onward, which is 50 years ago. He missed 435 of 835 votes, or more than 52 percent, during his final four years. After that, Smathers declined to run for re-election and became a lobbyist. If we look at the sheer number of missed votes over a similar length of time, Paula Hawkins skipped 245 over six years, while Edward Gurney missed 293. Those are both more than Rubio’s 234 missed votes. But remember, those two had significantly more votes to miss, so we think the absentee rates carry more weight. Other presidential candidates who were senators do miss plenty of votes. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who also ran for the 2016 Republican nomination, missed 139 of 321 votes between April 2015 and June 2016, an absentee rate of 43.3 percent. His career rate is 18.1 percent. In 2008, then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois missed 137 out of 213 votes as he ran for president, or 64.3 percent of votes. His career absentee rate was 24.2 percent. In 2004, then-U.S. Sen John Kerry of Massachusetts missed 89.8 percent of votes. His career rate was 7.7 percent. But back to Floridians: A Rubio spokesman pointed out that Bob Graham, who ran for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, missed about the same number of votes during his campaign as Rubio did. That was a compelling bit of trivia to check. We found that between April 2015 and March 2016, the months Rubio was on the trail, he missed 157 of 242 votes, a 65 percent absentee rate. (Rubio's campaign clarified that he both declared and ended his campaign in the middle of those months, so his absentee rate then was 53.3 percent.) Graham missed 149 of 459 votes between January and November 2003, roughly the time he considered and campaigned for the presidency. That’s an absentee rate of 32 percent. He underwent heart surgery on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch on May 6. (Rubio's campaign noted that between May 6 and when Graham dropped out on Oct. 6, Graham's absentee rate was 50.4 percent.) That overall period also accounted for three-quarters of Graham’s missed votes over 18 years in the Senate. Graham routinely spent months without missing a single roll call vote. Finally, overall voting trends in the U.S. Senate do change. Spessard Holland was a senator for 24 years between 1946 and 1971. GovTrack noted that in that time period, the average absentee rate for his peers was considerably higher — 14.5 percent. Our ruling Murphy said, "Sen. Rubio has the worst vote attendance record of any Florida senator in nearly 50 years." Rubio has the highest absentee rate since Smathers, who left office in 1969. There are plenty of ways to slice the data: Some senators missed more votes overall, and his record is largely in line with other presidential candidates from the U.S. Senate. It’s important to keep those points in mind, but the roll call has been recorded. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-14532	Says "the one person (Donald Trump) has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton. She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/16/ted-cruz/cruz-trump-thinks-his-sister-hardcore-pro-abortion/	Republican voters can’t count on Donald Trump to appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice, said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. With the unexpected passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative legend, Republicans are hoping to thwart President Barack Obama’s chance to nominate a liberal replacement in his final year. Their hope is that the next president will be a Republican who would pick a conservative appointee. Trump, however, "does not care about conservative justices on the court," Cruz said of his opponent, in a Feb. 14 interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week. "You know, the one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton," Cruz said. "She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge. And he said she would make a terrific justice." We wondered, who is Trump’s sister, and has Trump said he only wants his sister on the court? Who is Trump’s sister? Trump’s older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in New Jersey. Cruz is correct that President Bill Clinton appointed Barry to this post in 1999. Prior to this position, Barry was a federal judge for the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. President Ronald Reagan nominated her for that post in 1983. Is Barry a "hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge," as Cruz said? Barry isn't one for trumpeting her political views, and she has avoided talking to reporters. The New York Times wrote a profile of her in August, for example, but she declined an interview. So we’re limited in what we know about her politics. Trump himself said in a Feb. 15 press conference, "I don’t even know what her views are." We think Cruz is referring to the fact that Barry wrote the majority opinion in a 2000 panel ruling that found a New Jersey law banning partial-birth abortions to be unconstitutional. "It is clear that the Act is unconstitutional because it creates an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion," Barry wrote. An interesting tidbit: Current Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, was also a Third Circuit judge at the time. He heard the partial-birth abortion case, too, and sided with Barry, arguing that the Supreme Court had ruled similar bans unconstitutional. So it seems a bit unfair to pin Barry as "hardcore pro-abortion" based on this case alone. We couldn’t find any other indications of Barry’s position on abortion. Trump addressed the issue in his book The America We Deserve, saying Barry declined to answer questions about her personal views on abortion at her 1999 Senate confirmation hearing. We were unable to locate a transcript of the hearing. Barry is a well-respected judge on the federal appeals court, which is where quite a few Supreme Court justices come from. But would Trump actually appoint her? He’s only kidding, he says. Trump did say his sister would make a "phenomenal" Supreme Court justice, but he was quick to say he wouldn’t appoint her. Back in August, Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin asked Trump if there was anyone he would consider for the court if the opportunity came up. Trump declined to name specific people. But then Halperin asked, "How about your sister?" "I think she would be phenomenal," Trump said. "I think she would be one of the best, but frankly I think she is — we'll have to rule that out now, at least temporarily." And in an October interview with Fox, Trump added that Barry would probably decline the offer, as she is "very happy where she is." Minutes after Cruz’s This Week interview Feb. 14, Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he would nominate his sister. Trump said that he was just kidding back in his August Bloomberg interview. "My sister, she also happens to have a little bit different views than me, but I said in that in a very joking manner," Trump said. "But my sister obviously would not be the right person. It's a conflict of interest for me." Cruz also said Trump has only suggested his sister as a potential nominee. That may have been accurate for a while, but at a Feb. 13 debate in South Carolina — the day before Cruz made this claim — Trump named two potential nominees, neither of whom are members of the Trump family. Trump suggested Diane Sykes, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Bill Pryor, who sits on the 11th Circuit. Both are conservative George W. Bush appointees. Cruz was the only other candidate at the debate to float a name: Mike Luttig, a former federal judge for whom Cruz clerked in Virginia. A spokesman for Cruz's campaign emphasized that up until the debate, Trump hadn't named anyone but his sister as a potential Supreme Court pick Our ruling Cruz said of Trump, "The one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton. She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge." Cruz’s claim is misleading. Yes, Trump said his sister would make a good Supreme Court justice. But he said he wouldn’t appoint her, and he has named two other potential nominees. And yes, Clinton elevated Trump’s sister to the appeals court. But Cruz leaves out that Reagan appointed her to the federal bench in the first place. Trump’s sister did join in ruling a New Jersey ban on partial-birth abortions unconstitutional. It’s worth noting that Justice Alito — hardly a "hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge" — joined in that opinion. Cruz twisted and left out facts to make a faulty claim about Trump’s views on the Supreme Court. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.

He was struggling a bit as he made his point, but here's what he said: "Obama gave the Muslim Brotherhood a million [then correcting himself] a billion and a half dollars last week, you know, in Egypt. We need that money here. A billion and a half dollars could really help Rhode Island, quite frankly. We probably need it, in my opinion, more than the Muslim Brotherhood needs it . . . especially when the Muslim Brotherhood got together, I think one of the first things they did, when they convened their new congress, was to make Israel enemy #1. And we give them a billion and a half dollars? That's a problem in my book. We need to focus our resources here." The Muslim Brotherhood has been a part of Egyptian politics -- sometimes an outlawed part -- since 1928; one of its goals is to promote Sharia law, which is the moral code and religious law of Islam. Did the Obama administration really give the Brotherhood $1.5 billion? It turns out that the money was actually an aid package to Egypt itself, not the Brotherhood, according to a March 22 story in The Washington Post. We contacted Hinckley's campaign. Spokesman Christopher McAuliffe said Hinckley "is aware that there is a pro forma difference between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Egypt. In that light, his position could certainly have been more precise. However, I do think the basis of it is readily understandable, since the Egyptian government is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood." For guidance on that point, we contacted some experts on Egypt. Melani Cammett, director of the Middle East studies program at Brown University, told us that sending aid to Egypt was not the same as giving it to the Brotherhood because the Brotherhood doesn't actually control the government. "It's true that the Muslim Brotherhood won the plurality of seats [in December elections] and when you combine them with the Salafis, which are more radical Islamists, they've won the majority of seats in the parliament," she said. "The fact of the matter is the SCAF, which is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, still controls the government and controls the executive branch and is manipulating things in such a way that it's making it difficult for the Islamists to exert their full power as the majority in parliament." "So the major struggle going on in Egyptian politics right now is that the SCAF, controlled by elite military officers, is not willing to relinquish power," said Cammett. John P. Entelis, director of Middle East studies at Fordham University, said it would be "totally inaccurate" to say that $1.5 billion is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. "This is an ongoing military aid package that we've been giving to Egypt since 1979." The aid package, according to multiple sources, includes $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic and political assistance. Our ruling Republican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the Obama administration approved $1.5 billion to go to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, the aid package was for the nation of Egypt, not the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood may control the largest bloc of seats in parliament, but it's not even a majority. Not only that, the country itself continues, for now at least, to be controlled by the military. And more than 80 percent of the aid package is military aid. The statement is incorrect for so many reasons, we rate it False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-06373	Says "tanking" Rick Perry’s federal tax plan has "huge tax cuts for rich people and big tax hikes for everyone else."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/02/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-rick-perry-tax-plan/	Saying Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential candidacy is foundering, liberal MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow said on her Oct. 25, 2011, show that Perry’s flat-tax plan has dire implications. Mentioning Republican hopeful Herman Cain’s tax plan, Maddow added: "So, tanking Rick Perry has now come up with his own version of a flat tax that accomplishes the same goal of huge tax cuts for rich people and big tax hikes for everyone else." Big cuts for the rich, hikes for everyone else? Earlier, PolitiFact rated False a Cain claim that his plan, replacing the progressive income tax with three flat taxes including a 9 percent personal income tax, would not raise taxes on those who make the least. To the contrary, the independent Tax Policy Center concluded that Cain’s plan would cut taxes for many of the wealthiest taxpayers while increasing taxes for the poorest. At a glance, Perry’s proposal, which has a flat 20 percent personal income tax, would seem similarly likely to sock low-income Americans. Yet Perry would permits taxpayers to stick with the current tax system — enabling him to argue that a tax increase would not be forced on anyone. Current personal income tax rates range from 10 percent to 35 percent, with those who earn the most expected to pay the most. Perry’s plan calls for a standard deduction of $12,500 per individual and dependent in a household and preserves deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations. He also proposes to eliminate taxes on estates, certain dividends and capital gains, as well as Social Security benefits. He also wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. "You can continue to pay your taxes, as well as the accountants and the lawyers, under the current tax system," Perry said at a South Carolina stop before he held up a postcard. "Or you can file your taxes on this postcard." His speech included this claim: "Taxes will be cut across all income groups in America." When we sought backup from MSNBC for Maddow’s claim, spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski pointed out news accounts calling Perry’s plan more regressive than the current income tax for reasons including the end to progressive tax rates. Also, she noted, Perry’s plan would eliminate the child care tax credit and the earned income tax credit, which enables low-to-moderate income tax filers to receive tax refunds. She passed along a comment to Yahoo News by Bruce Bartlett, a U.S. Treasury official in President George H.W. Bush’s administration, saying the removal of the refundable credits means "you’re massively raising taxes" for people who now pay nothing. Bartlett said in a Nov. 1, 2011, opinion article, posted online by the New York Times, the refundable "credits give many people a negative tax rate. That is, they pay no income taxes but still get a Treasury refund. Going from a negative rate to zero would mean a tax increase for such people." Skowronski pointed out an Oct. 25, 2011, Times’ blog post mentioning the loss of the earned-income tax credit. Citing a preliminary look at Perry’s plan by an expert for the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, the post said that generally, the "highest-income households (at the 99th percentile in income) in every structure of family analyzed always benefit from opting into the Perry plan.The poorest households, on the other hand, do not." We wondered, though, about the crux of Maddow’s claim. Which taxpayers would get huge cuts and who, if anyone, would see big increases? In a telephone interview, the policy center’s analyst, Roberton Williams, said the wealthy would enjoy big tax cuts under the plan because the 20 percent income-tax rate would require less from them than the current maximum rate. Also, he noted, exempting capital gains and dividends from the income tax would help wealthier taxpayers. Capital gains and dividend income are currently subject to rates of up to 15 percent. "These are substantial cuts," he said. However, he told us, the notion that everyone but the wealthy would face a big hike is incorrect since the plan allows taxpayers to continue under the current tax system. The center later posted a detailed analysis of Perry’s plan. We realize that Maddow could not have had this analysis when she aired her claim. However, mindful that her provided backup information didn’t fully support her statement and MSNBC had referred to the center’s preliminary analysis, we figured it was OK to delve into the detailed look. That analysis, posted Oct. 31, 2011, says that compared to current tax law, Perry’s plan would deliver a tax cut in 2015 of an average $267 to about 25 percent of the nation’s poorest 20 percent of households, with annual earnings up to $19,342. About 45 percent of the next-poorest quintile of households, earning up to $39,862, would get a cut averaging $695. Williams said the center’s definition of current law presumes that tax cuts put in place since 2001 under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will expire after next year, which will happen unless lawmakers intervene. Compared to current law, Williams said, Americans earning more would fare better under Perry’s plan. At least three in four households earning $69,074 or more would experience a tax cut, averaging $1,722, with 94 percent or more earning $119,546 or more seeing cuts averaging $3,872 to $34,928, according to the center’s analysis. The very wealthiest 0.1 percent of households, earning more than $2.87 million a year, would get average tax cuts of more than $1.9 million, the analysis says. We asked MSNBC and Perry’s campaign for their responses. In reply, Skowronski pointed out another part of the center’s analysis showing that compared to current policy -- that is, assuming most tax reductions put into place under Bush and Obama would not expire at the end of 2012 -- Perry’s plan would result in tax increases, on average, across the nation’s lowest 40 percent of earners. Then again, the chart indicates that 19 percent of the poorest taxpayers and 27 percent of the next-poorest quintile of earners would get a tax cut under Perry’s plan. Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier replied by email that Perry’s plan was devised assuming current tax law, not current policy. "We are operating under reality, not making assumptions of what may or may not happen in the future," Frazier said. And, she said, when "compared to current law, Americans of all income groups are better off under the governor's tax plan." The center’s analysis shows ways that such a conclusion holds up, including increases after-tax income and reductions in tax rates--on average--for households at each quintile of income. On average, the poorest taxpayers would see a $66 cut in taxes while wealthier households would see greater decreases topping out at $34,004 for the wealthiest 20 percent of households, the analysis says. The center’s Williams summed up this who-wins/who-loses aspect by telling us that not everybody would be better off under Perry’s plan, but "every (income) group is better off" mainly because those who do not gain from paying the proposed 20 percent flat tax can continue paying the existing income tax. All in all, too, the rich would make out very well. He’d be happy to be rich anyway, Williams said, but under Perry’s plan, "I really want to be rich." Our ruling Nearly all of the nation’s wealthiest residents would see tax cuts if Perry’s plan became law, in keeping with Maddow’s claim. Will they be huge? That’s an eye-of-the-beholder question, but some could be sizable by any definition. Some other Americans--including 45 percent of residents earning $19,343 to $39,862--also would see tax cuts, a projection that does not support the claim that the plan means big tax increases for everyone but the wealthy. Perry’s plan allows every taxpayer to continue under the current system. No one would pay more unless he or she chooses the flat tax against their financial self-interest. Maddow’s statement, leaving the incorrect impression that Perry’s tax plan hugely benefits the rich while everyone else pays more, rates Mostly False. UPDATE, 1:20 p.m., Nov. 4, 2011: We’ve amended this article to correct our initial recap of some of the Tax Policy Center’s average tax-cut forecasts for some taxpayers under Rick Perry’s tax plan.

pomt-07697	"We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down."	true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/07/frederica-wilson/frederica-wilson-claims-credit-closing-garbage-pla/	On Feb. 27, 2011, the Washington Post invited six new members of Congress to "tell their tales in their own words." Two of them were Floridians: Republican Rep. Allen West from District 22 and Rep. Frederica Wilson from District 17, both in Southeastern Florida. Wilson, the Miami Democrat who was elected to Congress for the first time in November, recalled how, when she was principal at Skyway Elementary in the Carol City neighborhood outside Miami, Miami-Dade County permitted a garbage plant to be built across the street from her school. The outcome, she said in the Washington Post article: "We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down." We knew Wilson had a long track record as an educator before turning to politics. But she had a hand in closing a multimillion-dollar plant? We had to check it out. The plant in question was called Agripost and was built in November 1988 across the street from Skyway, the Carol City elementary school. Wilson, a veteran with the school system, was the principal. County Hall had hoped that Agripost would help solve Miami-Dade’s trash problems by turning household trash into compost through a process of shredding and fermenting. The plant was to use the composting technology to convert household garbage into a soil additive for agricultural use. "The county was looking for innovative ways to deal with the waste," Clerk of the Courts Harvey Ruvin, who then served as a commissioner, said in an interview. But it didn't turn out as planned. After it opened, the plant at 20600 NW 47th Ave. emitted an odor that troubled Wilson and her students. "It was awful," Wilson said by telephone. "It smelled like rotting eggs and dog poo." And so the students made phone calls, wrote letters to government officials, and showed up at commission and school board meetings in red "Skyway" T-shirts. They stood on their tiptoes to reach the microphones. "She was very forceful on behalf of the children, as I recall," Ruvin said. Newspaper accounts credit Wilson for leading the charge. "What was the plant's biggest nemesis?" a Wall Street Journal report asked in a December 1991 article. "The Skyway Elementary School across the street. Principal Frederica Wilson is a self-proclaimed environmentalist. But she claimed a stench from the plant permeated school grounds, causing children to vomit or have nosebleeds, and she led a revolt against the plant." The plant closed in January 1991, barely two years after it opened. One report in the Miami Herald, on Nov. 25, 1990, said Agripost spent $20 million to build the plant. Another, on Dec. 23, 1990, said it was a $25 million plant. Agripost appealed the commission's decision, and in 1994 sued the county for $140 million. According to a Miami Herald report on Oct. 4, 1994, the lawsuit claimed the company had invested $40 million in the plant and also sought $100 million in damages for the "destruction of the company" when county commissioners voted to revoke the company’s zoning authorization. The decision threw Agripost into bankruptcy. Wilson said, "We closed that plant down. It was a $27 million-dollar plant, operating full steam, and we closed it down." (As for the different estimates for the cost of the plant, Wilson said by phone: "You know how long that’s been? I don’t remember everything.") But after 20 years, her memory in the Washington Post article was on target. We rate this True.	None	Frederica Wilson	None	None	None	2011-03-07T10:43:11	2011-02-27	['None']

pomt-03604	North Korea has a "substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/10/jack-reed/sen-jack-reed-says-capita-north-korea-has-one-worl/	In recent weeks, the North Korean government has made numerous increasingly provocative statements threatening South Korea and the United States, at one point warning South Korea that "our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now." As the rhetoric was escalating, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke of North Korea’s military capabilities during an appearance on WJAR Channel 10’s "10 News Conference." Reed was asked about North Korea’s recent moves and generally about what threat it could pose to the United States. Reed said that there is concern that, in five or more years, North Korea could increase its capability to launch nuclear missiles that travel longer ranges. "They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world," he said of their conventional, non-nuclear, military. We wanted to know whether North Korea -- officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea -- really has such a large force, based on the best-known information. The caveat of best-known is underscored by a recent New York Times news analysis, which reported on the difficulties the United States faces getting accurate intelligence about the country and raised questions about the accuracy of information about things such as nuclear weapons. We contacted Chip Unruh, Reed’s spokesman, who e-mailed links to several documents. One is a U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress on North Korea that says that country’s total military -- army, air and naval capabilities -- "ranks in personnel numbers as the fourth largest military in the world." It fields "primarily legacy equipment," the report states, meaning hardware "based on designs of the Soviet Union and China, dating back to the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s, though a few systems are based on modern technology." According to the Department of Defense report, at about 950,000, "the ground forces comprise the vast majority of North Korea’s military." The report estimates that country has some 60,000 naval personnel and 92,000 air force personnel -- a total of about 1.1 million. Several other sources provided by Unruh, including a March 28, 2012, statement before the House Armed Services Committee by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, supported the statement that North Korea has the fourth largest military in terms of sheer manpower, behind China, the United States and India. The 2012 U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs fact sheet said the estimated active-duty military force in North Korea is as many as 1.2 million personnel. Unruh also supplied a link to a short 2011 article and graphic in The Economist magazine. Using data from 161 countries for which such information was available, according to the magazine, the graphic said China had the largest active military in number of personnel -- more than 2.25 million -- while the United States was second with upward of 1.5 million active-duty personnel. India was third in manpower. The Economist placed North Korea fourth in overall personnel at about 1.2 million, but the Economist also noted that, if looked at per population, North Korea was, by far, the "most heavily militarized of all," saying there were 49 military personnel for every 1,000 North Koreans -- a ratio greater than that of any other nation. China has a population estimated at 1.3 billion people, with 1.7 military personnel for every 1,000 Chinese, and the United States has a population estimated at more than 316 million, with 5.5 military personnel per 1,000. We checked the CIA’s latest estimate, for July 2013, which put North Korea’s population at about 24.7 million people. Finally, we contacted the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which issues an annual report "The Military Balance" on nations’ military capabilities. Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the institute’s nonproliferation and disarmament program, e-mailed that Reed’s statement "sounds correct to me" but suggested checking the militaries of some smaller nations such as Israel. The Economist reported that Israel had 23 military personnel per 1,000 population. Of course, sheer manpower numbers aren’t necessarily a good measure of a nation’s military capability. And analysts often assert that much of North Korea’s technology and hardware is outdated or obsolete. But that’s beyond the scope of our analysis. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said, of North Korea: "They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world." Numerous publicly available documents support his claim. We rate it True.	None	Jack Reed	None	None	None	2013-05-10T00:10:00	2013-04-07	['None']
pomt-07370	"A [bank] surveillance camera capturing a criminal’s face and other identifiable traits would certainly discourage robbery attempts and serve as a deterrent to robbers."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/06/stephen-ucci/rep-ucci-says-requiring-banks-have-outside-securit/	On the morning of Sept. 20, 2010, a 49-year-old service station manager brought a deposit bag with $12,542 to a Citizen Bank branch in Woonsocket. A man in a ski mask confronted him outside the bank and demanded the money. When David Main tried to run away, the robber fatally shot him outside the bank entrance and ran off. Three accomplices have since been indicted for the crime. Now state Rep. Stephen Ucci is sponsoring legislation that would require all banks to "maintain security video cameras covering all customer doors, automatic teller machines, and night deposit repositories." "If that bank had been required to install security cameras outside of its building years ago, the victim may still be alive today," Ucci said in a statement. "A robber’s primary goal is to get in and out of the bank or ATM as quickly as possible without being recognized. A surveillance camera capturing a criminal’s face and other identifiable traits would certainly discourage robbery attempts and serve as a deterrent to robbers." The killing of Main, a father and husband, provoked outrage and calls for the death penalty. Ucci told us he submitted his legislation after talking to Main’s employer, who told him about the killing. He said the police did not ask him to pursue the bill and that he did not research the subject. While we understand his motivation, we wondered: does video surveillance deter robberies at banks? We often see surveillance images of robbers -- some disguised, some not -- who clearly were not deterred by cameras prominently placed in banks. So we searched for some evidence. For starters, we learned that nationwide, 5,628 bank robberies (including a very small number of larcenies and burglaries) were reported in 2010 to the FBI. Loot was taken more than 90 percent of the time. The crimes resulted in 106 injuries and 16 deaths. Of the banks that were targeted in these cases, 5,543, or 98 percent, had some form of video surveillance. That’s quite a few robbers unfazed by video surveillance. Did plenty of others refrain from robbing banks because of video cameras? No study shows that, as far as we know. We did find one enlightening report, written by Deborah Lamm Weisel, director of police research in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at North Carolina State University. Her 2007 text on bank robbery was created for the non-profit Center for Problem-Oriented Policing and appears on the U.S. Department of Justice’s web site. Weisel notes that the number of incidences has increased dramatically since the 1960s, as banks expanded hours and branches. "Bank robberies are usually fast, low-risk crimes, because employees are trained to comply with a robber’s demands," she writes. When listing measures that heighten a robber’s "perception of risk," she mentions hiring security guards, assigning employees to greet customers and enforcing policies prohibiting caps and sunglasses inside the bank. She did not include electronic surveillance. "Cameras do not appear to reduce robberies. Many bank robbers are not deterred because they simply do not believe they will be caught. Others believe that cameras can be thwarted with a disguise or by covert behavior or that cameras can be disabled such as with spray paint; or they simply do not think about cameras at all," Weisel writes. Surveillance, she said, helps "in identifying and apprehending suspects and can aid in prosecution as well. " Douglas Johnson, vice president of risk management policy at the American Bankers Association, agreed. "I’ve always heard and believed that cameras are not a deterrent measure. Cameras and video are there specifically for apprehension purposes," he said. Cameras are already at all ATMs, he noted, and do not prevent ATM crime. William Farrell, legislative council to the Rhode Island Bankers Association, testified against Ucci’s bill at the State House because of civil liberty concerns and other issues. When interviewed, he said that industry experts don’t view surveillance as an "effective tool in terms of deterrence." We did find a 2009 article, in which representatives of The Security Executive Council, a risk mitigation research and services organization, wrote that "parking lot cameras … could help identify perpetrators before they put their masks on. They could also act as a deterrent." But the authors emphasize apprehension, adding only that such video surveillance "could also" serve as a deterrent. When we told Ucci our findings, he said his intent was not just to prevent robberies of banks, but of customers, too. Exterior surveillance could deter robbers from attacking customers outside, he said, as well as provide information about a robber’s identity and getaway. Ucci, no doubt, sincerely wants to prevent another tragic death like David Main’s. And police officials in Providence and Woonsocket told us that video surveillance certainly helps catch and send robbers to prison, preventing repeat offenders from robbing again. But we couldn’t find any evidence that outdoor surveillance deters robberies of customers. And the experts we consulted doubt its deterrence value. We rate Ucci’s claim False. Update: The initial version of this item incorrectly reported the amount of money stolen in the 2010 robbery outside a bank. It was $12,542.

pomt-14745	"Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/dec/16/uber/uber-says-drunk-driving-crashes-down-austin-advent/	UPDATE, 12:50 p.m., May 6, 2016: Months after this fact check posted, the Austin American-Statesman obtained Austin Police Department statistics that conflict with the numbers the agency provided us when we conducted the check. The updated figures, which suggest more than 80 previously untallied DWI collisions in 2014 and 2015, would change our calculations in the fact check below, resulting, for instance, in 12 percent fewer DWI collisions in 2014 compared with 2013, not 24 percent fewer. That said, we’re not changing our story or adjusting the original Truth-O-Meter rating. The new data were not available to Uber at the time the company aired its claim, which was based on a news report that also used data the police department provided.Uber, a prominent ride-sharing service, has urged Austin-area supporters to tell Austin City Council members not to limit how it does business in part, it says, because drunken-driving accidents declined after such services started locally. "Ridesharing is moving Austin forward," Uber says in a web post including a petition for council members that we spotted in November 2015. "Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market." We wondered about the declared link. It seems plausible that if residents who consume alcohol avoid driving by enlisting a ride-sharing service, there could be fewer drinking-related accidents. In January 2015, indeed, Temple University researchers concluded from reviewing California data that the availability of ride-sharing at a lower cost than traditional taxi service in certain cities reduced drunk-driving deaths by up to about 6 percent. On the other hand, social scientists and statisticians are often quick to point out correlations don’t prove causation. Even if DWI-connected accidents are down since Uber arrived in Austin, it's not a certainty that's because of Uber's presence. Uber's backup To our emailed inquiry about ride-sharing and Austin accidents, Uber spokeswoman Brooke Anderson pointed out a March 2, 2015, KVUE-TV news story stating that according to the Austin Police Department, DWI arrests and crashes were down citywide, "and there could be a few reasons why," the station said. The story said the number of DWI arrests had dropped 16 percent in 2014, according to APD statistics. "DWI-related crashes fell even more citywide, decreasing by 23 percent last year," as in 2014, the story said, which also is "the year ride-sharing started in Austin, with services like Uber and Lyft entering the market." Asked when Austin residents became able to use a cell-phone app to call a ride-sharing service, Anderson told us Uber launched in Austin in June 2014. But it wasn't until October 2014 that the council gave permission to the Uber and Lyft ride-sharing companies to operate, effective a month later, and the city indicated plans to develop permanent rules later. KVUE’s news story quoted APD DWI Enforcement Lt. Keith Walker saying he didn’t know how much of an impact its arrival had on drunk driving in Austin, but he said the more travel options people have, the better. Police department figures Next, we asked the police department for a month-by-month breakdown of DWI collisions. To our inquiry about Uber's claim, department spokeswoman Amanda Cole also forwarded an email from Lt. Brent Dupre, then in the department’s Highway Command, stating: "We cannot say any drop" in DWI collisions "is due to the ridesharing groups." Different timeframes, different results We crunched the department’s counts of DWI collisions different ways, mostly finding decreases over the months that ride-sharing services have been available. For instance, according to the department, Austin experienced 454 DWI collisions in 2014; that count was 24 percent less than the 597 DWI collisions in 2013, much as KVUE reported. Then again, most recently, there were 445 DWI collisions in Austin from January through October 2015, the latest month of available data when we inquired--a nearly 6 percent increase from the 422 such collisions over the comparable stretch of 2014. Still, DWI collisions in Austin over the first 10 months of 2015 ran nearly 12 percent behind the 503 DWI collisions in the comparable part of 2013, according to the department. Next, we compared tallies for the 12 months after the council’s grant of permission to ride-sharing services took effect in November 2014 to the previous 12 months. According to the police, there were 497 DWI collisions in the city after ride-sharing was legal compared to 496 DWI collisions in the previous period--no change. But we also compared DWI collisions over the 17 months from June 2014, when Uber started picking up passengers in Austin, through October 2015 to the preceding 17 months. According to the police, there were 821 DWI collisions in the city from 2013 through May 2014 and 675 DWI collisions from June 2014 through October 2015, or 18 percent fewer. Our ruling Uber said: "Recent news reports indicate DWI crashes in Austin dropped 23 percent since ridesharing entered the market." That aligns with a local news report. Yet different timeframes for making statistical comparisons suggest a range of results--even, in one slice, more DWI collisions than before. It's worth repeating that Uber is referring to correlations between ride-sharing’s availability and collisions, not necessarily causation. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-08656	"Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents... And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident."	true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/14/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-florida-last-two-state-employee-mea/	Voters don't often hear politicians in Florida declare "We're No. 1!" when it comes to state spending for certain programs. Usually they cite how poorly we rank. CFO Alex Sink, the Democrat running for governor, follows that pattern and puts Florida in last place on two measures on her campaign website. "Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident." It doesn't get any worse than last so we wanted to check: Is Florida last in the ratio of employees to residents and in state payroll expenditures per resident? We asked Sink campaign spokeswoman Kyra Jennings for the source of both claims. Jennings sent us the State Personnel System Annual Workforce Report 2008-09 from the state's Department of Management Services. On Page 5 of the report we found these statements: "In 2008, state governments nationwide had an average of 216 state workers per 10,000 in population. Florida had a ratio of 118 workers per 10,000 in population. In 2008, the state government national average was $69 in payroll expenditures per state resident. Florida’s ratio was $38 in payroll expenditures per state resident." A map on page 6 based on census data shows that Florida and Illinois were tied for the lowest number -- 118 full- and part-time workers per 10,000 in population. A map that only looked at full-time workers per 10,000 population showed Illinois the lowest at 97 followed by Florida at 103. (And you thought we only competed with Illinois for most corrupt politicians. A New York Times analysis showed Florida is ahead of Illinois by a few steps in that category when measuring convicted public officials from 1996-2007.) A map on page 8 clearly shows Florida is the lowest in payroll expenditures at $38 followed by Arizona at $40. Lauren Engel, a spokeswoman at the Florida Department of Management Services, said that is the department's most recent published report. So that's a relatively current state report based on census data, pretty conclusive evidence of accuracy. We looked at DMS' previous report and found that in 2007-08 Florida had the same last-place rankings in both categories. But while our task was to fact-check Sink's statements, we still wondered: Is she pointing out how few state employees we have because she wants to change that rank if she's elected? We can't get lower than "dead last," so does she plan to move the state up in the rankings? On Sink's website, she appeared to be critical about the fact that Florida came in last in these categories -- she italicized the word "last" and the phrase "dead last." Here is the full context of what she wrote: "The face of Florida government is reflected by the efforts of its employees, whose contributions are intended to help people, businesses, communities, and overall quality of life. Compensating public employees fairly is essential, because without the ability to attract and retain well-trained and knowledgeable staff, Florida government cannot deliver the programs and services that citizens depend on. Florida already is not competitive in this area compared to other Florida industries and even other states. In fact, state government employees have not had a general pay raise in the past five years. In 2008, the average annual state employee salary of $38,839 was 4.5 percent below Florida's average wage for all industries. Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident. As Governor, Alex Sink will push to ensure that state employees are recognized for high performance by receiving fair and competitive compensation." We asked Jennings in an interview, would Sink add more state jobs? "No but she wants to make sure state employees are recognized for high performance and receiving fair and competitive pay,'' she said. Jennings added that Sink wants to "streamline middle management" and we saw on her website that she stated "As CFO, Alex recently launched an initiative to streamline middle management in the Department of Financial Services, with an estimated savings of $8 (million) to $10 million a year when fully implemented. As agency managers resign or retire, their positions will be reviewed for elimination and the agency structure re-engineered using existing staff to cut unnecessary management layers in government." So now Sink is talking about reducing the number of jobs though attrition -- not adding them. We asked Jennings for more clarity. She told us in an e-mail: "The point of the statistics you're fact checking is to demonstrate how lean Florida government already is compared to other states. Alex Sink will bring stakeholders together and do a top to bottom assessment of state government and its workforce -- inviting innovative ideas about how we attract quality workers, reward effectiveness and continue to make government more efficient and productive for our citizens -- before setting specific goals on numbers of state employees." Or to put it more simply: Stay tuned. We don't think Sink has made clear yet how she will reach the goals of streamlining middle management and paying fair and competitive salaries if she is elected governor. But for this Truth-O-Meter, our task was to evaluate whether Sink's statement was accurate that Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents and in state employee payroll expenditures. Sink accurately quoted those rankings from the state's most-recent Department of Management Services report, although Florida tied Illinois on the number of employees per 10,000 residents -- putting both in last place. We rate this claim True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-09-14T16:49:39	2010-09-13	['None']
pomt-13698	"We put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-us-put-lid-irans-nuclear-prog/	During her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton touted her experience as secretary of state, including her role in coming to a nuclear agreement with Iran. "I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot," she told the crowd in Philadelphia. "Now we have to enforce it, and keep supporting Israel's security." Since the United States has not had any military skirmishes with Iran in the past year, what she said about not firing a shot is clearly true. But what about the part about putting "a lid on Iran’s nuclear program"? That’s a trickier question. Here, we’ll recap the fact checks we’ve done on the landmark arms-control agreement since it was struck in July 2015. In the big picture, the deal lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb. To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, it cannot build a nuclear weapon. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s "breakout time" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. Iran "does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material," Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, has told PolitiFact. "It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days." Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University, told PolitiFact in 2015 that the deal definitely impedes Iran’s nuclear program. "Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon," he said. However, all of this is contingent on Iran abiding by the agreement in perpetuity -- something that only time will tell. Matthew Kroenig of Georgetown University, a foreign policy adviser to the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign, said that once the enrichment limit is gone, that could set the stage for a nuclear weapon. Installing more and more sophisticated centrifuges "would take at least several months," he said. "It is hard to know how long this would take because Iran never came clean on its past weaponization work, and we don't know how much progress they might be able to make covertly over the next 15 years," he said. "But again, several months is a reasonable assumption." Next, it would need to marry the warhead to its ballistic missiles, but given its experience in mounting conventional warheads on its already sizable ballistic missile stockpile, this should be a relatively routine matter, Kroenig said. "So, in sum, after the limits expire, it would likely still take Iran between several months and a year or so to have an actual deliverable nuclear weapon," he said. And "to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons, it would take several years." Our ruling Clinton said, "We put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot." There are lots of uncertainties about how well the accord will hold up over time, and especially what will happen once some of its provisions expire. As the saying goes, there are no guarantees in life. Still, most independent experts we have checked with agreed that the deal is both effective on paper and close to the best outcome the United States could have achieved through diplomatic means. So we’re giving it some benefit of the doubt. As long as you define "put a lid on" as "keep in check" -- a definition we think is reasonable -- rather than "ensure something will never, ever happen," then Clinton has a plausible case.

pomt-11455	"When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-wage-trends/	Before meeting with his Cabinet, President Donald Trump held court with the reporters assembled at the White House. Among other topics, Trump discussed some of the economic achievements on his watch: "Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, something that people have been waiting for, as you know. When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years, and wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people." Previously, we rated a similar statement by Trump about rising wages "finally" coming "after years of wage stagnation" as Mostly False. Trump’s recent statement is more problematic. We looked at the data for what economists say is the best measurement — median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, 16 years and over. This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation. This figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It might be reasonable to describe the overall wage pattern from the mid 1990s to the mid 2010s as "stagnant" or "unimpressive," but it’s not the case that they "effectively went down" over those two decades. In July 1994, median inflation-adjusted wages stood at $314. They peaked at $345 in early 2009, right before the Great Recession fully hit wages. That’s an increase of about 10 percent — not very strong over 15 years, but not a downward path, either. Even after weekly wages bottomed out in mid 2014, they still stood at $330, or 5 percent higher than the decade before. Again -- wages didn’t go down over that two-decade period. Is it accurate that for "the first time in a long time (wages are) starting to go up?" It is wrong for Trump to say wages are "now, for the first time in a long time" increasing under his watch. Wages had already been going up for nearly three years while Barack Obama was president, at a faster pace than the previous two decades. The significant upward trend in wages began in 2014, almost three years before Trump was inaugurated (and even before he had declared his candidacy for president). During the roughly three years before Trump was sworn in, median real wages rose from $330 a week to $351, or an increase of more than 6 percent. On Trump’s watch, wages initially went up and then fell enough to wipe out the accumulated gains. A few quarters of data can be subject to statistical noise, so there is not much we can say for certain about how Trump’s actions have or have not affected wages. . Our ruling Trump said, "When I was campaigning, I was talking about 18 and 20 years (when) wages effectively went down. Now, for the first time in a long time, they're starting to go up for people." Wage growth during the two-decade period Trump is referencing was modest, even sluggish, but wages didn’t go down over that period, even accounting for inflation. As for wages finally going up now, they rose for almost three years before Trump took office, so it’s not credible for him to imply that he deserves credit. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04507	Obama says he’s "put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-he-will-cut-deficits-4-trillion/	In the first presidential debate, President Obama and Mitt Romney disagreed sharply over who had the best way to rein in federal deficits. Romney relies on spending cuts and reshaping the tax code. The first would make it easier to reach fiscal balance and the second would spur growth that would fill the government coffers with higher tax revenues, he says. Obama favors what he calls a balanced approach. It uses a mix of spending cuts and a variety of tax and fee increases to curb the deficit . "I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan, Obama said. "You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue." Is Obama’s $4 trillion claim accurate? Sort of -- but $1.7 trillion dollars of it depends on when you start counting the savings. We rely on two Washington think tanks for this fact-check. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization that is very keen on debt reduction, crunches the numbers in the President’s 2013 budget and finds that by 2022, Obama’s program trims the deficit by $2.4 trillion. That’s compared to what the committee thinks the fiscal picture would have looked like without the president’s plan. The other think tank is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group. It comes up with pretty much the same result. It sees $2.1 trillion in deficit trimming that would accumulate between 2013 and 2022. Neither of these reach the $4 trillion mark. But last year, between a series of continuing resolutions that froze department budgets and a major deficit reduction compromise between President Obama and Congress, the government racked up $1.7 trillion in savings. If you add that to either of the think tank numbers, you get close to or over the $4 trillion the president counts in his plan. Whether that’s legitimate is a matter of debate. Our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post say, "No matter who is the president, the savings are already in the bank." Thus, don’t count them. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that since the effort to trim the deficit began in earnest in 2011, that those savings should be counted toward the goal. Here, it’s useful to see where the $4 trillion goal came from. Its origins lie in the Simpson-Bowles National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. That bipartisan panel said a blend of spending cuts and tax hikes could deliver nearly $4 trillion in deficit reductions by 2020. The president adopts that general approach on the fiscal side, but note the difference in the timelines. With all these plans, the biggest savings come at the end and the president is working with two more years than the Simpson-Bowles group. The difference is huge. Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said if you add two years to the Simpson-Bowles approach, you reach deficit reductions in the range of $6 trillion starting from the same point that the president begins his tally. Obama cites the Simpson-Bowles report to justify his balanced approach of spending cuts and tax increases. However, that report taken as whole would push the president to do much more than he has proposed "The president’s plan is a good start but does not go far enough," said Pequet. Our ruling President Obama said he had "put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan." According to independent analysts, that’s true only if you include the spending cuts that took place last year. It is not necessary to resolve that debate to assess the president’s claim. Obama cherry-picks the elements from the commission report that gave rise to the $4 trillion goal. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-11726	Says Donald Trump "has not apologized" for comments caught on tape by "Access Hollywood."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-wrongly-says-donald-trump-never-apo/	President Donald Trump’s sexually explicit remarks on the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced during the 2016 election have received fresh scrutiny as the country reckons with a tidal wave of high-profile sexual assault allegations. With recent misconduct allegations leading a number of prominent men in Hollywood, the media and politics to step down, some Democratic lawmakers have pointed to Trump’s remarks and multiple allegations against him as grounds for his resignation. But in calling for Trump’s White House exit, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., misstated Trump’s response to the controversial recording. "We have the absurdity now of a president of the United States who basically says, on a tape that everybody in this country has seen, his pride in a sense, in assaulting women," Sanders said Dec. 10 on NBC’s Meet the Press. "And he has not apologized for that and he has not offered his resignation." As anybody who closely followed this chapter of the 2016 election recalls, Trump did apologize after the tape came to light. Trump’s multiple apologies Trump’s campaign initially issued a one-paragraph press release that made reference to former President Bill Clinton, before apologizing "if anyone was offended." "This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago," the Oct. 7, 2016, press release reads. "Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended." Trump issued a more expansive video response the next day, expressing regret for the his comments. "I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me, know these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize," Trump said, before making another reference to former president Clinton. Finally, Trump again apologized during his Oct. 9 debate with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. "This was locker room talk. I am not proud of it. I apologize to my family, I apologize to the American people," Trump said. "Certainly, I am not proud of it. But this is locker room talk." Our ruling Sanders said Trump he "has not apologized" for his comments on the Access Hollywood tape. Trump in fact apologized multiple times for what he characterized as "locker room talk."

pomt-14000	Virginia’s banning of felons from voting is a "Jim Crow-era law."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/jun/06/levar-stoney/levar-stoney-wrongly-traces-virginia-felon-voting-/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe was quick to credit Richmond mayoral candidate Levar Stoney for playing a key role in his decision to restore voting rights to more than 200,000 felons in Virginia who have served their time. Until mid-April, Stoney was McAuliffe’s secretary of the commonwealth. The office oversees gubernatorial appointments and the restoration of rights to felons. Stoney, whose father once had lost his voting privileges, urged McAuliffe to issue a blanket restoration of rights to former inmates instead of continuing the process of considering each case individually. He stood beside McAuliffe and was allowed to speak at an April 22 ceremony on the Capitol steps at which the governor signed the restoration order. Both he and McAuliffe said the policy of making it hard for felons to regain their rights harks back to Virginia’s days of excluding black voters. Stoney added a detail during a recent radio interview on "The Jack Gravely Show," when he was asked whether the restoration was a "Democratic move" to help him win the mayorship this year and presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton carry the state in November. "Well, when people tell me that, it’s laughable," he replied, "because there are some people who would rather stand up for a Jim Crow-era law, a civil rights era law, instead of actually think about the 224,000 people now who actually have a voice in the process." Stoney made a similar claim in a May 2 tweet in which he lamented a Republican legal challenge to the blanket restoration. "We must move past these Jim Crow-era laws and look forward to engaging the citizens of Richmond in civic participation," he wrote. We wondered whether Virginia’s policy of banning felons from the ballot box really does spring from the Jim Crow era. Let’s go back in time. Black men were widely given the right to vote by the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870 - five years after the Civil War ended. By the late 1870s, Southern states began passing so-called Jim Crow laws to promote segregation and to sidestep the amendment with laws that made it all but impossible for blacks to vote. The Jim Crow era - marked by poll taxes, literacy tests to vote, segregated schools and public facilities - lasted until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1902, the General Assembly adopted a new state constitution that had all of those restrictions. It also included a section that banned persons convicted "of any felony" from voting. Stoney cites the 1902 constitution as proof that the ban on felons voting is a Jim Crow-era law. He also cites a quote by Carter Glass, a delegate in the 1902 deliberations who went on to become a U.S. senator and U.S. secretary of the Treasury. Glass approvingly said that all of the voting restrictions will combine to "eliminate the darkey as a political factor in this state, so that in no single county … will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government." But again, Carter was talking about the effect of all the voting restraints. He did not specifically mention the felon ban. Records trace that law back to a state constitution adopted in 1830 - decades before the Jim Crow era. Article III, Section 14 of the document denied "the right of suffrage" to "any person convicted of any infamous offense." This is important, because the 1830 constitution also limited the right to vote to white men. Blacks initially were unaffected by the felon ban, because they couldn’t vote. Only white, male felons lost the right. The same conditions applied in redrafts of the constitution in 1850 and 1864. Virginia Republicans, in their suit to stop McAuliffe’s blanket restoration, note that the felon ban’s onset in 1830 occurred "long before African-Americans could vote." But the GOP stressed that the history is not central to their suit. Republicans say McAuliffe doesn’t have authority to issue the blanket restoration and must consider giving back rights to each felon individually. Attorney General Mark R. Herring, in replying to the GOP lawsuit, did not address the history of the ban. It should be pointed out that Virginia’s current constitution - adopted in 1971, after the Jim Crow era ended - retained the ban on felon voting unless their rights had been restored by the governor. A final note: This Truth-O-Meter simply examines whether the felon ban is a Jim Crow policy. We don’t doubt an assertion that the ban, today, largely affects black voters. The Virginia Department of Corrections most recently released a racial breakdown of its prison population in mid-2014. Of almost 37,000 inmates, it found that 58.5 percent were black, 38.6 percent were white, 2.2 percent were Hispanic, and 0.7 percent were listed as "other." The U.S. Census Bureau estimates blacks comprised 19.7 of Virginia’s population in mid-2014. Our ruling Stoney said Virginia’s banning of felons from voting is a "Jim Crow-era law." The ban was written into Virginia’s constitution in 1830, almost a half-century before the era began. Only white men could vote then, so contrary to Stoney’s assertion, the law couldn’t have been designed to keep blacks from voting. The ban was retained in redrafts of Virginia’s constitution that were adopted during and after Jim Crow days.

pomt-11098	"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/12/yournewswirecom/clickbait-headline-wrongly-blames-clintons-anthony/	A clickbait headline on Facebook falsely claimed CNN’s Anthony Bourdain was killed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. This is an unsubstantiated, ridiculous allegation by conspiracy theorists who have tried to link the Clintons to criminal activity for years. "Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives," said a June 10, 2018, headline from YourNewsWire.com, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online. The report cited a similar article from News Media Central, an "alternative media" site that considers itself "free from establishment influence," according to its about page. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) YourNewsWire.com’s story said Bourdain, who died June 8, 2018, "had been harassed and threatened by Hillary Clinton operatives just weeks before he was found dead" and added that "investigators" were looking into the matter. As evidence of a link between Bourdain’s death and the Clintons, the report pointed to two tweets from Bourdain. The first tweet, posted Oct. 11, 2017, criticized Hillary Clinton over an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria during which she said she was "appalled" to discover that there was "a different side" to her longtime donor Harvey Weinstein, a film producer who was accused by several women — including Bourdain’s girlfriend, Asia Argento — of sexual assault. Bourdain called Clinton’s response "uninspiring," and many Clinton supporters responded on Twitter, including former Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. In the second tweet, sent May 2, 2018, Bourdain said he was "in no way (a Hillary Clinton) fan" and that he had "been on the receiving end of her operatives’ wrath" before. The Twitter thread started when Bourdain shared a Rolling Store story about Donald Trump attorney Michael Cohen, writing, "The glorious career of ‘Fast’ Mikey Cohen. Nothing to see here, folks. Totally legit." The YourNewsWire.com report suggested that these tweets show the Clintons as likely responsible for Bourdain’s death. The YourNewsWire.com report, like other Clinton-related conspiracies before it, crumbles under the microscope. The story’s only sources are alleged investigators — all unnamed — who were said to be looking into Bourdain’s death and also whether he had been planning to air an exposé of a pedophile ring, a separate claim that Snopes already debunked. Sean Adl-Tabatabai, editor-in chief at YourNewsWire.com and author of the false report, told us the investigators referenced were "online sleuths who dug up Anthony’s tweets and joined the dots." He also pointed again to Bourdain’s May tweet as proof of the Clintons’ involvement. We found no evidence that the Clintons played any role in Bourdain’s death. Bourdain died by suicide and was found unresponsive in his hotel room by a close friend, CNN reported. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-05857	As Dane County executive, Kathleen Falk raised property taxes by "millions of dollars every year" and approved the second highest increase in the state in 2010.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/12/rebecca-kleefisch/lt-gov-rebecca-kleefisch-says-kathleen-falk-raised/	Democrat Kathleen Falk’s bid to knock Gov. Scott Walker out in a likely recall election is subjecting her 14-year tenure as Dane County executive to attacks by Republicans. Led by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, they are labeling Falk a classic Madison tax-and-spend liberal -- one out of step with the times. "In a national economic downturn, Wisconsin families cannot afford to have a leader with an addiction to taxing and spending," Kleefisch wrote in an opinion piece published by Madison’s Capital Times on Feb. 3, 2012. "The failed policies Falk has consistently stood for throughout her career are exactly the same policies that led Wisconsin down an irresponsible path to a $3.6 billion budget deficit." Kleefisch went on to cite chapter and verse: "As Dane County executive, Falk raised taxes by millions of dollars every year, most notably in 2010, when she increased taxes by 8 percent, the second highest increase across the entire state of Wisconsin." The op-ed piece contrasts these claims with Walker’s state budget, which Kleefisch says was balanced "without raising taxes on Wisconsin families." We’ve labeled inaccurate, multiple times, the GOP claim that Walker didn’t raise taxes. He came close, and he cut taxes more than he raised them in his budget overall, but he reduced tax credits for some lower-income working people, which the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau has scored as tax increases. Asked to back up the claim about Falk, the Walker campaign -- speaking for Kleefisch -- pointed us to property tax figures compiled by Dane County and the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group. Falk’s approach as executive from 1997 to 2011 was to limit increases in the property tax levy to inflation with a factor built in for population growth. It was an effort to tie increases to service demand, said Scott McDonell, chairman of the Dane County Board, which largely approved of Falk’s approach. Did Falk’s budget raise property taxes by 8 percent in 2010, "the second highest" in the state? Yes. In 2010, Falk busted past her self-imposed levy limit of 1.19 percent for that year. She blamed lagging sales tax and other revenue due to the Great Recession, and said higher property taxes, a 3 percent wage cut negotiated with county unions and efficiency moves would preserve needed services. "I’ll be the first to say I’m not one bit comfortable with this levy increase, but using the formula would have resulted in painful cuts to public safety and human services that are unacceptable to me," Falk said at the time. The 8 percent hike was second-highest behind Green County. Did Falk’s budgets raise the levy by "millions" every year? We analyzed the data and found that in Dane County, the property tax levy went up in a range from $2 million to $9 million every year. That’s in the neighborhood of 3 percent to 5 percent increases annually -- with the exception of 2010. So the "millions" every year is accurate, though it’s worth pointing out that Dane County is nearly a half-billion-a-year operation supported by $133 million in tax levy -- so it doesn’t take a big percentage increase to get to "millions" of new property taxes in a year. Falk’s campaign defends her budget record, saying her property tax "cap" was landmark. She, like Walker, touts the fact that she balanced budgets, though both were legally bound to do so. The numbers showed Falk’s self-imposed limits held down property tax increases to the point that only 15 counties had a lower cumulative tax levy increase during that time, we found. Dane County ranked 57th among 72 counties, with 72 being the lowest levy increase. By comparison, under then-County Executive Walker, Milwaukee County was fifth-lowest (68th ranked) from 2002 to 2011. So both were in the bottom 20 percent of tax raisers, with Milwaukee County close to the champion of frugality. Indeed, both counties raised property taxes: Dane’s levy went up $59 million in Falk’s 14 years, while Milwaukee’s rose $51 million over Walker’s nine years. The difference: While Falk and the board gave themselves a cap on growth, Walker proposed zero tax levy increases each year and vetoed attempts to add to the levy. But the County Board almost always overrode him, complaining his budgets were unrealistic. To be sure, Walker started each budget with the new, higher base. In effect, he used the new taxes he opposed one year to help his budget for the next year. So if you compare the tax levy he sought in his first budget to that in his last, it is up. Our conclusion Kleefisch takes on Falk’s record of consistent property tax levy increases. While we found Dane County on the low side for tax hikes during Falk’s 14 years, Kleefisch’s main point is that taxes went up every year under Falk, and spiked one year. They did.

pomt-04598	"Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/20/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-talks-tough-china-puts-his-money/	America’s fraught relationship with China seems to creep into every modern presidential election. This time the argument is over which candidate has done more to boost Asia’s largest economy at America’s expense. Mitt Romney slams President Barack Obama for being soft on enforcing trade rules with China. In a television ad, the Obama campaign punches back, saying as an investor, Romney sent American jobs to the very country he promises to boot into line. The Obama ad gets personal. It says "Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China." We wondered if that attack was on the money. To the extent that some of Romney’s funds can be traced to China, the claim is accurate. In fact, the Romney campaign confirmed it. In an email exchange with us, staff made no bones about it. The candidate has money in Chinese companies. The campaign noted that Romney has his assets in a blind trust and the trustee is in charge. Staff described Romney’s role in his Chinese investments as passive; he does not decide which funds will get his money and the fund managers pick the places where to invest. The campaign also had something to say about Obama’s investments, which we’ll get to in a bit. Romney’s investments We can trace some examples of how this plays out. In the personal financial disclosure he filed as a presidential candidate, Romney listed an investment in Bain Capital Asia in the range of $100,000 to $250,000. This is a small amount relative to his estimated net worth of $250 million. The New York Times reported that Bain Capital Asia purchased a Chinese video surveillance company, Uniview Technologies, in December 2011. The firm supplies cameras and software to police so they can keep watch over public spaces such as universities and commercial centers and share information with their counterparts elsewhere in the country. Bain Capital Asia has multiple investments and multiple investors, so the Romney stake in Uniview Technologies is highly diluted. But in some small way, his money is there. When news of the investment broke in March, Romney told reporters he knew nothing about it. "Any investments that I make are managed by a blind trust," he said. "I don't make investments in Bain or anywhere else. That's done by a trustee who makes decisions that he thinks are correct." That trustee, R. Bradford Malt, issued a statement, cited in the New York Times, that he had put the money into the Bain fund before it purchased Uniview. Malt said the Romneys had no say in the matter and that he himself had no control over the fund’s choice of investments. According to the Boston Globe, Romney reported at least half a million dollars invested in another Bain fund that is a major shareholder in the Chinese retailer Gome. The blind trust puts Romney at some distance from his Chinese investments. Presumably, if the New York Times hadn’t written about Uniview, he wouldn’t have known where his money was. Romney’s blind trust We should note that not all blind trusts are created equal. Romney’s meets the requirements in Massachusetts. His trust would not pass muster in Washington. "It’s a blind trust only to the extent that Romney calls it that and describes it that way," said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group focused on government ethics. Romney is much closer to his trustee, Malt, than federal rules would allow. The two men both have close ties to Bain Capital, Romney as founder, and Malt as a lawer to the firm. Romney retains large investments in Bain. None of this matches the criteria of independence and arm’s length dealings that are spelled out in the federal rules. For one thing, the Office of Government Ethics, the agency that oversees the rules, allows only financial institutions to be trustees; individuals need not apply. Second, the rules would block someone with Malt’s history with Romney and Bain. The regulations state that the office will only accept a trustee who "is not and has not been employed by any interested party, not served as a director, officer, or employee of any organization affiliated with any interested party." Romney is the "interested party," and Malt’s work with Bain alone would disqualify him. Obama’s China connection The Romney campaign claims that President Obama has money invested in China too, albeit indirectly. The president’s financial disclosure shows he has retirement money in Vanguard mutual funds and the Illinois pension plan.Those funds list investments in some 500 companies, including Apple, Wal Mart, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and General Electric. Those firms have employees and in some cases, manufacturing facilities in China, which relates to another campaign hot-button issue, outsourcing. However, the companies themselves are based in the U.S. The investments involve domestic, not international, stock purchases. Our ruling The Obama campaign ad says, "Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China." The Romney campaign confirms this statement. In particular, news reports show as recently as this year, Romney had money invested in funds that owned shares in two Chinese firms. The amount is not likely to be large, certainly relative to Romney’s sizeable assets, and might be minor in absolute terms as well, due to the dilution that comes with funds with multiple investors and multiple investments. The claim suggests that Romney had more to do with the investment decision than is the case. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04187	The increase in the current state budget was greater than the inflation rate and the rate of population growth in Georgia.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/12/libertarian-party-georgia/gop-lawmakers-georgia-dont-walk-walk-spending-libe/	The term "supermajority" worries some Georgia Libertarians -- and they say you should be concerned, too. Republicans are very close to two-thirds majorities in both chambers of the Georgia Legislature, a "supermajority," which is described as a majority so large Democrats and independents would be unable to block proposed changes by GOP lawmakers to the state constitution. Leaders in the state’s Libertarian Party tried to emphasize their trepidation in a recent press release. Republicans, they say, are not the best managers of state finances. One claim in the press release seemed worthy of a fact check. "While Republicans held a large majority for the past few sessions, we saw an increase in the state budget for FY 2013 greater than the rate of inflation and population growth," said party Chairman Doug Harman. "That certainly is not the limited government spending promised by Republican candidates on the campaign trail in 2010." The Libertarian Party endorsed James Camp in the race to fill a vacant state Senate seat that became open when Gov. Nathan Deal appointed Bill Hamrick, a Republican, to the Superior Court on the Coweta Judicial Circuit. An election is scheduled for Jan. 8, 2013. We wondered if the party’s claim about the growth in the state budget was correct, and if it is the best way to measure such growth. The party’s executive director, Brett Bittner, explained how they reached this conclusion. They compared the amount of money approved by the Georgia Legislature in the two most recent state budgets. That’s about a 5.4 percent increase. Georgia’s budget runs on a 12-month schedule that begins July 1 and ends June 30. Bittner said they calculated the increase in inflation between 2010 and 2011, which he said was 3.16 percent. He added that number and the percentage of Georgia’s population increase between April 2010 and July 2011, which was 1.32 percent. Combined, that’s about 4.5 percent. "[T]hat means the budget grew BEYOND inflation and population growth," Bittner wrote in an email. Several experts we interviewed agreed that the Libertarian Party’s claim is accurate, if you make the comparison using Georgia’s population increase and the inflation rate between 2010 and 2011. But they said that’s not the best way to measure such things. They also said there’s some context that should be considered when examining the state budget. "I don’t think this formula is the one I would prefer," said Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth. Humphreys believes a better comparison would be to measure any increase in state spending against Georgia’s economic growth through its gross domestic product. Georgia’s nominal gross domestic product, which measures the value of all the goods and services produced in current prices, grew by 3.9 percent between 2010 and 2011, Humphreys said. He noted, though, that increase is between one calendar year, as opposed to a fiscal year. Humphreys said a multiyear study of state spending is a more effective approach. He and others noted that state spending is about $1 billion less than it was before the Great Recession took hold in 2008. The biggest increases in state spending between the last two budgets occurred in education and community health. Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a nonprofit group that opposed the Legislature’s decision to cut some taxes earlier this year, said the current budget had to be increased. Enrollment in state-funded colleges has increased by 100,000 students over the past decade, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently reported. Another factor in increased state spending is Medicaid, which Essig said has been underfunded. "Ninety percent of (the budget increase) was keeping the state afloat," Essig said. He and others pointed out that Deal has asked state agencies to make further cuts. Carolyn Bourdeaux, the former director of the Georgia Senate Budget and Evaluation Office, said in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the state had to replace federal stimulus funding and state reserves that were used to shore up general fund spending in prior years. For instance, she said the state took about $850 million in reserves between 2009 and 2011 from employee retirement health benefits and the state’s health benefit plan to help keep the state budget afloat. "At least some of these funds must be replaced," said Bourdeaux, now associate director of Georgia State University’s fiscal research center. Bourdeaux continues to track state spending against population, the consumer price index, gross domestic product and other factors. Her research shows state government real per capita spending has grown by only 2 percent since fiscal year 2009. Bourdeaux’s data also shows real per capita state spending has declined by 23 percent from its height in fiscal year 2001. Bittner said they decided to compare spending against population growth and inflation because Georgia Republicans contend they’ve kept pace with those two categories. "It did grow faster," Bittner said of state spending. Bittner rejected the argument that the state has been hamstrung by other budgetary matters in recent years, particularly since they dominate both legislative chambers and hold all of the constitutional offices. "We should see much greater cuts," he said. "It further indicts them." To summarize, the Libertarian Party of Georgia claimed that the increase in the current state budget was greater than the inflation rate and the rate of population growth in Georgia. Their numbers are accurate, but per capita state spending is actually less than it was a decade ago and has been flat since the recession. Meanwhile, Georgia has had a record number of college students and has other areas where it must spend more. The claim is technically accurate, but it ignores some facts that would give readers a different impression. Under our rating system, this claim is Half True.

pomt-03662	"Most state employees did not receive any pay raise from 2009 to 2012."	true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/29/texas-state-employees-union/employee-group-says-most-state-workers-did-not-fie/	Pay raises for Texas government workers are extremely rare of late, an employee group maintains. "Most state employees did not receive any pay raise from 2009 to 2012," the Texas State Employees Union says on a union web page. On the same page, the union says workers in Texas higher education have not drawn a statewide raise since 2002. But we did not delve into this aspect of government for this article. There is no central repository of pay-raise data for higher education. We probed instead whether general state agency employees had no raises from 2009 to 2012. Over the three years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agencies employed about 182,000 workers or more in those years. By phone, union spokesman Seth Hutchinson said employees last fielded an across-the-board raise in 2008; the 2007 Legislature budgeted consecutive raises of $50 a month or 2 percent, whichever was larger, first in September 2007 and again in September 2008, actions we confirmed in a May 26, 2007, Austin American-Statesman news article. Hutchinson said the 2009 Legislature gave most employees a one-time $800 bonus, described by some as a retention payment. He said targeted raises were approved for certain employees with law enforcement or prison jobs. According to a June 10, 2009, Statesman news article, correctional workers fielded a 7 percent raise spread over two years and state law enforcement officers fielded raises averaging 7 percent to 8 percent over two years. By phone, Ray Hymel, a lobbyist who represents the Texas Public Employees Association, estimated that more than 34,000 state workers landed these pay raises. Hutchinson said the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature did not approve pay raises; we found no news stories contradicting that. So, there have been no across-the-board increases for state workers since September 2008. In contrast, most workers drew $800 bonuses from the 2009 Legislature, which otherwise awarded raises to a subset of workers. We wondered how many workers drew increases in pay thanks to merit raises doled out by agency chiefs. Hutchinson replied: "Many employees never receive merit raises," a conclusion he attributed to conversations with union members. We asked the state comptroller’s office if it could break down merit pay raises from 2009 through 2011. Spokesman R.J. DeSilva emailed us charts indicating the prevalence of three actions leading to higher pay for employees of about 110 agencies, though he said 10 agencies do not enter payroll information with the comptroller’s office in a way that would enable a check of their pay hike. The comptroller’s research indicates: --In 2009, 21,996 of 184,754 employees had merit raises, 29,102 workers were promoted and 3,443 workers saw equity pay adjustments. --In 2010, 13,517 of 187,944 employees fielded merit raises, while 25,489 employees were promoted and 3,826 workers experienced pay adjustments for equity. --In 2011, 8,860 of 186,549 employees got merit raises, 22,488 workers were promoted and 5,213 saw equity pay increases. At first pass, this research indicates that in 2009, 30 percent of workers in the checked agencies got a raise in some fashion, while in 2010 and 2011, no more than 23 percent of the workers got a raise. It’s possible, we suppose, that each year, at least 70 percent of workers saw no raise--though that is without considering the law enforcement/criminal justice personnel who fielded legislated raises. Then again, might it be that different subsets of workers drew merit raises each of the three years so that one might speculate that some 60 percent of workers got a raise sometime in the three years? Hutchinson suggested another way to break down the comptroller’s results, noting by email that the results could be taken as indicating that just 14 percent of workers fielded merit or equity raises in 2009 and smaller clutches got such raises in 2010 and 2011. His view: It’s not accurate to count promotions as raises considering they involve changes in position and responsibilities with pay implications. Our ruling The employees union says most state employees did not receive a raise from 2009 to 2012. The last across-the-board raises took effect in 2008. Otherwise, lawmakers gave most employees a one-time, one-month bonus in 2009 and legislated consecutive raises for more than 34,000 other workers in 2009 and 2010. But a bonus is not a raise. Meantime, it appears that no more than 14 percent of workers across most state agencies got a merit raise any of the three years. Even if one assumes, perhaps improbably, that a completely different set of workers got each year’s merit raises, less than half of agency workers would have gotten those pay bumps. We rate this claim as True.	None	Texas State Employees Union	None	None	None	2013-04-29T06:00:00	2013-04-01	['None']

pomt-02906	Congress "is bewildered at the scope and reach of our spying apparatus" but in 2008 and 2012 "explicitly rejected an amendment calling for more disclosure."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/05/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-congresss-shock-spying-allies-rings-ho/	The U.S. tapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone, along with the phone calls of other American allies, has led members of Congress to call foul. Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show, isn’t having any of it. "They have no right to be surprised," Stewart said. Stewart then walked through all the ways that from 2001 onward, lawmakers have given the green light for greater and more expansive eavesdropping. "Congress passed the Patriot Act giving our intelligence agencies access to, quote, 'any tangible thing'," Stewart said. "Our intelligence has to have access to everything except wishes and fairies." Sarcasm aside, Stewart made some specific allegations. "The very Legislature that is bewildered at the scope and reach of our spying apparatus, granted them the scope and reach," he said. "In 2008 and 2012 (they) explicitly rejected an amendment calling for more disclosure of said surveillance." While many of Stewart’s bits are pure comedy, his take on Congress’ actions includes specific claims that can be fact-checked. In that vein, Stewart is correct. Congress expanded the legal boundaries of intelligence gathering and turned back several efforts aimed to reveal details of how spying touched the lives of ordinary Americans. The only caveat: It seems unlikely that any of the amendments he referenced would have led the intelligence agencies to report on their spying on America’s allies. Bolstering FISA in 2008 and 2012 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, has been around since 1978. It basically sets the ground rules for spying on foreign agents, especially when that spying touches American soil and might touch American citizens. It gives a special court the power to oversee that work. After the terrorist attacks of 2001, President George W. Bush pressed to give intelligence agencies additional money and authority to look at information that people might have thought was private, such as library records. That was the "any tangible thing" that Stewart referred to. But library records were a tiny sliver of the data collection program created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Electronic information, over the Internet and through telephone networks was gathered and stored in vast quantities. The collection of that data became known in 2006, when the role of major companies such as Verizon and AT&T was revealed. That prompted a 2008 review of the FISA law, to basically retroactively approve the arrangement. "The 2008 amendments appear to be designed to legalize warrantless wiretapping by the NSA that had been done illegally prior to the amendment," said Molly Bishop Shadel, an expert in foreign intelligence law at the University of Virginia School of Law. "Congress expanded the scope of FISA even though it knew or should have known that the NSA had done something questionable." During the debate in 2008 the main point of contention was whether to grant retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that apparently had given the government access to data that passed through their networks. While the changes in 2008 did set some limits on domestic surveillance, they gave intelligence agencies greater flexibility to use new technology to track the activities of foreign agents so long as they were outside American borders, even if their communications ran through American systems. The 2008 revisions were to last five years, which prompted further tinkering in 2012. By 2012, several members of Congress offered amendments that would have compelled intelligence agencies to give Congress more details on their activities. One from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., would have urged the government to share key interpretations of law from the FISA court. Another from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would have told the government to report the number of Americans whose personal records had been caught up in its surveillance nets and would have strengthened the rules against warrantless searches. A third from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., would have required a warrant for access to any U.S. communication, although it didn’t speak directly to greater disclosure to Congress. The Senate rejected all three amendments. Wyden’s bill came the closest but failed 52-43. The overall reauthorization of the wiretapping program passed 73 to 23. The expanded reach of intelligence agencies continued and any amendment that Stewart referred to was turned back. (We reached out to The Daily Show for supporting details but did not hear back.) Congress "definitely had a chance to pass amendments that would have given them more information," said Trevor Timm, a privacy activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. But there is a caveat. Timm said none of the amendments would have changed American activities overseas. They all were aimed at protecting the privacy of Americans. While keeping the country safe from its enemies remains the larger goal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, there is nothing in the law that puts America’s friends off limits. Legally, the U.S Code says intelligence agencies "shall keep the congressional intelligence committees fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities." But that law allows to the director of national intelligence to set the standards as to what should be included in its reports. Our ruling Stewart said Congress had given intelligence agencies broad powers to engage in surveillance and had rejected an amendment that would have required more disclosure. Overall, changes made in 2008 and continued in 2012 did give U.S. spy agencies more leeway. Individual lawmakers offered amendments aimed expressly at giving Congress more details on intelligence activities, but they failed to win enough support. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10264	"Whether in Illinois or Washington, Barack Obama has bridged partisanship to bring about significant reform."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/25/nancy-pelosi/some-bipartisan-success/	In her speech at the Democratic Convention on Aug. 25, 2008, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., portrayed Barack Obama as a leader capable of breaking through the partisan gridlock of Washington. "Whether in Illinois or Washington, Barack Obama has bridged partisanship to bring about significant reform," Pelosi said. This has been a common theme in the Obama campaign, and we have looked at this from several angles in the last year. The short answer is that Obama does, in fact, have some history of success in reaching across the political aisle, but he's also got a record of reliably voting in line with the Democratic Party. A year ago, we checked a statement on the Obama campaign Web site almost identical to Pelosi's claim at the convention: "During his tenure in Washington and in the Illinois state Senate, Barack Obama has accumulated a record of bipartisan success" and ruled it Half True . Let's start with Obama's record in the Illinois Senate. Obama was a key player in passage of the Gift Ban Act, which was the first major overhaul of Illinois' ethics legislation in 25 years. The law prohibits legislators, state officers and employees, as well as judges, from soliciting or receiving gifts from a person with interests affected by the state government. In his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Illinois state Sen. Emil Jones Jr. cited Obama's efforts in shepherding this legislation, noting that it was a difficult bipartisan task to get legislators to vote on regulating gifts they receive. Kirk Dillard, a Republican in the Illinois state Senate, worked with Obama on the ethics bill and was impressed enough to appear in an Obama presidential campaign TV ad even though he's endorsing GOP Sen. John McCain. "Sen. Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way," Dillard said in the ad. "Republican legislators respected Sen. Obama. His negotiation skills and an ability to understand both sides would serve the country well." Dillard said in an interview he made the ad primarily because of his work with Obama on ethics reform, but also mentioned his cooperation on changes in the state's death penalty laws. "Sen. Obama, even on a topic more suited for liberals, worked extremely well with conservatives," he said. Obama collaborated with another Republican, Rep. Sandra Pihos, on legislation expanding the state's KidCare and FamilyCare health insurance programs. Still, by most indications Obama compiled a Democratic voting record in Springfield. In 2001, he received a 100 percent rating from the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council and in 2002 received a grade of "A" from Illinois Citizens for Handgun Control. He consistently received high scores from the Illinois AFL-CIO. Since arriving in Washington in 2005, Obama has also voted consistently with his party while also attempting to work with Republicans on several high-profile issues. Obama worked with Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana on several energy bills and on Jan. 11, 2007, President Bush signed their bill to expand U.S. cooperation to destroy conventional weapons. Obama and Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma successfully pushed through Congress legislation creating a database to track federal grants and contracts. Open-government advocates said the legislation would help provide more public access to the so-called earmarking process, where individual lawmakers secure funding for particular projects. But the picture isn't all rosy. Perhaps signaling battles to come, Sen. John McCain accused Obama in February 2006 of partisan posturing over ethics reform. Obama had taken his party's lead on the issue, and he had asked McCain to support his version of a bill. "I failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self-interested partisan posturing appear more noble," McCain wrote in a letter to Obama. "Again, sorry for the confusion, but please be assured, I won't make that same mistake again." In June, McCain sought to poke holes in Obama's claims of bipartisanship, noting that he, McCain, was the one who in the spring of 2005 joined the so-called Gang of 14, a small bipartisan group that resolved a bitter partisan dispute over three conservative judicial nominees named by President George W. Bush. As part of the compromise, the Democrats agreed not to support furthering the filibuster of the judicial nominees and the Republicans agreed not follow through on the threat of the "nuclear option," which would have effectively killed the practice of filibustering. We examined this claim , and ruled that McCain was correct that Obama did not participate. For his part, Obama said he didn't participate because he felt like the Republicans got everything they wanted. "I don't think it was a particularly good compromise," Obama told the St. Petersburg Times on May 21, 2008. A review of Obama's votes as a senator also doesn't bolster his argument of bipartisanship. Congressional Quarterly does vote studies each year and found that in the Bush era, Obama voted his party's position 96 percent of the time on votes where Republicans and Democrats were divided. Bottom line, while it's clear that Obama has had some bipartisan success, when it comes to voting on key pieces of legislation, Obama's record is almost in lockstep with the Democratic Party. Therefore, we can only give Pelosi's claim a Half True.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2008-08-25T00:00:00	2008-08-25	['Illinois', 'Barack_Obama', 'Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-02309	If the legislature refuses to expand Medicaid, "27 states are going to get our money – Virginia taxpayer money – into their states to provide health care for their citizens, paid for by us."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/mar/31/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-legislatures-refusal-expand-medicai/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe says the House of Delegates is tossing Virginia taxpayer’s dollars to other states by refusing to expand the Old Dominion’s Medicaid program. "In America right now, 27 states are going to get our money – Virginia taxpayer money – into their states to provide health care for their citizens, paid for by us," McAuliffe, a Democrat, said during a Feb. 26 appearance on WTOP radio. A few days earlier, the Republican-led House rejected a budget amendment to expand eligibility for Virginia’s Medicaid program to 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, the federal government would pay the entire expansion cost for three years and 90 percent of it down the road. Since then, the sides have dug in on a debate that’s blocking passage of a new two-year state budget. The House last Thursday again rejected the expansion on a partisan vote, with GOP leaders saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. And McAuliffe has been touring the state, repeating that failure to expand Medicaid will send Virginia taxpayers’ money into 27 other other states to insure their working poor. We wondered if the governor is right. First, let’s look at the number 27. It refers to the number of states that have expanded their Medicaid programs and, according to McAuliffe, stand to gain from Virginia’s defiance. Brian Coy, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the tally comes from a map of states that have expanded their programs compiled by the National Academy of State Health Policy. A chart by the Kaiser Family Foundation offers the same number. What’s the evidence that Virginia taxpayer’s money will flow to Medicaid recipients in those states if Virginia opts not to expand? "The Affordable Care Act pays for itself by raising taxes and cutting spending on health care programs," Coy emailed. "If we refuse to close the coverage gap, Virginians will be paying taxes into the federal government that were meant to help fund the ACA, but we will not be bringing our share of that money back home to cover our citizens. Those Virginia tax dollars will instead go toward the funding of the ACA and states that have elected to bring tax dollars back down." Well, it’s not quite that simple. Obamacare contains a series of new taxes and penalties on: individuals with adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 a year and families with more than $250,000. many companies that fail to provide health insurance to employees and individuals who fail to buy it. high-end, or "Cadillac," health insurance plans. manufacturers of drugs and medical devices. The taxes will generate $570 billion over the next 10 years, according to February projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Virginia’s Senate Finance Committee estimated last year that the Old Dominion would pay about $26 billion in ACA taxes over a decade. The Obamacare levies will flow into the U.S. Treasury where they will mix with perhaps $40 trillion of other tax revenues collected over the next decade and funnelled to federal programs. There are no guarantees under Obamacare that states will reap benefits equal to the new taxes that they pay. So it’s possible that a portion of Obamacare levies paid by Virginians could help expand Medicaid in another state -- or build a military barrack, fund agricultural research or help pay for a multitude of other federal programs. There’s no telling. It’s like trying to tracing a drop of rain that falls into to reservoir to see who’s bath tub it eventually reaches. But here’s the fine point: Virginia’s decision on Medicaid has no effect on the amount of money that will be available to expand the program in other states. "There’s no finite money for expansion," said Edwin Park, vice president of health policy at the liberal Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The expansion extends Medicaid eligibility to households earning up to 133 percent of the U.S. poverty line. Each state that opts in gets federal money based on the number of new Medicaid enrollees it signs up, regardless of what happens in other states. There is no cap on the federal money available for expansion that forces states to compete for shares. Park said McAuliffe’s statement is misleading because other states will not get more money if Virginia opts not to expand Medicaid. Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed with Park, but said McAuliffe has a valid point. "To the extent Virginians pay federal income tax, some states will get Medicaid money that Virginia doesn’t," he said. Our ruling McAuliffe said that the General Assembly’s refusal to expand Medicaid would send Virginia taxpayers’ money into 27 other states to insure their working poor. He’s right that 27 states have broadened Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. And if Virginia doesn’t join suit, it will sacrifice federal dollars that would pay the overwhelming long-term cost of the expansion. Virginians, like residents of all states, are subject to new taxes to help support the ACA. The payments pour into the U.S. Treasury where they are mixed with other tax dollars and piped out to federal programs. There’s no tracking of individual coins in this flow of money and it’s possible that some deposits from Virginia could end up helping Medicaid recipients in other states. But contrary to McAuliffe’s statement, there’s no direct connection between Virginia’s decision on expansion and what happens to Medicaid in other states. The goal of expansion is to offer Medicaid insurance to people earning up 133 percent of the U.S. poverty line. States participating in the program will receive the same federal subsidy for each new enrollee regardless of whether Virginia participates. So McAuliffe’s statement has an element of truth but gives an incorrect impression on the impact turning down the money would have. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10424	"NATO hasn't provided enough troops (in Afghanistan) because they are still angry about us going into Iraq."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/19/barack-obama/government-report-backs-up-obama/	During the Q&A; portion of a town hall meeting in Cape Girardeau, Miss., on May 13, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama talked about the need to focus on and provide more troops in Afghanistan. "If we're going to catch (Osama) bin Laden, or most importantly, break down al-Qaida ... we've got to have the capacity to put more troops in Afghanistan ... both our troops and NATO troops. "Right now, we don't have enough troops and NATO hasn't provided enough troops because they are still angry about us going into Iraq." With the addition of some 7,500 Marines in Afghanistan in early 2008, there are now about 32,500 American troops in Afghanistan; plus an additional 28,000 NATO troops. Late in 2007, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates made several public, but largely fruitless, pleas to NATO countries for the commitment of more troops in Afghanistan. A Congressional Research Service report for Congress, submitted Jan. 7, 2008, states that Gates "acknowledged that domestic political problems are preventing some allies from increasing their force levels in Afghanistan. Allied government officials state privately that their populations are reluctant to follow the Bush Administration, largely due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and subsequent criticism of the United States in Europe and the Middle East." Later, the report cites a "highly respected" German Marshall Fund poll that found a sharp decline in European public opinion toward U.S. leadership due to the U.S. policy in the Iraq war. The report concludes that, "This decline is complicating the effort of allied governments to sustain support for the ... mission" in Afghanistan. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor of International Relations at Georgetown University, said there is some truth in Obama's statement. "The Iraq war has soured many European electorates on U.S. foreign policy," Kupchan said. "Even though there was a groundswell of support for the war in Afghanistan, there is a certain amount of skittishness about Bush and his foreign policy." That creates a situation where the United States is finding it more difficult to garner support for more NATO troops. But that's not the only reason, he said. There is a widespread belief that the United States has not balanced the use of force in Iraq with reconstruction and assistance. There is a feeling, he said, that the United States has "overmilitarized" the Iraq war, Kupchan said, that there are too many civilian casualties, "that we are dropping too many bombs and not winning over as many hearts and minds." Many NATO countries also are uncomfortable with involvement in a war thousands of miles away. "I think it (Obama's comment) is fair as long as one realizes that's one of several factors when looking at the shortfall of NATO contributions," Kupchan said. "It is one of several issues in play." The British House of Commons' Defence Committee, in a report on British operations in Afghanistan, warned last summer that troop shortages in Afghanistan threatened to undermine the campaign, and that the size of NATO forces should be considerably greater. So Obama is on solid footing when he says more troops are needed in Afghanistan. In a Pentagon news briefing in July 2007, Gen. Dan K. McNeill, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said as much, calling the international military mission "under-resourced." And even a U.S. government report concluded that European criticism of the U.S. war in Iraq has made some NATO countries less willing to commit troops to Afghanistan. While some NATO experts say that is not the only reason, they agree it is a big one. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-10879	"Roadside bombs are responsible for 70 percent of casualties in Iraq and these new mine-resistant vehicles can reduce those casualties by two-thirds."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/20/joe-biden/new-trucks-are-safer-but-how-much/	In the May 23 news release, Biden of Delaware criticized Pentagon delays in approving the deployment of mine-resistant vehicles in Iraq, arguing that the more heavily-armored vehicles could be sparing the lives of U.S. troops. Biden's assertions are based on information from the Department of Defense. In testimony and reports, military officials have said roadside bombs – improvised explosive devices – have caused 70 percent of U.S. casualties. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, told the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a March 2007 letter the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, called MRAPs, "could reduce the casualties in vehicles due to IED attack by as much as 80 percent." Those estimates are based on damages sustained mostly by Humvees, which are commonly used for quick transport but offer little protection from bombs. The trouble with the 80 percent figure is that things are changing rapidly in Iraq. In the past year, military officials have reported that Iraqi insurgents have been using bombs that can pierce the armor of the MRAPs. The stronger bombs have been used in fewer numbers, and it's uncertain how much insurgents will target the new trucks with them, said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org.

pomt-09395	Marco Rubio "supported $800,000 for AstroTurf for a field where he played flag football."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/24/charlie-crist/crist-accuses-rubio-supporting-money-his-football-/	In their battle for the Republican nomination U.S. Senate, Gov. Charlie Crist and former House Speaker Marco Rubio are accusing each other of supporting wasteful spending. Rubio cites Crist's support of the economic stimulus, while Crist says Rubio supported political pork. On Crist's campaign Web site, under the heading "Despite Promises, Speaker Rubio's Shocking Lack of Fiscal Conservatism," Crist's campaign accuses Rubio of "earmarks." One example: "Rubio Supported $800,000 for AstroTurf for a field where he played flag football." Rubio, described in several news articles as an avid flag football fan, played with the South Florida Sports League -- the same group that requested state money in 2007 while Rubio was House speaker. Crist's claim raises questions about what role Rubio had in the legislative funding that was vetoed by Crist. Ultimately, the project was never built. We'll focus on two questions: Did Rubio support the project? And would it have provided $800,000 for AstroTurf where Rubio played flag football? First, some details about the project. The money was supposed to go to a joint project between a sports league and the city of South Miami for a plan to build several multi-use fields and buildings for programs to help at-risk youth. The total cost of the project was $1,050,000 and the proposal asked for $800,000 in state funds. The sponsors were State Rep. Mitch Needelman, R-Melbourne, and State Sen. Alex Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami. The line-item, No. 1239, made it into the house's budget bill and the conference bill. It doesn't mention the fields or turf explicity. It just lists the $800,000 for the South Florida Sports League under the heading "LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES TO REDUCE AND PREVENT JUVENILE CRIME FROM GENERAL REVENUE FUND." Rubio, along with the majority of legislators, voted "yes" on both on the House bill and the final version. And we should note that Rubio was not a rank-and-file legislator: he had power over the budget as the House Speaker. We turned to Steve Geller, a retired Senate Democratic leader, to summarize that power since he has no stake in the fight between Rubio and Crist. "Obviously I have no knowledge of what Marco individually did here,'' Geller said. "What I can tell you is that the House Speaker has absolute power to direct the appropriations staff, subcommittee chairs or appropriations chair to put in the appropriation or take it out. ... If the speaker said 'put it in', it's in, if he said 'take it out,' it's out. ... One of perks of being speaker or president is you get to put money places." Still, as far as we could find, there had been no reference to artificial fields in news articles when the budget was approved. The first mention didn't come until two weeks after the final vote, when the Miami Herald published an article about earmarks in the budget. "You like football?,'' the article stated. "You'll be happy to know that in the new $72 billion state budget, there's $800,000 to pay for new synthetic football fields in Miami." A list of "Member Issues by Appropriation and Project" created by Gov. Crist's office mentions that, "these funds would provide the astro-turf for the fields." But that update, too, was dated after the votes -- May 17, 2007. Alberto Martinez, a spokesman for Rubio's campaign, said the project wasn't billed as turf for football fields when legislators voted on it. "Members, including Rubio who voted for this appropriation as contained in the budget, were voting not for "800,000 for astroturf," but rather for a new facility for "at-risk youths and young adults in a tri-county area...offering services and programs to participants ranging from sports and recreational activities to education about healthy, drug-free, and alcohol-free living," Martinez said. Although the project became linked to Rubio in news accounts and editorials, we couldn't find any evidence he was a driving force behind the earmark. Needelman, who was chairman of the juvenile justice committee at the time, told PolitiFact Florida that it was his idea to put the money in the budget. "Marco has never talked to me one on one on this at all,'' said Needelman, who is supporting Rubio for Senate. Guillermo Chacon, executive director of the sports league, said he never spoke with his friend Rubio about this proposal. "Our business dealings were always with Needelman (and) Diaz de la Portilla,'' Chacon said. "We never had a contact with Mr. Rubio." So, to recap: Rubio voted for the state budget bill, both the original and the conference version that was reconciled with the Senate. So in that regard, he supported the project, although we couldn't find evidence that it was referred to as "turf" at the time of the April 11 and May 3 votes. As for whether it would have provided $800,000 for AstroTurf on a field where Rubio played flag football, we'll take the last part first. Rubio's campaign confirmed that he played flag football in the South Florida Sports League. But a campaign spokesman told us that the appropriation was not specific enough to confirm Crist's statement because the league used several fields at different locations. Still, we're satisfied Crist is right on this point. We asked Chacon if Rubio had played at this specific site in South Miami where the project was slated and he said Rubio had. Now, to the question of turf. Crist claims the money would be used for "AstroTurf," a brand name so well-known that it's often used as a synonym for artificial turf. And that term was used by the governor's office in the 2007 "Member Issues by Appropriation and Project." News accounts and editorials used different words to describe the field material. The Orlando Sentinel used the more generic term: "Rubio lost several Miami-Dade County projects he had tucked into the budget, including $800,000 for new artificial-turf football fields for the South Florida Sports League." Chacon did suggest some sort of artificial material in a Miami Herald article May 20, 2007: ''Hopefully we will get a very nice park where the kids can play year-around,'' said Willie Chacon, executive director of the league, who said the group is going to install synthetic fields because "there's no natural grass facility that could sustain so much sports programming.'' Finally, let's examine Crist's claim. He said Rubio "supported $800,000 for Astroturf for a field where he played flag football." There's no proof that Rubio was the prime sponsor, but he voted for the bill, which in our view is "support." And yes, it was $800,000. But it was one of hundreds of items in a giant $71.9 billion budget bill and the bill didn't specify it was for artificial turf. It wasn't until later news accounts that the turf came to light. It's conceivable that Rubio knew it was for turf -- indeed, using Geller's account of the Speaker's power, you might think he did. But there's no proof. So we find the claim Half True.

pomt-04608	Based on the August 2012 national jobs numbers, "for every person who got a job, nearly four people stopped looking for a job."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/19/paul-ryan/ryan-says-four-times-many-people-quit-job-hunting-/	The latest Labor Department jobs report, issued Sept. 7, 2012, was another disappointment: Only 96,000 jobs added nationwide. That was below the projections from various economists that 125,000 jobs would be added. The report, which was issued one day after the Democratic National Convention, became The Story for the presidential campaign -- at least for that day. In an interview with CNBC, Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, blamed President Barack Obama for the state of employment. "This is not even close to what a recovery looks like," Ryan said. Ryan noted that there must be 150,000 jobs created just to keep in pace with population growth, and blamed "bad fiscal policy" from the Obama administration for the disappointing results. Then he offered this observation: "For every person who got a job, nearly four people stopped looking for a job." Now that makes it all sound even more discouraging. Is Ryan right? The Labor Department report report said that 12.5 million people were out of work in August, a number that was little changed from the previous month. But the figure Ryan seized upon is less-noticed. It’s the labor force participation rate and its monthly fluctuations are seen by some as a barometer about how the unemployed are viewing their job prospects. If they’re discouraged enough, they drop out of the labor force and report that they are not only unemployed but not actively seeking work. That, in turn, affects the unemployment rate, which in August dropped from 8.3 to 8.1 percent. In other words, the way the unemployment rate is tallied, it could fall even if no one found a new job, and instead more people stopped looking. It also does not count people who, for instance, go back to college for more training to get a better job. In August, the labor force participation declined by 0.2 percent, or about 370,000 people, the Labor Department reported. And that’s the number at the center of Ryan’s claim. His statement notes that the increase in the number of people who have a job (96,000) is about a fourth of the number of people who dropped out of the labor force. Ryan repeated the statement Sept, 9, 2012 on CBS’ "Face the Nation". It’s an unconventional way to parse the monthly report, but other Republican leaders and conservative pundits have used a similar approach. "This has been a pattern throughout the recession," James Sherk of the Heritage Foundation wrote on The Hill.com blog on Sept 10, 2012. "Labor force participation rates have fallen 2.5 percentage points, to 63.5 percent, since December 2007. That is the lowest rate since 1981-- a time when far fewer women worked. " Sherk concluded that the adult male work force has hit an all-time low of 72.7 percent, a fifth of which is due to factors such as the retirement of Baby Boomers. "The poor economy has caused the rest," he said. Others economists have said retirements have played a larger role -- that people are retiring rather than simply giving up on a job hunt. The Huffington Post quoted a Barclays Capital economist Michael Gapen as saying the bank didn’t expect the participation rate to rebound "any time soon and its decline is mainly driven by the ageing (sic) of the population and the exit of the baby boomers from the labor market." "Therefore, the decline in the unemployment rate is not reflective of underlying strength in employment in this report, " Gapen said. In March 2011, the Congressional Budget Office said the retirement of Baby Boomers "will cause the potential labor force participation rate to decline throughout the next decade." While Ryan’s numbers check out, we feel it’s important to note -- even if Ryan didn’t -- that both the jobs numbers and the unemployment numbers are only estimates. Indeed, on the jobs side, we have previously noted the monthly numbers can change dramatically by the time the next quarterly census -- a more complete look at all jobs -- is completed. Our rating Ryan said four times as many people gave up working in August 2012 than found a job. He’s highlighting a couple of figures from the Labor Department’s monthly report, and notes that one figure is four times as high as the other. What he doesn’t say, of course, is that both figures are estimates and subject to revision. And he doesn’t account for another key factor: Baby Boomers are retiring.

pomt-12327	Says Barack Obama complained that Democrats continue to ignore blacks except at election time.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/19/great-america-alliance/Attack-ad-Obama-book-turn-blacks-Dems-Georgia/	In the most expensive congressional race ever, outside groups are making a final push to move the needle in what’s expected to be a very close contest between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff in a suburban district north of Atlanta. Great America Alliance, a pro-Trump organization, lofted a radio ad aimed at cutting African-American turnout for Ossoff. In the ad, black conservative Autry Pruitt warned African-Americans against being taken for granted by Democrats, using the words of the first black president to make his point. Here’s the text: "Hi, my name is Autry Pruitt, a fellow black American working hard every day, just like you. It may seem out of season, but all of a sudden, Democratic politicians have started coming around again. We normally only see them every other November, swarming around and making promises to get our vote. But nothing ever changes for us, does it? Here's what President Barack Obama had to say about it:" Obama: "A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey." "Let's not sell out for another Christmas turkey. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The Democrats keep taking our votes for granted." Did Obama really complain that Democratic politicians only pay attention to African-Americans when they need their votes? No. The voice is Obama’s, but the words were not his. They came from Obama reading from his book Dreams From My Father about his first days in Chicago. He’s quoting a barber named Smitty talking about Chicago’s first black mayor, Harold Washington. A sentence before the book excerpt that appeared in the radio ad gives those words a different meaning. Smitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington. Here’s how the scene plays in the book: "Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city," Smitty said. "Before Harold, seemed like we’d always be second-class citizens." "Plantation politics," the man with the newspaper said. "That’s just what it was, too," Smitty said. "A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and we’d reward ‘em with the vote." In the book, Obama went on to describe the power of African-Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified. "They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded," Obama wrote. In Smitty’s words, "When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life." In contrast to the suggested meaning in the ad, the passage is about the good things that come from voting. Through a Great America Alliance spokesman, Pruitt rejected the idea that he had cited Obama out of context. "The clip of President Obama was absolutely in context on this issue and helps make our point in the ad, which is why we used it," Pruitt said. Our ruling Great America Alliance said that Obama complained that Democrats continue to ignore blacks except at election time. Obama did say the words used in the ad, but they weren’t his. He was quoting a Chicago barber talking about the days before African-Americans in Chicago helped elect the city’s first black mayor. The full text from Obama’s book shows that he was arguing that voting can make a difference. Nothing in the section suggests that he thinks Democrats today only pay attention to blacks at election time. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-03831	U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell "wants gun owners in a federal registration system."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/mar/18/national-association-gun-rights/national-association-gun-rights-says-rep-scott-rig/	U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd, is being targeted by a pro-gun group for supporting for "Obama’s gun control." The National Association for Gun Rights aired an ad in Hampton Roads earlier this month criticizing Rigell for co-sponsoring legislation that would increase penalties for people who illegally purchase firearms or transport them across state lines. "Rigell also wants gun owners in a federal registration system," the ad said. We wondered whether Rigell, who boasts a pro-gun background, really has endorsed a federal gun registry. The congressman, in a news release, dismissed the charge as "laughable." The group is headquartered in Fredericksburg and bills itself as the "fastest growing guns right group in America." We made three requests to the association for information that would back up its claim about Rigell. No one got back to us. So we poked around on our own. Let’s start with a little background. The federal government since 1986 has been explicitly forbidden from keeping a registration system connecting most firearms to their owners. Even when Congress passed legislation in 1993 that instituted the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, it did not allow the government to keep information about firearm purchasers in order to build a data base. In the wake of shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut last December that left 20 children and six teachers dead, President Barack Obama made a series of proposals to strengthen gun laws. One of them calls for expanding background checks, which now apply to people who buy guns from licensed dealers. Obama says people who buy arms from private individuals should also be checked out. Rigell has said in at least two interviews that he would be willing to consider proposals for expanded or universal background checks. The National Rifle Association, the most influential of guns rights organizations, claims the president’s support of universal background checks is tantamount to creating a federal registry. The NRA argues that expanding the checks will create a slippery slope that will lead to the registry. FactCheck.org said in January that "it’s simply not accurate to suggest that Obama’s plan for universal background checks would result in a massive federal registry." They pointed out that Congress, since 2004, has inserted language in annual spending bills requiring the FBI to destroy firearm transfer records within 24 hours of approval of the sales. Obama’s gun control agenda also includes a limit on the number of bullets a magazine can hold, an assault weapons ban and more support for mental health care. But none of the 23 proposals calls for a federal registry. Some Democratic members of Congress, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, have introduced bills that would create gun registries. Rigell has vowed to oppose the measures. "As a gun owner, hunter and lifetime member of the NRA, I have not and will not support legislation which establishes in any form a national registry of guns or gun owners," he said on Feb. 28. That’s consistent with a statement Rigell posted on his campaign website in 2010, when he was first elected to Congress. "Federal licensing of law-abiding gun owners and national gun registration would violate our Second Amendment rights," he wrote. Rigell, as we’ve noted, did co-sponsor a gun bill earlier this year that would increase the federal penalties for straw purchasers -- people who buy weapons for those who cannot pass background checks -- and for runners who transport guns across state lines. But the bill makes no mention of a federal registry. Our ruling The National Association for Gun Rights claims that Rigell wants a national gun registration system. The record shows he has consistently opposed that idea. The association offers no proof for its claim, which is wrong and inflammatory. It’s only fitting that we set the association’s Pants on Fire.

pomt-03756	Says that even if his budget is adopted, private schools in the choice program would be getting about half the per-pupil funds that public schools receive	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/07/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-choice-schools-would-get-onl/	Stumping for his proposal to expand school choice as an "alternative to failing schools," Gov. Scott Walker threw down a challenge to what he called five common myths about choice. Under the heading, "Myth #1", Walker said in a March 22, 2013 news release: "Choice schools are getting more money than public schools." "Not even close," the release continued. "Public schools in Wisconsin receive, on average, $12,775 per pupil in total funds. Under Gov. Walker’s budget, choice schools will get about half of that per student." A flashpoint in Walker’s proposed two-year budget would boost per-pupil state aid to some choice schools by 9.4 percent in 2014-’15. Others would see payments boosted by 21.9 percent. Overall public school revenues, by contrast, would be frozen. Can it be true that even after those increases, choice schools still would get about half what public schools get in funds per pupil? Let’s check the numbers. For the public schools, Walker got the $12,775 revenue figure from the latest available U.S. Census report on public education finance. It reflects primarily state aid to schools, local property taxes, and federal funding. But that report covers 2009-’10, before Walker cut education aid and limited what schools could raise in property taxes. A more recent such tally, by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, put the figure somewhat lower, at $12,376 for 2011-’12. What’s the comparison figure? For the choice schools, Walker did not mention a figure, but the numbers are readily available in his budget proposal. He would increase state aid to kindergarten-through-eighth-grade voucher schools to $7,050 per pupil (up from the current $6,442) in the 2014-'15 school year, theJournal Sentinel reported. For voucher high schools, the per-pupil aid would rise to $7,856. There are mismatches galore in the comparison years here, but we can still draw some conclusions. If we assume that total revenues for public schools hold at the 2012 level, the choice schools would be getting 57 to 63 percent of what public schools get, depending on whether they are a K-8 or high school. And if we assume revenues hold at the 2010 number Walker cited, it’s 55 to 61 percent. So, pretty close to "about half" for the K-8 choice schools -- but much closer to two-thirds for the high schools. There are other caveats regarding Walker’s methodology. The public school revenue figure he used is accurate, and it has the virtue of being comprehensive in pulling in the three major funding sources. The Census data is widely cited. "What the governor said is an accurate reflection of the cost to the average resident," his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, told us. But there are flaws inherent in this approach because he’s comparing two different types of funding systems. Every researcher we consulted warned that comparisons between public and choice school funding can produce different conclusions depending on how the comparisons are set up. In this case, the broad revenue figure Walker mentions for public schools includes sources that also help choice schools -- but are not reflected in the choice-school number. Left out on the choice side of the equation, for example, is what choice schools collect in fees from parents for a whole range of school-related items. It’s also worth noting that some federal dollars that flow, for example, through Milwaukee Public Schools actually go toward helping transport and support choice students. So the funds show up as revenue to MPS even though a portion is essentially in-kind revenue for choice schools. So it’s an apples to oranges comparison to some extent, though precisely how much is unknown because we don’t have budget details for private schools. "Only with comparable expense data could we more definitively get at this," said education researcher Anneliese Dickman, research director at the Public Policy Forum in Milwaukee. There’s no way now to make the comparison perfect, but one preferred method would be comparing the choice payment to what public schools get from local property taxes and general state aids, we heard from researchers or other officials at DPI, the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance and School Choice Wisconsin. By that counting method, choice funding would be within 75 percent of the public school level. Another method would put the choice funding in between the Walker method and this one. Last point. Milwaukee provides by far the most students in the choice program, and there’s only one other city included right now, Racine. So, it’s "somewhat misleading" to compare the choice payments in Milwaukee to a state (public school) average, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization. Using the method we heard was preferred (counting local property taxes and general aids), choice in Milwaukee would be at 70 to 80 percent of the Milwaukee Public Schools number. Under Walker’s method, city choice schools would get half or very close to half of what their public counterparts receive. Our rating Walker said that even after the aid increases in his proposed budget, choice schools would be getting "about half" the per-pupil funds that public schools receive. He’s pretty close for some schools but not others based on his method of comparison, but off considerably based on a method preferred by researchers as a more accurate comparison. On the Truth-O-Meter, there’s a spot for claims that are partially accurate but leave out important details or takes things out of context. That’s Half True. And we think it fits here.

pomt-02731	The Murray-Ryan deal "is the first divided-government budget agreement since 1986."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/19/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-said-bipartisan-budget-deal-first-di/	Lawmakers and pundits heralded the recent agreement on federal spending reached between House Republicans and Senate Democrats as a rare, bipartisan accord between a deeply divided Congress. Some went so far as to suggest that it was historic, including Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican and chief budget negotiator for the GOP. "This is the first divided-government budget agreement since 1986," Ryan told reporters Dec. 10, 2013, when announcing the deal alongside Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. The deal has since passed the House and Senate. We knew that recent Congresses have clashed on federal spending over the years, but was it really almost three decades since two parties came together to cut a deal? Let’s take a trip down memory lane. Budgets 101 First, a brief explainer on the agreement. The legislation Ryan and Murray hammered out averts a government shutdown in January 2014 by funding federal agencies and providing some relief from the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester. The sequester cuts are unpopular among many Democrats and some Republicans because the cuts slash discretionary spending, including defense, in an across-the-board fashion, rather than allowing lawmakers the ability to cut less-crucial programs and save more urgent ones. The agreement also raises some fees on air travel, requires federal workers to contribute more to their pensions, and decreases retirement benefits for veterans younger than 62. Under the agreement, budget caps for discretionary spending are set at $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. For 2014, that figure is $45 billion more than it would have been under sequestration, and it’s $18 billion more for 2015. Also notable — and often unexplained in media accounts — is that the bill includes language that serves the purpose of a "budget resolution," an annual fiscal blueprint agreed to by both chambers. A budget resolution provides a general outline of spending, taxation and deficit reduction. While passage of a budget resolution is not mandatory, it can be valuable to lawmakers by easing the process of passing spending bills. The president does not sign it. Typically, if a budget resolution is passed, it happens relatively early during a congressional session, and it is passed independently of spending bills. But due to partisan battling, that didn’t happen this year; to rectify this, the spending bill belatedly included language that made it like a budget resolution as well as a spending bill. Divided government vs. divided Congress We contacted Ryan’s staff the day after he made the comment we’re checking, and they offered a key clarification: They said Ryan had meant to say it was "the last time a budget resolution was adopted while Congress was controlled by opposing parties was 1986." This is an important distinction. Divided government means that each major party controls one of the following three entities: the presidency, the House of Representatives or the Senate. By contrast, a divided Congress means that one party controls one chamber of Congress and the other controls the other chamber. Both scenarios mean that the levers of power are divided between the parties, but divided government is much more common than a divided Congress in recent history, so whether you use one phrasing or the other leads to a different outcome. We’ll look at both here. We should add that Ryan has used both formulations. On Dec. 12, for instance, ABC quoted him saying: "This is the first time, with a divided Congress, that we’ve had a budget agreement since 1986, when both houses were controlled by the other parties." The following chart outlines control of each chamber of Congress and the presidency since 1986. Congress Year House control Senate control President control 99th 1985-87 Democratic Republican Republican 100th 1987-89 Democratic Democratic Republican 101st 1989-91 Democratic Democratic Republican 102nd 1991-93 Democratic Democratic Republican 103rd 1993-95 Democratic Democratic Democratic 104th 1995-97 Republican Republican Democratic 105th 1997-99 Republican Republican Democratic 106th 1999-2001 Republican Republican Democratic 107th 2001-03 Republican Republican/ Democratic Republican 108th 2003-05 Republican Republican Republican 109th 2005-07 Republican Republican Republican 110th 2007-09 Democratic Democratic Republican 111th 2009-11 Democratic Democratic Democratic 112th 2011-13 Republican Democratic Democratic 113th 2013-15 Republican Democratic Democratic As the chart shows, the usual state of affairs has been for the same party to control both chambers of Congress. Since 1986, the only exceptions are the two annual sessions of the 112th Congress, the first session of the 113th, and the second session of the 107th Congress, when a mid-session party switch tipped the Senate from Republican to Democratic control at a time when the House was in GOP hands. (That change occurred on May 24, 2001, which was after the Senate agreed to a budget resolution for the first session.) Here’s a cross-tabulation of party control in Congress with the passage of a budget from 1986 to 2013. Party control Passed budget Failed to pass budget Unified Congress and president 6 3 President of one party, Congress unified under other party 13 1 Divided Congress 2 3 So, if you analyze Ryan’s words literally, he’s wrong: There are actually 15 instances since 1986 in which "divided government" produced a budget agreement, 13 with a unified Congress in opposition to the president and two with a divided Congress. On the other hand, if you cut him some slack and rate his claim based on the term "divided Congress," he’s right -- but it’s also not all that enlightening, since there have been just four annual sessions of Congress that have occurred under divided control during the past 28 years. In 2002, with the House controlled by Republicans and the Senate run by Democrats for most of the year, no budget resolution was agreed to. The Republican House and Democratic Senate also failed to reach an accord in 2011 and 2012. Roy Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County and a former analyst at the Congressional Budget Office, agreed that Ryan’s point is correct but doesn’t mean much. He added that the wider understanding of the term "divided government" is a split in control between Congress and the White House -- something that doesn’t matter in evaluating budget resolutions, since they only need Congress’ approval, not the president’s. Meyers also emphasized that just because one party controls both chambers of Congress doesn’t guarantee a budget resolution will be passed. Republicans controlled Congress in 1998, 2004 and 2006 but didn’t pass a budget. Democrats also failed in 2010 despite running the House and Senate. Patrick Griffin, an American University government professor who worked in legislative affairs for President Bill Clinton, added that the final spending bills are more important than the budget resolution, anyway. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton, he said, all had budget battles with the opposing party controlling Congress, and this made the final pact more powerful once the White House gave its blessing. "For (a budget resolution) to have consequence, it has to involve all the institutions," Griffin said. Our ruling At the initial news conference, Ryan said the current deal "is the first divided-government budget agreement since 1986." He later clarified his statement to note it’s actually the first one "with a divided Congress" since 1986. The first claim is wrong -- there are actually more than a dozen instances since 1986 in which "divided government" produced a budget agreement. And while the second version of Ryan's claim is right, it's not very significant, since Congress has been under divided-party control for just four years out of the past 28. On balance, we rate Ryan’s claim Mostly False.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2013-12-19T12:45:35	2013-12-10	['None']

pomt-13711	"When LBJ started #WarOnPoverty, 14% of Americans lived in poverty. 50 yrs later, 14% still do. There's a #BetterWay."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2016/jul/28/john-shimkus/shimkus-shortens-war-poverty-make-point/	Few things in American politics have been more hotly and consistently argued in the last half-century than the legacy of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty. In a 1986 speech on welfare reform, President Ronald Reagan took several jabs at Johnson’s initiative, saying: "[When] the famous War on Poverty was declared... a funny thing happened. Poverty, as measured by dependency, stopped shrinking and then actually began to grow worse. I guess you could say, poverty won the war." Today, the bipartisan debate continues. Democrats and Republicans argue whether welfare programs work and if the poverty rate actually shrank since Johnson declared the War on Poverty. On June 7, U.S. Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., tweeted: Shimkus was promoting House Speaker Paul Ryan’s "A Better Way" agenda that looks at, among other things, poverty and welfare reform. But just as America has changed since the Johnson administration, so has the way the government measures poverty. Does Shimkus take those changes into consideration in his tweet? We decided to investigate his claims about the nation’s poverty record and how much it has changed since the War on Poverty was declared. First off, what is poverty? Every year the United States Census Bureau updates the thresholds it uses to define the official poverty rate. The thresholds help the Bureau when it gathers statistics for its annual report on income and poverty. Here are the key things to know about those thresholds: Using the Consumer Price index, thresholds are updated based on the country’s inflation rate. The same poverty calculation is used across the country regardless of a person’s location, which means the same criteria is used for a person living in New York City or Peoria. The Bureau looks at income before taxes and doesn’t include non-cash benefits like public housing, Medicaid and food stamps. In 2010, the Census Bureau also started producing the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which takes into account place of residence, government benefits and necessary expenses like taxes. The SPM offers another perspective on poverty, calculating the factors missed in the official poverty report. (See a side-by-side comparison of the SPM and official rates here.) A deeper dive into poverty Shimkus press secretary Jordan Haverly told PolitiFact Illinois that Shimkus pulled the data for his tweet from page 5 of the "A Better Way" guide, which shows an overview of the welfare system. The graph below shows the data in the "A Better Way" guide is consistent to that of the Census Bureau. The vertical stripes in the charts represent periods of recession. "A Better Way," Page 5 Shimkus' tweet says that 14 percent of Americans lived in poverty at the dawn of the War on Poverty and 14 percent still do. It’s meant to show the country’s poverty situation hasn’t made much progress more than five decades after the declaration after the War on Poverty began. A surface-level look into the Census Bureau data from 1966 to 2014 backs that claim. However, many researchers consider the methods used by the Bureau to be outdated, and say its studies do not accurately reflect the poverty rate in the United States. If given the option, 90 percent of academics and researchers would favor a move away from the reliance on the official poverty rate data, according to Timothy Smeeding, the Lee Rainwater Distinguished Professor of Public Affairs and Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Smeeding said because the Supplemental Poverty Measure takes into account government contributions when determining whether a person is poor, it’s better for tracking the number of poverty-stricken people in the country than the official rate. "The SPM is a measurement that takes a look at all the things we think are important, all the things we spend money on," Smeeding said. "The official rate doesn’t make a lot of sense. But if you want to say the War on Poverty is a failure, then take a look at the official numbers." Smeeding said politicians are often more comfortable with the official rate, especially if their state gets a lot of government funding because of it. "No politician would ever pitch a move to the SPM because it might mean the state’s poverty level would decrease and they would get less money," Smeeding said. A 2013 study by Columbia University backs that claim. Researchers found if the Bureau incorporated government programs into the official poverty rate, the rate would have significantly decreased over time. Using historical data, the Columbia researchers found the poverty rate would have fallen from 26 percent in 1967 to 16 percent in 2012 if the Bureau used the SPM. Shimkus’ tweet only uses the Census Bureau’s data. The numbers and Shimkus’ wording Shimkus said the poverty rate was 14 percent when Johnson declared the War on Poverty, and the poverty rate was still 14 percent 50 years later. The wording could be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the history of the War on Poverty. First, Shimkus’ tweet implies Johnson started the War on Poverty exactly 50 years ago. Johnson actually declared the War on Poverty in 1964 during his State of the Union Address, which was 52 years ago. Second, in 1966 the poverty rate was 14 percent, but at the time of Johnson’s 1964 address, the poverty rate was 19 percent. Our ruling Shimkus said, "When LBJ started #WarOnPoverty, 14% of Americans lived in poverty. 50 years later, 14 percent still do. There’s a #BetterWay Shimkus isn’t wrong saying the current poverty rate is 14 percent, according to the most recent data. But the figures in his tweet come from a measurement standard most researchers regard as obsolete. A more accurate and widely-accepted gauge of poverty is the Supplemental Poverty Measure, though neither Shimkus’ tweet nor House Speaker Ryan’s "A Better Way" acknowledge it. There’s also a problem with Shimkus’ timeframe. The War on Poverty began in 1964, but the tweet implies it dates only to 1966. Even using the obsolete Census Bureau "poverty rate" measure, there’s a 5 percentage point difference between 1964’s 19 percent and the 14 percent figure of 50 years ago in 1966.

pomt-00961	Says award-winning Milwaukee Public Schools teacher Megan Sampson was laid off because Gov. Scott Walker cut state aid to education.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/17/gail-collins/columnist-gail-collins-blames-gov-scott-walker-tea/	Gov. Scott Walker brought the story of Megan Sampson, the first-year teacher who in 2010 lost her job in the Milwaukee Public Schools, back into the news. Now it’s Walker critics who are keeping it there. In a Jan. 24, 2015 appearance at an early 2016 presidential event in Iowa, Walker told the audience Sampson -- the "outstanding teacher of the year in my state" -- lost her job because of seniority provisions in the school district’s contract with the teachers’ union. (We rated that claim Half True: Sampson was laid off under the provisions of the contract, but her award was for first-year English teachers in the district, not all teachers.) In a Feb. 15, 2015 column titled "Scott Walker needs an eraser", Gail Collins of the New York Times cited the story in criticizing Walker’s education policies. One problem: The calendar. In the piece, Collins noted Walker’s mistake in calling Sampson teacher of the year and wrote: "All of that came as a distinct surprise to Claudia Felske, a member of the faculty at East Troy High School who actually was named a Wisconsin Teacher of the Year in 2010. In a phone interview, Felske said she still remembers when she got the news at a ‘surprise pep assembly at my school.’ As well as the fact that those layoffs happened because Walker cut state aid to education." The last part caught our attention -- and that of others as well. In short, Walker’s policies had nothing to do with Sampson’s layoff in 2010. At the time, he was in the midst of his successful campaign, but did not take office until January 2011. Rather, MPS laid off a total of 482 teachers in June 2010 in response to a severe budget shortfall, in part tied to declining enrollment. Collins didn’t respond to an email, but the Times posted a correction Feb. 15, 2015. "An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that teacher layoffs in Milwaukee in 2010 happened because Gov. Scott Walker "cut state aid to education." The layoffs were made by the city’s school system because of a budget shortfall, before Mr. Walker took office in 2011," the correction said. Our rating Collins said Gov. Scott Walker’s policies were to blame for Milwaukee Public Schools teacher Megan Sampson being laid off. But Sampson lost her job in June 2010, six months before Walker took office.

pomt-10286	On torture.	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/18/john-mccain/mccain-consistently-opposed-to-torture/	Google "McCain and flip flop and torture" and you'll get hundreds of thousands of page hits, just one indication that Sen. John McCain has been hammered for supposedly wavering on the issue. For years, McCain has been one of the most powerful voices in Congress advocating against torture; a position informed by his personal experiences at the hands of the North Vietnamese during 5 years as a prisoner of war. He repeatedly stood up to the Bush administration, opposing such controversial practices as waterboarding as cruel and inhumane. The Bush administration argued that waterboarding is legal under certain circumstances and the Central Intelligence Agency publicly acknowledged waterboarding three people since Sept. 11, 2001 (including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, thought to be the mastermind behind the attacks). In 2005, in the wake of abuses at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and other U.S.-controlled facilities, McCain championed an amendment that required the military to abide by the Army Field Manual, which specifically forbids waterboarding, as well as other actions: forcing a detainee to perform sexual acts or pose sexually, placing hoods over the heads of detainees, threatening detainees with dogs, or using temperature extremes to cause physical trauma, among other things. Although the CIA was not limited to those specific techniques, McCain argued the CIA had to abide by a prohibition against cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment as per the international convention of torture. And McCain has consistently spoken out against torture during his run for president. "Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be unsure. It is a horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and being used on Buddhist monks as we speak," McCain said after a campaign stop in Iowa in October 2007. "People who have worn the uniform and had the experience know that this is a terrible and odious practice and should never be condoned in the U.S. We are a better nation than that." At a Republican debate in St. Petersburg, Fla., in November 2007, McCain again was clear in his conviction that waterboarding and other extreme interrogation techniques are in violation of the Geneva Convention, "it's in violation of existing law." "And again, I would hope that we would understand, my friends, that life is not 24 and Jack Bauer. Life is interrogation techniques which are humane and yet effective," McCain said. "And I just came back from visiting a prison in Iraq. The Army general there said that techniques under the Army Field Manual are working and working effectively, and he didn't think they need to do anything else. "My friends, this is what America is all about. This is a defining issue and, clearly, we should be able, if we want to be commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces, to take a definite and positive position on, and that is, we will never allow torture to take place in the United States of America." With such strong convictions on the issue, many human rights activists were disappointed when, in February, McCain voted against a bill that would have limited the CIA to following the techniques outlined in the Army Field Manual as well. The bill passed anyway, but President Bush vetoed it. A number of McCain's opponents, as well as a few newspaper editorial boards, accused McCain of flip-flopping. But did he? McCain said he opposed the measure on the grounds that the CIA should not have to follow the same guidelines as the Army, and it should have the flexibility to use valid techniques not mentioned in the field manual. "None of those techniques would entail violating the Detainee Treatment Act, which said that cruel, inhumane and degrading treatments are prohibited," he told reporters in February, defending his vote. Tom Malinowski, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, said he disagreed with McCain's vote and believes "it put us in a position where we will have to wait until January to definitively end the country's experiment with torture." "At the same time," Malinowski said, "I don't think he's been inconsistent." McCain has never formally supported applying the Army Field Manual to the CIA, Malinowski said. "It undermined a cause he profoundly believes in," Malinowski said. "But I don't question his commitment to the cause." McCain has continued to speak unequivocally in opposition to torture, as he did in a foreign policy speech in March. "America must be a model citizen if we want others to look to us as a model," McCain said. "How we behave at home affects how we are perceived abroad. We must fight the terrorists and at the same time defend the rights that are the foundation of our society. We can't torture or treat inhumanely suspected terrorists we have captured." Sounds like the same tune to us. Some may argue that McCain missed a pragmatic opportunity in February to achieve his aim of preventing the CIA from waterboarding — or that he buckled to the administration in an election year. But we think voting against a measure to limit the interrogation techniques of the CIA to those used by the military — a position he held even back in 2005 — is not the same as endorsing waterboarding or torture. We give McCain a No Flip on torture.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-18T00:00:00	2008-08-18	['None']
pomt-10953	"Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/24/blog-posting/did-republicans-vote-make-it-legal-nationwide-ban-/	A story drawing eyeballs on social media said Republicans approved a measure that, if implemented, would allow child welfare providers to deny same-sex couples seeking to adopt. "Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting," said a July 12, 2018, headline from LGBTQ Nation, an online magazine. The headline choice leaves out important details that could give readers the wrong impression. The amendment would not establish a nationwide ban making it impossible for same-sex couples to adopt. Instead, it would allow individual child welfare providers to create their own adoption criteria — a change that would increase the potential for discrimination against gays and lesbians but would not constitute an outright ban nationwide. And the reference to "Republicans" refers to one House committee. The proposal is not yet law. Here's what happened. The U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee voted on a measure related to adoption by same-sex couples July 11 during a markup of a funding bill for the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., introduced an amendment prohibiting the federal government, or any state or local entity receiving federal funds, from taking action against child welfare providers that refuse to provide services to certain customers due to "sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions." If installed, the Aderholt amendment would enable child welfare providers to discriminate when recruiting adoptive parents, promoting and facilitating adoptions, and supporting adoptive families. In a public statement, Aderholt made specific reference to child welfare providers that turn down same-sex families hoping to adopt. "Several states and localities across the country are not allowing religious organizations, such as Catholic Charities and Bethany Christian Services, to operate child welfare agencies," Aderholt said. "The reason for this is simply because these organizations, based on religious conviction, choose not to place children with same-sex couples." He added: "The amendment I introduced seeks to prevent these governments from discriminating against child welfare providers on the basis that the provider declines to provide a service that conflicts with its sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions." Aderholt’s amendment also includes language requiring HHS to withhold 15 percent of federal funds allocated for child welfare services from states and localities that do take action against providers that refuse services on the basis of religious beliefs. The amendment was approved by a vote of 29 to 23, with all 22 Democrats and one Republican voting to strike it. Several Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have voiced disapproval for the amendment, calling it a "license to discriminate." Bil Browning, managing editor at LGBTQ Nation, said the amendment is part of a larger trend. "This year alone, Kansas, Georgia and Oklahoma have passed legislation that would allow adoption agencies to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples," Browning said. "In Kansas and Oklahoma, the Republican governors signed the legislation into law." Still, the full funding bill will have to pass both the House and Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump before the amendment will enter into effect. Other headlines about what happened were more accurate. CNN wrote, for instance, "Adoption agencies could refuse same-sex couples under measure OK'd by House panel." Our ruling A headline said, "Republicans vote to make it legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting." The amendment is not an absolute ban on same-sex adoption, despite the headline's implication for casual readers. Republicans in a House committee approved an amendment that would make it illegal nationwide for states and localities to punish child welfare providers that refuse to place children with same-sex couples because of religious beliefs or moral convictions. But it has not yet been taken up by either chamber of Congress. Theoretically, the amendment would allow child welfare providers to implement official or de facto bans on same-sex adoption without fear of retribution. At the same time, states and localities could also choose to continue taking action against discriminating child welfare providers in spite of a 15 percent cut to their federal funding. LGBTQ Nation’s claim that the amendment would make it "legal nationwide to ban gays and lesbians from adopting" is therefore slightly misleading, because the full effect of the amendment would depend on the responses of individual states and localities, as well as the number of agencies that elect to discriminate in their provision of services.

pomt-11082	"Crime in Germany is way up."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-crime-germany/	President Donald Trump regularly tells Americans that people seeking to enter the United States without permission bring crime and violence with them. In a morning tweet, Trump said Germany faces the same risk. "The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition," Trump tweeted June 18. "Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com We looked at whether crime in Germany is on the rise. We contacted the White House press office and did not hear back. According to the latest government numbers that came out in May, crime in the European Union’s largest economy is down by about 9.6 percent from 2016 to 2017. It is also down nearly 4 percent compared to 2012. This chart shows the percentage drop in all crime, violent crime, and the three most common crimes of street crime (a catchall category that spans offenses from sexual harassment to extortion to gang violence), theft and property damage. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In a May press release, German minister for Interior, Development and Community Horst Seehofer crowed about the latest figures. "The number of criminal offenses committed in Germany is the lowest since 1992," Seehofer said May 8. "This drop in crime is even more apparent in relation to the total population: fewer than 7,000 offenses per 100,000 residents. That is the lowest rate in more than 30 years!" Not every type of crime went down. Those involving drugs went up about 9 percent in the past year, and weapons violations rose by 10 percent. Role of immigrants Since Trump tied crime to immigration, we looked at the numbers of German and non-German suspects. The number of people arrested (the statistics count arrests, not convictions) who were not German rose between 2012 and 2017, starting at 502,000 and reaching 736,000. There are two ways to read that. Over the six years, more immigrants have been suspected of crimes. On the other hand, it’s also true that as the number of non-German suspects rose, the number of crimes fell. And it’s not as though native Germans stopped committing crimes in droves, leaving all the violations to immigrants. The number of Germans arrested dropped, but at roughly the same rate as the number of crimes. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com A study in one German state linked immigrants to a rise in violent crimes in 2016, with a third of those committed against other immigrants. These numbers back up what experts have said before: Cause and effect are complicated, and rising numbers of immigrants does not translate into an broader increase in crime. Our ruling Trump said that crime in Germany is "way up." The opposite is true. Crime in Germany is down from 2016 by over 9 percent, and since 2012 by about 4 percent. The numbers don’t link a rise in the number of immigrants to a rise in criminality nationwide. We rate this claim False. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Update: A previous version did not include the reference to the 2016 study in a German state. We added it after this item published.

pomt-02554	In 2002, "Iran was more or less an American ally."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/03/andrea-mitchell/mitchell-says-iran-was-more-or-less-us-ally-2002/	President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address fueled an extended political pre-game show that almost rivaled the chatter ahead of the Super Bowl. Every network fielded experts to assess what the president might say, why he would say it, and what could happen next. On the afternoon of the speech, MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell was deep in conversation with MSNBC political director Chuck Todd and Washington Post political reporter Chris Cillizza. The three agreed that despite the hype, these speeches deliver few surprises. But Mitchell said in her mind, the great exception came in 2002 when President George W. Bush named Iran, North Korea and Iraq as part of "an axis of evil." "Up until that moment, Iran was cooperating with the United States on the border of Afghanistan," Mitchell, MSNBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent, said. "Post 9/11, Iran was more or less an American ally. By being included in the axis of evil, it turned the Iranian government in a completely different direction. It was a turning point in American politics and in foreign policy." To say Iran and American ally in the same breath drew ridicule from the conservative community. The website Townhall.com wrote of Mitchell’s stunning "historical ignorance." Breitbart.com called her claim "a delusion." For this fact-check, we go to the record to assess whether in January 2002 Iran qualifies as "more or less an American ally." A tortured relationship Ties between the U.S. and Iran have been troubled for over 50 years. With the help of the CIA and the British, a coup toppled Iran’s elected leader in 1953 and led to the autocratic control by the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. An Islamic fundamentalist revolution displaced the Shah in 1979, producing the famous hostage crisis with American embassy staff. The U.S. has had no embassy in Iran since. Over the decades, there have been episodes when tensions between the two countries eased, but the dominant climate has been one of profound distrust if not outright hostility. The U.S. backed Iraq’s Saddam Hussein in his war with Iran. Iran supported the Hezbollah in Lebanon as a military surrogate to strike at Israel. In recent years, the desire to shut down Iran’s nuclear program has defined American policy toward the Middle Eastern nation. With that background, it would come as a surprise to ever characterize Iran as anything approaching a partner of the United States. But if there was such a moment, it was immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks on American soil. The enemy of my enemy Iranian and American interests dovetailed in Afghanistan, which lies along Iran’s eastern border. Iran viewed the Taliban as a threat. "For many, many years, the Iranians backed the Northern Alliance, the opponents to the Taliban," said Hossein Askari, a professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. The Northern Alliance became America’s wedge into Afghanistan in an offensive that overthrew the Taliban in a matter of weeks. Askari said Iran had boots on the ground in those attacks. "Iran had its military advisers within the Northern Alliance forces," Askari said. "I was told they fought side by side." To block a resurgent Taliban, both Iran and the U.S. wanted to establish a strong centralized government in Afghanistan. This required a partnership between two ethnic groups, the Tajik leaders of the Northern Alliance and the Pashtuns of Hamid Karzai. But the Northern Alliance was not interested. According to a RAND report prepared for U.S. Marine Corps, Iran brought the two sides together. "Iranian political pressure on Northern Alliance leaders during negotiations in Bonn, Germany, persuaded them to reach a compromise and agree to the formation of the new government," the RAND report said. Soon after Sept. 11, Iran also helped the U.S. with al-Qaida. This also fit with Iran’s interests. Al-Qaida is on the other side of the religious divide that splits the Arab world. Al-Qaida is Sunni while Iran is Shia. Iran gave no harbor to members of the terrorist organization. "They turned al-Qaida operatives out of their country," Askari said. A former Bush administration official told the Associated Press that Iran copied the passports of about 300 of those operatives and sent them to the United Nations where they were handed over to the Americans. Temporary partners, not allies While all of these moves put Iran and the U.S. on the same side, Askari would not goes as far as Mitchell suggested. "I totally disagree that they were allies," Askari said. "Their interests merged on this one issue, the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Iran wanted to have a say in what happened in Afghanistan. But on other issues, they kept their distance." As an historical note, Askari believes the Iranians became most interested in a new relationship with the U.S. only when American forces rapidly drove Saddam Hussein out of power. "They were shaking in their boots," Askari said. "They really thought that if the U.S. could do that to Saddam Hussein so quickly, they could be next." But whatever overtures Iran made at that moment were met with no response from the Bush administration. Our ruling Mitchell said that in 2002, Iran was almost an ally of the United States. While Iran provided critical assistance in the military defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan and helped undermine al-Qaida, this cooperation did not reflect deeper ties. It was a moment when both countries sought similar goals in one country. Mitchell’s point was the Bush administration squandered an opportunity. That might have merit, but there is no fact-checking a hypothetical situation. What we can assess is the degree to which Iran was "more or less" an ally. With due regard for the ambiguity in Mitchell’s words, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Andrea Mitchell	None	None	None	2014-02-03T11:05:46	2014-01-28	['United_States', 'Iran']

pomt-10379	Barack Obama "cut taxes for working families."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/23/barack-obama/obama-was-not-a-solo-performer/	In one of his first ads since winning the Democratic nomination for president, Sen. Barack Obama speaks directly to the camera about his life story and his legislative accomplishments. "America is a country of strong families and strong values," the ad begins. "My life's been blessed by both. I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up." Later in the ad, Obama says, "I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected." The tax cuts Obama is referring to are from his time as a state senator in the Illinois Legislature. In 2000, the Legislature created a state earned income tax credit, based on the federal earned income tax program, which is a tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. The program is meant "to offset the burden of Social Security taxes and to provide an incentive to work," according to the Internal Revenue Service. In the federal version, when the tax credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax refund to those who qualify. In the Illinois bill that Obama co-sponsored, state taxes can go to zero, but there is no additional refund. In the 2000 legislation, the legislative record shows that Obama was one of more than 40 senators that co-sponsored the bill, with most of them signing up for it on the same day. But the bill had a sunset clause, and when it came time to renew it in 2003, Obama filed the bill and was its chief sponsor. Another 20 senators signed on to co-sponsor it. Rather than renewing it for another few years, the Obama bill made the state earned income tax credit permanent. The record shows Obama was a minor co-sponsor in cutting taxes in 2000 and was the leader in the state Senate in 2003 in making the tax credits permanent. It takes more than one person to pass a bill, and although he played a significant role in making the tax credits permanent, the record on Obama's statement supports only a Mostly True.

pomt-01142	Georgia has had 12 school shootings in the two years since the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School, more than any other state.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/dec/19/everytown-gun-safety/deeper-look-claim-georgia-leads-nation-school-shoo/	Georgia has had the nation’s highest unemployment rate for three straight months. Now a new report puts Georgia at the top of another undesirable ranking: leading the nation with 12 school shootings since the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the Everytown for Gun Safety findings when they were first released last week. But a follow-up story noted concerns that PolitiFact found in previous Everytown school shooting report, centered on the group’s overly broad definition of a school shooting. PolitiFact Georgia decided to review the latest report, and our previous work, to see if the new ranking holds up. At issue is what counts as a "school shooting." Everytown is very transparent about its methodology and criteria which go beyond the common understanding that a school shooting is an intruder or student shooting at innocent classmates and staff. The group counts those incidents, such as the Sandy Hook massacre that left 28 dead. But it expands to other incidents, according to the report’s footnotes: "Incidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented by the press or confirmed through further inquiries with law enforcement. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included. " In other words, Everytown is counting incidents where no one is killed and even accidental discharges as school shootings. That’s how, for instance, the 12 incidents in Georgia include a 17-year-old student who accidentally shot herself with an illegally concealed firearm in a February 2013 incident at Grady High School. Also added to the tally: what turned out to be a suicide attempt in May in the parking deck of Georgia Gwinnett College. Only one incident counted in the more commonly understood definition: the August 2013 morning when Michael Brandon Hill stormed McNair Discovery Learning Academy in DeKalb County armed with an AK-47 style semi-automatic rifle and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition. A school bookkeeper, Antoinette Tuff, talked down the man who had shot his way into the 800-student school. She, and a heavy police response, convinced Hill to surrender without injuring anyone – an outcome that drew international headlines. Experts warned about the confusion of putting those kinds of attacks – and two other shootings during school hours or school events following confrontations – in with other incidents. "The question is whether the entire school or campus is endangered by the episode. The answer is most of these cases is no," said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston and author of the book, "Violence and Security on Campus: From preschool through college." But without knowing that, the report could drive anxiety and fear amid parents and students when schools are actually among the safest places for children to be, Fox said. There were consistently about 45 school-associated violent deaths (not just by guns) in K-12 schools annually between 1992 and 2010. The number plunged to 31 in 2011, after spiking at 63 in the 2007 school year, according to a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report. The Southeast, not just Georgia, often sees more of the incidents because of easier access to guns, Fox said. But a two-year snapshot does not offer any meaningful analysis, he added. Shootings on college campuses, meanwhile, are yet another different type of incident. Alcohol is often a factor in those incidents, which the Everytown report and experts conclude are often the result of an escalating conflict. Those shootings are no less tragic for stemming from confrontations, but experts said that also shows the different circumstances than the image of a lone shooter gunning down victims indiscriminately. "That kind of personal altercation happens in a variety of locations. People are in a bar, get in a fight and go get a gun from their car," said Mark Safarik, president of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. "You’ve really broadened it to the point where it loses the sense that you are trying to get," he added. Everytown defends its definition, noting it includes on the first page of the report its criteria for the report. "Our definition of what qualifies as a school shooting could not possibly be any more straightforward. When a gun is shot on school grounds, that's a school shooting," said Everytown communications director Erika Soto Lamb. "Plain and simple -- any challenge to this very obvious definition deserves to be called what it is: a case of 'pants on fire.’" The experts disagree. But, the group can take heart in one key element of its findings and how it may play out in Georgia. The report concludes that more than a third of all shootings nationally occurred after an argument or confrontation. Two-thirds of the Georgia incidents involved a shooter and victim who knew each other, an argument or fight beforehand or a drug deal. That helps make the case for keeping guns off of college campuses, a fight expected to be revived when the Legislature convenes next month. "In a lot of these incidents, a fight occurs and it’s settled with a gun," Safarik said. "You add in college campuses, with alcohol consumption, it could be a recipe for more events. That should be a more important conclusion than a dubious conclusion Georgia has the most school shootings." And with that, it appears the new Everytown report on school shootings mirrors concerns raised before about how to tally school shootings. It is accurate, by its broad definition, that Georgia led the nation with its version of "school shootings." The report is also useful in explaining what often leads to violent incidents at school and college campuses. In the end, there is value in the findings but significant context missing from its overall conclusion.We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-11842	Says the University of Florida "requests to cancel rivalry game" against Florida State University.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/07/react365com/gators-will-still-play-seminoles-despite-fake-news/	The University of Florida football team is having a very bad, no fun football season. That’s true. But it’s fake news that the Gators said they don’t want to play their traditional post-Thanksgiving rivalry game with Florida State University. "UF requests to cancel rivalry game against FSU," read the headline on a post we first saw Nov. 7, 2017, on React365.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The brief article, attributed to "Patrick Jones - Sports Writer," said that the Gators are looking for a little mercy from the Seminoles after a terrible season. As of this writing, the Gators had a 3-5 record. Florida head coach Jim McElwain was fired Oct. 29 after a season fraught with controversy and disappointment. Florida State also had a 3-5 record at the time of the article. The fake story said: "When asked why they were considering canceling the game, a spokesman for the UF Athletic Department stated, ‘Though both programs are struggling this year, dealing with injuries and academic disciplinary action, there is no need in embarrassing the UF Athletic program further by subjecting our already mediocre team to a game that would further humiliate the morale and enthusiasm of our student body.’ " The University of Florida Athletic Association didn’t make any such statement, and the Gators aren’t giving up on their Nov. 25 game at the Swamp. The story is completely made up. React365.com is a website that allows people to create "prank" stories, in which users write a few sentences and post a photo to trick people. The stories have the same effect as any fake news article — they trick readers into thinking they are real. Out of context, anyone can be fooled, even with the minimal warning posted at the bottom of the page that reads, "This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information." React365.com is one of a number of URLs owned by a man named Nicolas Gouriou, who runs a company in Binic, France, called Mediavibes. When we tried to contact Mediavibes via email, they only replied that they do not comment to the press. Readers should be wary of any story from React365.com or similar sites. The posts appear to always carry the current date, and feature a share counter that reflects the current date. When we saw this story, the counter said the story was from Nov. 7 and had been shared more than 94,000 times, but there’s no way to tell if that’s accurate. We contacted UF ourselves, just to make sure this Thanksgiving weekend tradition really was slated to continue as scheduled. "This is not true," athletic association spokesman Will Pantages confirmed. Feel free to plan your turkey day recovery around the UF-FSU rivalry game, because this is another fumble from a fake news generator. Pants on Fire!

pomt-08495	Says Republican opponent Jason Isaac is peddling a plan meaning Texans "would pay the highest sales taxes in America, up to 14.5 percent."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/09/patrick-rose/state-rep-patrick-rose-says-gop-challegner-jason-i/	Democratic state Rep. Patrick Rose of San Marcos, seeking re-election in a district whose voters preferred Republican John McCain for president in 2008, depicted the GOP nominee as a high-tax advocate in a recent TV ad that debuted online Sept. 24. To creepy music in the background and grainy video of the challenger, Jason Isaac, the ad's narrator says Isaac "supports higher sales taxes. The tax plan he's peddling means Texans would pay the highest sales taxes in America, up to 14.5 percent. So if Isaac gets his way, you'll pay more for every loaf of bread, every prescription, everything you buy in Texas." Another Rose ad revisits the tax-hike warning about Isaac with: "Hey Jason, you can't be serious." Gutsy or whack, is Isaac selling a tax surge? Rose's campaign consultant, Randy Thompson, shared a transcript of an Aug. 17 interview of Isaac on an Internet radio program titled "Texas Sons of Liberty Riders." We verified the transcript after Isaac's campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, provided a web link to the archived audio. On the show, Isaac said he favors lowering the 10 percent state cap on annual increases in home appraisals to 3 percent and eventually wiping out property taxes altogether. Isaac also told the hosts that lost revenue from eliminating property taxes could be recovered from higher sales taxes, saying: "A lot of people like the consumption-based model and there's a group out there, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, they released a study earlier this year that said if you just eliminated property taxes and you wanted to make a pure consumption (tax) base... sales tax is an easier way to put it." Isaac then said: "You increase the sales tax to 14 and a half percent and you've got a wash. It balances out. You could eliminate all your property taxes but everything you buy, you pay a 14 and a half percent tax." We confirmed that in April 2009, the conservative-leaning Austin-based public policy foundation issued a report on wiping out property taxes and replacing that revenue with sales taxes. The study says that if the sales tax is limited to items it now covers, it would need to be raised to about 14.5 percent. If it were expanded to all property sales, the state rate could be 12.5 percent, the study says, and if expanded to cover "all services taxed by at least one other state," the rate could be 9 percent. A sales tax rate of 14.5 percent would--take a breath-- more than double the current Texas rate of 6.25 percent, on which local jurisdictions may tack on up to 2 percent more. As of January, California's 8.25 percent statewide sales tax was the highest in the country, according to the Washington-based Federation of Tax Administrators. But there was more to Isaac's interview than talking up a sales tax hike, which he noted could also be counterproductive: "My thought process is you get above 9 and a half (percent sales tax) and you're gonna start driving people to the black market... they're gonna order everything off of Amazon.com... But I like the consumption-based model." In a follow-up e-mail, Rose's consultant, Thompson, said Isaac has failed to tell voters precisely how he'd replace the lost property tax revenue. Thompson shared a transcript from a Sept. 12 forum in which Isaac concedes he doesn't have the answer, aside from using money from the state's so-called rainy day fund. "But," Isaac said, according to the transcript, "I believe if you start to cut property taxes, your tax base is going to grow" because more people will be able to afford homes and more people will buy more goods and services, resulting in greater sales-tax revenue." Isaac reaffirmed that position in an interview with us. He also said that while he favors wiping out property taxes, "I don't have the answers" on how to replace the revenue. Isaac's campaign, responding to Rose's ad, distributed a statement saying Isaac does not support raising the state sales tax rate to 14.5 percent, but believes "Texans deserve options to create a more sustainable tax model and that we need creative new solutions in this tough economy." On his campaign website, Isaac states he "believes that a consumption-based model is one possible solution, but there are limitations." So, Isaac wants Texas property taxes to go to zero sometime. He says he's uncertain how to get there, yet he supports the "consumption" model, meaning a reliance on sales taxes. And he approvingly referred to a study by a conservative group showing that one way to eliminate property taxes in Texas is to raise the state sales tax to 14.5 percent. Contrary to Rose's statement, though, there's no sign Isaac is peddling a plan to bump the state sales tax to 14.5 percent--indeed, there's flat-out no plan to peddle. Still, there's a shred of truth to Rose's statement because Isaac has saluted the idea of swapping higher sales taxes for cuts in property taxes. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13300	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to go to a single-payer plan" for health care	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-wants-go/	Donald Trump called the Affordable Care Act a "disaster" that he wants to repeal and that Hillary Clinton would make health care even worse. "She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster," Trump said during the presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis Oct. 9. "Somewhat similar to Canada. And if you ever noticed the Canadians -- when they need a big operation when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow, it's catastrophic in certain ways. But, she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything." Does Clinton want to move the United States to a single-payer system for health care? Clinton’s health care plan Converting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies. Some Democrats — including, at one time, Barack Obama — pushed for a single-payer system. But there wasn’t enough support for that, and ultimately Congress approved a plan that allows different insurance plans offered in "marketplaces" by individual states and the federal government. During the vice presidential debate, Trump’s running mate Gov. Mike Pence made a similar claim that Clinton and and Tim Kaine "want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program." We rated that claim Mostly False. For our fact-check of Pence, Trump spokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website. It indicates "that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare," Kowalski said. "A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery." Here is exactly what she said on her campaign website about a public option: "Defend and expand the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million people. Hillary will stand up to Republican-led attacks on this landmark law—and build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a "public option" possible. She will also support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare." So Clinton does want a public option, but she is calling for adding the public option to the existing options. Clinton has consistently said, including during the Oct. 9 debate, that she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans. She has called for expanding it to include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries with cheaper prices. We previously asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal. Kowalski responded that "Hillary has committed fully to the public option," and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady. At the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, "I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I don’t think it’s — I don’t even think it’s a close call politically." Later in her answer Clinton says there are three ways to get universal health coverage, only one of which is a single-payer system. The other two: an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works. WikiLeaks speech excerpt about single-payer A few days after the vice presidential debate, WikiLeaks published emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. A Jan. 25 email from Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk to Podesta contained excerpts of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speeches but hasn’t done so.) One excerpt related to single-payer systems was from remarks she gave to "ECGR Grand Rapids" on June 17, 2013. She gave a speech to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids in Michigan that day. "If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here." We can’t fully evaluate Clinton’s speech because WikiLeaks published only excerpts. (We asked the Clinton campaign for a fully copy but did not get a response to that request.) However, Clinton praised single-payer because she says it keeps costs down, but she also said that it imposes wait times. And she also praised systems like Switzerland for having clear budget controls and said they don’t have single payer. Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us a brief fact-check in Politico that was headlined: "No, Clinton has not been after single payer for years." One final note: Trump has been all over the map on single-payer health care if we trace his comments back to his first race for president in 2000. "The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. … We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing," Trump wrote in his 2000 book The America We Deserve. Other times in the past couple of years he has praised it, but he has also said he doesn’t support it. His campaign plan on his website emphasizes "free market principles." Our ruling Trump says Clinton "wants to go to a single-payer plan" for health care. She has consistently said she would fight efforts to repeal Obamacare and would try to improve it. She said she wants a public option to be "possible" but she has not called for moving to a system of only single payer. Clinton has not called for a single-payer plan. At times, she has praised the health care systems of other countries that have a single-payer plan, but she has not advocated that plan for the United States.

pomt-05148	"Congressman Renacci is under FBI investigation."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/21/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-claims-fbi-investigating-jim-renacci-over-cam/	There’s nothing like a law enforcement investigation to set off a political mudslide. That’s what happened to Wadsworth Republican Rep. Jim Renacci after a May 18 article in The New Republic revealed that federal law enforcement authorities were examining donations that his campaign received from employees of a North Canton direct marketing firm called Suarez Corporation Industries. Federal law enforcement officials sought contribution records from the campaigns of Renacci and GOP U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel after the Toledo Blade published a report about large sums of money the firm’s employees gave to the two campaigns. Wealthy political donors sometimes try to skirt caps on the amount they can give campaigns by having other people write checks and reimbursing them. That practice is illegal. The company and its employees deny any wrongdoing, as do the political campaigns. Still, the questions were enough to prompt Mandel -- who serves as Ohio’s state treasurer -- to return the donations at issue. "We have decided to issue refunds for any contributions that appear to be under investigation by federal authorities," Mandel campaign treasurer Kathryn Kessler said in a letter to Suarez Corporation."We believe we have no reason to be concerned with the contributions, but out of an abundance of caution and until the investigation is complete, we believe this course of action is most appropriate." Renacci’s decision to hang onto the cash pending the investigation’s outcome prompted predictable political attacks from his foes. Demanding that an opponent get rid of donations from a controversial campaign backer is a common political tactic, one that Renacci himself has repeatedly used in the past. "After several months of investigation and countless stories in the press about suspect campaign contributions, Congressman Renacci’s continuing refusal to return the funds speaks volumes," said a May 29 press release from Renacci’s November election rival, Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton. "Every day that passes is a day that he fails to do the right thing to come clean about what he knew about these potentially illegal contributions and return or donate the suspect funds." Eager to capitalize on the controversy, the campaign arm of Democrats in the House of Representatives issued a June 1 missive announcing it had named Renacci its "Corrupt Republican of the Month," a designation whose sole purpose seemed to be providing an excuse for press releases. "Congressman Jim Renacci is under FBI investigation for taking $110,250 in suspect campaign cash and refuses to return the money," Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in the release. While it is clear that the FBI is investigating Suarez Corporation’s donations, PolitiFact Ohio had not heard that Renacci himself was under investigation by the FBI. We asked the DCCC to back up their claim. The DCCC said its assertion was consistent with statements from groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government, whose website claims that the FBI is investigating Renacci, and headlines such as this one from the Medina Gazette’s online edition: "FBI confirms campaign investigation of U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci." The article underneath that headline clearly stipulates the FBI is investigating Suarez’ donations to Renacci and Mandel, and states "The candidates are not accused of any wrongdoing." While a claim on a watchdog website, or sloppy headline could have conveyed the impression that Renacci or his campaign was being investigated by the FBI, none of the news coverage we found on the subject indicated that was the case. To settle the question, we went straight to the source: the Canton office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In a June 18 interview, Andrew Hayden, the supervisory senior resident agent of Canton’s Federal Bureau of Investigation office confirmed that Renacci is not a target of the FBI’s investigation. "We are looking into the donations from the Suarez Corporation, and not the congressman’s campaign or the congressman," Hayden said. It couldn’t be much clearer than that. The FBI says it is not investigating Renacci. On the Truth-O-Meter, the DCCC’s statement rates False.

pomt-12295	President Trump has signed more bills into law "than any president previously before at this stage in the game."	false	/california/statements/2017/jun/27/devin-nunes/nunes-gets-it-wrong-trump-hasnt-signed-more-bills-/	President Donald Trump is quick to list his accomplishments. On June 23, 2017, he tweeted "I’ve helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills, mostly with no Democratic support, and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations. Nice!" Trump was correct about the number. He omitted the fact, however, that few of these created substantive legislative change, as NPR reported. Fifteen of the bills "reversed Obama-era rules and regulations. Others renamed federal buildings, provided for the creation of memorials or were related to personnel or government spending." Some Trump supporters, including California Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, also have made problematic claims about the president’s accomplishments. A reader suggested we fact-check this claim, made by Nunes on Fresno’s KMJ radio, about Trump’s bill signings: "The news media hasn’t covered this. But we have actually got more bills signed into law, more bills signed into law, this Congress working with this president, than any president previously before at this stage in the game," Nunes said on June 19, 2017, in an interview with host Ray Appleton. He made this claim on Trump’s 150th day in the White House. By that point, Trump had signed 39 bills into law, according to GovTrack.us, a legislative research and tracking website. Nunes has gained additional attention in recent months, particularly for his actions as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. In April, he announced he was temporarily stepping away from leading that panel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He cited ethics complaints that he mishandled classified information. That doesn’t mean, however, that Nunes has stayed silent on Trump. In fact, he’s continued to praise the president’s actions. We wondered whether the Nunes was right at the time he stated Trump had signed more bills "than any president previously before at this stage in the game." Our research PolitiFact California and our national partner PolitiFact have checked related claims. In April, shortly after Trump’s 100th day in office, we rated as Mostly True California Rep. Tom McClintock’s statement that "President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman." We found Trump had indeed signed the most bills, 28, since Truman signed 55 during the first 100 days of his first full term. We clarified that, as of that time, none of the bills Trump had signed were major pieces of legislation. That same month, PolitiFact rated False Trump’s claim that "no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days." It cited several presidential historians who said Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Truman and Barack Obama all accomplished more during their first 100 days in the White House. Outdated claim But as we noted earlier, Nunes made his assertion on Trump’s 150th day in office. He was specific about it, too, saying Trump had signed more bills than other presidents "at this stage in the game." That’s simply not accurate, based on the research by GovTrack.us. Not only did Roosevelt and Truman sign more bills through 150 days, so did Presidents Jimmy Carter, 48, and Bill Clinton with 41. President George H. W. Bush signed the same number as Trump, 39. "I think it’s important that we all get the facts right," said Joshua Tauberer, founder of GovTrack.us. "When Nunes made that statement, his numbers were 50 days out of date." Counting the number of bills signed is only one measure of a president’s accomplishment, Tauberer added, and perhaps an arbitrary one at that. "If you count pages or words, Obama signed more than twice as much legislation at this point than Trump. It just happens that the legislation that went to Obama was grouped into fewer distinct bills," he said. Reporting by the Washington Post also shows Trump’s bill signings fall short of other presidents’ totals through 150 days. Asked about the claim, Nunes’ spokesman Jack Langer told us the congressman "was referring to it being the most bills signed in the first 100 days of a new administration since Truman." That would be accurate, if that’s what Nunes said. But it’s not. Of note, Trump has signed 36 executive orders, more than any president in recent history during his first 150 days, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. The orders do not require congressional approval. Our ruling California Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Tulare, said on Trump’s 150th day in the White House that Trump had signed more bills into law "than any president previously before at this stage in the game." Research from GovTrack.us and reporting by news outlets show Trump’s 39 bills signed into law trailed totals by Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Carter and Clinton. It tied him with President George H. W. Bush’s total through this period. The congressman’s claim would have been accurate had he cited the correct timeframe (the 100 day mark in office) and context (since President Truman). Instead, he repeated an outdated talking point. We rate Nunes’ statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-02002	"In the city of Milwaukee, we’ve still got a mayor and a police chief who are furloughing police officers at a time when we have violence all across the city."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/11/robin-vos/robin-vos-says-milwaukee-furloughing-police-office/	In the wake of the May 21, 2014 shooting on a Milwaukee playground that left a 10-year-old girl gravely wounded, a familiar debate rekindled: Are there enough cops are on the street? In a May 30, 2014 appearance on WTMJ-AM radio, state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos told host Charlie Sykes that "systemic problems" led to such incidents, including the use of plea bargains, lenient judges and diverting resources from controlling crime. Vos also argued Mayor Tom Barrett and Police Chief Ed Flynn should be held accountable: "Remember, in the city of Milwaukee we’ve still got a mayor and a police chief who are furloughing police officers at a time when we have violence all across the city." So is Vos right? Are cops being kept off the street? When we asked Vos for backup, his office cited news accounts, city budget documents and testimony from Milwaukee Police Association president Michael Crivello at a Sept. 19, 2013 meeting of the city Fire and Police Commission. Under Barrett, the city began using the unpaid days off for all staffers in 2009 to address budget issues. Police officers have been involved, to varying degrees, since the practice began. City officials maintain that furloughs have been used selectively, at least when they come to cops. For instance, in the first year "only a limited number of MPD sworn staff was required to have furloughs," said Mark Nicolini, the city’s budget director. Furloughs expanded to all officers in 2010. There were no furlough days for sworn staff in 2011 or 2012. Furloughs returned in 2013, when all police department staff took three days. The same number was included in the 2014 budget. To be sure, the furloughs are not a product of the mayor and police chief alone. The Fire and Police Commission unanimously approved the 2014 plan at a Sept. 19, 2013 meeting. And the Common Council voted 15-0 in favor of the furloughs, which for the police would save a projected $1.75 million, according to the city’s budget office. Savings from all city employees is expected to be $3.3 million. Furloughs and safety According to the Barrett administration and Police Department, the furloughs have little impact. Here’s what the city’s furlough policy says: "Furloughs for furlough-eligible personnel in the Fire and Police Departments are to be scheduled in a manner designed to minimize the disruption to department operations and public safety." Flynn’s spokesman, Lt. Mark Stanmeyer, said in an email: "Furloughs have no impact on the minimum staffing levels set and maintained by MPD." "The operational impact of furloughs is that it becomes slightly more difficult for an officer to receive permission to use a compensatory day, vacation day, holiday or other contractually accrued leave time. In order to mitigate this impact, furloughs are scheduled throughout the entire year." Crivello, the union president, told the commission that he opposes furloughs "due to public safety, police safety, morale, and lack of documentation illustrating other means of budgetary relief." Asked in an interview about the city’s claim that furloughs don’t affect minimum staffing, Crivello did some basic math. With about 1,600 cops forced to take three days off, "that’s 4,800 man days we’re losing to furloughs," he said. "That means that every day there are 13 to 14 officers that are not on the street." He said the furloughs affect officer safety because they contribute to fewer two-man squad cars, and reduce response time for when officers call for backup assistance. Crivello also said furloughs also hurt morale. Our rating Vos said the mayor and police chief were furloughing police officers. But Vos places the blame for them solely on Barrett and Flynn, when the responsibility is shared by the council and Fire and Police Commission. What’s more, it’s a longstanding practice to deal with budget issues and steps have been taken to mitigate the impact on public safety. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-07135	Says he's signed a pledge not to raise taxes four times.	true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/16/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-hes-signed-no-tax-pledge-four-/	U.S. Senate hopeful Roger Williams stressed his opposition to higher taxes during a June 8 candidate forum presented by the Texas Tribune and KLRU-TV, saying: "I've signed that pledge four times. The idea of raising taxes any time, but certainly at a time of economic slowdown, is nuts." Williams, a Republican, is making his first bid for elected office, so his comment seemed a head-scratcher. How many no-tax pledges can one candidate sign? On behalf of Williams, campaign spokesman Colby Hale told us Williams has twice signed no-tax pledges from Americans for Tax Reform, has signed the American Family Business Institute no "death tax" pledge and, Hale said he believes, a "few different Tea Party (no-tax) pledges at various rallies." Hale said he thinks Williams also signed a "No Climate Tax" pledge for Americans for Prosperity. We checked his list. By email, Patrick Gleason of Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform said Williams signed its pledge Feb. 9 and once before then. The pledge says the individual will "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses" and also will "oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." The American Family Business Institute forwarded a copy of the Death Tax Repeal Pledge signed by Williams May 10. It states the signers will support the "permanent repeal of the federal estate and gift taxes." Spokesman Adam Nicholson said by email that Williams also signed the pledge earlier because the group asks candidates to sign for each election cycle. Last year, Williams was among candidates geared up to run for U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison’s seat when she said she was considering stepping down to run for governor. Later, Williams’ campaign forwarded a copy of the no-climate tax pledge -- avowing opposition to any climate-change legislation that includes a net increase in government revenue -- signed by Williams on Feb. 14. So, Williams has signed at least three anti-tax pledges--two of them twice. We rate his statement True.	None	Roger Williams	None	None	None	2011-06-16T06:00:00	2011-06-08	['None']
pomt-07442	Says $38 billion in spending cuts in federal budget compromise is "less than $1 billion in real cuts."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/21/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-38-billion-cuts-budget-compromise/	About 11 p.m. on April 8, 2011, shortly after a federal budget compromise averted a government shutdown, President Barack Obama addressed the nation from the august Blue Room of the White House. The compromise measure, he declared, contained "the largest annual spending cut in our history." News reports pegged the figure at $38 billion. Eight days later, with sleet bearing down on her outside the Wisconsin Capitol, Sarah Palin took aim at the budget compromise while speaking to a tea party rally. The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee asserted that because of "politics-as-usual and accounting gimmicks, we find out it’s not $38 billion in cuts." She added: "We find out it’s not even $38 billion; it’s less than $1 billion in real cuts." Palin’s claim about the bill, which was signed into law by Obama, was about as specific as it was startling. Let’s find out if it’s true. News media throughout the country reported that the compromise made $38 billion in spending cuts -- but they characterized the cuts in different ways. The New York Times said the cuts would be made "this year." Reuters was more specific, saying they would be made by Sept. 30, 2011, the end of the federal government’s 2011 fiscal year. But the Associated Press said "most of those cuts will either not take effect until future years or amount to accounting gimmicks that won’t reduce actual spending." The reports were consistent, however, on the amount of the cuts: $38 billion. So, how could $38 billion become "less than $1 billion in real cuts," as Palin claimed? We e-mailed SarahPAC.com -- the website for Palin’s political action committee, which has fueled speculation that she might run for president in 2012 -- but didn’t get a reply. We did get a return e-mail from Conservatives4Palin.com, which supports Palin but is not an official Palin website. That e-mail cited an Associated Press article that was published three days before Palin’s speech in Madison. It quoted the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal analyst, as saying the compromise would cut just $352 million in spending by Sept. 30, 2011. So, the CBO seemed to provide some backing for Palin. The CBO analysis, however, was limited to cuts that would be made in the current fiscal year. The same Associated Press article cited by Conservatives4Palin.com explained how a bill that was touted to contain $38 billion in spending cuts was producing only $352 million in cuts in the first 5-1/2 months after being signed into law. "At issue is a concept in budgeting that is often difficult to grasp," the article said. "Appropriations bills like the pending measure give agencies the authority to spend taxpayers’ money. But such authority typically takes months or years to actually leave the federal Treasury, so cuts made in the middle of the budget year often have little immediate impact." In other words, the budget compromise cancelled what is known as the budget authority for $38 billion worth of spending. But only $352 million in actual spending would be eliminated before Sept. 30, 2011. An explanation provided by a Washington Post article, published two days before Palin’s Wisconsin speech, was more thorough. That article said "Congress usually gives agencies the authority to draw from Uncle Sam’s one gigantic checking account. That is the Treasury’s General Fund, which is constantly taking in taxes, fees and borrowed money. The agencies can’t take money out of this fund until they’re ready to spend it. And that’s where it becomes complicated. "Sometimes, agencies aren’t ready to spend the money until a year, or longer, after Congress gives them their IOU. That’s not a problem when an agency makes a one-time purchase for something like pencils. Officials call a supplier, get their pencils and write a check, and the money is gone. But it works differently when the government buys an aircraft carrier," when the final check won’t be cut until several years later, the article said. The Post also found 98 instances in which the budget compromise took back unused IOUs and called it a cut. For example, the article said, the compromise "takes $560 million from the Academic Competitiveness and SMART programs, which gave grants to college undergraduates. But the programs are set to end after this school year. And the Education Department has enough cash to cover the remaining grants." In other words, some of what is counted in the bill as spending cuts are monies that had budget authority but would never have actually been spent. That also lends support to Palin’s claim, that not all of the $38 billion in the announced spending cuts would actually be achieved. Well, how much spending will actually be cut? Two days before Palin’s Madison speech, the Congressional Budget Office issued a second report on the budget compromise. It estimated that, beyond the $352 million in spending cuts that would be made by Sept. 30, 2011, $20 billion to $25 billion in cuts would be made between 2011 and 2021, with the vast majority occurring between 2012 and 2016. Clearly, $20 billion to $25 billion is less than the $38 billion in spending cuts that were claimed by backers of the compromise bill. But it also far exceeds the less than $1 billion in cuts that Palin claimed. We consulted two Washington, D.C. think tank experts, Joseph Antos of the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute and Scott Lilly of the liberal Center for American Progress, who was chief of staff to former Democratic Wisconsin congressman Dave Obey. They agreed that the CBO’s $20 billion to $25 billion estimate was the best representation of the spending cuts produced by the budget compromise. Let’s review. Sarah Palin claimed that a federal budget compromise, which was billed as containing $38 billion in spending cuts, would actually make less than $1 billion in cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the spending cuts would amount to only $352 million for fiscal 2011. But it said the cuts would total $20 billion to $25 billion from 2011 to 2021. Palin’s statement contained some element of truth, in that the spending cuts amount to less than $1 billion for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, 2011. But she ignored a critical fact, namely that the bill makes $20 billion to $25 billion in cuts over the next 10 years. We rate her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

The same report puts the cost of a remand prisoner at $239.17 per day. The main reason for this difference is because sentenced prisoners generally have longer unlock hours, more case management and a series of mandated programmes such to attend. The same report gives an average population of 6816 sentence prisoners and 2377 remand prisoners. The weighted average cost therefore works out at $105,809 per prisoner, per year.

pomt-07687	Damage by protesters to the Wisconsin state Capitol will cost $7.5 million to repair.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/08/mike-huebsch/wisconsin-officials-claim-cleaning-state-capitol-w/	After nearly three weeks of protests, including large groups of people sleeping in the Wisconsin Capitol, the administration of Gov. Scott Walker decided to clean up the joint. On the eve of Walker’s March 1, 2011, budget address, the building was shut down to almost everyone. You had to have an appointment with a legislator and make it through a police checkpoint to get inside. Organizers of protests against Walker’s plans to curtail collective bargaining rights for most public employees went to court to demand the Capitol be reopened. A three-day hearing was held before Dane County Circuit Judge John Albert. We won’t rehash all the details here. But in the spirit of spring cleaning, we want to return to a statement -- since withdrawn -- that was made about how much the Capitol cleanup would cost. The number, stated in court on March 3, 2011: A whopping $7.5 million. Think of it this way: If you paid someone $20 an hour, with a standard 40-hour workweek, that person would be peeling tape and scrubbing marble for 180 years. The $7.5 million figure came from the state Department of Administration, headed by Secretary Mike Huebsch. The words were spoken by an attorney for the department, Cari Anne Renlund. But, following PolitiFact protocol, which assigns statements from spokesmen to their bosses, we’ll attribute this number to Huebsch. To duplicate the reaction we -- and many readers -- had at the time the number was first used, we have to type in capital letters: IT WILL COST $7.5 MILLION? And: THAT’S A LOT OF CASH. In court, Renlund said the estimate included $6 million to repair damaged marble inside the Capitol, $1 million for damage outside and $500,000 for costs to inspect the damage. The culprit: Tape used to put up protest signs. The tape adhesive is acidic, the marble is a base, so, over time, the tape could etch the stone. The damage claim rocketed around the Internet (such as here and here and here) and on news reports and talk shows around the world (here and here). Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch posted the figure on her Facebook page, generating more than 125 comments -- mostly from people condemning the protesters and the extraordinary level of damage they allegedly caused. But other testimony and news reports from the Capitol indicated that something was amiss. Protesters had, by all accounts, policed themselves, including creating cleanup details and other organizational efforts. They used blue painters’ tape to hang their signs -- at the request of state officials. Some protesters said the state had actually provided the tape to avoid lasting damage. One day before the eye-popping damage estimate came out, a Madison historic preservation expert posted a blog item praising the conduct of the protesters. The protesters "have adopted an ownership ethic in the building, treating it with the utmost care and respect," wrote Jason Tish, executive director of the Madison Trust for Historic Preservation and a local field representative for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. He called the demonstrators "evangelistic about their respect for the building." "Handwritten signs on glass display cases, rest room doors and granite pillars demand care, cleanliness, and respect for the building they call ‘Our house.’ High humidity and salt and dirt residue may add to the cumulative impact on floors and painted surfaces, but any damage to the building is unintended," he wrote. Such observations were seen and heard by reporters and others covering the Capitol day after day. So when Renlund uncorked her estimate, it was especially jarring. As one blog posting noted, you could replace large sections of marble for $7.5 million. Indeed, that’s more than the $7.2 million that the state spent to build the Capitol, which was completed in 1917. On March 4, 2011 -- the day after the number was revealed -- Huebsch’s office issued some documents backing up the alleged pricetag. This included a March 2, 2011, memo from state architect Dan Stephans, who oversaw a $145 million restoration project in 2001. The memo says 400 hours of time by a "qualified team" would be needed to inspect the building and grounds for damage at a cost that could reach $500,000. In addition, he wrote, 240,000 square feet of the building need attention -- and it would take a crew of 20 a minimum of 12 weeks. That’s $6 million for the interior, and another $1 million to replace sod and shrubs outside. Twice in his memo, Stephans said he’s providing an "educated guess" about the repair costs. But the memo was not operative for long. The same day, the state provided a different memo, from Peter Maternowski, deputy administrator of the Division of State Facilities. It was written that day, addressed to Huebsch. That memo said the cleanup would cost $347,500 if the work did not require a historic preservation specialist. That’s 20 times less than the original claim. Among other things, the budget-priced memo said Stephans’ estimates included restoring portions of the building to way they were in 2001, after the major rehab project was done. That sounds like a lot of work for painter tape removal. By March 7, 2011, the Department of Administration reported that all signs and banners in the Capitol had been removed. Some of the signs are being considered for preservation by the Wisconsin Historical Society or the Smithsonian Institution. Tish, the preservationist/blogger, returned for a look that same day. "The extent of what I saw today is just chips and nicks -- cosmetic damage," he said in an interview. "I don’t see how they (protesters) could have conducted themselves any better." Tish said the building bore the signs of the "accelerated cumulative effects of lots of people going through the building. I saw no intentional damage." Maternowski said the state has hired Charlie Quagliana, a Madison architect, to evaluate the building’s condition and recommend how to proceed. Quagliana worked on the 2001 restoration project and is an expert in historic buildings, Maternowski said. "Depending on what he finds, he may call others in," he said. Let’s assess the damages. While urging a judge to scale back protests, a state Department of Administration official said the state Capitol sustained $7.5 million in damage. State officials could not immediately provide a basis for the number, and later backtracked from it. The new estimate: $347,500, some 20 times less than the original one. And there are indications that even that could be high. This smells like an effort to pour gas on the anti-protester fire. The claim was ridiculously high. And that gets a Pants on Fire rating.

pomt-14372	"We do not have an overcrowding problem. As a matter of fact, Rhode Island has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2016/mar/20/richard-ferruccio/ri-incarceration-rates-low-prisons-not-overcrowded/	In the midst of a General Assembly hearing Feb. 23, Richard Ferruccio, the former president of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, took a minute to defend himself and the state’s prisons. When discussing House Bill 7420, which would raise penalties for residents who tamper with cellphone and radio towers, Rep. Edith Ajello voiced concerns. Ajello said she felt the new penalties were "extreme." Why raise the sentence to up to 10 years in prison when the facilities are already overcrowded? she asked. Ferruccio shot back. "We do not have an overcrowding problem. As a matter of fact, Rhode Island has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country," Ferruccio said. "It is not the doom and gloom" that people think. Ferruccio’s sources — a Wikipedia page, an article from Governing Magazine, which cited data from the Bureau of Justice, and a WorldAtlas.com article — all backed up this part of his claim. Rhode Island has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. We also did our own research. The National Institute of Corrections, an agency housed within the U.S. Department of Justice, reports the incarceration rates in each state every year. Their most recent report from 2014 says Rhode Island has a rate of about 55 percent less than average with 178 people incarcerated per every 100,000. It is the second lowest, with Maine reporting 153 per every 100,000. The national average is 392 per 100,000. (However, the NCIC numbers also showed us that the Ocean State has a probation rate that is 91 percent higher than the national average, second only to Georgia.) Now, for the second part. Are the state’s prisons overcrowded? No, Ferruccio said, sending us an email claiming that the prisons are just 76-percent full. J.R. Ventura, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said that figure was off by less than 1 percent, mainly because Ferruccio failed to include female inmates. On average there are 136 women a day in the prisons. Including women, there were 3,060 inmates were in Rhode Island’s prisons on March 15, or 76.7-percent of capacity. Those rates have been falling in recent years from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 80.6 percent in 2014. Other state prison systems are operating way above capacity. In Colorado, prisons are at 115 percent of capacity. In Louisiana, the average is 119 percent, according the federal government. But these are averages and in Rhode Island the medium and maximum-security units run at about 93 percent capacity. So, is that "crowded"? "Absolutely no, we are not overcrowded," Ventura said. "There’s a lot of people in the Max and Medium facilities, but we are not overcrowded." Overcrowding was a significant problem in the state in the 1970s and a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the crowding was unconstitutional. In a settlement called the Palmigiano agreement, the state agreed to limits for each facility. As long as the numbers don’t exceed those limits, the prisons are not overcrowded, Ventura said. "Our numbers have remained steady and far below capacity since 2008. We are able to manage our daily operations safely and effectively." he said. OUR RULING: Ferruccio said Rhode Island has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. His numbers were spot on. Except for Maine, Rhode Island has the lowest incarceration rate. However, the state also has a very high probation rate, which he did not mention. He also said the prisons do not have an overcrowding problem. He is correct. The Department of Corrections confirmed that the prisons are not "crowded" by the Palmigiano standards.

pomt-11433	"We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive)."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/15/donald-trump/donald-trumps-misleading-tweet-trade-canada-rest-w/	At a closed-door fundraiser in Missouri, President Donald Trump told the audience that during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he just simply made up a fact without knowing if it was true or not. The Washington Post, citing leaked audio from the event, reported that Trump said, "Nice guy, good-looking guy (Trudeau) comes in (and says) ‘Donald, we have no trade deficit.’ He’s very proud because everybody else, you know, we’re getting killed. … I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ " Trump's comments came days after enacting a pair of landmark and controversial tariffs on steel and aluminum. On Twitter the morning after the Post's report, Trump doubled down, saying his claim was true after all. "We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered: Does the United States have a trade deficit with Canada? And does the United States have a trade deficit with "almost all countries"? We found that Trump’s statement was somewhere between incomplete and misleading. Does the United States have a trade deficit with Canada? Trump seems to be referring to a deficit in goods, which tells only part of the picture. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) In 2017, the United States had a $23.2 billion deficit with Canada in goods. In other words, the United States in 2017 bought more goods from the Canada than Canada bought from the United States. However, the United States had a $25.9 billion surplus with Canada in services — and that was enough to overcome that deficit and turn the overall balance of trade into a $2.8 billion surplus for the United States in 2017. The same pattern occurred in 2016. Those unhappy with current trends in trade, such as Trump, tend to highlight the balance of trade in goods, since that subset of trade is the one that shows just how much manufacturing activity the United States has lost to foreign countries in recent years. By contrast, the United States has fared much better in services, which includes finance, insurance, legal services, business consulting and entertainment. "Over the past 30 years, we have lost jobs in manufacturing, which produces goods, but gained a large number of very good jobs in service sectors and intellectual property," Matt Gold, an adjunct law professor at Fordham University, told PolitiFact in February. In services, by contrast, "the U.S. dominates the world," Gold said. There’s a political connection here. Trump garnered significant support in the Rust Belt, which has been hit hard by trade deficits in goods, and he fared poorly in coastal and metropolitan areas that have benefited from the surge in services. It’s worth adding that a significant historical driver of the U.S. trade deficit in goods with Canada has been crude oil — a commodity that the United States has usually preferred to buy from Canada when possible, rather than from overseas suppliers that might be subject to greater political instability. It’s also a product for which the United States is increasingly less reliant on foreign sources overall. "After you take out oil products from Canada’s exports to the U.S., the U.S. runs a massive trade surplus plus against Canada," to the tune of $49 billion in 2016, Daniel Trefler, a professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, told PolitiFact in February. "If we are talking about manufacturing jobs, the U.S. is a huge winner." Does the United States have a trade deficit with "almost all countries"? By our calculations, this is incorrect. We looked at the full list of countries and country equivalents that are tracked by the United States on trade balances to see whether the United States had a surplus or a deficit with them. We found 129 countries or country equivalents with whom the United States had a surplus in 2017, out of 234 entities listed overall. This means that the United States had a surplus in 55 percent of those countries, or a majority. Notably, this data refers to goods only; if we had the data for both goods and services, the percentage might go even higher, given the United States’ general advantage in services. We did find at least six major trading partners with whom the United States had a surplus in 2017 in goods and services: Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The United States also had a sizable surplus with the entire region of South and Central America. That said, it’s reasonable to point out that for the United States, the biggest trade deficits are larger than the biggest trade surpluses.

So among the United States’ largest trading partners, the biggest deficits are larger than the biggest surpluses. But that’s not what Trump said. A final note: Experts who support free trade say that arguing over deficits and surpluses misses the point. "We should be running deficits with some countries and surpluses with others, since comparative advantage will vary, country by country," said I.M. (Mac) Destler, who teaches at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive)." On Canada, Trump’s statement is at best telling only part of the story. The United States currently has a trade deficit in goods with Canada, but the United States’ edge in services turns the overall balance of trade into a surplus for the United States. As for the world at large, Trump is wrong — the United States actually has a surplus with a majority of countries tracked in the official data. However, it’s reasonable to point out that among the biggest trading partners, trade deficits outpace trade surpluses in size. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-04015	"One-third of the gasoline is purchased by out-of-state people" in Virginia	false	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/05/richard-saslaw/state-sen-richard-saslaw-says-virginia-one-third-g/	Many Democrats oppose Gov. Bob McDonnell’s transportation plan, which would eliminate the state’s gasoline tax and raise the sales tax from 5 percent to 5.8 percent to fund road repair and construction. Senate Minority Leader Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax, told reporters that McDonnell’s plan would lift some of the tax burden for transportation paid by out-of-state motorists buying gas and put it on the back of Virginians purchasing goods. "There’s no reason for us to put the whole burden on Virginia when one-third of the gasoline is purchased by out-of-state people and now we’re going to give them a free ride," he said on Jan. 9. We see lots of cars with other states’ plates on Virginia’s roads, but do those visitors really account for one-third of the state’s gasoline sales? We asked Saslaw, who once owned service stations in Northern Virginia, to back his claim that out-of-state drivers buy one-third of the gas in the state. He said the Department of Motor Vehicles has estimates showing visitors bought between 26 percent and 35 percent of the gasoline bought in Virginia. We told Saslaw that the DMV denied ownership of the figure asked him if he could identify an official or a report that was his source. He said he could not, saying he did not recall. "I heard it," he said. "It was either the DMV or VDOT." But officials at the Virginia Department of Transportation told us VDOT doesn’t know what percentage of gas is purchased by out-of-state drivers. When he relayed this to Salaw, he said, "We got it from somewhere. I think I read it in the paper." We searched the archives of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post and The Virginian-Pilot and found a few references to a similar statistic. An Emporia City Council member told the governor in August that 40 percent of the fuel bought along I-95 is done so by out-of-state drivers. And fellow Democratic Sen. Ralph Northam said that 35 percent of the fuels tax is paid by out-of-state drivers in an editorial in The Virginian-Pilot in March. But those references do not give any indication of their source. We also turned to the U.S. Department of Transportation, which collects a federal excise tax. But like Virginia, the federal government also collects the levy from wholesalers and doesn’t gather statistics about the end users of gasoline. Jeff Lenard, spokesman for the Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing, said the statistic we were seeking doesn’t exist. We stumbled on a possible source of the mythical figure. Mike O’Connor, president and CEO of the Virginia Petroleum, Convenience and Grocery Association, said he has estimated that visitors purchase 25 to 30 percent of the fuel in Virginia. O’Connor noted that Virginia’s gasoline tax hasn’t increased since 1987. Since then, the number of registered cars in Virginia has increased by 63 percent while fuels tax revenues have gone up by 81 percent. The logical explanation for the different trajectories, he said, is that a large portion of the gas is being purchased by visitors to Virginia. But the amount of fuel used by each vehicle has increased, too. Federal Highway Administration data shows that fuel use per vehicle per year in Virginia increased by 7.8 percent from 1987 to 2010, the most recent year for federal statistics. So the fuel use by vehicles registered in Virginia increased by 77 percent over that time. O’Connor’s estimate is also not too useful because it doesn’t separate diesel, whose tax won’t change, from gasoline, whose tax would with the governor’s proposal. The Federal Highway Administration reports that diesel sales in the state grew 73.6 percent -- from 540.6 million gallons in 1987 to 938.4 million gallons in 2010. Meanwhile, gasoline sales increased 37.5 percent -- from 2.91 billion gallons to 4 billion gallons. So diesel contributed more to the jump in fuels tax revenue than gasoline did. There’s a big difference between how O’Connor and Saslaw make their arguments, however. O’Connor acknowledges up front that his number is an estimate while Saslaw has presented his figure as fact. Republicans have been trying debunk Saslaw’s claim. The McDonnell administration and House Speaker William Howell, R-Stafford, have been circulating a memo from the Virginia Department of Transportation that suggests the portion of gasoline purchased by out-of-state drivers is only about 9 percent. VDOT came to the figure by noting that non-Virginians pay about 9.1 percent of the sales tax collected in the Old Dominion, according to the departments of Taxation and Tourism, and that 9.6 percent of drivers convicted of traffic violations are out-of-state visitors, according to state police. The Transportation Department also tried to construct a mathematical proof. It started with a DMV report that the state, in 2011, had 6.6 million registered passenger vehicles and motorcycles. VDOT multiplied that number by 10,640 -- the average number of miles traveled by passenger vehicles according to the National Household Travel Survey from 2009. The multiplication led VDOT to conclude that Virginians logged about 70.2 billion miles on state roads. That’s short of the 77.1 billion total miles that department had previously estimated. VDOT reasoned that 6.9 million mile gap was filled by out-of-state motorists, who would have accounted for 8.9 percent of all the road travel in Virginia. VDOT’s proof is flawed, however. It assumes that Virginians drive every single mile in their home state. No one knows what percentage of the driving by Virginians occurs inside the state’s borders. If Virginians did one-fourth of their driving out of the state, then under VDOT’s construct, visiting motorists would have accounted for one-third of the miles driven in the Old Dominion. That would give credence to Saslaw’s claim that non-Virginians pay one-third of the gas tax. Our ruling Saslaw, the senate minority leader, said one-third of the gasoline bought in Virginia is purchased by out-of-state motorists. He cited the statistic as a reason he and many other Democrats oppose the governor’s plan to raise money for roads by ending the state gas tax and increasing the sales tax. Saslaw said the plan would diminish Virginia’s ability to tax out-of-state drivers for using its roads and transfer that burden to Virginians. Saslaw offered no credible proof to back his statistic. Each time we asked him, he cited a different possible source: the DMV, the Virginia Department of Transportation, maybe a newspaper article. There’s a good reason none of his possible sources pan out: the statistic does not exist. Virginia taxes gasoline sales at the wholesale level, not at the pumps. So there’s no data on the percentage of gas purchased in Virginia by out-of-state drivers. The burden of proof falls on Saslaw and he comes up empty. We could find no element of truth in his statement, which we rate False.	None	Richard Saslaw	None	None	None	2013-02-05T06:00:00	2013-01-09	['None']

pomt-03415	Recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan are evidence that global warming is leading to "the evaporation of our Great Lakes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/28/richard-durbin/dick-durbin-says-global-warming-leading-evaporatio/	On the same day that President Barack Obama gave a major address on climate change, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, gave a floor speech that drove the issue home for his constituents. "I believe the environment is a challenge we must face head on," Durbin said on June 25, 2013. "To ignore it is to ignore reality. Lake Michigan, when measured just a few months ago, was at its lowest depth in any measured time in recent history. What we are seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes." A reader suggested we check out Durbin’s claim, so we will. The Great Lakes take in water through precipitation, runoff and inflow from upstream bodies of water; they lose it from evaporation or diversion. Both seasonal and longer-term cycles have caused fluctuations since the end of the Ice Age. Over the past 150 years, scientists say, water levels have varied within a relatively narrow, 2-meter range. But the past few decades have produced some important patterns. Lake levels were relatively high from the 1970s to the late 1990s, then fell swiftly in the late 1990s before settling in at a low, but fairly stable, level through today. Durbin is correct that water levels in Lake Michigan were lower in January 2013 than at any time since records began in 1918 -- a full 6 feet lower than the 1986 peak. This is causing worries about wildlife, shipping, recreation and tourism. Several factors tend to increase water loss: • Dredging. The removal of soil and rock to enable ships to pass can encourage lower water levels. Dredging projects going back to the 19th century are estimated to have lowered Lake Michigan by 16 inches, according to the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canada panel on boundary issues. • Erosion. Natural erosion since 1962 may have lowered water levels by an additional 3 to 5 inches, according to the commission. • Diversion. A diversion of Lake Michigan water to Chicago starting in 1900 is estimated to have lowered water levels by about 2 inches, but this has been more than balanced out by two diversions into Lake Superior, which feeds Lake Michigan. Dredging, erosion and diversion have affected today’s low levels by reducing the baseline level, but because there have been no major dredging projects in recent years, these factors have not contributed to recent fluctuations. Other factors more directly related to climate change, however, may have, specifically: • Low precipitation. In 2011 and 2012, the basin feeding the Great Lakes experienced mild winters, which produced lower-than-normal snowpacks, reducing a major source of incoming water in the spring. Dry summers can also provide too little incoming rain to keep levels high. • Higher evaporation. If it’s hot in the summer, water temperatures increase. Then, when cool, dry air comes in the fall, the lakes’ warmer water evaporates in greater quantities, lowering water levels. This can be exaggerated if precipitation levels are already low. Such conditions prevailed last year. • More limited ice cover. In winter, diminished ice cover can mean higher water temperatures, which in turn encourages evaporation. A 2012 study found that the Great Lakes have lost 71 percent of their ice cover since 1973. However, it gets complicated: Scientists say that greater evaporation in the fall can cool lakes, potentially increasing ice coverage the following winter. Durbin’s office pointed to these factors as support for the senator’s claim. "Warmer weather, more severe droughts, higher water temperatures and greater evaporation are, in fact, leading to lower water levels," said Max Gleischman, a spokesman for Durbin. "The lake has seen record-low water levels in recent years at the same time we’ve seen record drought conditions in the region. While temperature, water level and drought conditions have fluctuated over the years, the highs are getting higher and the lows are getting lower." However, scientists we interviewed say Durbin’s claim is an oversimplification. "Attribution of low lake levels to human-caused climate change is rather speculative at this time," said Brent M. Lofgren, a climatologist at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Lofgren said it’s important to look at the pivotal period in the late 1990s. Levels declined suddenly, he said, and since then, have remained fairly steady. The record lows of early 2013, he said, amounted to "a small downward excursion from the levels over the last decade and a half." In fact, after hitting the low point, Lake Michigan saw a 9-inch rise in April -- the second highest monthly increase for April on record. In other words, the water level is still low, but it’s fluctuating, and it’s in roughly the same range it’s been since the late 1990s. This pattern of events doesn’t fit very well with existing models of global warming, which suppose a gradual rise in greenhouse gases, Lofgren said. A sudden change like the one experienced in the late 1990s -- followed by a decade and a half of fairly stable levels -- "is particularly difficult to attribute to a gradual buildup of greenhouse gases," he said. In the meantime, Lofgren said, the modeling of how climate change could affect the Great Lakes in the future has recently undergone a rethinking. A new model developed by Lofgren for how climate changes affect the Great Lakes basin suggests potential water-level declines smaller than previous estimates. The previous consensus for Lake Michigan was a decline of between 10 and 44 inches. The new model suggests anywhere from a decline of 36 inches to a rise of 20 inches, and another recent study indicated losses of 24 inches or less. Why such a wide range of outcomes? It boils down to complexity. Both a 2012 study by the International Joint Commission and the Great Lakes Environmental Assessment and Mapping Project, an independent group, agreed that lower water levels are likelier in the future than higher levels, but they added that varying models leave considerable uncertainty about which outcome will result. "Although climate experts expect evaporation to increase in the future, there is debate over whether or not the Great Lakes would see more precipitation under future climate change scenarios," said John Allis, chief of the Great Lakes Hydraulics and Hydrology Office at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Detroit district. Our ruling Durbin pointed to recent record-low water levels in Lake Michigan as evidence that global warming is leading to "the evaporation of our Great Lakes." Most scientists agree that recent patterns of precipitation, evaporation and ice cover suggest that climate change is affecting water levels in the Great Lakes. But over the long term, dredging and erosion have lowered water levels, and the sudden decline in the late 1990s, followed by a relatively stable decade and a half, doesn’t mesh with the presumed slow buildup of greenhouse gases. In addition, scientific models offer a wide range of possible impacts on water levels due to climate change, from decreases to increases. Because Durbin’s statement is oversimplified and ignores complicating factors, we rate it Half True.	None	Richard Durbin	None	None	None	2013-06-28T09:30:20	2013-06-25	['None']

pomt-08897	"Nobody’s invited us" to the Obama events in Atlanta.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/30/chris-carpenter/barnes-campain-says-former-governor-not-invited-ob/	UPDATE: When we originally published this item, we relied on a source who did not want to be named, which was not consistent with PolitiFact's policies. A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee has since gone on the record. We are re-publishing the item to reflect on-the-record confirmation that Barnes was, in fact, invited to the Obama event. President Barack Obama comes to Atlanta on Monday for a pair of events -- a Democratic fund-raiser and a speech to the Disabled American Veterans convention. But the state's best-known Democrat at the moment, former Gov. Roy Barnes, will not attend. The state's Democratic standard-bearer will instead take his gubernatorial campaign to South Georgia, about as far away from Atlanta as a politician can get on the day a Democratic president comes to visit. When Tim Bryant, who hosts a daily talk show for WGAU (1340 AM) in Athens and also reports for WSB Radio in Atlanta, asked Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter about Barnes' high-profile absence from the Obama events, Carpenter had an explanation. Bryant -- during a WSB news report -- repeated what Carpenter told him. "Nobody’s invited us," Bryant said, quoting what a Barnes campaign spokesman told him during an interview. Bryant confirmed to PolitiFact Georgia the spokesman was Carpenter. But why would Democrats not invite Barnes to one of their highest-profile Georgia events of the year? What follows is a story about the state of state politics in Georgia. It's a saga about the difficulty of being a Democrat running for statewide office in Georgia, a state where Republicans rule. Listed as the contact on the fund-raiser invitation is Kristin Oblander, who raised money for Barnes from 1998 to 2002, according to her Web site. On that site Oblander is listed as president of the Oblander Group LLC, a "prominent Democratic fundraising firm specializing in Democratic campaign fundraising." PolitiFact attempted to get in touch with Oblander, but she did not return our calls. Her office referred us to the Washington press office for the Democratic National Committee, which is helping host the Obama fund-raiser. "Gov. Barnes was invited to the fundraiser, but unfortunately he had a prior commitment and could not attend," said Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Joanne Peters. Invitations had not been sent out for the other part of Obama's Atlanta visit, the president's speech to the veterans convention. This is an official White House event, while the fund-raiser is hosted by the Democratic National Committee. Democratic candidates are usually invited to fund-raisers, but not necessarily to events like the president's speech before the veterans group. So what's going on here? Barnes has been a loyal Democrat for years, giving generously to a long list of candidates and Democratic organizations. Federal Election Commission records show he gave the DNC $10,000 in 2009 and $15,000 in 2004. He initially backed former U.S. Sen. John Edwards for president in 2008 but threw his support and checkbook behind Obama when Edwards bailed out of the race. Federal election records show Barnes gave $2,300 to "Obama for America" on Aug. 30, 2008, and on Sept. 23, 2008, gave $2,500 to the "Obama Victory Fund." The former governor even gave Obama money six years ago, before the former senator rocketed onto the nation stage -- FEC records shows Barnes gave $1,000 to "Obama for Illinois Inc." on June 2, 2004. Barnes is certainly the kind of guy the Democrats like to have at their fund-raisers. But political scientists say the Obama visit is a political minefield for the former governor, who lost to Republican underdog Sonny Perdue in 2002. If you are a no-show for Obama's visit, it might not play well with the president's supporters. But if you go, you might alienate conservatives and give your Republican opponent ammo for the November election. "I'm sure he [Barnes] wishes Barack Obama would not come to Atlanta right now," said Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor. Obama lost Georgia to John McCain in 2008 even though a historically large number of African Americans turned out to vote for the president. Nationally, Obama's popularity has declined since the election, and perhaps even more so in a conservative state like Georgia, Bullock said. "To get elected, Barnes not only has to get Democratic votes, but he has to attract independents, and polls show independents have been moving away from Obama," Bullock said. Translation: The last thing the Barnes campaign needs right now is a photo of the former governor at an Obama fund-raiser. "Barnes knows he will be attacked [by Republicans] as a liberal, and he will deny that," Bullock said. "But if there is a photo showing him in a man-hug with Barack Obama, that would be taken by a lot of Georgia voters as affirming the charge that Barnes is a liberal. "It's a great shorthand for the Republicans to get that message across." PolitiFact Georgia also contacted Carpenter, who responded with an e-mail. "We were not invited to the President’s official event," Carpenter wrote. "By the time I learned of the president’s visit, I had to make a difficult decision on how to best utilize Governor Barnes’ time and travel. With less than 100 days until the election, I decided to keep his commitments in middle and south Georgia." When PolitiFact Georgia asked what he meant by "official event" Carpenter e-mailed the same response. Carpenter said he was talking about the veterans event when asked whether Barnes had been invited to Obama's Atlanta appearance, rather than the fund-raiser. But we believe that most people, hearing the remarks on the radio or seeing them in the e-mail he sent us, would believe he was referring to both of the president's appearances. Which brings us back to the central question of this quest. Was Barnes invited to any Obama event while the president is in town? The people doing the inviting said Barnes was indeed invited to the Obama fund-raiser. It would be bizarre if Barnes were not on the invitation list since he has been a contributor to both Obama and the DNC. PolitiFact Georgia smells smoke on this one.

pomt-02649	"Trey Radel does not even qualify to drive a Lee County school bus at this point, yet he occupies a seat in Congress."	true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/15/mike-scott/sheriff-says-trey-radels-cocaine-conviction-means-/	U.S. Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fort Myers, is back to work in Congress following a few weeks in rehab after he got busted for cocaine possession in Washington. He’s lucky he has that job, some say. With a drug arrest on his record, he wouldn’t be eligible for a host of other gigs -- like driving a bus in his own district. Radel’s conviction prompted some high-profile Republicans to call for his ouster. Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott, who was mentioned as a potential opponent, announced on Facebook Jan. 11 that he won’t run. But Scott vowed to be a "staunch advocate for his political replacement" and unleashed this attack: "While Radel returned to his congressional office following a microwave stint in rehab and a gaggle of rehearsed apologies, I have hundreds of inmates in our jail that are unable to return to their home due to similar or lesser drug offenses," Scott said on Facebook. "The sad reality is that Trey Radel does not even qualify to drive a Lee County school bus at this point, yet he occupies a seat in Congress....." Scott’s Facebook post was reported by multiple news outlets. Is Scott correct that Radel’s cocaine possession conviction means he would not meet the qualifications to drive a Lee County school bus? Radel’s misdemeanor conviction On Oct. 29, Radel was nabbed after he bought 3.5 grams of cocaine for $260 from an undercover agent in the District of Columbia. He then brought agents to his apartment where he handed over a vial of cocaine. Radel kept his case quiet until it reached court a few weeks later -- and then the news exploded about the 37-year-old TV reporter turned tea party freshman busted for cocaine. (We emailed a Radel spokesman to alert him to our fact-check and did not get a reply.) On Nov. 20, Radel pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession and was sentenced to one year of probation. Radel spent about a month in rehab and returned to Congress in early January. Radel was charged under the District of Columbia’s Uniformed Controlled Substances Act, which divides controlled substances into five graded schedules, U.S. Attorney spokesman William Miller told PolitiFact. "The most dangerous controlled substances are contained in Schedule I, with incrementally less serious offenses in Schedules II through V. Cocaine -- both in crack and powder form -- is in Schedule II. Possession of any controlled substance other than PCP without intent to distribute is a misdemeanor," Miller said in an email. Possession with intent to distribute most controlled substances would result in a felony. In 2012, the U.S. attorney in D.C. charged 700 people with misdemeanor possession of cocaine. Most pleaded guilty like Radel and entered a diversion program or had their cases dismissed. Only a small fraction received jail time (Radel didn’t). If Radel had been arrested for cocaine possession in Florida, he would have faced a felony. "Possession of cocaine in any amount is a felony in Florida," Scott said in an email. Three and a half grams "would constitute a third-degree felony, while greater quantities and/or trafficking amounts can escalate the degree of seriousness." In Florida, "even residue is a felony," said Broward public defender Howard Finkelstein. Some Florida counties don’t prosecute residue cases, but prosecutors do in Broward, and first-time offenders typically get adjudication withheld and probation, he said. Across the country, a misdemeanor drug possession statute isn’t unusual, though felonies appear to be more of the norm. Last year, California considered a bill that would have made possession a "wobbler," meaning it could have been charged as a misdemeanor or a felony. A bill analysis said that 13 states plus the District of Columbia have misdemeanor drug possession laws. (Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed the bill.) There are differences in states’ laws depending on whether it relates to a first-time offender, the particular drug or other factors. "Every state gets to totally make up its own penal code, and it shows," said Margaret Dooley-Sammuli, a senior policy advocate for the American Civil Liberties Union in California, which advocated for the bill. School bus drivers On the unlikely chance that Radel plans to apply to be a Lee County school district bus driver, would his conviction mean he wouldn’t qualify? Lee County school district won’t hire an individual -- including a bus driver -- who has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge less than five years ago or a felony drug charge less than 10 years old, or someone who is currently on probation, said Ranice Monroe, the school district’s director of professional standards and equity. Even if a defendant gets an adjudication withheld, the district won’t hire the individual, Monroe said. "Our standards are high," Monroe said. "We don’t make exceptions." If someone was already a bus driver and then pleaded guilty to a drug charge the employee would face discipline including the potential of being fired, Monroe said. "What we perceive is you are taking drugs, which is a violation of our rules," she said. We also contacted spokespersons for a few other Florida school districts to ask if a cocaine possession conviction would make a school bus driver candidate ineligible. Miami-Dade County has a similar policy to Lee County. Broward likely wouldn’t hire such an individual, said spokeswoman Nadine Drew. Pasco schools’ guidelines call for a committee review but not automatic denial of employment for drug convictions. However, a recent cocaine possession conviction would likely disqualify someone, spokeswoman Linda Cobbe said. School bus drivers must have a commercial driver's license. A cocaine possession plea "in and of itself would not necessarily prevent a person from obtaining a CDL or result in a revocation of a CDL," John Lucas, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles told PolitiFact in an email. "That decision would have to come from the courts. However, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles could take action if the person was found to be in possession of cocaine while operating a commercial vehicle." Our ruling In a Facebook post vowing to advocate for Radel’s replacement, Scott said, "The sad reality is that Trey Radel does not even qualify to drive a Lee County school bus at this point, yet he occupies a seat in Congress." Radel was convicted of misdemeanor cocaine possession in Washington. If he had been charged in Florida he would have faced a felony. Under the unlikely scenario that Radel’s future career plans include applying for a job as a Lee County school bus driver, the district’s policies state that it won’t hire anyone currently on probation or who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge within the past five years, or a felony drug charge in the past decade. Radel’s future as a congressman may be in the hands of the voters of Southwest Florida. But Scott is correct that Radel’s drug conviction has put the brakes on him becoming a bus driver. We rate this claim True.	None	Mike Scott	None	None	None	2014-01-15T17:31:06	2014-01-11	['United_States_Congress', 'Lee_County,_Florida']

pomt-09407	The Democratic health care bill will "collect higher taxes for 10 years and provide health care for only six years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/19/todd-tiahrt/tiahrt-health-care-bill-will-collect-10-years-taxe/	In the debate over health care reform, Republicans have often charged that the Democrats are cooking the books. In a House floor speech on March 16, 2010, Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., said that Democrats claim "that the Obama health care bill will reduce the debt and help balance the budget, but reviewing those calculations shows that they’re going to collect higher taxes for 10 years and provide health care for only six years. Imagine that. Isn’t that a little misleading? Four years of health care taxes with no health care." We decided to look at whether the Democratic bill does in fact provide just six years of coverage while drawing on 10 years of taxes. We'll begin by cautioning that health care experts -- including the nonpartisan arbiters at the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary -- continue to pore over the newest version of the much-rewritten bill, leaving the analysis a work in progress. In addition, Tiahrt made his comments two days before the key analyses were released. But the broad outline of the bill was known at the time of his speech, and we do know enough to draw some conclusions. On a number of fronts, Tiahrt and his Republican colleagues are correct. But the comment does not tell the whole story. Two of the highest-profile and significant elements of the bill start in 2014. The virtual marketplaces known as the health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through a large employer to buy affordable plans. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange. In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And the shrinking of the "doughnut hole" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- would be phased in over 10 years. And, yes, some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan do start well before 2014. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning would begin immediately, and an escalating annual fee on drugmakers would begin in 2011. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- would also be hit with certain exclusions and limits beginning in 2011. However, the bill would also do many things immediately to boost coverage, while delaying the start of major new taxes until several years down the road. Some of the benefits that will be introduced within the first year: • Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost. • Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a "high-risk pool" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014. • Assistance for early retirees. Starting in 2010, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare. • Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers will have to accept dependent coverage for children up to age 26. • No more rescissions. Existing plans would no longer be able to terminate beneficiaries when they get sick. • Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans would have to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting in 2011, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid will be eliminated. Meanwhile, some of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years. • Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in in 2013. • Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013. • Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014. • Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016. • "Cadillac tax." The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They only start getting big in 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019. Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care. Meanwhile, on the coverage side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to CMS's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage. So Tiahrt is correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation begins well before that. But he makes it sound like all the taxes hit immediately and there are no significant benefits in the first four years. In fact, there are some benefits that begin immediately, and the taxes levied in the early years account for a small percentage of the total dollars involved. So we find his claim Half True.

pomt-10120	"Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/15/john-mccain/obamas-been-critical-of-nafta/	During a discussion of climate change and energy imports during the third presidential debate, Sen. John McCain detoured briefly to Canada. McCain attacked Sen. Barack Obama's position on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Here's his claim in context: "I think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine," McCain said during the Oct. 15, 2008, debate. "By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, 'Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.' You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them." What we take McCain's claim to mean is that Obama said he would renegotiate NAFTA whether or not Canada and Mexico – the other signatories to the trade agreement – want to do so, or renegotiate in such a way as to impose additional burdens on them but not on the United States. It's true that Obama has been harshly critical of NAFTA on the campaign trail, citing shortfalls in its protections for workers and the environment. He has used words like "devastating" and "a big mistake" to describe the agreement. Obama was particularly critical of NAFTA in February in the run-up to the Ohio Democratic primary. In a debate, he said, "We should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced." In a June 20, 2008 conference call with reporters, Obama surrogate Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat, said he was "absolutely confident Barack Obama will reopen the negotiations on NAFTA. I have been assured by him and his top economic advisers there is no question his position is constant and will stay that way on the North American Free Trade Agreement." But would Obama do so "unilaterally"? In a June interview with Fortune magazine, he indicated he would not. "I'm not a big believer in doing things unilaterally," he told the magazine of his plans on NAFTA. "I'm a big believer in opening up a dialogue and figuring out how we can make this work for all people." It's difficult to reconcile these two stands. There's little indication Canada wants to renegotiate the agreement, so it's not clear how Obama would do so without initiating the negotiation "unilaterally." Perhaps it was a bit misleading for McCain to highlight Obama's harsher rhetoric on NAFTA instead of his softer stance. But only a bit – the fact is, Obama has often spoken of NAFTA in such a way that a fair listener would conclude he would press to renegotiate it regardless of how the other parties feel. Characterizing that as a "unilateral" renegotiation, though not the clearest language in the world, was a pretty fair shorthand for McCain to use. We find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-13776	Says North Carolina is "home of the largest military installations in the world."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/21/north-carolina-republican-party/does-north-carolina-have-largest-military-bases/	The U.S. spends far more than any other country in the world on its military. And at the Republican National Convention, the North Carolina Republican Party proudly announced that the Tar Heel State, more than any other, is a reflection of those policies. "The land of the longleaf pine, the land where the summer sun doth shine, where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great," said N.C. delegate John Steward, introducing the state during roll call. "North Carolina, home of the largest military installations in the world." True or not, a claim about military bases pales in comparison to getting your own state capital wrong, like the Nevada delegation did. But still, we were intrigued. Does North Carolina really have the world’s largest military installations? We’ll narrow this claim down to just the largest U.S. bases in the world. It’s impossible to accurately verify how large various Chinese, Indian, Russian and North Korean bases (the only countries with militaries comparable in size to the U.S.) might be. Different metrics What does it mean to be the largest military base? Biggest land area? Most air space? Most active-duty military members? Largest population in total? The most buildings and square footage? The most expensive facilities? Those are all good indicators, although we’ll give the most weight to a base’s geographic size and, especially, its military population. For data on physical size and cost, we relied on a 2009 report the Department of Defense compiled on its sprawling infrastructure. The U.S. has the world’s largest military footprint, with hundreds of bases spanning the globe from Asia to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and South America. So where does North Carolina stack up? Two North Carolina bases are among the largest in their respective branches in terms of military population, as well as facility value – the Army’s Fort Bragg and the Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune. However both of them are dwarfed, in area, by other bases out West. Still, we’re more concerned with military strength than with area, so that’s pretty convincing. But are North Carolina’s the absolute largest, or just among the biggest? Army Fort Bragg in Fayetteville is home to the 82nd Airborne and a host of other units ranging from intelligence to artillery. People there are fond of saying it has more generals than anywhere but the Pentagon, but that’s a fact check for another day. We just want to know how big it is. At about 153,000 acres, it trails Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia. And all of them are puny compared to the 900,000-acre Fort Wainwright in Alaska. But Bragg’s population is the largest of any base in any branch of the military – not just the Army. Back in 2010, PolitiFact looked into a claim by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who said Hood was the biggest. He got a Half True because some days Bragg had more people, and other days Hood did. But as the war on terror has gone on, special forces are more in vogue, and Fort Bragg is where many of those units are based. As of 2015 it was substantially larger than Fort Hood. Bragg had 53,660 soldiers last year, according to the Fayetteville Observer, while Hood had 40,820 according to the Killeen Daily Herald. It’s also possible that some soldiers at Bragg might not be included in official counts, since even their units’ names are sometimes kept secret. Bragg is home to the Joint Special Operations Command, in which Navy SEALs, Army Delta Force and other secretive groups often team up with CIA operatives for sensitive missions. A small airfield in nearby Johnston County was likely once a major piece of the CIA’s "extraordinary rendition" program. Bragg’s entire population of soldiers and civilians is about 140,000 people. If it were a city, it would be one of the largest in North Carolina. So North Carolina has America’s largest single military installation. But the roll call statement said it has the world’s largest installations, plural. So let’s keep looking. Marines North Carolina’s second-biggest base is the Marine Corps’ Camp Lejeune. Is it also the country’s second-biggest? No. In fact, it’s not even the biggest Marine Corps base. The largest, in terms of area and population, are both in California. Twentynine Palms has a relatively small population but covers 650,000 acres, and Camp Pendleton has more Marines than Lejeune – although that hasn’t always been the case. Lejeune had more Marines in 2008, with about 48,000 compared to 42,000 at Pendleton. But by 2013, according to Marine Corps reports, Pendleton has risen to 46,000, compared to 41,000 at Lejeune. And what about the other branches of the military? North Carolina has no significant Navy presence, let alone anything that could compete with the 44,000 sailors at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia. The Air Force and Coast Guard have some medium-sized bases in North Carolina, but Air Force bases in Nevada and Florida are significantly larger, and the Coast Guard only says its Elizabeth City base is is "one of the busiest" and even then, just in terms of air operations. Our ruling The N.C. GOP introduced itself at the Republican National Convention as hailing from the state with "the largest military installations in the world." North Carolina does have Fort Bragg, which has more active-duty troops than any base in the Army – or any other branch of the military, for that matter. Camp Lejeune is also large, although it’s not the biggest Marine Corps base anymore. In terms of physical size, none of the state’s bases are even close to the biggest. And its Air Force and Navy bases don’t stack up in any category of largeness. A little bit of bluster is to be expected during roll call statements, which are often filled with local pride. But North Carolina’s, while exaggerated, has definite merit – due in large part to Fort Bragg. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04643	Ann Kuster "supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/12/charles-bass/charlie-bass-attacks-anne-kuster-and-obamacare-tv-/	U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass survived a challenge from four opponents in this week’s Republican primary. But, even as the election approached, Bass was already focusing his attacks more on his Democratic challenger, Concord attorney Ann McLane Kuster. In an ad released August 27, 2012, Bass, a Peterborough Republican, attacks Kuster, his opponent in the 2010 campaign, for being a hyper-liberal partisan, citing her support for the national health care reform law as evidence. "She supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion," a narrator says in the ad, titled "Not Working." "Annie, that’s not working together," the narrator scolds. "That’s not working for any of us." Kuster, who lostto Bass by 1.6 percent of the vote in the 2010 campaign, has been outspoken in her support of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. In August of 2010, as referenced in Bass’ ad, she told WMUR-TV "I think health care reform was a historic first step." "Thirty million Americans will now have health insurance … and we've prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage right when you need it most," she said at the time. But, does her support for the Affordable Care Act really translate to support for a government takeover of health care? And does the health care law really "rob" $700 billion from Medicare? According to past PolitiFact rulings, the answer is no. In past rulings, PolitiFact has disagreed strongly with the classification of the Affordable Care Act as a government takeover of healthcare. In recent months, these rulings have ranged from False to Pants on Fire, and in 2010, PolitiFact editors named the claim its Lie of the Year. In that ruling, PolitiFact reported that the term "government takeover" refers to a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are public employees. By contrast, under the Affordable Care Act, the government will not take control of hospitals or doctors. Employers will continue to provide health insurance to most patients through private insurance companies, and the law does not include a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers, the article noted. "The label 'government takeover’ has no basis in reality, but instead reflects a political dynamic where conservatives label any increase in government authority in health care as a ‘takeover.," Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said at the time. Looking to the second part of Bass’ statement, PolitiFact has also taken issue with similar claims about the Affordable Care Act robbing Medicare. Last month, for instance, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney earned a Mostly False rating for his claim that Obama "robbed Medicare (of) $716 billion to pay for for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare." In this fact-check,PolitiFact noted that neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut any money from the Medicare budget. Instead, the law included a number of changes seeking to lower future Medicare costs. Initially, the Congressional Budget Office estimated those reductions to total about $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. But, more recently, the CBO updated its projected reductions to about $716 billion between 2013 and 2022. Bass references this updated figure in his attack on Kuster, but neither in his ad, nor in Romney’s claim, can these spending reductions be reasonably considered "robbing." As noted in the Romney piece, Democrats included the Medicare cuts in the law to avoid adding to the deficit, and the proposal was debated in the open for many weeks as it made its way through Congress. Several days after his initial claim, Romney made another reference to the Medicare cuts, this time says that the president’s plan "cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare." PolitiFact rated that statement Half True, saying that, although Romney’s got his numbers right, his claim suggests that the law re-routes funding already allocated to Medicare to finance the health care law. As noted before, the law works to reduce future Medicare spending and frees up savings that are then used to offset the costs of the health care law. As a sidenote, PolitiFact has also ruled that Romney’s vice presidential nominee, U.S. Rep Paul Ryan, relies on the same $700 billion in Medicare savings in his own budget plan. Our Ruling: Had Bass been careful in his wording, there might have been some truth to his claims. Kuster has expressed support for the Affordable Care Act, and the law has been shown to reduce Medicare spending by $700 billion. But, instead, the Congressman repeated past claims that the Care Act constitutes a "government takeover" of health care, and that it "robs" $700 billion from Medicare. The government takeover part is so wrong it's been rated Pants on Fire; the Medicare part is Mostly False. On balance, we rate the full claim False.

pomt-06230	Says Barack Obama had "huge majorities" in Congress during his first two years in office and "did nothing with them to create jobs in America."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-barack-obama-did-nothing-t/	Billions of dollars began pumping through the American economy in 2009 as part of the stimulus program started by President Barack Obama, but somehow Gov. Chris Christie missed that. While campaigning on Nov. 9 in New Hampshire for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Christie took to the airwaves and summed up in one word what the president did to spur job growth during the first half of his tenure: nothing. "But remember this: (Obama) can complain about Republicans in the House as much as he wants," Christie said during an interview on the "New Hampshire Today" radio show. "But in the first two years, he had, you know, huge majorities in the House and Senate, and did nothing with them to create jobs in America." Nothing was done to create jobs? Research by PolitiFact New Jersey shows that Christie’s statement ignores the impact of a major piece of federal legislation aimed at creating and saving jobs: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Signed into law less than a month into Obama’s presidency, the stimulus bill allocated about $787 billion in federal spending and tax benefits. By Sept. 30 of this year, about $5.5 billion had been awarded to recipients in New Jersey alone. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and other independent economists, the stimulus bill has created or saved jobs. Funding recipients also have reported jobs supported by stimulus dollars. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Here’s what some of the economic research shows: Compared to what would have happened otherwise, the stimulus bill increased the number of people employed by between 1 million and 2.9 million in the second quarter of 2011, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, projected that without the stimulus bill, the country would have had 1.75 million fewer jobs as of the third quarter of 2011. "The debate is how much, not whether it had a benefit," Zandi said. Daniel Wilson, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has estimated that stimulus spending created or saved 3.4 million jobs by March 2011. Ohio State University economics professor Bill Dupor offered another projection. Due to the stimulus bill, there were 870,000 private-sector jobs and 510,000 government jobs in place in December 2010, said Dupor, who made the analysis with University of Western Ontario economics professor Tim Conley. "Thus, Tim and I are finding some jobs created/saved as a result of the ARRA," Dupor said in a series of emails. "At this stage, Tim and I don’t have any projections based on plausible assumptions that say there was a net job loss." Another snapshot of the stimulus bill’s impact on jobs can be found at the government-run website -- recovery.gov -- which tracks jobs funded by stimulus dollars, as reported by certain recipients in each state. Between July 1 and Sept. 30, there were more than 6,300 full-time equivalent jobs in New Jersey funded by the stimulus in that quarter, according to the website. Our ruling In a radio interview, Christie claimed that in Obama’s first two years, the president had "huge majorities in the House and Senate, and did nothing with them to create jobs in America." But Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress did do something, governor. It’s called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a stimulus bill that various economists credit with creating or saving jobs. That’s why it is ridiculous for Christie to claim Obama did "nothing." Pants on Fire!

pomt-12761	"Obamacare covers 24 million fewer people than it was expected to, and the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/feb/24/reps-keith-rothfus-mike-kelly-and-bill-shuster/bad-math-behind-3-pa-gop-congressmens-obamacare-cl/	Three Republican congressmen from Pennsylvania circulated an op-ed criticizing the Affordable Care Act and touting an alternative health care plan that "will expand the options for individuals and families to access affordable insurance coverage." In the three-byline op-ed titled, "Relief from Obamacare: a better system ahead," Rep. Keith Rothfus, R-12th, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-3rd, and Rep. Bill Shuster, R-9th, claimed that "Obamacare covers 24 million fewer people than it was expected to, and the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion." But that didn’t sound anything like figures that have come from both sides of the aisle: that some 20 million people are now insured and wouldn’t have been if it weren’t for the Affordable Care Act. So we decided to check the claim. Kate Rosario, a spokeswoman for Rothfus, said the numbers "all come from the Congressional Budget Office" and cited three articles — two from The Weekly Standard and one from the Washington Examiner — about CBO figures. The CBO is the nonpartisan arm of Congress charged with determining how much legislative proposals will cost the federal government. Sometimes its projections change as circumstances change (as we’ll see), but PolitiFact considers it a standard for fact-checking claims. Let’s look first at the number of people covered under the Affordable Care Act. In March 2010, the CBO released its cost projections before the law’s final passage. At the time, it estimated the following would occur by 2016: 159 million people would have insurance through their employer 24 million people would have non-group or "other" health insurance 52 million people would be covered under Medicaid and CHIP 21 million people would obtain insurance through the healthcare exchange/ marketplace 22 million people would be uninsured By 2016, those projections had changed. At that point, the Supreme Court had ruled Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act could be left up to the states, changing some projections about who would enroll and how they would do it. The projections by 2016 — the last available full report, according to a CBO spokeswoman — were: 155 million people would have insurance through their employer Nine million people would have non-group or "other" health insurance 68 million people would be covered under Medicaid and CHIP (11 million of whom newly qualified under the Affordable Care Act) 12 million people would obtain insurance through the healthcare exchange/ marketplace 27 million people would be uninsured That means that in 2010, the CBO estimated 21 million people would be covered under exchanges by 2016. Six years later, it’s 12 million, but an additional 11 million people qualified for Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. That means those covered under Obamacare was actually about two million people higher than the projections. So where’d that 24 million number come from? Rosario referenced a Weekly Standard article from March 2016 titled, "CBO Misses Its Obamacare Projection by 24 Million People." In the article, the reporter wrote that in 2013, CBO estimated the ACA would result in "201 million people having private health insurance." By 2016, that estimate decreased to 177 million. The article later states that "[n]one of this is to say that fewer people have ‘coverage’ under Obamacare — it’s just not private coverage." Rothfus and his colleagues didn’t qualify that in their op-ed, though. They wrote only that Obamacare covered 24 million fewer people than it expected to. In reality, it covers slightly more people than it was expected to. The piece of their claim that asserted "the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion" is a bit more complicated. In 2010, the CBO projected that between 2010 and 2019, the gross cost of the ACA to the federal government would be $938 billion, a number used by former President Obama. In its March 2016 report, the CBO estimated that between 2016 and 2026 — a similar length of time but a different time period — the gross cost of coverage provisions would be $1.9 trillion. Rosario blamed the discrepancy on Democrats, saying the original figure provided by the CBO in 2010 was a "gimmick to make the cost of the bill look less up front than it would end up being." But cherry-picking those figures from either side of the aisle leaves out some key points. First, the CBO’s estimates for 2010 through 2019 included the first four years after the Act’s passage when spending was negligible, as the healthcare exchange didn’t launch until fall 2013 and Medicaid expansion was still being worked out in individual states. It makes more sense to compare the same years over a smaller time frame. In 2010, the CBO estimated that costs related to the Affordable Care Act would total $623 billion between 2016 and 2019. By March 2016, the projection had actually decreased to $157 billion, or by about 25 percent. The decrease in costs can be partially attributed to the Supreme Court’s decision that Medicaid expansion was optional for states. When taken year-by-year once the Act was in full effect, the CBO’s 2010 projections were actually above what they are now. The CBO wrote in a recent report that "for 2019, for example, CBO and [the Joint Committee on Taxation] projected in March 2010 that the ACA’s insurance coverage provisions would have a net federal cost of $172 billion; the current projections show a cost of $123 billion — a reduction of $49 billion, or 28 percent." That checks out. In the CBO’s March 2010 report, it projected the gross cost of coverage provisions in 2019 would be $214 billion. Last year’s report projects the gross cost of coverage provisions in 2019 will be $164 billion, a decrease of $50 billion. The CBO has also warned against using the gross cost of coverage provisions (that’s the $1.9 trillion figure) to assert the "price tag" of the Affordable Care Act. That’s because the Act includes a number of tax provisions, penalty assessments and decreases in Medicare payments to hospitals that both bring in revenue and decrease overall costs. The CBO contends that because of that, the ACA is still expected to, on the net, reduce budget deficits. Representatives from both Kelly’s and Shuster’s offices did not respond to requests for comment. Our Ruling Three Republican congressmen wrote in an op-ed that "Obamacare covers 24 million fewer people than it was expected to, and the projected price tag has more than doubled at $2 trillion." Obamacare actually covers slightly more people than it was expected to. Fewer people are expected to be covered by private health insurance, but the congressmen conflated that with the Affordable Care Act in totality. In addition, the projected gross cost of the ACA over a 10-year span has more than doubled to reach nearly $2 trillion, but original projections included several years in which spending was negligible. To assert that the "price tag" of Obamacare is $2 trillion is itself a misleading statement that ignores other provisions of the act that offset those costs.

pomt-13046	"Slavery is still allowable under Wisconsin law as long as it’s a punishment for a crime."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/25/lena-taylor/even-if-not-practiced-slavery-still-allowable-wisc/	State Sen. Lena Taylor has made a promise for when the Wisconsin Legislature starts its next session, in January 2017. "I am reintroducing my slavery ban," the Milwaukee Democrat declared. Which suggests that slavery can be legal in Wisconsin -- a claim we want to check. Here’s more of what Taylor said while making the pledge Oct. 13, 2016 in an opinion column headlined, "Legalized slavery in Wisconsin": "There is absolutely no compelling reason for the State of Wisconsin to allow slavery. Period," Taylor wrote on Madison365.com, a site devoted to the Madison area’s communities of color. "But did you know slavery is still allowable under Wisconsin law as long as it’s a punishment for a crime?" She added: "I don’t care what you do or who you are, nobody deserves a life of enslavement. Nobody gets to own another person. I hope we can all agree on that. In practice, this amendment allows our prisons to exploit incarcerated individuals and force them to work without pay. Now I need to be clear on one thing – Wisconsin’s Department of Corrections does not currently use slave labor. But they could. And they would be fully within their legal rights to do so." So, is "slavery" legal in Wisconsin "as long as it’s a punishment for a crime"? Slavery in the news Surprisingly, slavery was repeatedly in the news in Wisconsin in 2016. More surprisingly, each time it was due to a candidate for the state Supreme Court. Liberal state appeals court judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who was running against conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley for the high court, misspoke by saying at a candidate forum that Abraham Lincoln had slaves. "I don't remember what I was thinking when I said it," she said later. During that campaign it was revealed that Bradley, while in college writing for her student newspaper, compared the practice of abortion to the Holocaust and slavery. Gov. Scott Walker later appointed lawyer Daniel Kelly to the Supreme Court. In his application, Kelly included a writing in which he said: "Affirmative action and slavery differ, obviously, in significant ways. But it's more a question of degree than principle, for they both spring from the same taproot." Now, let’s see how Taylor’s slavery statement stacks up on the Truth-O-Meter. Wisconsin Constitution To back her claim, Taylor cites the Wisconsin Constitution, which was approved by state voters in 1848. Section 2 of Article 1, entitled "Slavery prohibited," says: "There shall be neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude in this state, otherwise than for the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." (Taylor says she will introduce a constitutional amendment that would end Section 2 at the word state. If the amendment passes the Legislature, which is controlled by Walker’s fellow Republicans, in the next two legislative sessions, it would go to voters in a referendum in 2020.) Wisconsin’s Section 2 essentially mirrors the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery. "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." So, both constitutions ban slavery, but they specify an exception for the punishment of a convicted criminal. Two Marquette University law professors whose specialties include constitutional law told us it is lawful for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections to force prison inmates to work without pay. But it’s not absolute. Scott Idleman told us the work must be reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest, such as rehabilitation -- that is, it cannot be cruel and unusual, or arbitrary. He also made the point that while slavery can be considered to be forced labor without pay, it is not the same as chattel slavery (people owned as property) that existed before the 13th Amendment. His colleague Alan Madry provided a couple of examples. Requiring inmates to work in the prison laundry isn’t cruel and unusual, or arbitrary; cleaning up litter along the highway is probably within the law, too. Although there are no state Supreme Court opinions on how far the Department of Corrections could go, the department likely could not rent out inmates to private businesses to do work solely for the benefit of that business, he said. The Department of Corrections told us prison inmates are not required to work. Those who work are paid 5 cents to $2 an hour, depending on the assignment. The department sometimes requires inmates to work for no pay, but only as a penalty for violating prison rules. Our rating Referring to prison inmates, Taylor said: "Slavery is still allowable under Wisconsin law as long as it’s a punishment for a crime." Prison inmates aren’t owned and they cannot be forced into labor based on skin color. But slavery can also be considered as being forced into unpaid labor. And Wisconsin does have the legal authority to require inmates to work for no pay, although in practice it does so only when inmates violate prison rules. We rate Taylor’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0848bdf3-e68f-4de8-9a7a-9cfbfec543a3	None	Lena Taylor	None	None	None	2016-11-25T06:00:00	2016-10-13	['None']
pomt-01404	"The CBO says if we raise the minimum wage the way Charlie (Crist) wants to do it, it would lose 500,000 jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/10/rick-scott/would-raising-minimum-wage-cost-500000-jobs/	The minimum wage has long been a dividing line in the race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist in the governor’s race, so it’s not surprising that it emerged during the first of three televised debates. During the Oct. 10, 2014, debate hosted by the Spanish-language network Telemundo, a panelist asked Scott if he favors keeping Florida’s minimum wage at $7.93 or raising it. After bringing up his family’s money problems growing up, the multimillionaire governor said he does not support raising the minimum wage because he wants more jobs in the state. He cited a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). "I want more jobs. And that’s why I ran on 7 steps to 700,000 jobs. The CBO says that if we raise the minimum wage the way Charlie wants to do it, it would lose 500,000 jobs," Scott said. "I don’t want to lose those jobs." The context here is important; Scott used the 500,000 number while talking about Florida jobs. As we'll see, that number applies nationwide. Crist has said he would "fight every way I possibly can to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour." This mirrors an amount eyed by President Barack Obama, who has pushed to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25 to $10.10 over two years. In 2016, it would be tied to inflation. (States can set their minimum wage higher than the federal rate, the minimum wage in Florida automatically increased in 2014 to $7.93 because it is tied to inflation.) The CBO analyzed Obama’s proposal in a February 2014 report that provided a mixed bag of political talking points. It studied the effect of the policy on the national workforce and did not provide a state-by-state breakdown. People who support raising the minimum wage can highlight the CBO finding that 16.5 million low-wage workers would earn more money a week under Obama’s proposal. People who don’t like raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10, like Scott, can point to the fact that CBO said it would cost the country an estimated 500,000 jobs as businesses shoulder new employee costs. This figure is not precise. The analysts at CBO cushioned their findings by saying the number of lost jobs from the $10.10 hourly policy could range from a "very slight" decrease in employment to a loss of 1 million jobs. Back then, a top White House economic adviser pushed back on the findings, telling reporters the CBO report "goes outside of the consensus view" of economists who study the influence of higher minimum wages on employment. The Scott campaign directed us to a page for communities on Crist’s website, African Americans for Charlie. The page says he will increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for state workers and contractors "and fight to raise it for all Floridians." Scott campaign spokeswoman Jackie Schutz acknowledged the CBO report applies to federal minimum wage workers, not just Florida minimum-wage earners, but the effect of job losses "would certainly happen in Florida." In Crist’s "Fair Shot Florida," a policy road map for middle-class families, he said he will immediately urge the Legislature to pass a minimum wage of $10.10 -- a nod to how powerless he is to actually enact this for all Floridians, as it would likely not be popular in the state’s Republican-dominated Legislature. Our ruling Scott said, "The CBO says if we raise the minimum wage the way Charlie wants to do it, it would lose 500,000 jobs." Scott is referencing the CBO’s rough estimate for the effect of Obama’s plan to lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour on employment. It’s not necessarily what would happen, as he said, but what could happen. In other words, a loss of 500,000 jobs is the agency’s best guess, and other possibilities include a slight effect on jobs to about 1 million lost jobs. More importantly, its analysis pertained to the country as a whole. Scott's comments came in a discussion about Florida jobs, which means the number is being taken out of context. The average Floridian may not know that the CBO report does not apply to "the way Charlie wants" to raise the minimum wage in Florida. Florida’s minimum wage is slightly higher at $7.93 in 2014. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-10T17:45:11	2014-10-10	['None']

pomt-02937	Says Mike Enzi is "getting about 84 percent of his campaign funds from Washington-based PACs. That's more than any senator of either party."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/30/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-says-daughters-opponent-mike-enzi-get-/	Some fathers help their daughters by teaching them how to ride a bike. But if you’re Dick Cheney, you do it by attacking her political rival on national television. The former vice president appeared on ABC’s This Week on Oct. 27, 2013, to discuss national security issues, and was asked about the Republican primary battle in Wyoming between incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi and his daughter, Liz Cheney. Though Liz Cheney has previously said her father wouldn’t be campaigning for her, he didn’t pass on the opportunity to take a few shots at Enzi. He accused the three-term senator of "getting about 84 percent of his campaign funds from Washington-based PACs," which Cheney said was "more than any senator of either party." Enzi is far from the most prestigious, vocal or well-known lawmakers on the Hill. So we were surprised to hear that the three-term senator from Wyoming, of all places, is the upper chamber’s leader in percentage of donations from PACs. We decided to take a deeper look. Counting PAC money Off the bat, we ran into trouble with the term "Washington-based PAC." The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign finance data, noted that most political action committees, but not all, are based in the nation’s capitol, and it’s difficult to separate which of Enzi’s donors are from D.C. "What's probably safe to say is that the vast majority are not based in his home state," Viveca Novak at the center told PoltiFact (which is what Cheney was driving at anyway). According to data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics, in the Senate campaign cycle beginning in 2009, Enzi raised $1.64 million, with $1.19 million, or 73 percent, coming from PACs. That’s not the 84 percent figure that Dick Cheney mentioned. Liz Cheney’s campaign said they got to 84 percent by including a $74,463 transfer to the campaign from a joint fundraising committee, as well as $826,000 given to Enzi’s leadership PAC from other political groups. So the Cheney campaign counted those transfers as PAC money, while the center didn’t. Using the center’s data, Enzi’s percentage of PAC money is higher than any other senator -- by quite a bit actually. The next closest is Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., who has received 66 percent of his donations from PACs in the last five years. The disparity is even larger over the course of Enzi’s entire career. Nearly 70 percent of the $6.55 million the Wyoming Republican has raised since 1991 comes from PACs. In second is Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, at a distant 52 percent. A large chunk of Enzi’s PAC money comes from congressional leadership groups who are backing the senior senator over Cheney’s challenge. He gets quite a bit from health groups, as well -- which isn’t surprising, since he has worked prominently on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for years. It’s not that Enzi is taking more money from PACs than all of his colleagues, but a higher proportion of his money raised is from these outside groups It’s worth noting that of the 10 senators who have relied the most on PACs this cycle, nearly all hail from states in the bottom third of the population rankings. Candidates from smaller states have a shallower pool of in-state donors to pull from, pushing them to rely on PACs in their increasingly expensive election fights. Cheney has proven to be a formidable fundraiser, pulling in $1 million between July and September, for her contest against Enzi. Doug Weber at the Center for Responsive Politics had another explanation for Enzi’s reliance on PACs. "Enzi hasn't really raised and spent much in the past," Weber said in an email. "His 2002 and 1996 elections were the cheapest Senate victories of their cycle. So it may be a function of a modest fundraising effort -- raising from individuals involves a lot more work. (Republican House Speaker John) Boehner raised more from individuals just this year than Enzi has since 1989." And even though Enzi tops this list, he’s far from the most prolific fundraiser in Washington. In the current Congress, he’s 356th in money raised, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Enzi’s campaign didn’t deny Cheney’s claims. While spokeswoman Kristin Walker noted that two-thirds of Enzi’s individual donors in the last cycle were from Wyoming, she added he "has always raised the money he needed to be competitive." Our ruling While Dick Cheney differed from our nonpartisan sources on the final number, the fact remains he was right: Enzi has received a higher proportion of his money from PACs than anyone in the Senate. It’s more a product of circumstances — Enzi’s from a small state and he’s facing a strong challenger — than evidence that Enzi has "gone Washington," as Cheney was implying. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-14823	"It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/23/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-it-costs-more-send-person-prison-univ/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says society needs to figure out a way to focus more on educating people and less on throwing them behind bars. After all, Sanders told an Oct. 28 rally at George Mason University, it’s a simple matter of dollars and cents. "And here’s the simple truth: It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia," Sanders said. Sanders invoked U.Va.’s attendance costs to help buttress his call for reforming the criminal justice system with an eye toward lowering incarceration costs. We wondered if the truth really is as simple as Sanders says it is, so we asked his campaign how he justified his claim. Warren Gunnels, the Sanders campaign policy director, sent us two figures to prove his point. Cost of incarceration For the cost of imprisonment, Gunnels cited a statistic from the Federal Bureau of Prisons published in March that says the average cost of incarcerating federal inmates was $30,619 in fiscal 2014. But federal prisoners represent the smallest proportion of the U.S. inmate population. About 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the U.S., according to figures from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 200,000 are in federal prisons. Another 1.3 million are in state prisons, while another 700,000 are in local jails. Looking just at state prison inmates in the U.S., a 2014 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the average per-prisoner cost was $28,323 in 2010, the latest year for which figures were available. And that per-prisoner cost varies from state to state. The Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit that researches criminal justice issues, in 2012 published a report that listed state-by-state spending per inmate in 2010. The annual cost per inmate ranged from a low of $14,603 in Kentucky to a high of $60,076 in New York. In the Virginia prison system, the average inmate cost for fiscal 2014 was $27,462, according to a report by the state Department of Corrections. Cost of attending the University of Virginia For the cost of sending someone to U.Va., Gunnels pointed us to a "Tuition, Fees and Cost of Attendance" table on the school’s website. Gunnels zeroes in on a part of that table that says undergraduate in-state tuition for a freshman was $10,016 in the 2013-14 school year. For students in U.Va.’s engineering school, tuition was a bit higher at $12,016. These tuition figures would be lower than any of the prison costs. But there are major expenses that the tuition figure does not take into account. Many students have to pay for other things, such as room, board and books, among other expenses. A link to the U.Va. student financial services website provides an overall estimated cost to attend the school during the 2013-14 academic year that lumps tuition along with all those other costs to attend. The annual estimated in-state cost ranged from $26,166 for nursing students to $31,276 for commerce students. For students who commute and don’t have to pay for housing, the estimated expense is much smaller: $18,436. Beyond the amount students and their parents pay, the state contributes some money to help pay for the education of U.Va. students who live in Virginia. In the 2013-14 school year, state support for every "full-time equivalent" in-state student at U.Va. came to $8,845, said Dan Hix, the finance director at the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the state agency that tracks state spending on college costs. You add everything up - tuition, housing and other expenses along with the state contribution of a Virginia student’s educational costs - and the overall cost easily would outpace the nearly $31,000 figure that Gunnels cited. Also, these expenses are only for in-state students. Anyone attending from out-of-state pays a lot more. Virginia does not contribute a dime to the cost of educating out-of-state residents, who saw the price of tuition alone of about $36,720 in the 2013-14 school year, according to the U.Va. table Gunnels cited. That cost doesn’t include any room and board fees those non-Virginia students would pay. The U.Va. financial aid website says the total for tuition and other expenses for out-of-state residents could range from $53,942 to $59,922. Of U.Va.’s 15,669 undergraduate students, 31 percent are attending from out of state, said Anthony de Bruyn, a university spokesman. Prison sentences vs. college tenure These prison and college costs all are annual figures. The final price tag for housing a prisoner easily could be lower than the full in-state cost of attending U.Va., if that inmate is serving a sentence of less than the four-year span of a typical bachelor’s degree education. On the other hand, if that prisoner is serving more than four years, it easily could outpace the cost most students pay to attend U.Va. The Pew Charitable Trusts this month released a report that said the average amount of time federal prisoners served was 37.5 months in 2012, or just over three years. Those serving time for drug crimes spent an average of nearly 5 years behind bars. Pew estimated in a previous report that state prisoners released in 2009 had been incarcerated for an average of 2.9 years, but Pew doesn’t have more recent figures. Local jails typically are short-term facilities where inmates are held while awaiting trial or while serving sentences of less than 12 months, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. For Virginia state prisoners released in 2014, the average length of time served was 42.8 months, or roughly 3.6 years, according to the Department of Corrections. Our ruling Sanders said "It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia." He starts his calculation with a figure of the nearly $31,000 average cost for a federal prisoner. Prisoners held by state corrections systems in the U.S., on average, cost closer to $28,000, based on the latest figures available. In Virginia, that is a little more than $27,000. Sanders’ campaign compares prison costs only to the cost of tuition at U.Va. That figure represents a significant low-ball for many U.Va. students, who pay the added costs of room and board as well as other fees. U.Va. estimates of the full cost for attending in the 2013-14 school year ranged from $26,000 to $31,000 for in-state students. That price doesn’t include an additional $8,800 the state provided to pay for Virginia undergraduates’ education. Out-of-state students’ bottom-line cost can range from $54,000 to $60,000. When all those costs are put together, they exceed the annual prisoner costs Sanders cites. Still, the truth behind Sanders’ statement rests to some extent on the length of sentence for each prisoner and where they are held. If their incarceration surpasses four years, then it easily could surpass the cost of sending a student to the University of Virginia. Also, if that prisoner is held in a state such as New York, with high state prisoner incarceration costs of roughly $60,000 annually, it also could outpace the cost of sending someone to U.Va.

pomt-04604	"President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/sep/19/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-obama-has-no-plan-deficit-debt/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has made runaway government spending one of his top campaign themes. Mack, who is challenging Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, recently took aim against President Barack Obama in an op-ed in The Hill. "Under President Obama, we’ve had four consecutive years of trillion dollar deficits … ," Mack wrote on Sept. 6, the date that Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention. "President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt. His idea of a solution is to raise taxes—even though out-of-control spending that is the key driver of debt—and he ironically calls this a ‘balanced approach.’" Was Mack correct to say that "Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt?" Obama’s plan to reduce the deficit Obama released his budget proposal in February 2012, which he said achieved $4 trillion deficit reduction. The plan included discretionary spending caps, reductions in the growth of defense spending and reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs over 10 years. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities,a left-leaning think tank, estimated that the president’s combination of spending cuts and tax increases would lower deficits by $3.8 trillion over a decade. That total included the $1 trillion in reductions that the president and Congress agreed to in 2011. According to the center, about 46 percent would come from higher revenues; about 54 percent of the reductions would come through spending cuts. To raise revenues, families making over $250,000 a year would pay more, but Obama also has an extensive list of tax breaks he would eliminate. They can be arcane: For example, Obama would repeal last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories. On the spending side, the president proposes $580 billion in cuts to a number of programs that range from agricultural subsidies to rental assistance to airport construction. The Obama campaign claims that over 10 years, it would trim deficits by $4 trillion. Some have questioned that estimate, though, so we rated their $4-trillion claim Half True. We noted that different think tanks and federal agencies have different methods for estimating deficit reduction and that Obama’s plan counts savings that Congress agreed to last year. (Read our previous fact-check for more details on these differing methodologies.) The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said that Obama’s plan is a good start but too modest in its goals. Obama takes the right approach with "a gradual and thoughtful deficit reduction plan," the committee wrote in recent report. "However, the proposals in the President’s budget do not go far enough to put the debt on a clear downward path over the next ten years and to control the long-term debt trajectory by reining in the growth of health care and retirement costs." Still, while experts might differ on how much Obama’s plan reduces the deficit, it is a plan. That’s counter to Mack’s assertion that Obama doesn’t have one. What happens to debt under Obama’s plan There’s a critical distinction between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is the difference each year between the money the government takes in (taxes, income and fees) and what it spends (defense, Social Security, Medicare and every other government spending program). The debt is all the money the government has borrowed. In other words, it’s the accumulation of those deficits. So while Obama reduces the deficit, because he’s not eliminating it, he’s not really chipping away at the overall debt. We contacted several budget experts who work for groups across the political spectrum about Obama’s plans and Mack’s statement that "President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt." Some economists told us Obama can make a credible case that he’s reducing debt if he’s reducing its proportion to the size of the overall economy, usually measured as a ratio of debt to the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, which is a measure of the overall economy. Jim Horney of the left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities used the analogy of a family: The key isn’t the amount of money a family owes on their monthly mortgage, but how much that mortgage is as a proportion of a family’s income. That shows whether the family can afford the monthly bill. Our fiscal challenges are so great that it’s very unlikely we could balance the budget anytime soon, said Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "The best we can hope for over the next 10 to 20 years is to first stabilize debt as a share of the economy and then put it on a downward path to levels that are safer for the economy," he said. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s analysis of Obama’s plan states his budget would result in debt levels rising from 73.5 percent of GDP in 2012 up to a peak of 78.6 percent in 2014 and then gradually falling to 75.1 percent by 2022. Beyond a decade, Obama’s plan would allow debt to rise as a share of the economy as Baby Boomers retire, spiking up expenditures for Social Security and Medicare and due to rising healthcare costs, Peuquet said. And that’s a problem. Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates reducing the debt, said he would prefer a lower debt-to-GDP ratio than Obama’s plan. However, "it is incorrect to say that the Administration does not have a plan to reduce deficits and stabilize the debt. And stabilizing the debt is an appropriate goal for the nation -- since debt is projected to keep growing more quickly than the economy -- which would be detrimental for economic growth." Some of our experts were more critical of Obama’s plan. J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation said Obama’s plan was not credible. As an example, Obama’s plan claims reductions associated with winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that’s only a savings if we assume the original policy was to continue the wars indefinitely. "In no year does the government run a surplus, and the deficits are rising steadily toward the end of the 10-year horizon, so it is then axiomatic to say the president lacks a plan to reduce the debt. Reducing the debt requires a budget surplus," Foster said. Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute, said Obama has "no plan" to pay down the debt if we’re referring to total accumulated debt over 10 years. And regarding the deficit, "the main ‘plan’ that shrinks the projected deficit over the next decade is that federal revenues are expected to rise as the economy is projected to recover in coming years," he said. "Both candidates need to do a much better job of providing details of proposed spending reforms and cuts so that America does not go the way of Greece." We sent an email to Mack’s campaign to ask if he had documentation he wanted us to review and did not get a response. Our ruling Mack said that "President Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit, let alone pay down the debt." Obama has presented a plan that reduces the deficit. Analysts have debated whether it goes far enough. But it is a plan. However, while the plan reduces deficits, it doesn’t eliminate them. And that means the sheer amount of the debt continues to grow. Obama’s defenders would say that his plan stabilizes the debt and makes the debt smaller in comparison with the size of the overall economy. But this is not the same thing as reducing the debt itself. So Mack has a point that Obama’s plan doesn’t reduce the debt in dollars. He’s wrong that Obama has no plan to reduce the deficit.

pomt-11323	"Rick Scott wants to destroy Social Security by privatizing it."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/apr/12/jon-bowzer-bauman/does-gov-rick-scott-want-privatize-social-security/	The president of a PAC that works to protect Social Security says Florida Gov. Rick Scott doesn’t have the backs of senior citizens. Jon "Bowzer" Bauman, the president of the Social Security Works PAC (and a former member of the band Sha Na Na), blasted Scott in a press release April 9 after the term-limited governor announced his run for U.S. Senate against Democrat incumbent Bill Nelson. "Rick Scott wants to destroy Social Security by privatizing it," he said. "That would be a disaster for the 1.7 million Florida seniors who would be living in poverty without Social Security." The claim that Republicans want to privatize Social Security is a line we’ve heard from Democrats for more than a decade. A lot of the time, the remark is an exaggeration of the GOP candidates' positions, but we wanted to see if there was any truth to the claim about Scott. The evidence provided by Social Security Works is not based on Scott’s current position. The group’s evidence for this claims stems from interviews and actions he took as governor in 2011 and remarks from back in 1994. And in all of those instances, Scott never explicitly says he wants to privatize Social Security. What Scott has said Scott does not have position pages for his Senate campaign yet and has not made recent comments about Social Security. Scott’s spokeswoman, Kerri Wyland hinted that Scott would protect Social Security when we asked about his current stance. "Gov. Scott maintains his belief that Washington must change the way it operates, and that includes making sure it isn’t spending more money than it takes in – but it shouldn’t be done on the backs of the Social Security system that so many seniors rely on," Wyland said. We also checked an archived version of Scott’s campaign website from 2010 to see if there was anything suggesting he supported privatizing Social Security, but we came up empty-handed. So, what gives? As evidence of this claim, Social Security Works pointed to news clippings and transcripts from Scott’s past. But in these instances, Scott was vague. In a 2011 interview on CNBC with Andrew Ross Sorkin, Sorkin asked if Scott preferred Social Security to be privatized. "Here’s what I want to do. In our state, what I want to do, I want everybody in a 401(k)," Scott said. In 2011, Scott signed a pledge to urge senators and members of the House of Representatives to oppose any debt limit increase until conditions were met. The pledge — known as the ‘Cut, Cap, and Balance’ pledge — echoed legislation being considered by lawmakers. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for a large share of the federal budget, so one way to limit debt increases is to reduce spending for those programs. Before the legislation’s signing, the founder of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorites released a statement saying that "the legislation would inexorably subject Social Security and Medicare to deep reductions." The other two examples provided by Social Security Works rely on remarks from 1994. An Orlando Sentinel article from 2010 said that Scott once urged privatizing Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration. According to the article, Scott told USA Today the programs would be better off in the hands of profit-seeking companies. "Let us make a profit. So what?" he said in 1994. He went on to make a stronger statement about the Veterans Administration hospitals that same year. "If you look at how the government runs VA hospitals and Medicare and Medicaid, you can see that the whole system is inefficient," Scott told the South Florida Business Journal the same year. "The things we are doing wrong in health care can be corrected if private business could run national health care administration." While the comments do suggest that Scott may have supported elements of privatization for Medicaid, Medicare and the VA, they do not touch on Social Security. Social Security Works also pointed to the fact that Scott’s running mate in 2010 — Jennifer Carroll — supported "partial privatization" of Social Security. But that doesn’t mean that Scott himself shared her view. In a candidate questionnaire published by the Orlando Sentinel, in November 2000, Jennifer Carroll wrote, "If younger workers are allowed to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in their own retirement accounts, over the long run, they will have far more in their pension funds -- by their own efforts -- than any government Social Security pension fund could hope to provide." Not exactly privatization We reached out to several experts to get their take on the evidence that Social Security Works provided. None of the experts we spoke to were completely convinced Scott’s remarks translated to privatization. Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the evidence from Social Security Works "incredibly weak." "Supporting reducing Social Security spending to restore solvency isn’t privatization, nor is favoring that everyone be signed up for a 401(k)," Biggs said. "401(k)s are private accounts outside of Social Security and have nothing to do with privatization." Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron, called the evidence circumstantial, but said the remarks about Medicare, Medicaid and the VA system do indicate that Scott is in the same philosophical camp area as those who advocate for privatization. He also said the fact that Scott has not taken a position on Social Security "strongly suggests that he is not enamored with the program." "How on earth would a politician who is seeking votes ever choose to be silent about the most popular program the federal government runs in a state with more of the people that program serves than any other state in the nation unless one was less critical of it?" he asked. Our ruling The Social Security Works PAC president said Scott "wants to destroy Social Security by privatizing it." The majority of the evidence provided by Social Security Works stems from remarks Scott made as governor in 2011 and earlier when he was still the CEO of the hospital chain Columbia/HCA. At best, the evidence suggests Scott shares some of sentiments as those who support privatization, but that doesn’t mean he has a plan to privatize Social Security. In fact, Scott does not have a publicly available position on the issue. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14660	"Every piece of legislation, just about, that I ever introduced (in the U.S. Senate) had a Republican co-sponsor."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/20/hillary-clinton/spot-check-hillary-clintons-senate-record-immolate/	Voters concerned about gridlock in Washington want to know if a presidential candidate is going to be able to take a bipartisan approach to resolving the nation's problems. So on the campaign trail in Iowa, Democrat Hillary Clinton said she could work with Republicans because that's what she did when she served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2009. "When I was in the Senate, of course I had to work with Republicans. I think every piece of legislation, just about, that I ever introduced had a Republican co-sponsor," she said at a campaign organizing event in Toledo, a small town between Des Moines and Cedar Rapids. PolitiFact, which is in Iowa this week covering the caucuses, wanted to see if Clinton had that right. We used GovTrack.us to see any Republican senator who co-sponsored a bill by Clinton. Of the 355 bills she sponsored that were referred to a Senate committee, Republicans were listed as a co-sponsor 241 times. That means, in theory, up to 68 percent of Clinton’s bills could contain a Republican co-sponsor. But the real percentage is likely much lower. Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, for instance, co-sponsored six pieces of Clinton legislation. Four of those pieces of legislation had 10 or more Republican co-sponsors. We also did a spot check of Clinton’s record by looking at legislation directly. Congress.gov is the official website for U.S. federal legislative information. It says that Clinton sponsored 703 pieces of legislation while representing New York. They include bills, amendments and resolutions. We sorted the list by "Latest Action - Newest to Oldest" and then spot-checked every 10th bill, starting with the Paycheck Fairness Act, to see which ones had at least one Republican sponsor. From that list, we focused on the 44 pieces of legislation that were introduced, the term Clinton used. We found at least one Republican co-sponsor in 4 of 7 resolutions or continuing resolutions (57 percent) but only 9 of 37 bills (24 percent). Overall, that's 13 out of 44, or just under 30 percent. Focusing on the 18 bills that Clinton sponsored and brought to the Senate floor for consideration, four had at least one Republican co-sponsor (22 percent): • A bill commemorating the 225th Anniversary of the American Revolution Commemoration Act (two GOP co-sponsors); • A bill dealing with respite care (four GOP co-sponsors); • A bill concerning the labeling of pediatric medication (two GOP co-sponsors); • A bill seeking to assist the victims of landmines (four GOP co-sponsors). So neither metric supports Clinton’s claim. None of this is to say she didn’t work with Republicans during her time in the Senate. But if someone says, as Clinton did, that "Just about every piece of legislation I introduced had a Republican co-sponsor," we think most listeners would expect better than 30 percent of the legislation introduced by Clinton would include a GOP co-sponsor. When we heard back from the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin said, "She meant to say, 'Just about every Republican senator I served with co-sponsored a piece of legislation I introduced.'" "In total, 57 (Republican) colleagues cosponsored at least one piece while only 8 did not," he reported in an email, and Schwerin supplied a list of 42 pieces of legislation to support that assertion. The list can be viewed here. However, that claim is a significantly different from what voters heard in Iowa on Jan. 18. Our ruling Clinton said, "Every piece of legislation, just about, that I ever introduced (in the U.S. Senate) had a Republican co-sponsor." By our review of legislation introduced by Clinton, she isn't even close. Her campaign says she meant to cast the statement differently, but we cannot rule based on what candidates intended to say. Clinton introduced a significant amount of legislation without Republican co-sponsors. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01465	"Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/01/national-rifle-association/scary-nra-ad-claims-mary-landrieu-voted-take-away-/	The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun lobbying group, is targeting a handful of Democrats in close Senate races with one of the most provocative — if not downright scary — ads of the campaign season. Let’s set the scene: A young mother puts to bed her infant child and receives a text, presumably from her husband, letting her know his plane landed. "Love you. Good night," she texts back. Suddenly, an ominous shadow is outside a window and a figure busts into the front door. Cut to a scene with police tape outside the home, suggesting tragedy. "It happens like that," a narrator says. "The police can’t get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. It’s your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights." Replace Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., with Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and you get the ad running in Colorado. How do we get from a vote in Congress to an intruder barreling through a poor woman’s front door? It’s far from a straight line. The NRA’s first justification When the Washington Post Fact Checker looked at this question, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pegged Landrieu’s vote "to take away your gun rights" to her support of the Toomey-Manchin proposal (named after its sponsors, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.). That proposal, which failed 54 to 46 in April 2013, did not ban the sale of any firearms. Its most significant provision would have expanded federal background checks already in place to firearm purchases made at gun shows and over the Internet. You could still buy a weapon from a family member or friend without a background check. The Fact Checker concluded that it’s hard to envision a situation in which Toomey-Manchin would have prevented a woman from being able to defend herself against an intruder. Assuming the woman in the ad was legally eligible to purchase a firearm (meaning she doesn’t have a criminal record), she would not have any trouble owning a gun in her home — even if Toomey-Manchin passed. The Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its harshest rating. The NRA’s second justification By the time PolitiFact inquired, the NRA offered different evidence as support for its claim. The group told PolitiFact that its claim stems from Landrieu’s vote to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009, a pick the NRA opposed. "Landrieu voted to confirm at least one anti-gun and anti-self defense (Supreme Court) justice," said NRA spokesman Arulanandam. "Anti-self defense is life or death." During Sotomayor’s nomination proceedings, her past ruling on a Second Amendment issue became a talking point for Republicans who were critical of President Barack Obama’s choice. While on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District, Sotomayor was part of a three-member panel that reviewed a lower court ruling in Maloney vs. Cuomo. At issue was whether New York could ban the chuka stick (commonly called nunchucks, a weapon with two sticks connected by a chain or rope). Sotomayor was part of a majority opinion that ruled the New York statute legal. The Second Amendment applies to federal laws but not state laws, they wrote, citing an 1886 Supreme Court decision. During her confirmation testimony, Sotomayor reasoned that the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on whether its decision in Heller vs. District of Columbia — which overturned the federal capital’s handgun ban — applied to all cities and states. So, Sotomayor said, she was applying the precedent as it was understood at that point. Several Republican senators cited this case as reason to vote against Sotomayor’s nomination. (Worth noting, Landrieu actually supported the court’s decision in Heller to overturn the D.C. handgun ban and signed onto a letter from Sen. Kay Hutchison, R-Texas, to codify the Supreme Court’s ruling.) The Supreme Court eventually ruled, by a 5-4 margin in 2010, to strike down Chicago’s ban against owning a handgun in the home. This effectively applied the Heller ruling to all local governments. Sotomayor, by then on the Supreme Court, signed on to a minority opinion that argued the Second Amendment did not prohibit local governments from regulating firearms or banning certain weapons in the home. No other major gun issues have come before the Supreme Court during Sotomayor’s time. In fact, it has turned down requests to review the right to have a handgun outside the home, said Amy Howe, editor of the popular Supreme Court analysis website SCOTUSblog. Problems with the second justification So how convincing is the Sotomayor argument? It has some considerable holes. For starters, it’s a slippery slope to claim that a vote for a Supreme Court justice is a vote "to take away your gun rights." To use the same logic, was a vote to confirm President George W. Bush’s nomination of John Roberts also a vote for the Affordable Care Act just because he ruled to uphold the individual mandate? Was a vote for Justice Anthony Kennedy — the justice appointed by President Ronald Reagan who became the swing vote in the case that effectively ended California’s same-sex marriage ban — a vote to legalize same-sex marriage? In other words, no one can tell in advance how justices will eventually vote on issues that come before the court. Justices appointed by Republicans can surprise and take what would be considered the liberal position in a case, and vice versa. We will also note that Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., joined seven of their Republicans to confirm Sotomayor’s nomination. Yet the NRA gave them each an A- rating for their votes on gun issues and endorsed them for reelection this year. So this is either selective memory or the NRA applying its own logic differently to candidates. As for Landrieu, her campaign said she has supported pro-gun measures over the years, including a proposal that requires states to recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states. She also voted against an assault weapons ban supported by the White House in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The NRA also opposed the measure. Our ruling The NRA ad claims, "Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights." This is quite a leap in logic. After initially staking its claim to a background check bill that didn’t pass Congress — nor did it "take away your gun rights," leaving women defenseless in their homes — the group now pins its claim on Landrieu’s vote to confirm Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. But that’s questionable, since there is no way to know in advance how a justice will vote. And the NRA has endorsed two other senators, Graham and Alexander, who cast exactly the same vote. Meanwhile, on the other major gun vote of this term, a key assault-weapons ban, Landrieu voted the NRA’s position. Given all this, to run an ad as scary as this one can only be described as fear mongering. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-11836	Says Roy Moore said a "practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/09/jeff-flake/flake-roy-moore-said-muslims-shouldnt-serve-congre/	Until allegations of sexual misconduct emerged, the worst criticism that Roy Moore heard from Republicans in the Senate centered on his views about Islam. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was one of just two GOP senators who condemned Moore, the party’s Senate nominee in Alabama. "When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith, it was wrong," Flake said Oct. 31 on the Senate floor. "That this same judge is now my party’s nominee for the Senate should concern us all. Religious tests have no place in the United States Congress." Moore is known for many strong stands, including opposing homosexual marriage and defying a court ruling to remove a display of the 10 Commandments from his courtroom. But did he say that a Muslim should not be a member of Congress simply because of his faith? He did, back in 2006. That year, Moore wrote an op-ed for the website WorldNetDaily.com. Keith Ellison from Minnesota had become the first Muslim to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Moore said Ellison’s faith had no place in the government of the United States because the "Islamic philosophy (is) directly contrary to the principles of the Constitution." "The Islamic faith rejects our God and believes that the state must mandate the worship of its own god, Allah," Moore wrote Dec. 13, 2006. "Common sense alone dictates that in the midst of a war with Islamic terrorists we should not place someone in a position of great power who shares their doctrine. In 1943, we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath on ‘Mein Kampf,’ or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to the ‘Communist Manifesto.’ Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today!" As far as we can tell, Moore did not take up the issue again. That is, until he was criticized for it by Flake, which Flake first did during an exchange with a Washington Post reporter on Oct. 26. Soon after that, at an event in Decatur, Ala., a reporter asked Moore if a Muslim could serve in federal office. "Of course they can serve," Moore said Oct. 28. "But they understand what they swear the Bible on, they swear to on the Bible, is the God that is not of their faith." Moore had shifted his position, but how much remains unclear. On Oct. 31, the same day Flake spoke, Moore was on Capitol Hill. An MSNBC reporter asked him if he still thought Ellison should be ousted from Congress. "Read my article and you’ll find out what I believe," Moore said. "It’s clarified very clearly in my article." Since Ellison's election, André Carson, D-Ind., became the second Muslim member of Congress. We reached out to Moore’s campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Flake said that Moore had expressed the belief that a "practicing Muslim should not be a member of Congress because of his faith." That’s what Moore wrote in an op-ed in 2006. He said Rep. Ellison should not be seated in Congress solely because he is a Muslim. Moore’s response to recent criticism has been equivocal. In one encounter he said that Muslims could serve in federal office. In another, he said his 2006 op-ed clearly explained his beliefs. There is no question that Flake accurately described what Moore had written. Moore’s comments since then add a touch of uncertainty, but only a touch. We rate this claim True.

pomt-05157	"Vagina. Because apparently, saying that word in the Michigan State House of Representatives can get you a two-day ban from speaking on the floor."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-michigan-lawmaker-silenced-sayi/	Yes, this did happen. The rumors you’ve heard about a female lawmaker in Michigan saying "vagina" and causing an uproar are not made up. On June 13, 2012, the second-to-last day of the spring legislative session in Michigan, state lawmakers took up a bill regulating abortion providers. The proposed law would require expensive medical malpractice insurance for abortion providers, dictate how to dispose of aborted fetuses and require doctors to screen women to determine if they're being coerced to terminate their pregnancy. None of that sat well with Democratic Rep. Lisa Brown, who stood up in opposition during debate in the Republican-controlled House. Brown invoked her Jewish religion for her own personal support of abortion rights and asked that lawmakers not impose their religious beliefs on others. But it was Brown’s closing line that sparked a political wildfire: "Finally Mr. Speaker, I’m flattered that you’re all so interested in my vagina, but ‘no’ means ‘no.’ " That remark got Brown banned from speaking in the House, where she was deemed to have violated the chamber’s decorum. And that only made the story get bigger. Cue the Twitter hashtags. Call the cable news hosts. Take the fight to Facebook. Here’s a post we spotted: On a black background in white letters, the banner reads "Vagina," in huge letters. It goes on, "Because apparently, saying that word in the Michigan State House of Representatives can get you a two-day ban from speaking on the floor. So pass it on." We won’t pass it on, but we will check it out. The bill, the debate As we noted, the legislation strengthens restrictions on abortion providers. It passed the Michigan House largely along party lines and next heads to the state Senate. Here are Brown’s complete comments shortly before the vote: "This legislation does a lot of things, Mr. Speaker. It regulates business, requiring exorbitant insurance policies to be purchased, which will result in clinics closing doors, causing people to lose their jobs and denying women their constitutional rights. "Yesterday we heard from the representative from Holland (Mich.) speak about religious freedom. I’m Jewish. I keep kosher in my home. I have two sets of dishes, one for meat and one for dairy, and another two sets of dishes on top of that for Passover. Judaism believes that therapeutic abortions, namely abortions performed in order to preserve the life of the mother, are not only permissible but mandatory. The stage of pregnancy does not matter. Wherever there is a question of the life of the mother or that of the unborn child, Jewish law rules in favor of preserving the life of the mother. The status of the fetus as human life does not equal that of the mother. "I have not asked you to adopt and adhere to my religious beliefs. Why are you asking me to adopt yours? And finally Mr. Speaker, I’m flattered that you’re all so interested in my vagina but ‘no’ means ‘no.’ " In video of her floor speech, a person can be heard hooting in the background along with some light applause. Then there’s a loud slap of the gavel, and a man’s voice says "Members, I do ask that you respect the decorum of the House." The ban The next day, Brown learned she was prohibited from speaking during floor debate. Her office didn’t return our call seeking comment, but in an interview on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, Brown said she had been informed of the prohibition by her party’s leadership and had yet to hear from any Republicans about the decision. "I never heard from them that I was banned, why or for how long," she said. "We’re on break now for about a month for the summer and we’ll see what happens when we come back. I would love to hear from somebody. I’ve read things in the paper but not one person has contacted me." Ari Adler, spokesman for House Speaker Jase Bolger, said in an interview that Republicans followed a process in imposing the ban. He said the majority floor leader, Rep. Jim Stamas, saw Brown’s name on the Democrats’ list of members who intended to speak about bills on the day’s agenda. Stamas informed the Democrats’ leader that Brown would not be recognized. "He believed he was doing the right thing and being professional in how he handled it," Adler said. Along with Brown, a second Democratic legislator was not allowed to speak that day. Rep. Barbara Byrum had tried to introduce an amendment to the abortion bill that would restrict vasectomies unless men could prove medical emergency. Adler said Byrum had not been recognized to speak and began yelling while others were speaking. "Our Republican leadership, both male and female, felt that they did not maintain the decorum of the House," Adler said of Brown and Byrum. The reason Why was Brown banned from speaking? The answer depends on whom you ask. Brown called a press conference with Byrum the day of the ban and said she could only guess the reason. "Perhaps they are silencing me because I dared to speak out yesterday on religious oppression," she said in the press conference. "Or maybe they’re banning me because I dared say ‘vagina,’ the correct medical name of a part of a woman’s anatomy these lawmakers are trying to regulate. Isn’t that something? These lawmakers, predominantly men, have no problem passing legislation about my vagina, but I dare mention its name and they become outraged. You know what? I’m outraged." As the controversy swelled, Brown announced plans to perform, along with other lawmakers and actresses, Eve Ensler’s 1996 play The Vagina Monologues on the steps of the state capitol. Ensler appeared alongside her in the MSNBC interview. Said Brown: "I didn’t say anything wrong. It’s the anatomically correct terminology for female anatomy. I was speaking to a bill that was about abortion, so it was germane to the legislation that we were debating. …As I said, I don’t think I did anything wrong. I don’t know what terminology somebody would prefer, but I think ‘vagina’ is the right word to use." O’Donnell responded, "Now Rep. Brown, if using that one word on the floor of the House gets you banned from speaking on the floor, what do you think performing ‘The Vagina Monologues’ on the steps of the capitol is going to get you?" Brown: "Well there’s a little thing called free speech." O’Donnell: "I don’t know about that in Michigan. That’s in doubt right now, isn’t it?" Brown: "A little bit, yes it is." Other news coverage, like O’Donnell’s comments, have assumed that Brown was banned for saying "vagina." But Michigan House Republicans say that’s not the case. "It had nothing to do with her use of the word ‘vagina.’ That’s not at all accurate," Adler, the House speaker’s spokesman said. "It was the reference that she made when she said ‘no means no.’ Members immediately connected that support of the legislation was akin to supporting rape." "No means no" has commonly been used as a slogan in anti-date rape campaigns. The Detroit News reported that Republican Rep. Mike Callton called Brown’s comments "offensive." "It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company," Callton told the Detroit News. Adler said, "That was his personal opinion. That’s not leadership’s opinion." To Democrats, however, Republicans are "changing their tune." Katie Carey, press secretary for the House Democratic caucus, said the first reason for the ban given by Republicans was Brown’s use of "vagina," as evidenced by Callton’s remark. Then they said Brown violated House decorum. Then came the "no means no" explanation. "I think they’re just trying to use whatever excuse they can come up with and whatever fits," Carey said. "I think that they didn’t expect it to be as big a story as it was." Bob Ballenger, the longtime editor of the political newsletter Inside Michigan Politics, said the reasoning that Brown’s use of "no means no" equated to approval of rape didn’t make sense to him. "Nobody on God’s green earth knows what the hell he’s talking about," Ballenger said, adding that he and a few other reporters had discussed Adler’s explanation. "It makes no sense at all. The preceding sentence before she said ‘no means no’ was ‘I’m glad you’re so interested in my vagina.’" "I think there are several things going on," he said. "First of all, Lisa Brown and Barbara Byrum are both very outspoken women. They have gotten in the faces of the Republican majority before. They are not popular with the Republican leadership." So what does he think is the likely reason for the speaking ban? "I just think in general her whole diatribe and the fact that they just don’t like her," Ballenger said. But more important than the reason for the ban, stated or unstated, is simply that it happened. Ballenger said Republicans have pointed out to him that when Democrats controlled the House, they too restricted how much the opposing party got to say. "Whatever the issue, it’s dead wrong," Ballenger said. "You cannot do this in a legislative body. You cannot silence speech. ... Where would you draw the line?" Our ruling The Facebook post -- surely one of many -- snarkily summed up the Michigan controversy: "Vagina. Because apparently, saying that word in the Michigan State House of Representatives can get you a two-day ban from speaking on the floor. So pass it on," the post said. Republicans who silenced Brown say the reason wasn't the word itself, but that she violated decorum and invoked an offensive parallel to rape. Brown herself said she thinks it was just because she said "vagina." Her party spokeswoman said the reason has evolved as Republicans try to dodge negative media coverage. And a longtime observer of Michigan politics says the Republicans in power simply don’t like Brown and her outspoken opposition. The Facebook post hedges its claim, saying that the word "apparently" can get a person banned. That seems like a fair claim: A lawmaker who said "vagina" in a floor debate was then banned from speaking, though for one day, not two. Overall, we rate the Facebook claim Mostly True.

pomt-07405	Says "we have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/29/barack-obama/obama-says-us-has-more-agents-ever-borders/	President Barack Obama offered a defense of his administration’s immigration policies in response to a question about the controversial bill recently passed by Georgia lawmakers to catch illegal immigrants. "We have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history," Obama told Channel 2 Action News anchor Justin Farmer. The president’s claim seemed counter to criticism from some Georgia lawmakers and activists who say the federal government has done little to stop people from illegally crossing the U.S. borders and discourage employers from hiring illegal immigrants. We decided to check out Obama’s claim. Homeland Security spokesman Steven Cribby told us there are currently 20,745 Border Patrol agents. Nearly 85 percent of them patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. The rest patrol the U.S.-Canada border. Cribby said there were 17,499 agents by the end of September 2008, nearly four months before Obama took office. A decade earlier, in 2001, there were about 9,000 Border Patrol officers, according to a March 2010 report compiled for Congress by the U.S. Congressional Research Service. In 1992, the earliest year mentioned in the report, there were 3,555 agents along the Southwest border. About 300 agents patrolled the northern border in 1992. An official with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, did not dispute the federal data. But the official said Obama shouldn’t gloat. "The Border Patrol has been growing significantly under Obama as well as [under former President George W.] Bush," said Jack Martin, special projects director for FAIR. "So he can take credit for it – but not all of the credit. The big stimulus was a focus on controlling the border in the wake of the 9/11 attacks." The congressional report supports Martin’s point. The number of agents nearly doubled during Bush’s presidency. However, the average annual increase of Border Patrol agents since Obama took office is about the same as Bush. Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy for the Center for American Progress, said the toughest critics on immigration policy "continue to move the goal post" on the issue because it is easier to say the border patrol process is faulty rather than what he said are the more complex issues concerning illegal immigration. The Center for American Progress is an organization that has pushed for the federal government to help illegal immigrants to pay taxes and earn legal status in the U.S. Fitz said the president’s claim is "accurate," but noted there may have been times where there have been more agents at the Southwest border. He pointed to 1954, when an estimated 750,000 illegal immigrants left the United States to avoid a border crackdown. Experts say there were probably only about 750 agents leading the roundup. Our colleagues at the national PolitiFact site tackled a similar claim by the president in July 2010 when he said the U.S. had more Border Patrol agents along the Mexican border "than at any time in our history." They took into account the Mexican Expedition during the early 20th century before making their ruling. PolitiFact noted that President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus. Here’s a portion of what prompted them to give Obama a Mostly True ruling: "We do have more agents than anytime since the early 1990s. But there have been times in our history when the U.S. sent troops to the border, and many more people than are there to guard the border today." Federal data shows the number of agents patrolling America’s borders has increased to its highest levels in the last two decades. There is historical data that shows there has been at least one period in American history in which there were many more authorities patrolling the border. Because of that, we rate the president’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-04-29T06:00:00	2011-04-26	['None']
pomt-14936	"After today, @GovJayNixon will have been overridden more times than all previous governors in #MO history #moleg"	true	/missouri/statements/2015/oct/28/peter-kinder/lt-gov-kinder-right-about-nixons-veto-overrides/	The Missouri General Assembly entered its yearly veto session on Sept. 16. In it, the Republican-led body voted to override 12 bills vetoed by Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a GOP candidate for governor, said the amount of bills overridden in the Sept. 16 veto session represented a historic achievement for Nixon. "After today, @GovJayNixon will have been overridden more times than all previous governors in #MO history #moleg," Kinder said in a tweet. We wondered if Kinder was right. Is Nixon Missouri's most overridden governor of all time? We reached out to Kinder's director of communications, Jay Eastlick, who sent us a list of Missouri governors and the number of times they were overridden. He gathered the information from Anne Rottmann, an administrator at the the Senate Legislative Library. Before the Constitution of 1875, Eastlick said, a simple majority was enough to override a veto. Veto sessions became annual events in 1989. During a veto session, the General Assembly may override any veto issued after the regular session if two-thirds of the members in each chamber agree. The list includes nine governors. It turns out Kinder is right. Not only is Nixon the most overridden governor in Missouri history, more of his vetoes have been overridden than those of all previous governors combined. (The chart below lists Missouri governors and the number of overrides of vetoed legislation. The chart does not include overrides of line item appropriations.) Nixon vetoes have been overridden 34 times in the past six years: one each in 2011 and 2012; nine in 2013; 11 in 2014; and 12 this year. Between 2012 and 2013, there was a significant spike in vetoes. Legislative makeup under Nixon Of the 34 total overrides, 23 occurred after 2013. That's almost 68 percent of all overrides. Missouri's political climate and the makeup of the General Assembly, especially the House of Representatives, has undergone a noteworthy change during Nixon's current term. Here's a look at how the balance of power has changed: Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon made history on Sept. 16 by having the most vetoes overridden for a Missouri governor. Missouri GOP members overrode a dozen of Nixon's vetoes. The Missouri legislature has experienced a small but steady increase of Republican seats in the House since 2009. Shy Hardiman The numbers show a small steady increase in Republican seats in the House. We wondered about the significance of this shift in power, so we reached out to a few experts to speak about the veto process and Missouri's political climate during Nixon's time as governor. Marvin Overby, an American politics professor at MU, said the partisan divide does have an impact on veto overrides. "Any executive (governor or president) facing a legislature in which both chambers are controlled by the opposition will likely be in a position to a) use the veto pen more often and b) face a larger number of overrides." Nixon faced a Republican-dominated General Assembly for nearly half his tenure as governor. Between 2009 and 2012, the Republicans in the House of Representatives did not hold a veto-proof majority because they didn't occupy two-thirds of the chamber. Every year since, Republicans have maintained a two-thirds margin in the General Assembly. The Senate has maintained a two-thirds margin since Nixon's first year in 2009. In addition to the legislative makeup, Peverill Squire, an American politics professor at MU, said the relationship between the governor and the legislature contributes to number of vetoes and veto overrides. "The governor has not enjoyed a close relationship with the legislature and that has contributed to the number of bills he has vetoed and the number of those vetoes that have been overridden," Squire said. "But partisanship rather than personal relationships really drives the number of overrides." So, legislative makeup affects veto overrides and the bills that are vetoed in the first place, but is Kinder's claim significant? Overby said there are many ways to interpret the number of times Nixon has been overridden. "From Kinder's perspective, the number is notable because it is the most in state history. But from another perspective, it would be reasonable to ask about the percentage of vetoes overridden," Overby said. So, we looked at the percentage of vetoes overridden. Except for 2015, Nixon vetoes were sustained more often than they were overridden. Although 34 veto overrides is a historic number, Squire said it is worth noting that the GOP failed to override the governor on a number of key issues. Overby echoed Squire and said the more interesting question is how Nixon can sustain any vetoes given the makeup of the General Assembly. Overby said the reason vetoes were sustained depends on a multitude of factors: "a) Nixon's skill in choosing which bills to veto, b) splits within the GOP caucuses in the chambers and c) the fact that vetoes and overrides are not always sincerely about policy … sometimes they are about politics." Scott Holste, Nixon's press secretary, noted that Kinder's claims leaves out details. "...the General Assembly has sustained several vetoes on the Governor's key priorities, including Right to Work in 2015, two school voucher bills, and numerous tax break giveaways that would have done serious damage to the state budget…" Holste said. Holste also said lumping all the veto overrides together misses the point. "The bills that have been vetoed have been vetoed for a number of different reasons," he said. "In some instances, they are vetoed because of technical errors; others are vetoed because of constitutional problems; others because of unintended consequences." Our ruling Kinder said Nixon has been overridden "more times than all previous governors in Missouri history." Thanks to the growing Republican majority in the legislature and the number of bills Nixon vetoed, that is indeed correct. We rate Kinder's claim to be True.

pomt-14074	Zika mosquitoes "can’t catch me."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/19/usain-bolt/can-usain-bolt-outrun-zika-mosquito/	The world’s fastest man says he’s not scared of Zika since he can always outrun virus-carrying mosquitoes. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who is preparing for this summer’s Olympic games, was asked recently about the Zika epidemic in the host country of Brazil. No worries, he said. "Because I’m fast," he joked in a May 18 interview on NBC’s Today. "They can’t catch me." This should be obvious: We are not saying that running is a Zika prevention method. (Here are some actual steps to take to avoid being bitten.) But we were curious whether Bolt really would outpace the mosquito. (People already have tried to figure out if Bolt can beat a cheetah. He can’t.) To the stat sheet! Bolt currently holds both the 100 meter and 200 meter world records at 9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds respectively. That corresponds to 23.35 miles per hour for the 100-meter dash, and 23.31 miles per hour for the 200-meter dash. Based on how he’s performed in all past races listed by the International Association of Athletics Federations, Bolt’s average speed is 21.65 miles per hour. Even at his slowest, when he clocked 48.28 seconds at the 400-meter in 2001, he was still running at 18.53 miles per hour. The New York Times did an excellent job breaking down Bolt’s prowess in this video from the 2012 Olympics. So Bolt runs — in short bursts — around 22 miles per hour. How does that stack up against mosquitoes? Many mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti. Female aegypti mosquitoes (the ones that bite) are estimated to have a cruising speed of 0.5 to 1.5 meters per second. That’s the equivalent of 1.12 to 3.35 miles per hour — a fraction of Bolt’s speed, even at his slowest. In that sense, it’s not a contest. Until you factor in stamina. Bolt runs short distances, while the mosquitoes are in it for the long haul. Researchers have documented lady aegypti flying continuously for two to nine hours, with an average of 2.2 hours. So Bolt, or really anyone, would have to run more than 7.37 miles in that time frame to outpace the mosquito. Kenya’s Dennis Kimetto, Bolt’s world record counterpart in the marathon world, ran 26.219 miles in 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. He’d leave the mosquito nearly 20 miles behind with that pace. Kimetto. (AP) Bolt and Kimetto would have a lot more to worry about if the Zika vector was a desert locust or earworm, which have respective average air speeds of 21 and 17 miles per hour. But for now, Zika-carrying mosquitoes can’t catch up to either man. Our ruling Bolt said Zika mosquitoes "can’t catch me." The Olympic champion and world record holder clocks an average speed is 21.65 miles per hour in his races, with 23.35 miles per hour at the high end and 18.53 miles per hour at the low end. Female A. aegypti mosquitoes, the main vector for Zika, cruise between 1.12 and 3.35 miles per hour. That’s a lot slower than Bolt, though the mosquitoes fly for much longer than Bolt sprints. Don’t try this, people. (But if you do, send us a video!)

Sarah Palin tried to take a hammer to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama’s postpartisan campaign tack. “Now, Barack Obama, of course, he’s pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line,” Palin said, questioning whether he could reduce polarization in Washington. In fact, Obama — who joined the Senate in 2005 — has voted with his party 96 percent of the time, according to a study by Congressional Quarterly . CQ’s calculation of party unity measures how often members vote with their party on bills where the parties split. By comparison, rival Sen. John McCain has voted with his fellow Republicans at an 81 percent clip over the entire Bush presidency. But as PolitiFact has reported before , voting studies can be skewed depending on a lot of factors, such as attendance, the roll-call votes picked and the issues that arise during the course of the year. Some congressional sessions may have more head-to-head party line votes than others. Examining votes that matched the position of President Bush — the titular head of the GOP — shows McCain has supported him 90 percent of the time, while Obama has gone along 40 percent, CQ found. But the question here is if it's true that Obama voted along party lines 96 percent of the time, and that claim is True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-10-02T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']

pomt-00334	"Most Americans don’t own stocks."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/sep/18/ro-khanna/what-percentage-americans-own-stocks/	The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 32 percent since President Donald Trump took office. But are Americans overall benefiting? U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna. D-Calif., suggested that they are not in a Facebook post spotted by a PolitiFact reader. Khanna’s post featured the headline, "Most Americans don’t own stocks." He repeated that point in his message, which accompanied a bar graph: "FACT: Most Americans don’t own any stocks. Instead of celebrating whenever the Dow Jones goes up, we need to focus on bringing investment and good jobs to the areas of this country that haven’t been part of the economic recovery." The accompanying graph details the "distribution of stock ownership by wealth percentile," specifically 84 percent for the "top 10 percent," 9.3 percent for the "next 10 percent" and 6.7 percent for the "bottom 80 percent." The data in the graph stems from a peer-reviewed academic paper. However, when we took a closer look, we found the data in the graph doesn’t directly support the claim that "most Americans don’t own stocks." In fact, the actual data on that question shows that a small majority of Americans do have a stake in the stock market. Stock value vs. stock reach The data in the graph comes from a paper published in November 2017 by New York University professor Edward N. Wolff. One of the paper’s findings was that "despite the fact that almost half of all households owned stock shares either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, trusts, or various pension accounts, the richest 10 percent of households controlled 84 percent of the total value of these stocks in 2016." This line by Wolff presents a key contrast that Khanna’s post glosses over: While about half of households own stocks in one way or another, the richest Americans hold the lion’s share of the value. Khanna uses a bar graph that highlights the imbalance in the value of stock holdings, but his headline claim is about the reach of stock ownership throughout the population. Those are two different things. When we contacted Wolff, he agreed that Khanna’s headline was "wrong." So what does the data show on the reach of stock ownership? It’s a bit wider than Khanna suggests. Even if you don’t own or trade individual stocks, there’s a decent chance you have a 401(k) account or an Individual Retirement Account or belong to a pension fund that is invested in stocks. "Many individuals have an indirect interest in the stock market by means of their claims on pension funds that own stocks and use these stock positions to fund pension payments," said Hendrik Bessembinder, a professor at Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business. A once-every-three-years study by the Federal Reserve Board found that in 2016, 51.9 percent of families owned stocks, either directly or as part of a fund. And in 2017, Gallup found that 54 percent of respondents owned stocks either directly or as part of a fund. Those findings show a majority owning stocks — a modest majority, but still a majority. In an email interview, Khanna told PolitiFact that he still feels the "essence of the post" is accurate but added that "a better headline would have been, "Most Americans Don’t Have a Real Stake in the Stock Market." Khanna has a point that a household’s affluence does help determine how vested they are in the stock market. The Federal Reserve Board study found that about one-third of families in the lower half of the income scale had stock holdings. In the next 40 percent of the income scale, about 70 percent of households held stocks, while households in the top 10 percent of the income scale had stock ownership rates above 90 percent. Here's a chart from the Fed's report, showing how stock ownership rates vary depending on income level. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Gallup, meanwhile, found that certain subgroups were notably less likely to own stocks, including those without a college education, younger Americans, unmarried Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics. Our ruling Khanna wrote that "most Americans don’t own stocks." To be precise, a narrow majority of Americans does own stocks, according to credible recent studies. But Khanna has a point that Americans of modest incomes are significantly less invested in the stock market than wealthier Americans are. Other large groups, including minorities and those without a college education, also lag in stock ownership, meaning that the stock rally is largely passing them by. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-04697	Says Bruce Springsteen played in 1975 at Seton Hall University in South Orange at Walsh gym.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/05/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-his-first-bruce-springsteen-co/	It was December 1975 when Bruce Springsteen took his "Born to Run" tour to Walsh gym at Seton Hall University, kicking off the set with "Thunder Road" and "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out." And in the audience was the future governor of New Jersey, seeing the Boss for the first of what would ultimately reach 130 concerts. Gov. Chris Christie pointed to that show as his first Springsteen concert during an interview Wednesday on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon." The Republican governor would have been 13 years old at the time of the concert. His first show was "at Seton Hall University in South Orange at Walsh gym" in 1975, Christie told Fallon, before the two performed part of "Thunder Road" together. Taking a break from politics, PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that Christie knows his Springsteen concert history. Springsteen performed at the Walsh gym at Seton Hall University on Dec. 11, 1975, according to various websites containing information on the set list as well as images of a concert ticket, an advertisement in a student newspaper; and CD covers. The concert was scheduled to start at 8:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, with tickets costing $6.50 in advance and $7.50 at the door, according to the advertisement posted here. Springsteen performed the following 21 songs that night, according to various websites: 1) Thunder Road 2) Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out 3) Spirit in the Night 4) Lost in the Flood 5) She's the One 6) Born to Run 7) Pretty Flamingo 8) Growin' Up 9) It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City 10) Backstreets 11) Kitty's Back 12) Jungleland 13) Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) 14) 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy) 15) Santa Claus Is Coming to Town 16) Detroit Medley 17) For You 18) Party Lights 19) Quarter to Three 20) Wear My Ring Around Your Neck 21) Twist and Shout A person who attended the concert posted a photo of Springsteen and the band here. Christie's spokespeople did not return a request for comment. Our ruling Before performing part of "Thunder Road" with Fallon, Christie told the late-night host that his first Springsteen concert was "at Seton Hall University in South Orange at Walsh gym" in 1975. The governor’s Springsteen concert history is correct. As part of Springsteen’s "Born to Run" tour, the Boss performed 21 songs on Dec. 11, 1975 at Walsh gym at Seton Hall University.

pomt-10458	During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Clintons brought the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to the White House for "spiritual counseling."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/25/michael-moore/not-a-spiritual-adviser/	In a letter endorsing Sen. Barack Obama on April 21, 2008, outspoken liberal and Academy Award-winning filmmaker Michael Moore suggested the Clintons were being hypocritical in their condemnation of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. "Mrs. Clinton continues to throw the Rev. Wright up in his (Obama's) face as part of her mission to keep stoking the fears of White America," wrote Moore, director of the documentaries Farhrenheit 9/11 and Sicko. "Every time she does this I shout at the TV, 'Say it, Obama! Say that when she and her husband were having marital difficulties regarding Monica Lewinsky, who did she and Bill bring to the White House for 'spiritual counseling?' The Reverend Jeremiah Wright!' " The letter, posted on Moore's Web site, contains a link to a Washington Post story that shows a picture of President Bill Clinton talking to the Rev. Wright at an annual White House prayer breakfast on Sept. 11, 1998. But this wasn't just any prayer breakfast. This was the forum Clinton chose to make his most comprehensive public apology for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. "I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned," Bill Clinton said that day. The Rev. Wright's incendiary comments about America — like the oft-viewed comment about America's "chickens coming home to roost" on Sept. 11 — and his close ties as spiritual adviser to Obama have made him the most controversial figure of this presidential election season. Moore's comment seeks to turn the tables on the Clinton campaign, which has made much of Obama's ties to Wright. For her part, Hillary Clinton has repeatedly insisted that if her pastor said some of the things the Rev. Wright did, she would have left the church. But did Wright's attendance at the prayer breakfast amount to providing "spiritual counseling" to the Clintons during their time of marital crisis? Religious leaders close to the Clintons don't think so. After the prayer breakfast that day, President Clinton did begin a long-term program of spiritual counseling with a small group of ministers. Wright was not among them. "I think this would be a good example of the way in which facts are being twisted in this campaign," said evangelical leader Tony Campolo, who did counsel Clinton privately. "President Clinton did reach out to Rev. Jeremiah Wright, as he did to about 100 other participants in that very important prayer breakfast." "To suggest he (Clinton) had some kind of close relationship with Wright, like Barack Obama did, is going too far," said Campolo, a professor at Eastern College in St. Davids, Pa. Rev. Don Argue, an Assembly of God pastor, remembers attending the prayer breakfast. He sat at a table with Vice President Al Gore. "There was no individual counseling or conversations going on," Argue said. "There was no interaction. We had breakfast, we heard from the president, we had a time of prayer and then we all went to the exit and were gone." In his many conversations with the Clintons over the years, Argue said, "Wright's name was never mentioned. Someone saying (Wright did counseling) is trying to make something out of nothing." There is no mention of Wright in any of the media reports about the prayer breakfast. His name does not appear in Hillary Clinton's recently released White House schedules that day — or any other day. Dr. Gerald Mann, then of the Riverbend Church in Austin, Texas, gave a blessing at the prayer breakfast that morning. In a limo ride with the Clintons later that day, Mann said Bill Clinton asked him if he was familiar with a restoration procedure in which a sinner submits to a regimen of prayer, scriptural study and repentance, under the guidance of three or more ministers. Those three ministers ended up being Campolo, the Rev. Gordon MacDonald, then senior pastor of Grace Chapel in Lexington, Mass., and the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church, which the Clintons regularly attended in Washington, D.C. MacDonald and Campolo told PolitiFact they met with President Clinton personally, often in the Oval Office, every four or five weeks, with most visits lasting more than two hours. About every six months, the three ministers met with the president as a foursome. And the meetings went on until the very last week of the Clinton presidency. The Rev. Wright was never a part of that, MacDonald and Campolo said. "I would have been quite aware if Rev. Wright had been a part of any ongoing counseling to President Clinton or his wife," MacDonald said. "Although an argument from silence is always suspect, I can only tell you that Rev. Wright's name never arose in all of our many conversations. I believe that speculation about any tie between the Clintons and Rev Wright is empty." MacDonald is aware of the photo of President Clinton and Rev. Wright conversing at the prayer breakfast, but he notes that there were over 100 religious leaders at the breakfast and, "I think you would find that there are several dozen such photos with clergy from all over America." It is clear that Wright attended the prayer breakfast. And yes, it came at a time when the Clintons were having marital difficulties regarding Monica Lewinsky. But there were over 100 religious leaders there. And according to the religious leaders who were there, Wright had no significant interaction with the Clintons either that day or later. Moore overstates the relationship by saying that Wright provided the Clinton's "spiritual counseling." We rate his statement False.
