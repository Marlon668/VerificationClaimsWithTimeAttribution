pomt-11684	"Police discover meth lab in back room of Alabama Walmart."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/02/ufconly/fake-news-walmart-employees-operating-meth-lab-sto/	A fake news story circulating for several months on Facebook claimed that employees at a Walmart in Decatur, Ala., were operating a meth lab in the store, leading to one of the biggest police drug busts in decades. "Police discover meth lab in back room of Alabama Walmart," stated a headline on the website ufconly.com on Dec. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This article is bogus. The same story appeared in March 2017 on the website Empire News, a website with a disclaimer that it is for entertainment purposes only. The story said that police received an anonymous tip about a horrible burning smell from the back of the Walmart. An officer discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room. The story stated that an "unofficial spokesperson did say that they were ‘disappointed’ that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down." One sign that this story is fake news: It provides a lengthy quote from "Chief Robert Garner," even though in Decatur the police chief’s name is Nate Allen. He told PolitiFact that there was no such bust. "This is fake news, and no, we don’t have a Chief Robert Garner," Allen said in an email. Tara Aston, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told PolitiFact in an email that the company was unaware of any meth lab being discovered at an Alabama store. While we found no news reports about busts of meth labs inside an Alabama Walmart, we did find some news reports about busts involving mobile meth labs in Walmart parking lots. In August 2016, police discovered a meth lab inside a 6-foot-high drainage pipe under a Walmart parking lot in Amherst, N.Y. The "about" section of the Ufconly website doesn’t describe the website’s content and instead stated that "Ufconly is a small village in the mountains of the Western Cape, South Africa." We found no such place. There is no evidence that police discovered a meth lab inside a Walmart in Decatur, Ala. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04097	U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin was "partly right" that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she's raped.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/16/phil-gingrey/gingrey-defense-akins-rape-comments-misses-mark/	So you might have heard that U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta got himself into some trouble last week when he talked about rape. Gingrey, now in his sixth term in the House, said fellow Republican Todd Akin of Missouri was "partly right" when Akin said last year that a woman’s body has a way of shutting down if she’s raped to prevent pregnancy. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to see whether there was any accuracy to Gingrey’s remarks. "[I]n a situation of rape, a legitimate rape, a woman’s body has a way of shutting down so the pregnancy would not occur," Gingrey said during a question-and-answer segment at a meeting Thursday of the Smyrna Area Council of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce. "[Akin’s] partly right on that." Gingrey, an obstetrician/gynecologist who said he’s delivered more than 5,200 babies, explained some more. "And I’ve delivered lots of babies, and I know about these things. It is true. We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble conceiving because of the woman not ovulating, ‘Just relax. Drink a glass of wine. And don’t be so tense and uptight because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate.’ So he was partially right, wasn’t he? But the fact that a woman may have already ovulated 12 hours before she is raped, you’re not going to prevent a pregnancy there by a woman’s body shutting anything down because the horse has already left the barn, so to speak. And yet the media took that and tore it apart." Akin later apologized for his remarks and said rape can lead to pregnancy. His initial comments were largely cited as the reason Akin lost his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who feared Akin’s comments would hurt him with women voters, gave Akin a verbal stiff arm. Gingrey said Akin’s remarks weren’t helpful. Gingrey’s effort to clarify what Akin said, first reported in The Marietta Daily Journal in its Friday editions, made the rounds within hours on several national political websites. The Democratic Party leader in Gingrey’s district has already announced plans to challenge the incumbent next year. On Monday, Gingrey’s Twitter site, deluged with criticism of Gingrey’s remarks, had been removed. Gingrey sent The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a statement Friday. "I do not defend, nor do I stand by, the remarks made by Rep. Akin. … In my attempt to provide context as to what I presumed they meant, my position was misconstrued," Gingrey said. Gingrey’s office did not respond to our messages for further comment. Some doctors and organizations said there is no accuracy to the Georgia congressman’s claims. "While chronic severe stress and anxiety may impact fertility sometimes, the fact is that a woman cannot prevent ovulation or conception with their emotions, especially in an acute traumatic situation like rape," said Barbara Croft, a board-certified OB/GYN based in Atlanta who has been in practice for 30 years. Croft called Gingrey’s comments patronizing, condescending and unscientific. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a Washington, D.C.-based organization with about 56,000 members, including Croft, echoed her comments. "While chronic stress, for example from extreme exposure to famine or war, may decrease a woman’s ability to conceive, there is no scientific evidence that adrenaline, experienced in an acute stress situation, has an impact on ovulation," the group told us via email. Gingrey is a fellow with the organization, which is defined as a board-certified OB/GYN whose professional activity is devoted to the practice of obstetrics and/or gynecology. For decades, some politicians and newsmakers -- mostly social conservatives -- have said women who are raped are less likely to become pregnant. Their definition of a legitimate rape is a woman who is sexually assaulted. The Washington Post reported that National Right to Life President John Wilke wrote an essay in 1999 that the "physical trauma" of rape has a way of preventing pregnancy. The newspaper’s website has a link to the essay. The link contains an analysis of Akin’s remarks by the Rev. Robert Fleischmann, the national director of Christian Life Resources. "Statistically speaking, it appears something happens in a rape, either with the victim or with the perpetrator, that reduces the incidence of pregnancy," Fleischmann wrote in August. "Fertility specialists continually debate the role of emotions, unresolved conflicts and trauma play in female infertility." There is some discussion on websites such as FertilityFactor.com that severe stress, eating disorders, excess exercise or extreme weight loss can interfere with regular menstruation. Some studies widely reported by news outlets conclude that the rate of rape-related pregnancy is higher than the rate of pregnancy from consensual sex. The likelihood of a rape-related pregnancy is usually in the 5 percent range, the studies show. Most of these studies, though, were done in the 1980s or 1990s. The Chicago Tribune, citing a Mayo Clinic publication about infertility, reported in August that mental stress can temporarily alter an area of the brain that controls the hormones that regulate a woman’s menstrual cycle. The Tribune article reported that it is a chronic kind of situation that occurs over months or years, not the acute trauma of a rape. Our conclusion: Gingrey said it’s "partly right" that a woman's body has a way of shutting down so that a pregnancy doesn't occur if she's raped. There is some information that suggests that some conditions, particularly stress, can reduce fertility. But our research found it is not typically the stress of a rape. There’s scant scientific evidence to support Gingrey’s argument. We rate his statement False.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2013-01-16T06:00:00	2013-01-10	['United_States', 'Todd_Akin']
pomt-09380	"Just this week we received the news that for the first time Social Security is now paying out more in benefits than it's taking in. That was something that was supposed to happen in 2016."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/28/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-social-security-upside-down-sooner-ex/	During the first primary debate between Gov. Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio, the former House speaker said that Social Security needs to be reformed or it will go bankrupt. "Social Security, whether we want it to or not, in its current form cannot survive and will not exist for us," he said during the March 28, 2010, showdown on FOX News Sunday. "In fact, just this week we received the news that for the first time Social Security is now paying out more in benefits than it's taking in. That was something that was supposed to happen in 2016. It's now happening in 2010." Calls to reform Social Security are nothing new; many economic analysts say that the program is unsustainable. But privatizing the program has become a hallmark of the conservative agenda. Its latest proponent is Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, who is the top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives' Budget Committee. His Roadmap for America's Future would reduce Social Security benefits for those who are 55 or younger in 2011 and supplement the reduction with private accounts. On March 24, that argument was put in the spotlight again, when the Congressional Budget Office, the independent number-crunching arm of Congress, issued some sobering news: This year, the Social Security Administration will take in less than it pays out, resulting in an approximately $29 billion shortfall. The projections are part of its yearly analysis of President Barack Obama's budget. In an interview with the New York Times, Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the SSA, explained the problem. He said that the recession has put people out of jobs and more people have applied for benefits sooner than expected. Simultaneously, fewer jobs means fewer paychecks are going out and that translates to less collected by the government in taxes. In the same interview, Gross pointed out that the SSA has a $2.5 trillion balance that will carry benefits for a while. So, Rubio's correct on the first part his claim. He's right on his second point as well. In its May 2009 annual report to Congress, the SSA projected that "annual cost will exceed tax income starting in 2016." As a result, we find Rubio's claim to be True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-03-28T16:14:21	2010-03-28	['None']
pomt-01275	"Jeanne Shaheen was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election"	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/nov/04/daily-caller/jeanne-shaheen-hit-last-minute-attack-over-lois-le/	By the time the sun came up on Election Day, a charge against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen -- the New Hampshire Democrat in a nip-and-tuck race for another term -- had begun making the rounds on social media. The Daily Caller, a web-based publication aligned with conservatives, ran a story headlined, "BOMBSHELL MEMO: Jeanne Shaheen Conspired With White House Insider On IRS Targeting Scandal." The story was posted at 9:36 p.m. the night before the election. The story accuses Shaheen of being "principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election." The night before Election Day is an unusually late moment for a "bombshell" to emerge in a Senate contest. But readers asked PolitiFact to take a look, even if our analysis would be published well into Election Day. So we did. Early in the election cycle, New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said that Shaheen "got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views." In our fact-check published Oct. 23, 2013, we concluded that what Shaheen actually "got behind" was the DISCLOSE Act, which requires nonprofit groups to share information about their campaign contributions. We determined that it was a stretch to suggest that Shaheen favored going after citizens "for their political views," so we rated Horn’s statement Mostly False. Tuesday’s story is a little different because it accuses Shaheen of being part of a "plot" of harassment against conservative groups. As evidence the story cited "letters exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller." Those letters were the result of a Freedom of Information request that was fulfilled on Oct. 9, 2014, according to documents provided to PolitiFact New Hampshire. Of the nine pages of documents provided, five of them reprint letters from Shaheen and six other Democratic Senators to Douglas Shulman, Commissioner of the IRS, asking the IRS to investigate any nonprofits that are avoiding being taxed while they "are focused on federal election activities." The remaining four pages are responses to that request. The IRS was noncommittal in its responses to making any changes. "To ensure that section 501(c)(4) organizations meet the requirements for tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS has ongoing programs that review the activities of organizations seeking IRS recognition of tax exemption," wrote Steve T. Miller, Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement in his response dated April 26, 2012. He later added, "The IRS is aware of the public interest in this issue. These regulations have been effect since 1959. We will consider proposed changes in this area as we work with the IRS Office of Chief Counsel and the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy." The letters themselves are not secretive. The first, dated Feb. 16, 2012, was signed by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). It has been publicly available for more than a year; Shaheen’s signature comes on the third page. The second letter, signed by the same seven senators and dated March 9, 2012, was even the subject of a press release by Schumer. What the letters say The letter dated Feb. 16, 2012, asks the IRS to review its oversight of 501(c)(4) organizations that get involved in politics. (The name refers to a section of the tax code.) The Internal Revenue Code grants tax-exempt status for nonprofit organizations that promote "social welfare." But Shaheen’s letter said some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The letter says the code specifies that social welfare "does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for political office." The letter first came to prominence in 2013 after publication of a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that concluded that the IRS had improperly targeted conservative groups. Some Republicans cited the letter as evidence that Democrats were responsible for such actions. Meanwhile, the letter to the IRS commissioner dated March 9, 2012, did encourage the IRS to change the way it handles nonprofit organizations that spend money on politics, suggesting three changes, including that the organizations document the exact percentage of their money that goes toward social welfare. We don’t see how these letters support the linchpins of the claim -- that Shaheen was "involved in a plot," that this plot involved Lerner and other Obama appointees, or that the issue concerned a "program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups." Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines this type of "plot" as "a secret plan for accomplishing a usually evil or unlawful end." The letters were not secret, and, while we won’t take a position on whether their effort was "evil," they were clear that they wanted the IRS to adhere to the law, not break it. In addition, there is no mention of Lois Lerner -- the central figure in the controversy -- and no obvious connection to any Obama political appointee other than Schulman, who was actually appointed by President George W. Bush in 2008. As for a "program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups," the letters do not urge a partisan or ideological focus to the effort. They point to 501(c)(4) nonprofits generally, not conservative groups alone. The Daily Caller did not return our request for comment. Our ruling The Daily Caller charged that Shaheen "was principally involved in a plot with Lois Lerner and President Barack Obama’s political appointee at the IRS to lead a program of harassment against conservative nonprofit groups during the 2012 election." Shaheen and six other Democratic Senators did send letters broadly connected to the issue of scrutinizing the activities of nonprofit groups. Their concern was that some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The Daily Caller article amps up the innuendo beyond the evidence. The letters weren’t secret, they didn’t cite Lerner or other Obama appointees, and they didn’t single out conservative groups. We rate the claim False.	None	Daily Caller	None	None	None	2014-11-04T17:51:04	2014-11-03	['None']
pomt-11741	"The FBI has become America's secret police … like the old KGB."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/08/gregg-jarrett/has-fbi-become-americas-secret-police/	A Fox News legal commentator argued the FBI has become the new KGB, the Soviet-era secret police, during a segment of Hannity. Here’s the exchange between Gregg Jarrett and the show’s host, Sean Hannity, during the Dec. 6, 2017, edition: Jarrett: "I think we now know that the (Robert) Mueller investigation is illegitimate and corrupt. And Mueller has been using the FBI as a political weapon. And the FBI has become America's secret police. Secret surveillance, wiretapping, intimidation, harassment and threats. It's like the old KGB that comes for you in the dark of the night banging through your door." Hannity: "By the way, this is not a game. This is not hyperbole you are using here." Jarrett: "No. Ask Paul Manafort, they came for him and broke through his front door." Hannity: "And if it can happen to him, Gregg…." Jarrett: "It can happen to all of us. Absolutely. The FBI is a shadow government now." Are today’s FBI and yesterday’s KGB really interchangeable? Jarrett and Hannity said it wasn’t hyperbole. We checked with a range of experts in the history of both agencies, and even those who are no fans of past and present FBI practices say the comparison is wrongheaded. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett The statement "is over the top and ridiculous," said Douglas Charles, a historian at Penn State University Greater Allegheny and author of three books on the FBI, including J. Edgar Hoover and the Anti-interventionists: FBI Political Surveillance and the Rise of the Domestic Security State. "And I say this as an FBI historian who has long been critical of the bureau's history, its political surveillance, its use of illegal wiretaps, its harassment of the LGBT community, and its promotion of ‘morality’ issues." To be sure, some of the tactics Jarrett cited are used by the FBI, or more broadly by law enforcement agencies in the United States. The pre-dawn, break-down-the-door raid ordered at a house owned by Manafort -- President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman now under indictment on several counts involving his foreign lobbying business -- is not especially unusual. Such raids are more common in drug investigations than in white collar crime, according to Radley Balko, a criminal justice blogger for the Washington Post and author of Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America's Police Forces. Meanwhile, law enforcement has the ability to conduct warrantless wiretaps under certain circumstances, despite the longstanding opposition of civil liberties groups. A category of subpoena called a "national security letter" provides "a law-enforcement officer with broad discretion or authority to search and seize unspecified places or persons," said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. National security letters have been used to trawl through "customer records held by banks, telephone companies, Internet service providers, and others," who are then prevented from telling anyone about these searches, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center. However, the use of such tools does not make the FBI, or any other U.S. law enforcement agency, the same as a secret police agency such as the old KGB. For one thing, those tactics sometimes may be needed. "Breaking down front doors in the dark of night is a bit melodramatic, but it is probably necessary to avoid destruction of evidence," Pike said. (Preventing destruction of evidence was the reported justification for the Manafort raid.) "Legitimate concerns about the increase in law enforcement’s surveillance capacity over the last decade or so are de-legitimized by such a specious pairing of agencies," said Victor E. Kappeler, a criminologist at Eastern Kentucky University and co-author of Policing in America and Homeland Security. Here are some of the reasons why any comparison between the two agencies is problematic. • Just because the FBI sometimes operates in secret does not mean that it’s a "secret police." "By 'secret police,' we do not mean 'police activity that is secret' any more than by 'public interest' we mean 'what the public is interested in,' " said Anthony Glees, director of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham and the author of The Stasi Files: The UK Operations of the East German Intelligence and Security Service. Indeed, the very fact that a legal analyst can criticize the FBI on a national television broadcast is a significant departure from anything that would be possible in a country with a true secret police. • The FBI is run by laws, not by whim. The KGB -- which translates from the Russian acronym for Committee for State Security -- answered to and served the interests of the Communist Party, not any system of law. Put simply, "the FBI is subject to the laws limiting police powers," said Joseph Wippl, a former clandestine Central Intelligence Agency officer who now teaches at Boston University. "These laws were passed by a Congress elected by the U.S. population. These laws can be changed, either restricting or expanding police powers." Robert Mueller, the special counsel, "needs to work within an independent judicial system to get search warrants and to indict suspects, whereas in the Soviet Union, there was generally no meaningful judicial oversight of the secret police," said Edward Cohn, a Grinnell College historian and author of The High Title of a Communist. "And KGB efforts at intimidation and surveillance often went beyond anything the FBI is accused of doing." Simon Ball, the chair of international history and politics at the University of Leeds and author of The Cold War: An International History 1947-1991, agreed. "The contemporary U.S. political system and the Soviet political system of 1954, when the KGB was formed, are not comparable in any sensible analytical scheme," he said. • The FBI doesn’t torture or carry out extrajudicial executions. "The KGB carried out the repression of a totalitarian state that murdered tens of millions of innocent people in the name of a political ideology," said Gregory Feifer a journalist and author of Russians: The People Behind the Power. "Whatever one thinks about the FBI — with its many faults and occasional moves toward KGB-like surveillance of government critics over the years — it is an integral part of our rule-of-law society." A secret police like the KGB operates "through the institutionalised use of torture," Glees said. By contrast, "any use of unnecessary violence, let alone torture, would be met with the full force of the criminal law." Even as bad as the Hoover-era FBI was about civil liberties and abuse of power, Charles said, "it was still no KGB-like organization coming for people in the dead of night who were then ‘disappeared.’ " Indeed, he said, the excesses of Hoover’s tenure were, to a large extent, curbed after his death by the ordinary workings of the democratic process. Pike of globalsecurity.org said that, while there’s a need for vigilance, "there does seem to have been a remarkable absence of abuses of these far-reaching powers." He added, "Whatever happens to you down at the J.Edgar Hoover building, you are pretty confident it will not entail a bullet to the back of the head." A Fox News representative did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Jarrett said that "the FBI has become America's secret police … "The FBI has become America's secret police … like the old KGB." He also agreed with Hannity that the statement was not an exaggeration. Numerous historians of the FBI and the KGB say the comparison is ridiculous. The KGB implemented the goals of the Communist Party leadership, including countless examples of tortures and summary executions. The FBI, by contrast, is subject to the rule of law and is democratically accountable. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-02865	"Our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/14/goldie-taylor/msnbc-contributor-goldie-taylor-says-national-debt/	MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor joined the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation on Tuesday to criticize former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for comparing the national debt to slavery. Sharpton said Palin’s comments were not only offensive but wrong on the facts, as the national debt "has been reduced every year for the last five years under this president." Taylor responded, "You know, our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II. And so the notion that our national debt is growing at some astronomical rate really is a misnomer." We thought their claims were ripe for a PunditFact review. We rated Sharpton’s comment False, and for a pretty basic reason. Sharpton mixed up the deficit with the debt. The budget words sort of sound alike, but they’re not interchangeable. The deficit is a yearly measure of revenues against spending, and the debt is the sum of all past deficits minus any annual surpluses. Taylor made a similar mix-up as she misconstrued a larger talking point we’ve heard from the Obama administration this year. The deal with debt Taylor’s statement is off no matter how you slice it. * In raw dollars: Gross federal debt is at an historic high of $17.1 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, it was $10.6 trillion. (The debt grew by $4.9 trillion under President George W. Bush. Under Obama, it is poised to double.) * As a percentage of the national economy, commonly measured as the Gross Domestic Product: The debt as a percentage of GDP reached 103 percent in 2012 after a steady climb since 2009, according to tables from the White House Office of Management and Budget. The debt as a percentage of GDP had not been that high since 1947, when it was 110.3 percent. The story is the same for the 2012 federal deficit, which fell to 7 percent of GDP but was larger than any year since the end of World War II. In fact, as University of California Berkeley law professor Alan Auerbach pointed out, the federal government had budget surpluses while Bill Clinton was president. "Whether you look at the debt or the deficit, it is clearly false that the figures are smaller than anything since WWII," said Princeton University economist Harvey Rosen. ‘What I should have said’ On Twitter, Taylor told us she should have said, "The deficit is falling at its fastest rate since WWII." That statement, borrowed from Obama team talking points, would have been more accurate. PolitiFact previously reviewed Obama’s claim that "our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years" and rated it True. The deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP in 2009, but fell in 2012 to 7 percent -- a decline of 3.1 percentage points. The period between 1946 and 1949, when the deficit as a percentage of GDP fell 7.4 percentage points, produced the only bigger decline. Experts have criticized Obama’s point as misleading. The recent drop is happening because the deficit was so large to begin with that it had more room to fall. The government ran the largest budget deficits relative to the GDP during 2009 and 2012 than since 1946, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and this is causing the debt "to soar." The debt’s long-term growth "is very worrisome given the risks it poses and the time needed to reverse the upward trajectory of debt," said Jason Peuquet, research fellow at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And for all of the crowing about the reduced deficit, CBO expects it to increase again in the next decade due to spending on programs for our aging population, health costs, new subsidies to offset the cost of health insurance, and larger interest payments on the debt. Our ruling Taylor said, "Our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II," which is plainly incorrect. The debt is as high as it’s ever been, in terms of real dollars, and it ticks up by the second. Taylor acknowledged her flub, tweeting us that she will work on "slowing things down a bit to make sure I get it right." Her statement on PoliticsNation rates False.

pomt-03428	Says proposed teacher contract "would layer on more restrictive rules."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/25/portland-public-schools/does-proposed-portland-teacher-contract-include-mo/	Contract negotiations are always a tense time, but the battle between the Portland Association of Teachers and the Portland Public School Board is getting particularly heated. Teachers say they're simply trying to outline their responsibilities as clearly as possible, while board members say the contract could negatively impact children's education. In an opinion piece published in The Oregonian June 5, board members argued that the proposal currently floated by the teachers' association "would layer on more restrictive rules." In the piece, they say the proposed contract does this by: "Prohibiting increases in instructional time in any school above the amount currently in place." "Preventing teachers from being required to communicate with parents or post grades online, unless 30 minutes of time is set aside to do so during the school day." "Prohibiting principals from having teachers make up parent-teacher conferences with families who miss their regularly scheduled meetings." Then, the board members really hammer it home: "Students and families deserve better. These demands exemplify much of what is already wrong with Portland's teacher contract." The analysis: PolitiFact Oregon was curious about whether the contract was really such a game changer, so we pulled up a copy of the contract and found the passages that the board members were talking about. Let's take these one by one. First up: Prohibiting an increase in instructional time. On Page 89 of the proposed contract, which is still undergoing tweaks, it specifically states that "Instructional minutes and/or student contact minutes shall not increase in any building above what is in effect during the 2012-2013 school year." Second: Preventing teachers from being required to post grades online or communicate with parents unless they're given specific time during the workday to do this. Page 94 of the contract has passages that address both of these issues. The proposed contract notes that "professional educators recognize the value and importance of communication with parents and the community, and may volunteer to do so using print, electronic or digital communication products." The key here, though, is requiring the teachers to do this -- and the proposed contract specifically says that should not occur: "Principals/supervisors shall not require such parent communication unless adequate additional time is allowed during the workday … Principals/supervisors may not require parent newsletters or more frequent progress reporting unless adequate additional parent communication time of at least thirty (30) minutes daily is allowed during the workday to complete these tasks." The same page has a similar note about grading: "The electronic posting of assignments, grading rubrics, support materials, and lesson plans on electronic student information systems … is recognized as beneficial; however it shall not be required unless adequate additional parent communication time of at least thirty (30) minutes daily is allowed during the workday to complete these tasks." Third: Will principals be barred from requiring teachers to make up parent-teacher conferences with families that miss their meetings? This, too, is stated pretty explicitly in the proposed contract. The teachers association notes that "professional educators shall make arrangements as may be necessary to meet with students and parents at reasonable times during the normal workday." But it then goes on to say, directly, that, "principals shall not require professional educators to schedule make up appointments for parents who miss regularly scheduled parent conferences." Given that all of this language seems to fit with what was in the opinion piece, we were inclined to wrap this one up, but we did want to chat with Marty Pavlik, the Portland Association of Teachers' chief contract negotiator. Pavlik gave detailed defenses of each piece of the contract, noting some of it still had not been completely worked out. While we found much of his reasoning behind the provisions to be reasonable, none of it much changed that these clauses were indeed in the contact. There was one exception however. Pavlik said that the first issue, the one dealing with no increased instructional time, was actually not a new provision. In fact, he said, it was already covered by the contract's Maintenance of Standard Clause, which essentially keeps instructional minutes the same from year to year. This added line, he said, was simply there to clarify that time would not be added. "In our opinion," he said, "it is not a change." On that one, we agree. But ultimately we come back to the school board's statement, which is that this contract proposal would "layer on more restrictive rules." We also, with due diligence in mind, spoke with Portland Public School's chief spokesman, Robb Cowie. He said one thing that stuck with us: "In terms of accuracy, the board's statements in this (piece) are absolutely accurate and hew to the language that is in the proposal." The issues they cite are clearly based on pieces of the proposed contract. What's more, those pieces do serve to create more restrictive rules. Now, whether that's a bad thing depends on your position in the broader debate. And teachers would argue they need the rules to protect their time in the face of growing district mandates. But we're not ruling on that -- PolitiFact doesn't delve into opinions, positions or predictions. We're just ruling on whether the proposed contract creates more restrictive rules for these specific situations. Clearly it does. We rate this statement True.

pomt-01544	Says Dick Cheney "de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/15/chris-matthews/matthews-cheneys-post-saddam-tactic-created-isis/	Even as President Barack Obama rallies support to attack the forces of the Islamic State, the military group also known as ISIS and ISIL, he is taking barbs from both the hawks and the doves. The former, like Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, back military engagement but skewer the president for having failed to act earlier. The doves doubt that a military response will do more than breed new enemies of the United States. This pincer movement galls Obama’s fans who feel he is unfairly blamed for a disaster he inherited. In the closing seconds of MSNBC’s coverage special immediately after the president’s address on ISIS on Sept. 10, Hardball host Chris Matthews leveled this dig at a major backer of the original invasion of Iraq, former Vice President Dick Cheney. "Do not listen to Dick Cheney," Matthews said. "He's the one that created al-Qaida by taking over the holy land in Saudi Arabia. He’s the one that de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS." We set aside the reference to Saudi Arabia and decided to take a closer look at the link between Cheney, ISIS and Iraq. Through the MSNBC press office, we asked Matthews if he could expand on how Cheney created ISIS. We did not hear back. But we can fill in the blanks. Saddam Hussein wielded power through the Ba’ath party. For all practical purposes, leadership in the military and civilian sectors was synonymous with Ba’ath membership. Early in the occupation of Iraq, the George W. Bush administration decided to purge the Ba’athists. And we know that at least some of the success of ISIS on the battlefield is due to former generals and colonels under Hussein who have shaped the groups tactics and intelligence activities. Lina Khatib, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said there is no doubt about this. "ISIS is indeed cooperating with former Ba'athists, especially military officers, who have been seminal in directing the group's military strategy," Khatib told PunditFact. So that’s a rough top line. But Matthew’s statement requires that we explore two points: Was Cheney responsible for de-Ba’athification? And how might that have led to the creation of ISIS? We heard from several researchers of ISIS and its origins. From them, and our review of the historic record, we find that this Ba’athist connection between Cheney and ISIS is real but it is indirect, and more factors than the expulsion of Ba’athist members from the Iraqi military fueled ISIS. Cheney and de-Ba’athification Thanks to a report from the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, we know that more than a year before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration began discussing plans to govern the country once coalition forces overthrew Hussein. A basic puzzle was this: to leave the Ba’athist leadership in place would give them the power to undermine anything the Americans might want. But to get rid of them wholesale risked chaos. In the words of former Secretary of State Colin Powell, "when you hit (Iraq), it’s like a crystal glass. It’s going to shatter." Initially, Bush signed off on a plan of "light" de-Ba’athification. While that term was never well defined, the general notion was that the most senior leaders would be removed, and mid-level managers would stay. In mid May 2003, about two months after the invasion began, a very different policy took effect. Under Ambassador Paul Bremmer, the man in charge of Iraq reconstruction, at least 20,000 government workers were fired. Then Bremmer disbanded the entire Iraqi military. According to the inspector general’s report "key U.S. generals on the ground in Iraq strongly opposed Bremer’s order. (They) anticipated using the Iraqi army to help stabilize the country and start the reconstruction process." Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of coalition forces in Iraq in 2003 said, "essentially, (the move) eliminated the entire government and civic capacity of the nation." When challenged at the time, Bremmer insisted that his orders came from the White House and the Defense Department. We found some ambiguity on who issued those orders. De-Ba’athification has come to be seen in many quarters as such a pivotal error, no one has leaped forward to take credit. In addition to the inspector general’s report, there are two other assessments written by analysts with high-level access to insiders. One, from U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute, reported that Bremmer was handed his instructions by an undersecretary of defense, Douglas Feith. "President Bush had previously given Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld managerial control of the occupation, so it is possible that Feith spoke for Rumsfeld who spoke for Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney," the institute report said. A report from the Rand Corporation, the grand-daddy of the private defense policy think tanks, said the National Security Council, "with President Bush in the chair," learned of the de-Ba’athfication order the day before it was implemented. "No one raised objections," the report said. However, the inspector general’s report finds that the move caught both the CIA and the State Department off guard. A body of information ties Cheney to this decision. Cheney played a key role on the National Security Council and in all decisions surrounding the war. His chief of staff Lewis "Scooter" Libby recruited Bremmer for his post in Iraq. Press reports at the time and analyses afterward put Cheney in a group of hard-liners within the White House and the Defense Department who sought to remake Iraq from the ground up. While Cheney might not have drafted the de-Ba’athification order himself, we can safely say he supported it. De-Ba’athification and ISIS Several key steps lie between the former Ba’ath leaders and the circumstances that ultimately produced ISIS. Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King’s College London, said there is a tenuous link. "De-Baathification and the dissolution of the Army disenfranchised Iraqi Sunnis, creat(ed) the kind of resentment that fueled the Iraqi insurgency in the mid 2000s," Neumann said. "This helped al-Qaida in Iraq, ISIS's predecessor, and it's the same kind of resentment and mistrust towards Shiites that allowed ISIS to gain the support of Sunni tribes in its recent advances." Austin Long, security policy professor at Columbia University, argues that it is, "certainly correct that without the 2003 invasion, the ISIS would almost surely not exist." On the other hand, Long said many ex-Ba’athists turned against al-Qaida in Iraq between 2005 and 2007. Long, as did the other analysts we contacted, pointed a heavy finger of blame at former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. "It is really in the past four years, with the Maliki government really disenfranchising and even targeting many Sunnis, that the Islamic State has begun to find allies in the Sunni community again," Long said. "Matthews’ statement is not wrong in the sense that without an invasion and de-Ba'athification there would be no ISIS, but it elides the fact that Cheney was not in office for the critical period when ISIS began to regain support." William Braniff, executive director at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said ISIS draws its strength from powerful ideological beliefs and ethnic tensions. "The Ba’athists are useful, but not the drivers of this murderous movement," Braniff said. Beyond Maliki and de-Ba’athification, many factors led to the creation of ISIS, including the tactics of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which played ISIS forces against other rebel groups, and some early funding linked to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. The online news site Vox has an intriguing overview for those wishing to read more. Our ruling Matthews said Cheney de-Ba’athisized the Iraqi government and created ISIS. We find that Cheney played a key role in de-Ba’athification and in creating the circumstances that led to the formation of ISIS. Former Ba’athists provide important military ISIS leadership, as they did in the first few years after the invasion when they joined forces with the group that preceded ISIS, al-Qaida in Iraq. However, many of those same Ba’athists later turned against al-Qaida in Iraq. They shifted back into the orbit of what became ISIS due to the repressive policies under Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. The causal link is too distant to say Cheney created ISIS. His decisions contributed to the group’s formation, but not more than that. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04501	"We're up 123,000 jobs over the last year and three-quarters. We're actually, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, down 500 ... auto jobs in Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/05/john-kasich/while-ohio-123000-jobs-2011-auto-jobs-are-down-joh/	Ohio's economic condition is improving. That's good news for Gov. John Kasich, but it comes with an asterisk. An improving economy is also considered good news for President Barack Obama. Kasich, a Republican, backs challenger Mitt Romney. The point came up, as it has before, during a recent Fox News interview. "The Democrats are saying one of the big factors helping the president is the auto bailout, particularly in the northern part of the state," host Paul Gigot said, wondering if Kasich's boosting of jobs was helping Obama's campaign. Kasich, as he has before, downplayed the role of the auto recovery. "We're up 123,000 jobs over the last year and three-quarters," he said. "We're actually, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, down 500 jobs, auto jobs in Ohio." A loss of jobs? PolitiFact Ohio was interested. We looked at figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we asked Kasich's office for his sourcing. First, we noted that Kasich, in talking about "the last year and three-quarters," was referring to the period from January 2011, when he took office, until August 2012, the last month for which figures were available. BLS figures for Ohio show that total nonfarm employment went in that period from 5,064,600 to 5,187,600 -- an increase of 123,000 jobs, as Kasich stated. In talking about auto jobs in that period, Kasich's staff said he was referring to jobs in the BLS categories of motor vehicle manufacturing and motor vehicle parts manufacturing. The first category saw an increase of 700 jobs from January 2011 to August 2012, from 19,200 to 19,900. In the second and larger category, employment went from 56,000 to 54,800, a loss of 1,200 jobs. That's a net decrease of 500 jobs. So Kasich’s numbers are correct. But additional information is needed to clarify his claim. The timeframe Kasich used is an issue in itself, as we have noted before. In talking about Ohio jobs, the governor only used figures that covered his time in office, starting in January 2011. But the first federal aid to the automakers was made in 2008 while Republican President George W. Bush was still in office. It continued in early 2009 under Obama. The auto industry hit bottom in June 2009, when vehicle manufacturing jobs in Ohio dropped to 14,200, down from 23,800 jobs one year earlier. By the time Kasich took office, after the auto bailouts, that number had increased by 5,000 jobs. That isn't reflected in the governor's tally. Parts manufacturing, down 1,200 jobs since Kasich took office, is up 3,900 jobs from the trough of June 2009. It is also worth noting that the figures the governor cited reflect only direct jobs in the auto industry. Some industry analysts, such as the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, also look at two other categories of employment in the industry -- intermediate and spin-off -- in considering the impact auto manufacturing has on the economy. Under that gauge, job growth in other businesses that have a connection to the auto industry also would be considered. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information rates Mostly True.

pomt-09537	"Barack Obama had 150 days in the U.S. Senate where he was able to vote quite often 'present.' "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/08/sarah-palin/palin-says-obama-voted-present-us-senate-very-ofte/	In an interview with FoxNews.com at the National Tea Party Convention on Feb. 6, 2010, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reprised a Republican talking point from the 2008 presidential campaign by criticizing President Barack Obama for his lack of executive experience. Asked by FoxNews.com's Judd Berger whether she thought she's "more qualified to be president than President Obama," Palin referred to the debate over "experience" from the 2008 contest between Obama and her running mate, Arizona Sen. John McCain: "The whole qualification issue still perplexes me, because in the campaign we tried to bring attention to the fact that Obama had really not a lot of experience. And I do say that my executive experience, as an administrator, as a team manager if you will was, and so was John McCain's as a matter of fact, was stronger and we had more experience than Barack Obama did in terms of managing huge multibillion dollar budgets and thousands of employees that I had just come from a position of that and that hasn't changed." When Berger asked Palin, "But without McCain?" -- a long-serving Arizona senator -- Palin responded: "And without McCain, I mean Barack Obama had 150 days in the U.S. Senate where he was able to vote quite often present, not have to make decisions, being one of many, not having to manage. His executive position now in the White House is as, whether he likes it or not, a manager. He has to make tough decisions. He has to be willing to fire people, though you don't make any friends when you fire people, and I know that first-hand because I've had to do that. And you have to make tough decisions, and not dither on issues. You have to make quick decisions in many respects, and I think that President Obama, with all due respect, his lack of experience is really made manifest in the way that decisions are made in the White House today." Palin's answer offers a lot to chew on, but we'll leave aside the larger question of whether she's more qualified to be president than the incumbent. Instead, we'll stick to the narrower claim that Obama often voted "present" in the U.S. Senate. We should point out that Palin's phrasing in this sentence is a bit unclear. Does she mean that Obama spent only 150 days in the U.S. Senate -- an argument that dovetails not just with the 2008 argument that Obama was young and inexperienced but with the (accurate) argument that he missed a lot of votes while running for president? If that's what she meant, she is incorrect. There are no statistics on day-by-day attendance for senators, but we approximated the bare minimum number of days that Obama was in the chamber by counting the number of days that he cast a vote. (In the Senate, votes cannot be cast remotely.) While it's true that Obama's absentee rate skyrocketed in the third and fourth years of his term, when he was running for president, we found that he cast votes on more than 180 separate days in 2005 and 2006, combined. And that undercounts his total days on the job, because the Senate does not necessarily vote every day that it's in session, and because we didn't count the (admittedly smaller) number of voting days he was present in 2007 and 2008. So, what about Palin's claim that Obama had 150 "present" votes in the U.S. Senate? The claim harkens back to the (again, accurate) charge that Obama frequently voted "present" when he was a state senator in Illinois. (It was actually a Democrat -- Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who gave this claim high-profile attention during the primaries.) Obama acknowledged voting "present" -- a vote similar in its effect to "abstain" -- 129 times during his eight-year state Senate tenure, according to a Boston Globe fact-check at the time. The Globe said that Obama cast about 4,000 votes as an Illinois legislator, meaning that he voted "present" in about one of every 31 votes he took. The New York Times reported that the records show at least 36 occasions in which Obama was either the only state senator to vote present or was part of a group of six or fewer to vote that way. Some of his "present" votes came on contentious issues -- abortion, juvenile justice and gun laws among them -- and critics have suggested that Obama's decision to avoid a "yes" or a "no" vote in those cases stemmed from political expediency. Other analysts have cited a more benign reason, saying that voting "present" has long been used as a way of expressing protest about the way a bill was put together, or displeasure about a specific provision contained within a bill. "You get a lot of 'present' votes from minority members to avoid the traps set by the majority," said University of Illinois at Springfield political scientist Kent Redfield. "Obama was in the minority most of the time he was in the legislature, and his present votes are slightly below the average for a member of his caucus." But this discussion of "present" votes has to do with the Illinois legislature. It has nothing to do with the U.S. Senate. We checked all of Obama's votes in the U.S. Senate and found not a single "present" vote. That's not surprising, given the way Senate procedure works. "It’s very rare for a senator to vote 'present,' " said U.S. Senate historian Donald A. Ritchie. "That’s usually only if they are somehow personally involved in something." Palin's statement is incorrect in two ways. She initially appears to suggest that Obama had only 150 days of experience in the U.S. Senate, which is inaccurate. She then says he voted present many times, which also is not correct. He never voted present in the U.S. Senate. So we find her statement False.

pomt-00900	"A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/04/ben-carson/ben-carson-many-prisoners-go-straight-come-out-gay/	Homosexuality is a choice, just look at the prisons, Republican neurosurgeon Ben Carson said on CNN. In a March 4 interview, the likely 2016 presidential contender said he believes that legalizing same-sex marriage is a decision that should be left to the states. He also argued that homosexuality is a choice, rather than biological. "Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight -- and when they come out, they're gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question," said Carson, a former head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We’ll jump to the point here: There is no conclusive evidence to support Carson’s claim that "a lot of people" make a switch from heterosexual to homosexual while in prison. Further, the medical community tends to conclude that homosexuality is not a matter of choice -- notably the American Psychological Association. "Dr. Carson's contention has a political intent but is absent of awareness of research on human sexuality," said Mark Fleisher, a social science professor at Case Western University, who studies sexuality and violence in prisons. A spokesman for Carson declined our request for comment. In the prisons Many inmates who identify as heterosexual change their sexual habits while in prison, possibly as a victim or perpetrator of abuse or due to lack of access to the opposite sex, said Christopher Hensley, a University of Tennessee at Chattanooga criminal justice professor. But a change in sexual behavior does not necessarily equate to a change in sexual orientation. Hensley recently authored a study that he said is one of the first to examine a shift in sexual orientation in prisons. He and his co-author questioned 142 prisoners at a maximum-security facility in the South about their sexual orientation. They found that of the sample, 24 men changed sexual orientation while incarcerated. Of those 24, 18 changed from straight to bisexual, three changed from bisexual to straight, and one each changed from bisexual to gay, gay to bisexual, and gay to straight. These results do not conclusively support Carson’s point, Hensley said. The sample size is too small to make any sweeping conclusions -- 142 is just about 0.001 percent of the nation’s prison population. Additionally, Hensley said his research does not support Carson’s implication that prison behavior shows that a shift in sexual orientation is a choice. Prison sex culture is not analogous to the sex culture outside of prison. "Carson is taking a simplistic view of sexuality," Hensley said. It’s possible that people go into prison unaware of their sexuality, and then once they are exposed to homosexual behavior as an inmate, they realize that they are gay or bisexual, Helen Eigenberg, who also studies prison sexuality as a professor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, said in an interview with PolitiFact. This isn’t necessarily captured in Hensley’s research, she said. Eigenberg added that sometimes victims of sexual abuse -- in prisons that can mean gang rape, prostitution or other forms of coercion -- are sometimes confused. They might think that just because they played a role in a homosexual act, they are now gay, which is not necessarily true. "The fundamental assumption of the analogy (Carson’s) using is insane," Eigenberg told the Washington Post. We asked numerous other experts who study criminal justice and sexuality, and none agreed with Carson’s claim. Nor were they aware of modern research addressing this topic, other than Hensley’s. "There is absolutely no good evidence supporting Carson's contention, and there is good evidence against it," said J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University who studies sexual orientation. A choice? In a previous PolitiFact article, we found that, while it’s not certain what factors cause sexuality, scientists agree that personal choice is not involved. The American Psychological Association, which has 150,000 members, considers it a "settled question." Greg Herek, a psychology professor at the University of California Davis who studies sexual orientation, pointed us to a nationally representative study that shows the vast majority of gay men and women do not perceive their sexual orientation as a result of choice. People can change their behavior -- such as engaging in homosexual behavior in prison -- but that does not equate to a change in orientation, Bailey, the Northwestern researcher, told PolitiFact. He also noted that there are examples (updated with new link) of boys being surgically changed into girls at birth (in the past, for medical reasons), but when these former boys grow into women -- they are attracted to other women. "If you can't make a male attracted to men by changing him, surgically and socially, into a girl, how likely is it that prison can do that?" Bailey said. Our ruling Carson said, "A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out they’re gay." There is no research that supports this point. The one study that even begins to address the topic has too small a sample size -- and too many variables -- to shed light on Carson's claim. And its author finds Carson's view "simplistic." Further, Carson used this example to prove that sexual orientation is a personal decision. Respected scientists consider it settled that homosexuality is not a matter of choice. Additionally, experts told us the sex culture in prison is not comparable to sex culture outside of prison, making it a bad analogy. We rate Carson’s claim False.

pomt-00732	"The unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000."	true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/23/texas-organizing-project/group-black-texans-have-higher-unemployment-rate-w/	Urging the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas to choose a president who prioritizes jobs and rising wages "for all communities," a Texas group said African Americans in the state have fared poorly on both fronts. The Texas Organizing Project, which says it promotes social and economic equality for low- to moderate-income residents, joined labor unions in calling on the Fed, which has kept interest rates near zero since 2008 to spur business lending, not to raise interest rates and focus instead on full employment and higher wages, according to a March 4, 2015, news story in the Dallas Morning News. The project got our attention in a March 2015 press release with this: "Although the economy is adding jobs, the unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000." We sought elaboration. Report offered as backup To our inquiry, a project spokesman, Daniel Barrera, pointed us by email to a March 2015 report by the Brooklyn-based Center for Popular Democracy, which says it promotes "equity, opportunity and a dynamic democracy." The report, "Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate," presents charts with the cited figures, which the Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute based on federal wage and employment data. One chart says the 2014 Texas black unemployment rate, 9.5 percent, was more than twice the state’s white unemployment rate of 3.7 percent; the 2014 Hispanic jobless rate was 5.3 percent. Conditions may have been better in Texas than elsewhere over those years. Nationally, according to the report, black-white unemployment disparities were greatest in Wisconsin (the black jobless rate was 4.6 times the white rate), and Minnesota (the black rate was 3.7 times the white rate). Another chart in the report indicates median hourly wages of Texas whites and Hispanics increased 8 and 2.9 percent, respectively, from 2000 to 2014 while median hourly wages of black Texans decreased 0.8 percent. We wondered if blacks saw falling wages by this measure all through those years. They did not: To our inquiry, the Economic Policy Institute provided year-by-year data showing the hourly median for black Texans decreased in six years while going up in eight years. Through the period, the real median wage for Texas African Americans bottomed out at $13.61 in 2008. It crested at $15.18 in 2012. Nationally at the end of the 15-year period, median real wages of African-American workers were down even more than in Texas alone, according to the report. That is, the national median real hourly wage for African Americans in 2014 was $13.97, about 3 percent less than the comparable median of $14.41 in 2000. Also, according to the report, other states had bigger differences between the first and last years studied. Source: Report, "Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate," Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015 Source: Report, "Wall Street, Main Street, and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard: Why African Americans Must Not Be Left Out of the Federal Reserve’s Full-Employment Mandate," Center for Popular Democracy, April 6, 2015 And why? Missing from the report: Why the differences between black workers and others? When we called to ask about that, Ady Barkan, a center official, suggested multiple longstanding factors including racism and differences between blacks and whites in education levels and rates of incarceration. By email, Barkan also pointed out a July 2011 issue paper from the liberal Center for American Progress noting, among reasons, that in each of the latest U.S. recessions, blacks were most often the first employees fired and the last ones hired (once each recession was ending). We asked the Economic Policy Institute why black unemployment in Texas appeared to be running higher than white and Hispanic unemployment. Josh Bivens, director of research and policy, said by email this may be because of discrimination in the labor market and pre-labor market. And what’s the "pre-labor" market? Bivens said residential segregation can lead to blacks going to lower-quality primary and secondary schools, potentially resulting in lower levels of educational achievement and less lucrative jobs. We also sought an explanation of the cited differences from Chris King, director of the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources at the University of Texas. By email, King said labor economists would explain higher unemployment among blacks/African Americans nationally by pointing out that African Americans tend to have lower levels of education and be employed in lower-paying occupations and industries than whites. King elaborated by pointing out Bureau of Labor Statistics data covering 2011 showing black men more likely to work in service, production, transportation and "material moving" jobs. Conversely, he wrote, black men were less likely to work in professional and managerial jobs than whites; the picture was similar, he said, for black women. (See his full reply here.) Another view Separately to our inquiry, analyst Chuck DeVore of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation suggested real median hourly wage estimates used by the institute may deliver an incomplete picture of economic well being. "People don’t live on wages alone," DeVore said, adding that a more accurate indicator of wealth would be household income, folding in Social Security, inheritances and any other financial assistance. See more on this aspect here. Our ruling The Texas Organizing Project said: "The unemployment rate among blacks in Texas is 9.5% -- far more than double white unemployment -- and wages have fallen for black workers in Texas since 2000." Texas African Americans may not have been as bad off as residents of other states, and this claim doesn’t acknowledge wage fluctuations over the years. Regardless, evidence shows Texas blacks having a higher unemployment rate than fellow Texans and also being the lone group with lower wages in 2014 than in 2000. We rate the statement True.

pomt-05182	Says Robert Menendez is "the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/14/joseph-kyrillos/gop-us-senate-candidate-joe-kyrillos-slams-incumbe/	When it comes to raising money from Wall Street, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos recently offered a clear distinction between him and Democratic incumbent Robert Menendez. Menendez is the "king" of such donations, while Kyrillos has received nothing of the sort, he said. "The guys in Washington – including my opponent, Senator Menendez – they govern by press release, and so, it’s laughable to talk about the Wall Street thing, because he’s the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate," Kyrillos, a state senator, said in a June 6 interview on NJToday. "I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all." PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Kyrillos needs to check his own campaign account. He’s right about Menendez being one of the leading recipients in the U.S. Senate of donations from the Securities & Investment industry, if not exactly the "king." But Kyrillos is wrong to say he hasn’t received any such donations, when records show he has collected nearly $60,000 for his current campaign. To analyze Kyrillos’ claim, we researched data available on OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan website tracking political donations. The website is managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics. The latest data on the Securities & Investment industry includes figures released by the Federal Election Commission on June 4 -- two days before Kyrillos’ interview. The donations tallied on the website represent contributions of $200 or more from employees and political action committees within the industry. According to that data, Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the industry between 1989 and 2012. Menendez served as a congressman for 13 years before joining the Senate in 2006. That amount puts Menendez in 15th place among the nation’s 100 Senators for such donations, according to data on OpenSecrets.org. The 14 Senators with greater donations than Menendez include six Democrats, seven Republicans and one Independent. The leading recipient is former presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), who has received about $11.2 million from the Securities & Investment industry. In a statement, Menendez’s campaign manager, Michael Soliman, pointed to the senator’s "long-standing record of championing common sense reforms that have sided with consumers over banks." "This silly partisan gotcha attack is absurd - by Joe Kyrlllos’s own standard John McCain, Mark Kirk, Scott Brown and Mitch McConnell - four Republican senator's - are the real Kings of Raising Money from Wall Street," Soliman added, referring to other senators who have raised more money from the industry than Menendez. As for Kyrillos, he has received his share of such donations as well. According to OpenSecrets.org, Kyrillos has received nearly $60,000 from the Securities & Investment industry for his current campaign. Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, responded to our findings in a statement: "You seem to be on a search to find anyway to find our statements not accurate and are missing the main point Senator Kyrillos made—Bob Menendez was cited as a top recipient of Wall Street money and Joe Kyrillos was not." Our ruling As the battle heats up for a U.S. Senate seat, Kyrillos claimed Menendez is "the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven’t raised any Wall Street money at all." Data on OpenSecrets.org shows that Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the Securities & Investment industry, putting him in 15th place among sitting Senators for such donations. That ranking means Menendez is one of the leading recipients, but it’s an exaggeration to call him "the king of raising money from Wall Street." Also, Kyrillos is wrong about his own fundraising, because he’s received nearly $60,000 from the industry for his current campaign, according to OpenSecrets.org. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06936	"The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/20/alan-hays/senators-says-legislature-didnt-file-lawsuit-fight/	How the Legislature decides to redraw state and congressional legislative districts in 2012 will be one of the bigger political stories of the coming year. So at PolitiFact Florida, we think it's important to stay on top of the claims coming out of the redistricting discussion. Florida Sen. Alan Hays, an Umatilla Republican, made several claims that we thought worth checking to clarify that debate. They all come from the same exchange with a voter during a July 13, 2011 public hearing at The Villages, a mainly conservative retirement community in Central Florida. "Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote," the voter said to a group of legislators, including Hays. "I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?" "Did I vote for what?" Hays asked. "....These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?" the man asked. The amendments the man was referring to were Amendments 5 and 6, which were approved by voters in 2010. The amendments were sold by supporters as a way to keep the politics out of redrawing legislative boundaries. But two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- are seeking to overturn Amendment 6 (which relates to congressional redistricting) arguing that the amendment will negatively affect minority representation. "No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit," Hays said later in response to the man. "The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman. The Florida House chose to go, and what's the term? An intervenor? ... in seeking clarification. The Florida House intervened. But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money." In one item, we checked Hays' assertion that he "did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit." In another, we checked Hays' statement that tax dollars are not being used to fight the lawsuit. In this fact-check, we're seeing if Hays is right to say that "the Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6." As we noted, the amendments were crafted as a way to eliminate gerrymandering and keep elected officials from drawing districts to their benefit. Amendment 5 deals with state legislative districts, and Amendment 6 covers congressional districts. The amendments were approved by the required 60 percent of voters during the Nov. 2, 2010, election. Here are their ballot summaries: Amendment 5 — Legislative districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries. Amendment 6 — Congressional districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries. The day after Florida voters passed both amendments, Brown and Diaz-Balart filed a lawsuit challenging Amendment 6. Brown, who is black and Diaz-Balart who is Hispanic, argued that Amendment 6 would reverse efforts to help minorities -- such as themselves -- get elected to Congress. The lawsuit did not challenge Amendment 5 because that dealt only with seats in the state Legislature while Amendment 6 relates to congressional boundaries. Records in U.S. District Court show that on Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House, represented by the GrayRobinson law firm, filed an unopposed motion to intervene as a plaintiff. On the same day, the House filed a complaint asking that Amendment 6 be declared unconstitutional. On March 17, the court granted the House's motion to become an intervenor. The case is still pending in U.S. District Court. The Senate has not joined the lawsuit, and Senate President Mike Haridopolos' Chief of Staff Craig Meyer told us July 15 the Senate has no intention of trying to join the lawsuit. "The voters spoke; we want to respect the voters," Haridopolos said in a Florida Times-Union article in February. In other words, Brown and Diaz-Balart were the original plaintiffs and the Florida House was added on as an additional "plaintiff intervenor" as written on court documents. The Senate isn't a party. What's important for this fact-check is to know that a plaintiff intervenor is an actual plaintiff. Just like an original plaintiff, in its role as the plaintiff intervenor the Florida House has lawyers and files motions. The two members of Congress and the Florida House are now on the same side of the legal fight in court against the defendant, the Florida Secretary of State (the state agency is the defendant because it is the agency implementing the amendments). "Because Amendment 6 was enacted wholly outside of the state legislative process and imposes requirements that go beyond simply regulating the 'manner' of congressional elections the Court should declare that it is invalid and grant judgment in plaintiffs' favor," attorneys for the Brown, Diaz-Balart and the Florida House wrote in a April 25 court motion. We sent Hays' claim to a few law professors in Florida to ask if Hays was right to state that the Legislature didn't file a lawsuit to fight the amendments. We also asked if his characterization of being an intervenor in this instance was simply seeking "clarification." We interviewed by e-mail Bob Jarvis, at Nova Southeastern University; Michael Froomkin, at the University of Miami and Joe Little, at the University of Florida. Hays scores points here in a purely technical way because the House wasn't the original filer of the lawsuit and technically intervening isn't the same as being the original filer. But Hays' comments are disingenuous, Jarvis said. "The lawsuit was not filed by the Legislature, but the Legislature is spending taxpayer dollars on a court fight whose goal is to have the amendments declared invalid. ... The plaintiff controls the lawsuit; the intervenor comes along for the ride and has much less say in how the case proceeds. So tactically, you usually want to be the plaintiff." Here, it does not make much difference, because the plaintiff and the intervenor both want the amendment declared unconstitutional, Jarvis wrote. Hays' use of the word "clarification" is also misleading, Jarvis said, because "there is nothing for the court to clarify with respect to the amendments -- they either are constitutional or they are not. A clarification would involve, for example, a question regarding how the amendments are to be operationally implemented." Little, who emphasized that he hadn't looked at the court filings and was speaking in general, wrote that while the difference between filing a lawsuit and intervening on the side of the plaintiff is a factual distinction, "On the merits the distinction would be seen by most people as 'without a difference.'" In most cases the difference between the original filer and the intervenor is "utterly technical" once the intervenor is allowed to join, Froomkin wrote. "For example, if the original plaintiff were to pull out, the intervenor would have a right to continue the suit. When they are both in, both have the same rights as each other." We asked Hays about his claims during an interview July 15. He said he could have been clearer by saying the Senate was not party to the lawsuit, instead of the Legislature. "Did I speak inaccurately? Perhaps I did. If we are going to split the hair a part of the Legislature did join the lawsuit -- they didn't file the lawsuit." Hays also disagreed with the suggestion that the House is "suing" the people of Florida. "If the House was suing the people of Florida, No. 1 the House would have been one of the initiators of the thing. Their purpose would have been to overturn the thing." Hays said he has heard the House chose to join the lawsuit "for clarification to determine whether or not that amendment in the Florida Constitution puts us in conflict with the U.S. Constitution." He said the goal of the two members of Congress is to overturn Amendment 6. If Hays had said the "Florida Senate has not filed a lawsuit against Amendments 5 and 6" that would be a true statement -- the Senate has not joined the lawsuit against Amendment 6 and has no plans to do so. And the lawsuit is about Amendment 6 -- not Amendment 5. But that's not what Hays said -- he said the Legislature has not filed a lawsuit. While that's true on a technical level -- the two members of Congress filed the lawsuit -- the House did join as a plaintiff. Hays later explained that the House joined as an intervenor "seeking clarification" but the House is seeking more than clarification -- the House has filed a motion asking that Amendment 6 be declared unconstitutional. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09998	"Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table" of abandoning the dollar for a multinational currency.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/michele-bachmann/defending-dollar-bachmann-distorts-geithners-comme/	Rep. Michele Bachmann has been uncommonly strident lately in her opposition to the Democrats running Congress and the Obama administration. Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican who is a tax lawyer, considers herself a "foreign correspondent on enemy lines" in Washington, D.C. She also called for an "orderly revolution" against the Democrats on a recent radio show. One source of her concern, Bachmann has said repeatedly, is that she fears the Obama administration wants to do away with the dollar. She introduced a constitutional amendment on March 25 that would prohibit that. Thirty-one Republicans have co-sponsored it. In a news release announcing the measure, Bachmann claimed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had said he was open to the idea of dropping the dollar. "Yesterday, during a Financial Services Committee hearing, I asked Secretary Geithner if he would denounce efforts to move towards a global currency and he answered unequivocally that he would," Bachmann said in the March 25, 2009 news release . "And President Obama gave the nation the same assurances. But just a day later, Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table. I want to know which it is." Bachmann's allegation that Geithner "left the option on the table" is based on comments he made at a question-and-answer session that day at the Council on Foreign Relations. Here's the relevant exchange: "Wonder if you could comment on two related things," a questioner said to Geithner. "One, the Chinese government proposal about a global currency; and about the IMF regulations..." "On the first question, I haven't read the (Chinese central bank) governor's proposal," Geithner said. "He's a remarkably — a very thoughtful, very careful, distinguished central banker. Generally find him sensible on every issue." It might have sounded to those who don't follow finance that Geithner declined to dismiss the idea of replacing the dollar with a multinational currency. But those who do follow finance would know the Chinese proposal had nothing to do with replacing the U.S. currency. Rather, it was to replace the dollar as the international reserve currency. An Associated Press Q-and-A about the Chinese proposal published a day before Bachmann's news release explained the difference: "Q: Does China want to get rid of the dollar and other currencies?" it says. "A: No, Americans wouldn't be expected to give up the dollar, nor would China give up its yuan, for that matter. The idea is to create an international currency that China and other countries could use to hold trillions of dollars in reserves." Chinese officials have argued that creating a new global currency for international reserves would protect them from the danger of inflation of the dollar, which would lower the value of their reserves. In any event, for Geithner to entertain the Chinese idea (which he later firmly rejected) was decidedly not to consider pulling the greenback off the street in favor of some one-world currency. Yet that is clearly how Bachmann portrayed Geithner's remarks. Bachmann's spokeswoman, Debee Keller, said, "We all recognize the difference between the global reserve currency and the actual currency we use here in the U.S." She said Bachmann was trying to defend the dollar's status in both regards. But in her news release and in public comments, Bachmann continually distorted the issue, suggesting that Geithner expressed openness to replacing the dollar as the U.S. currency. For example, her news release was titled: "Bachmann Demands Truth: Will Obama Administration Abandon Dollar for a Multi-National Currency?" It said her resolution would "bar the dollar from being replaced by any foreign currency." And her proposed constitutional amendment makes no mention of an international reserve currency — rather it would forbid the president from "entering into a treaty or other international agreement that would provide for the United States to adopt as legal tender in the United States a currency issued by an entity other than the United States." Bachmann continued to confuse the issue the next day on Hannity's America: "I'm very concerned about the international moves they're making," she said, referring to the Obama administration. "Particularly the question that there was about moving the United States off of the dollar and onto a global currency, like Russia and China are calling for." Again, Russia and China were not calling for "moving the United States off the dollar." A few days later, on the Glenn Beck Program, Bachmann made comments that indicated more understanding of the subtlety of the issue. Instead of railing against replacing the dollar, she referred to the prospect of the International Monetary Fund "taking the dollar off as the medium of exchange." But never during that appearance did she correct Beck's introduction, in which he had said Geithner "can't make up his mind whether or not he supports the global currency to replace the U.S. dollar or leave the U.S. dollar. The next guest (Bachmann) adamantly opposes a global currency and is proposing legislation now that would prohibit the United States from recognizing any other currency besides the greenback." So Bachmann left Beck's viewers with the impression that Geithner was open to abandoning the dollar. This claim, which Bachmann repeated in several forums over several days, including in a news release that remains on her Web site, is just wrong. That earns a False on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-14327	"Since 1900, six (U.S. Supreme Court) justices have been confirmed during election years, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in the final year of the Reagan Administration."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/mar/29/mark-herring/herring-correct-about-supreme-court-justices-confi/	Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring dismisses the notion that the U.S. Senate shouldn’t fill the Supreme Court vacancy before voters head to the polls in November. "Since 1900, six (U.S. Supreme Court) justices have been confirmed during election years, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in the final year of the Reagan Administration," Herring and fellow Democratic attorneys general wrote in a March 10 letter to U.S. Senate leaders. Herring’s letter was sent less than a week before President Barack Obama nominated U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, who died Feb. 13. We recently looked at another Herring claim that every nominee since 1875 had received a confirmation hearing, a statement we rated Mostly False. Here, we’re checking to see whether the attorney general was closer to the mark when he said there have been six justices confirmed during presidential election years since the start of the 20th century. Michael Kelly, his spokesman, pointed us to several sources to back Herring’s statement, including a nearly identical claim on the White House website. He also pointed us to several other sources, including an article in The New York Times about presidential election year confirmations and the U.S. Senate’s historic listing of all Supreme Court vacancies. We have some familiarity with the history of presidential election year confirmations going back to 1940, because we checked a statement by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, who claimed that was the last time the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year. We rated that claim Half True. Our colleagues at PolitiFact have looked at statements examining presidential year confirmations going back even further, to the early 1900s, which hews more closely to Herring’s claim. We examined the record to see if Herring was correct. The first Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year in the 20th century occurred in 1912. President William Howard Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney in February that year, and the Senate confirmed him the following month. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis and John Clarke to the high court, and both were confirmed that year. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo to high court, and the Senate confirmed him within two weeks. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the court; the overwhelmingly Democratic-led Senate approved the choice less than two weeks later. After Murphy’s elevation to the court, it would be nearly five decades before there was another justice confirmed in an election year. Anthony Kennedy, the justice Herring specifically cited in his letter, was confirmed in a 97-0 vote in the Democratically controlled Senate on Feb. 3, 1988. That was the final full year of President Ronald Reagan’s administration. Republicans argue that Kennedy’s case isn’t comparable to the current Supreme Court vacancy, because Kennedy filled a seat that opened six months before the 1988 election year. Reagan initially nominated Robert Bork to fill the vacancy left by retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., but the Senate rejected him in a vote that October. Reagan then announced he would nominate Douglas Ginsburg. But Ginsburg’s nomination was withdrawn after he acknowledged smoking marijuana as a college student and early in his teaching career. Finally, Reagan nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Regardless of that debate, Kennedy’s elevation to the court indeed did occur during an election year. We should note there have been some false starts in getting high court nominees through the Senate during a presidential election year. President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice and nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the bench in 1968. But both nominations fizzled after the Senate filibustered the Fortas nomination. Our ruling Herring said there have been six presidential election year confirmations for Supreme Court seats going back to 1900. There indeed were six justices confirmed during presidential election years in that time frame. We rate his claim True.

pomt-09659	"If you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/30/paul-krugman/krugman-says-bush-was-first-president-lead-country/	With President Barack Obama scheduled to make a speech on Dec. 1 on how the United States will proceed with the war in Afghanistan, war spending was the topic du jour on the Sunday political talk shows. Some Democratic officials have even talked of a war surtax to pay for the expense of additional troops. Depending on how many more troops Obama decides to send, the cost could top $30 billion. "This is a lot of money," liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Nov. 29, 2009. "And the point is, we should have been paying for these wars to begin with, right from the beginning. I mean, this was, if you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes." As the talk about the price tag for the war in Afghanistan heats up, we thought it would be worthwhile to take a look at Krugman's claim about Bush being the first to cut taxes after leading the country into war, and to add some context. Generally, we found, taxes and wars have followed a fairly predictable pattern: Taxes rise during wartime and then come back down in the years afterward. We'll start with the Civil War. Congress enacted various income and excise taxes to meet the rising cost of the war, most of which were repealed in the years after the war. During World War I, the 1916 Revenue Act and the War Revenue Act of 1917 increased tax revenue from $761 million in 1916 to $3.6 billion in 1918. After the war, in the 1920s, Congress cut taxes five times. The same was true during World War II. Tax increases over several years raised revenues from $8.7 billion in 1941 to $45.2 billion in 1945. Again, tax cuts followed the war. It's worth noting, however, that during all of those wars, the war expenses were much larger than today, relative to the size of the economy. Congress hasn't formally declared war since then, but we think it's fair to consider the wars in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and Iraq. However, we have decided not to include the armed conflicts in Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989 due to their much smaller cost, length and scope. So those are the wars. But what about major tax cuts? That's a smaller and somewhat more subjective list. Some of the most notable tax cuts have come during peacetime, such as the Reagan tax cut that took effect over the years 1982-84, and the smaller capital gains tax cuts under Carter and Clinton. The one notable exception is the Kennedy tax cuts, which took effect in 1964. The conflict in Vietnam stretched from 1959 to 1975, but when the Kennedy tax cuts were implemented, the Vietnam War did not have much of an impact on the U.S. budget. Within 18 months, when the tax cuts were in full bloom, the United States was spending plenty in Vietnam. The tax rates were phasing down just as our commitment in Vietnam was ramping up, said William Ahern of the Tax Foundation. "That would maybe be a counter example (to Krugman)," he said. But many argue the Kennedy tax cuts shouldn't count in Krugman's example because they came at a time when the United States did not anticipate the escalation of the war that followed. "The Kennedy tax cuts were proposed, and then adopted by Congress, before the Vietnam war was a big expenditure item," said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "Vietnam initially did not require much in the way of additional outlays; it was not like either World War II or the Korean War, which started out with a huge runup in military spending. It was not until 1968 that the Johnson administration proposed the surtax to help pay for the Vietnam War. ... Still, the Vietnam era surtax went into effect within five years of major spending on that war. We are now more than eight years into the 'war on terrorism,' and we’ve had only tax reductions; no tax hikes." We think Krugman is on firm ground. Aside from the Kennedy tax cuts during the Vietnam War, which were adopted before Vietnam became such a major fiscal issue, taxes have gone up during war. "Traditionally countries raise taxes to pay for wars, then cut taxes by a portion of the amount raised once peace descends," agreed J.D. Foster, senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. But Foster noted two caveats. One, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 came during a jobless recovery period after a recession. And the economic stimulus package championed by Obama includes $282 billion in tax cuts over two years -- also in the midst of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Curious though," Foster said, "whether Krugman is arguing we should have raised taxes when the economy was experiencing a jobless recovery (and by implication arguing we should raise taxes now), or whether he is trying to say Obama is just like Bush since if Bush was the first to do this, then Obama was the second." Krugman has not advocated a tax increase to deal with the war in Afghanistan. And we think Krugman also has some wiggle room on that second point, because he said Bush was the first president who "took us into a war" and cut taxes. Both wars were inherited by Obama. Again, there are many different political and economic realities now than there were when taxes generally rose during wars, but Krugman is still mostly right. We dock him some points, though, because the Kennedy tax cuts technically came during the Vietnam War and rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11935	A Homeland Security study "showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/oct/12/casey-cagle/georgia-lt-gov-casey-cagle-misleads-claim-about-ho/	Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said his state won’t tolerate sanctuary cities and cited as backup a federal report, claiming it found that more than 100 murders could have been prevented if communities worked with immigration officers. "Sanctuary city" is a term commonly used for a jurisdiction that limits its cooperation with immigration authorities. Federal officials send requests to local jails asking them to hold individuals scheduled for release so that immigration officers can pick them up. The extent of cooperation and scope of the policies implemented vary by jurisdiction. Cagle, who is running for governor, told a local news station that the City of Decatur may be in violation of a state law prohibiting sanctuary cities. "How are they in direct violation?" WSB-TV’s Craig Lucie asked Cagle. (Decatur said it complies with state law and called the sanctuary city label a misunderstanding.) "Well, they are not cooperating with (U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement), and the important feature of this is that criminal illegal aliens, it was demonstrated with a Homeland Security study, that showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security," Cagle said Oct. 9. President Donald Trump has claimed that sanctuary cities attract criminals and blamed their policies for the killings of Americans by immigrants in the country illegally. Given the national debate about sanctuary cities, we wondered if Cagle was right that the Department of Homeland Security had determined that 120 murders might not have happened if communities cooperated with immigration authorities. We found that DHS has not done a study on this issue. Cagle’s office pointed us to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which said that according to ICE data, "up to 121 homicides in the U.S. could have been avoided" between fiscal years 2010 and 2014 if ICE had deported criminal immigrants instead of releasing them back into the United States. But that letter is not about sanctuary cities’ lack of cooperation with ICE. DHS, Cagle’s response David Lapan, spokesman for DHS, told PolitiFact that neither DHS or ICE had published a report showing that murders could have been prevented in communities if they complied with immigration authorities. "However, there are instances where criminal aliens who were released from jails -- without allowing ICE to take custody -- who then went on to commit additional crimes, including murder," Lapan said. But information provided by Cagle’s office did not support the claim that 120 murders took place due to sanctuary city policies. A June 12, 2015, letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then Sen. Jeff Sessions, who chaired the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, specified that 121 criminal immigrants were charged with homicide after their release from ICE custody from fiscal years 2010 and 2014. Of the 121 individuals released by ICE: • 33 were released on a bond set by the Justice Department’s Executive Office of Immigration Review; • 24 were released because a 2001 Supreme Court case, Zadvydas vs. Davis, prevents the indefinite detention of immigrants who can’t be deported (some countries won’t take back their nationals ordered removed); • 64 were released per ICE’s discretion. The letter does not say that the homicides for which the 121 individuals were charged could have been prevented if communities or sanctuary cities had cooperated with ICE. It centered on ICE’s release of the immigrants from their custody. The senators asked DHS, the State Department and the Attorney General to identify the jurisdictions to which the 121 criminal immigrants were released. A June 16, 2015, letter sent to ICE’s assistant secretary doesn’t cite a specific number of homicides that could have been avoided, but more broadly said 121 criminals who were not deported were charged with homicides after their release from ICE custody between fiscal years 2010 and 2014. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels, reviewed data related to the 121 criminal immigrants. "This tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ICE declined to take them into custody due to Obama administration prioritization policies. This list includes only those aliens that ICE arrested and then released," the center reported in March 2016. Cagle’s overarching message is that homicides could have been prevented if criminal immigrants were deported, his office said. "The safety and security of every Georgian has been, and always will be, the top priority of Lt. Gov. Cagle," said Bo Butler, Cagle’s chief of staff. "The point in referencing this shocking number of murders is that Homeland Security concluded at least 121 homicides were committed by convicted criminal illegal aliens. Had deportation occurred following the previous convictions, this loss of life could have been prevented." Our ruling Cagle said that a Homeland Security study "showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security." Many elements of this statement are wrong. DHS said it had not published such a report. Cagle’s office actually referred to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing ICE data, that said up to 121 homicides could have been avoided if ICE had deported criminal immigrants. While the letter started off saying 121 homicides were preventable, the document focuses on 121 being the number of criminal immigrants who were charged with homicide after being released by ICE. Most importantly, while homicides were committed, the letter does not claim they could have been avoided had sanctuary policies not been in place. Cagle’s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.

pomt-05023	Funding the federal health care law without a tax hike will "require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/16/brian-robinson/deal-spokesman-slips-health-care-impact-georgia/	The recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the federal health care law had many Georgians attempting to figure out what it meant for the state. Brian Robinson, the communications director for Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, offered some insight in a front-page article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that had a few readers and organizations questioning its accuracy. A couple of them contacted PolitiFact Georgia to get some answers. State officials have said the law will result in at least 620,000 additional Georgians being eligible for its Medicaid program, which they estimate will cost about $4.5 billion over 10 years. Georgia was one of about two dozen states to join the lawsuit against the health care law that was reviewed by the Supreme Court. "To pay for the expansion without tax increases would require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget," Robinson said. "And that’s after we’ve shaved off billions in state spending since the beginning of the Great Recession." Cutting a quarter of the state budget? That could be catastrophic. The Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, which has concluded the health care law will save Georgia money, quickly disputed Robinson’s math in a news release. The institute, which frequently takes moderate to liberal positions on many Georgia fiscal issues, also pressed the state to provide information detailing how it calculated the $4.5 billion estimate on state finances. "It makes the issue sound bigger than it is," Tim Sweeney, the institute’s director of health policy, said of Robinson’s claim in a telephone interview. "We want to make sure it’s out there that it’s not true." The Georgia General Assembly adopted a $19.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1. The health care law expands Medicaid eligibility in 2014 to nearly all Americans under 65 with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. An additional 5 percent is disregarded when determining income eligibility, which effectively raises the threshold to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The 2012 federal poverty level for a family of four in Georgia is $23,050. The number of Georgia enrollees is projected to rise from 1.6 million to nearly 2.3 million as a result of the the law. The law provides that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these individuals through 2016. In the following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. The impact on state government in Fiscal Year 2015 is expected to be about $225 million, according to the state Department of Community Health. The annual impact of the health care law on Georgia’s Medicaid program rises by about $100 million a year between fiscal years 2016 and 2022, the state estimates. Georgia’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends June 30. As we noted, the state budget is $19.3 billion. If the state had to cut a quarter of its current budget, that figure would be about $4.825 billion. But the health care law’s impact on Medicaid spending in Georgia is projected to stretch over 10 years, not one year. The Fiscal Year 2014 impact on Medicaid spending is estimated to be about $80 million, which would be about 2 percent of the state budget if the budget remains at its current levels. Robinson, after an initial refusal to discuss the matter, admitted he erred. "What I said isn’t accurate," he told us. "I messed up. I was correctly quoted by the reporter." Robinson said his underlying point was that the health care law would result in potentially a major financial commitment from the state for Medicaid payments. "The way I said it made it sound like we’re spending $4.5 billion more per year. That’s not true," Robinson wrote us via email. "I SHOULD have said ‘Over 10 years, the new mandated spending will total a quarter of what the state spends on ALL services in its annual budget." Indeed. If he had said the potential impact of the health care law on Medicaid is equivalent to a quarter of the state’s budget, Robinson would have earned a True rating. But our rating of his actual statement as it appeared in the newspaper: False.	None	Brian Robinson	None	None	None	2012-07-16T06:00:00	2012-07-08	['None']
pomt-11001	Says Bernie Sanders was indifferent to Russia's annexation of Crimea because he felt "they have a lot of Russians anyway."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/11/danielle-pletka/was-bernie-sanders-fine-russian-annexation-crimea-/	Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea is poised to resurface as President Donald Trump prepares for his first summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Virtually the entire global community, including President Barack Obama’s administration, refused to recognize the annexation, which was the first such takeover in Europe since the end of the Cold War. But given Trump’s friendliness to Putin, some foreign policy specialists are wondering whether the president might soon change the U.S. position on the annexation of territory that belonged to Ukraine. During the July 8 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka, the senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, equated the Russia-friendly comments of Trump with the stance of the 2016 Democratic presidential runner-up, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "The Crimea thing highlights something much more important, which is this awful meeting of sort of the Bernie bros and the Trump people on this question of eating away at other country's sovereignty," Pletka said. "You know, ‘Oh no, that's fine, what do we care? Crimea, they've got a lot of Russians anyway.’ Bernie Sanders took that position, President Trump takes that position. I don't understand why it is that the center-right and the center-left are not more forceful on this issue." There’s a problem with this assertion: Sanders has consistently opposed the Russian annexation of Crimea. Here are some of his comments (with bold emphasis by us): • On March 17, 2014, Sanders wrote in an official statement, "The entire world has got to stand up to Putin. We've got to deal with sanctions." • On Feb. 4, 2016, during an MSNBC Democratic primary debate, Sanders said, "I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine." (Sanders did go on to say that he ranked the "isolated" nation of North Korea as the most serious national security threat to the United States, above Russia, without minimizing Russia’s threats.) • Feb. 11, 2016, during a PBS Democratic primary debate, Sanders said, "Right now, we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO — correctly, I believe — are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression." When we contacted Sanders’ office, they said the senator stands by the positions in these quotes. The closest potential evidence suggesting that Sanders was copacetic with the annexation of Crimea was his vote against legislation that would tighten sanctions on Russia. The bill, called the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, passed with only three nay votes in the House and two in the Senate, including Sanders, before it was signed by Trump in August 2017. However, Sanders made clear that his objection to the bill had to do with its policies toward Iran, not the sanctions on Russia. In June 15, 2017, statement, Sanders said, "I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on Russia included in this bill. It is unacceptable for Russia to interfere in our elections here in the United States, or anywhere around the world. There must be consequences for such actions." However, Sanders continued that on Iran, "these new sanctions could endanger the very important nuclear agreement that was signed between the United States, its partners and Iran in 2015." (Trump subsequently dropped United States support for the Iran nuclear agreement.) Russia specialists we contacted agreed that Sanders has been consistent in opposing the annexation of Crimea. "I don’t think there is evidence that Sanders or his supporters were ever in support of Russian annexation of Crimea," said Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist. "Both center-left and center-right supported sanctions and punishment of Russia over Crimea annexation." Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, agreed. "The Sanders campaign considered the annexation of Crimea illegal and illegitimate," said Dan Nexon, an associate professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. "He did have a more calibrated position that sought to balance, on the one hand, deterrence and pressure with, on the other hand, avoiding unnecessary escalation. But it was never that he said, ‘That’s fine. What do we care?’" Pletka told PunditFact that she may have conflated some past research she had done on the issue, inaccurately attributing the views of some left-wing Democrats to Sanders, who did not share them. Our ruling Pletka said Sanders was indifferent to Russia's annexation of Crimea because he felt "they have a lot of Russians anyway." We found no evidence to support that assertion. To the contrary, we found that Sanders has consistently criticized the annexation since it occurred and supported measures to punish Russia. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07006	Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign has "exactly the same" challenges as Ronald Reagan’s successful 1980 bid.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/08/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-campaign-problems-exactly-same-reaga/	Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich is comparing his struggles to those of President Ronald Reagan so often it’s turning into a habit. The former West Georgia College history professor said June 22, during a speech at the Atlanta Press Club, that on the day of the 1980 New Hampshire primary, "the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff quit." We ruled his claim Mostly True. Gingrich recycled the historical tidbit that same day before a crowd near Baltimore and to Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, both times in slightly different ways that hewed close to the truth. But the Truth-O-Meter's dial began to spin when it got word of what Gingrich said June 27 on Fox News’ "Your World With Neil Cavuto." Cavuto asked Gingrich how he will fight the perception his campaign is "rudderless" and assure voters that he can get his campaign on track. "Well, first of all, by not being distracted, but focusing on substance and talking about the solutions we need as a country, and second by reminding people that Ronald Reagan had exactly the same challenges in 1980 -- John McCain had exactly the same challenges in 2007," Gingrich said. Ronald Reagan had "exactly the same" challenges in 1980 as Newt Gingrich does? We rated his earlier statement Mostly True because on balance, Gingrich’s claim squared with history. At about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day of the New Hampshire primary, Reagan met with campaign manager John Sears and two other top staffers in his hotel suite. Reagan and others blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses. Reagan handed Sears a news release that announced the campaign’s new manager was future Central Intelligence Agency head William Casey. It said Sears had resigned to return to his law practice. Sears got the message and left, as did staffers loyal to him. Gingrich’s memory wasn’t perfect. But yes, many of Reagan’s top aides left the campaign on the day of his blowout victory in New Hampshire. Staffers left Gingrich’s campaign under very different circumstances. News accounts said Gingrich’s high command rebelled after disagreements on the direction of the campaign. The Associated Press, which broke the story, described the dissent as a "rebellion." On-the-record accounts indicate Gingrich did not orchestrate these departures as Reagan did in 1980. Staffers left of their own accord because they disagreed with the direction of the campaign. The departures started May 31, when Will Rogers, Gingrich’s Iowa political director, resigned. Rogers told The Des Moines Register that he thought Gingrich wasn’t campaigning or fundraising hard enough. Gingrich’s departure for a luxury vacation in the Greek isles was the last straw. Former staffers Rick Tyler, Gingrich’s longtime spokesman, and the campaign’s Iowa director Craig Schoenfield both told The Boston Globe after they left that they and others resigned after a series of meetings involving top-level campaign aides. Schoenfeld told Politico that staffers couldn’t convince Gingrich to run a more labor-intensive campaign. "To be successful in Iowa you need to be here [and] taking a look at the way the schedule was, he’s not scheduled to be here in June at all and he’s got very few appearances in July," Scoenfeld said. "You need to make sure that you give yourself a chance to be successful." Tyler told the National Journal that staffers made up their minds to resign June 9, the day the news broke. There are other glaring differences between the Gingrich and Reagan departures. Reagan switched staff during the primaries, as his campaign gained steam. Gingrich’s staffers left at a low point, after embarrassments on Medicare policy, his vacation to the Greek Isles, and news he held massive credit accounts at the jeweler Tiffany’s. The primaries are still eight months away. Reagan lined up replacements before he pushed out his old staffers. Ten days after Gingrich’s staff left en masse, The Des Moines Register reported that Gingrich had yet to replace his Iowa staff. At the Atlanta Press club, Gingrich referenced Reagan campaign history to drive home the fairly vanilla point that "campaigns go up and down." On Fox News, his point that he had "exactly the same" problems as Reagan in 1980 is outrageous self-flattery. Reagan was on an upswing when his staffers left. Gingrich’s campaign is in a rut. Reagan had replacements ready. Gingrich did not. Reagan pushed out his staffers to run a more competitive campaign. Gingrich’s left him because they thought he wouldn’t do what it takes to win. Gingrich started off in Atlanta with a statement about Reagan that was close to the truth, but as he repeated it, he embellished the facts so much that only a kernel of truth remained. Gingrich might wish he had Reagan’s problems. But on this one he deserves a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-07-08T06:00:00	2011-06-27	['Ronald_Reagan', 'Newt_Gingrich']

pomt-06915	Says members of the military have sent him more campaign contributions than they’ve sent President Barack Obama and more than twice what they’ve sent other Republican presidential candidates.	true	/texas/statements/2011/jul/23/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-members-military-have-given-him-far-/	If he were president, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul says, the United States would remove its forces from Afghanistan as "quickly as the ships could get there." In a July 20 interview with PBS’s "NewsHour," the Lake Jackson Republican continued: "It's insane on what we're doing. And I'll tell you one thing about this business about the military: We just had a quarterly (campaign finance) report, and they listed all the money that all the candidates got from the military. I got twice as much as all the other candidates put together on the Republican side, and even more than Obama got, which tells me that these troops want to come home as well because they know exactly what I'm talking about." There’s no clear-cut way to gauge why members of the military gave to Paul’s campaign or to others. But we wondered if Paul was squared away on how much more money his presidential campaign reaped from members of the military. A posting on his campaign website the same day he appeared on "NewsHour" sheds a little light. Headlined "Ron Paul Campaign Raises Most Donations From Military," it says that Paul has "raised more than any other current presidential candidate in donations from members of the military. Of those donors who indicated their occupation and employer, Paul topped the other contenders." Next, we turned to the presidential candidates’ latest campaign finance filings compiled by the Federal Election Commission, which breaks out donations by donors’ employers. In an interview, commission spokeswoman Mary Brandenberger told us the agency makes sure that each report complies with a federal law requiring candidates to list the occupation of each donor of $200 or more. A caveat: We did not achieve accounting-quality math in this look; there’s no quick way to do so. It’s also possible we missed a donation or two. Consider the numbers that follow in the ballpark. That said, from April through June, Paul fielded more than $25,000 from individuals who listed their employer as a branch of the military. Combined, six other Republican presidential candidates listed donations from members of the military totaling about $9,000. Our most-to-least breakdown: Herman Cain, $2,850; Mitt Romney, $2,750; Michele Bachmann, $2,250; Newt Gingrich, $500; and Tim Pawlenty and Rick Santorum, $250 each. On the Democratic side, Obama’s campaign received more than $16,000 in donations from members of the military. After we conducted this rough check, Paul’s campaign spokesman, Gary Howard, said by email that their numbers showed that Paul garnered $34,480 from members of the military; other GOP candidates fielded $13,848 and Obama took in $19,849. Summing up, Paul’s military-connected contributions for the three months more than double such contributions to all the other Republican presidential candidates—and they also exceed Obama’s. We rate his statement True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-07-23T15:28:09	2011-07-20	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-09235	On Sandra Day O'Connor: "I think one reason she was a good judge is she had no judicial experience" before she joined the Supreme Court.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/12/harry-reid/reid-claims-oconnor-had-no-previous-judicial-exper/	In a recent Senate floor speech, Democratic Leader Harry Reid likened Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan to another woman who sat on the court, Sandra Day O'Connor. "One of my favorite Supreme Court Justices in recent years has been Sandra Day O’Connor, not because she’s a Republican, but because she was a good judge. I think one reason she was a good judge is she had no judicial experience," Reid said on May 11, 2010. He pointed out that O'Connor served in the Arizona state legislature, giving her a different perspective on legal matters. "I think Solicitor General Kagan will bring a lot of those same views ... to the bench. That is, she has fresh ideas, she's been out in the real world recently," Reid said. Indeed, before taking a role in Obama's administration, Kagan was the dean of Harvard Law School, a law professor and an advisor to former President Bill Clinton. Prior to that, she served as a clerk for Judge Abner Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. But Kagan has never been a judge, something her critics are quick to point out. O'Connor, who retired from the court 2005, also had a variety of jobs, serving as Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo County, California, and as an Arizona state senator. But unlike Kagan, O'Connor had been a judge. In 1975, O'Connor was elected a judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court, where she served until 1979, when she was appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals, according to her biography on the U.S. Supreme Court Web site. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated O'Connor to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court. We asked Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley, if we were missing something, and he wrote that Reid had simply misspoken. So, O'Connor had six years of judicial experience before she was nominated for a seat on the highest court. We find Reid's claim to be False.

pomt-07608	Says taxpayer resources are being used "to facilitate private political agendas" through automatic payroll deduction of union dues.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/22/john-thrasher/what-does-it-cost-governments-automatic-payroll-de/	Some Republicans in the Florida Legislature are squaring off against unions over a measure that would prohibit public employers from collecting union dues through automatic payroll deductions. Republicans call the measure "paycheck protection," and say it gives individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The law would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions and would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. But opponents liken the measure to union busting, saying it will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. They also argue that the law is unnecessary because Florida is a right-to-work state where no employee can be forced to join a union and pay union dues. By choosing to join the union and pay dues, members are effectively supporting the union's agenda. The back-and-forth has played out several times in House and Senate committee hearings where the bill has been considered. The House version, HB 1021, is being sponsored by Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary. Its Senate companion, SB 830, is sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine. Thrasher argued before the Senate Community Affairs Committee on March 14, 2011, that another reason to support his bill is to remove the government costs of processing union dues collections -- which in turn could be used for political purposes. Thrasher said he had heard from taxpayers who thought "their resources ought not be used to facilitate private political agendas." In the middle of a complex policy discussion, this seemed like an important fact to pin down -- what do governments spend on collecting union dues through payroll deductions? We caught up with Thrasher on the Senate floor to ask him if he had more information about the costs to government. He said he did not, but that there had to be some cost just by the nature of the government performing a task -- payroll deduction -- on behalf of a private entity. "We need to get state and local governments out of the business of being involved in political purposes," he said, echoing comments he made to the Senate committee members. Payroll deduction is common for all workers. Employees automatically have money taken out of their paycheck to pay for all kinds of things. Some deductions are voluntary: student loans, charitable donations, health insurance, life insurance, union dues. Some deductions are not: taxes, alimony and other court-ordered deductions. The state of Florida currently has 364 groups or agencies that have the ability to take money directly from employees' paychecks. Here's the entire list provided to PolitiFact Florida by the state Chief Financial Officer's Office. Three different state legislative analysts have examined the bill, and all at least attempted to see how much governments spend deducting union dues from pay checks. The answer was generally not much, if anything. A House staff analysis said the elimination of payroll deduction for employee unions "may result in a positive, but insignificant, fiscal impact on public employers." A second House analysis said the elimination of payroll deductions "may result in a neutral fiscal impact to public employers." A Senate staff analysis declared the fiscal impact to governments "indeterminate." The CFO's office, which oversees the state payroll system through the Bureau of State Payrolls, told PolitiFact Florida that the process for setting up payroll deduction is "by and large automated." Spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said it's as simple as some group requesting a deduction, that request being approved or denied, and then the bureau assigning a deduction code. "The bureau's deduction code process is, by and large, automated and represents a minimal cost," Lambert said. Practically speaking, there is some personnel time required to set up the deduction and that's about it. State statutes also permit governments to ask unions to pay for deduction costs as part of collective bargaining. Section 447.303, which discusses dues collection for public employees, says that "reasonable costs to the employer of said deductions shall be a proper subject of collective bargaining." And then there's Dorworth, the House sponsor, who told members of the House Budget Committee on March 21, 2011, that eliminating payroll deductions isn't a cost-savings measure. In responding to a question about the cost of eliminating the payroll deductions, Dorworth said, "I tend to agree. There's not any (financial) impact either way." Whatever the state spends on processing payroll deductions, it is so small no one can quantify it. Governments also could ask unions to pay for the cost as part of a union's collective bargaining agreement. There are reasons to vote for this bill, and Dorworth and Thrasher have articulated them, but cost isn't one of them. To us, that makes Thrasher's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07182	Says six of the state’s 58 family planning centers had to close because of Gov. Chris Christie’s budget cuts.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/10/loretta-weinberg/state-sen-loretta-weinberg-says-6-new-jerseys-58-f/	The elimination of nearly $7.5 million in funding for family planning services helped state lawmakers plug a multibillion-dollar budget gap last year. But that’s not all it did, according to state Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen). She says the cuts forced six of 58 family planning centers to close. "In the current budget, the budget under which we are operating, the governor stripped out seven and a half million dollars that went to family planning centers throughout the state of New Jersey," Weinberg said at a discussion she hosted with women’s health care providers and other female Democratic legislators. "At the beginning of this current budget year, we had 58 family planning centers, we now have 52. Six have closed and others have cut back their hours." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check this claim, as lawmakers continue battling over funding for family planning services in New Jersey and nationally. In June 2010, the state Assembly and Senate passed a bill that would restore the $7.45 million in funding cut for family planning services. Gov. Chris Christie vetoed the bill, S2139, saying New Jersey residents have access to "comprehensive reproductive health care services" at other sites and the state can’t afford to "provide duplicative funding for family planning centers." Since then, Donna Leusner, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services, said her agency has been notified that six sites have closed: Westampton and Brown Mills locations run by the Burlington County Health Department; Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey’s Cherry Hill center; FamCare, Inc.’s Millville facility; the Bayonne Women’s Health and Family Planning Center; and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey’s Dover site. The state Senate passed another bill, S2899, on May 23 that would restore the funding, but the Assembly has not yet voted on the measure. The organizations that ran the six centers told PolitiFact New Jersey that state funding cuts forced the closures. Ralph Shrom, a spokesman for Burlington County, said the Westampton clinic and a satellite location at Deborah Hospital in Brown Mills closed at the end of 2010. In Camden County, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey Lynn Brown said her organization closed its family planning services center in Cherry Hill, a site that was operating one day a week, in fall 2010. A Millville location run by FamCare, Inc. that also operated one day a week closed on Dec. 1, according to Kimberly McKown-Strait, the organization’s executive director. The women’s health center in Bayonne officially closed on April 29, Bayonne spokesman Joe Ryan said. Triste Brooks, the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey, said the organization’s Dover site closed at the end of 2010. So let’s review: Six family planning clinics closed during the past fiscal year and representatives from each blamed the loss of state funding for the closure. Christie signed a budget that eliminated $7.45 million in funding for family planning services that the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed. The governor also vetoed a measure that would have restored the funding. We rate Weinberg’s statement that the governor’s cuts forced six family planning centers to close True.

pomt-14189	In the 2014 election, "80 percent of poor people did not vote."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-said-poor-people-dont-vote/	Income inequality is the core issue of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, and he said it may also be why he’s behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders why he thought 16 of 17 states with large wealth gaps were won by Clinton. "Well, because poor people don’t vote. I mean, that’s just a fact," Sanders said. "That’s a sad reality of American society. And that’s why we have to transform one, as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major society of Earth. We have done a good job of bringing young people. But in America today, the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote." Is turnout among the poor really that low? The data shows that we’ve done slightly better at getting out the vote among low-income people than what Sanders suggests, but not by much. Sanders’ policy director Warren Gunnels pointed us to a report by the left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos, which used data from the Census Bureau. "According to Demos, only one in four of those earning less than $10,000 voted in 2014," Gunnels said. "Even worse, the turnout was just 12 percent among 18- to 24-year-olds earning less than $30,000." In other words, roughly 75 percent of people in the lowest income bracket didn’t vote in the last midterm elections. However, there’s one catch to this figure. While an annual income of less than $10,000 is undoubtedly "poor," the poverty threshold in 2014 also includes family incomes above $10,000. Sean McElwee, a policy analyst with Demos who authored the report, told us to look at annual incomes under $30,000 instead. The turnout rate for that group was 31.5 percent, which means 68.5 percent of poor people didn’t vote in 2014, about 10 percentage points less than what Sanders said. "Sanders is indeed correct to highlight low turnout among the poor as an important factor that biases policy in favor of the wealthy," McElwee said. As PolitiFact has reported, census data may overstate the turnout rates, as it’s based on self-reporting. So it’s possible that Sanders’ 80 percent figure is closer to actual rates than what the survey shows, but this is speculative. Sanders is more on target if we look at a definition of "poor" that is not based on income. A 2015 Pew Center survey looked at the politics of financial security, which analysts defined as having a credit card, a savings or checking account, and a retirement or investment plan; not needing to borrow money; not falling behind on bills, rent or mortgage payments; and not receiving food assistance or Medicaid benefits. The survey found that just 20 percent of the least financially secure were "likely voters" in 2014 compared to 69 percent of the most financially secure. Turnout always drops in midterm elections, when the White House isn’t at stake, and overall turnout in 2014 was the worst it had been in 72 years. Nonetheless, census data shows turnout is consistently lower among the poor than other income groups: So why are the poor less likely to vote? The reasons are interconnected, if not unsurprising. For one, the political process sets hurdles for the poor. Registration barriers are key, said McElwee of Demos, pointing to census data that shows that low-income people are far less likely to be registered voters. Voter ID laws, for example, impose costs that people struggling to make ends meet can’t really afford. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2014 that a driver’s license can cost between $5 to $58.50 in states with voter ID laws. And nearly 500,000 eligible voters don’t have convenient access to an ID-issuing office, according to a 2012 study by New York University. The poor also make up 55 percent of people who can’t vote (which include felons and immigrants as well as residents of Washington D.C., and U.S. territories), according to a 2013 Harvard University working paper. "This means that they can't vote but also they won't be mobilized by parties, who base their mobilization off of voter files," McElwee said. Being poor also means you cannot afford to devote time to the political process. The Pew study found that just 26 percent of the least financially secure knew which party controlled Congress compared to 62 percent of the most affluent. Similarly, compared to affluent non-voters, low-income non-voters were more likely to list disinterest, forgetting to vote, health and issues of access as reasons why they didn’t vote, according to census data. "They often have inflexible jobs, have limited transportation options to get to the polls, and/or insufficient knowledge about democracy and the choices they face," said Zoltan Hajnal, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. "The poor also often lack efficacy and don’t feel like their votes count as much." Our ruling Sanders said, "In 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote." The figure is a bit high if we look at turnout by income. In 2014, about 75 percent of people who made under $10,000 and about 69 percent of those who made under $30,000 didn’t vote. If we look at financial insecurity, however, Sanders is right on the money.

pomt-10348	Obama worked with "Sen. Dick Lugar, a Republican, to help lock down loose nuclear weapons."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/barack-obama/obama-lugar-measure-included-weapons-of-mass-destr/	In a new television ad, Sen. Barack Obama makes the case for America leading international efforts to control nuclear weapons. "The single most important national security threat that we face is nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists," Obama says in the ad. "What I did was reach out to Sen. Dick Lugar, a Republican, to help lock down loose nuclear weapons. We have to lead the entire world to reduce that threat. We can restore America's leadership in the world." We checked into Obama's legislative record with Sen. Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. Obama's first foreign travel as a U.S. senator was with Lugar in August 2005, when the two men visited nuclear weapons storage and dismantlement facilities in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. The following spring, Lugar and Obama authored a Senate bill that authorized the president to carry out a program to provide assistance to foreign countries to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bill does not specifically list different types of weapons of mass destruction, but we'll take as a given that it includes nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The larger part of the legislation was a separate measure to stop the spread of conventional weapons, notably shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles that the legislation refers to as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS. The bill's provisions were incorporated into a House bill that passed later that year and was signed into law in January 2007. The Lugar-Obama initiative is modeled after a 1991 bill authored by Lugar and former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn. The Nunn-Lugar program provided U.S. funding and expertise to the former Soviet Union to dismantle stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. We'll note here that the legislation Obama and Lugar sponsored did not deal solely with nuclear weapons, but rather with all weapons of mass destruction, and that a good bit of their legislation focused on conventional weapons. But it does seem like part of the legislation's intent is to "help lock down loose nuclear weapons." For that reason, we find Obama's statement to be True.

pomt-08362	"When President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/26/michael-steele/michael-steele-says-obamas-claims-hypocritical-his/	For weeks, Democratic leaders have been complaining about the tens of millions of dollars being poured into attack ads against the party's candidates. The ads have been funded by independent groups -- like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS -- that have no legal requirement (or inclination) to disclose their donors. President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi say those groups have allowed anonymous special interest groups, perhaps even foreign corporations, undo influence on this election, threatening our very democracy. Asked about it on NBC's Meet the Press on Oct. 23, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele called the Democrats' charge hypocritical. "When President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it. So don't give me this high-and-mighty, holier-than-thou attitude about special interests flooding the political marketplace." We've fact-checked several Democrats' claims about attack ads aimed at their candidates being financed by secret foreign donors. Here, we're checking the counter-claim from Steele, that during the 2008 presidential campaign, "Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it." Despite the context of the conversation, Steele was not contending that the Obama campaign was asked to disclose donors to independent groups funding attack ads. That's a somewhat new phenomenon this election cycle. Trade groups and other 501 (c) groups were always allowed to keep donors anonymous. But the Supreme Court's Citizen United case upped the stakes with a ruling that allows corporations to contribute unlimited amounts to independent efforts to support or oppose a candidate. What Steele was talking about is different. We contacted the RNC for details about Steele's claim and were pointed toward an Associated Press investigation that found the Obama campaign had not properly safeguarded against illegal foreign donations in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election. Candidates can, of course, accept foreign donations from American citizens living overseas, and they are supposed to return any money donated by foreign nationals. But the AP investigation found "clear evidence that the campaigns of both Obama and John McCain took money first and asked questions later. Shining a light on a weakness in the nation's campaign finance laws, the review turned up a smattering of illegal foreign donations to Obama as well as missing details in federal paperwork the law requires from Obama and McCain." The issue was particularly striking, the story noted, as Obama was getting two-thirds of his contributions via the Internet. Online donors were asked to check a box certifying they were U.S. citizens. Although the Federal Elections Commission instructs campaigns to seek a donor's current U.S. passport when accepting money from an overseas address, many donors contacted by the AP said they were not asked to produce one before making their donation. In one case highlighted in the story, the Obama campaign accepted a $500 donation from a Canadian man who wrote "I am not an American citizen!" on his contribution. The Federal Elections Commission requires that "treasurers of political committees exercise best efforts to obtain, maintain and report the complete identification of each contributor whose contributions aggregate more than $200 per calendar year." The Obama campaign maintained it was complying with the law and that it met the "best efforts" standard with extensive "back-end review" of donations. That means the campaign accepted money and later checked to make sure the donations were proper. And campaign officials say that when they discovered illegal contributions from foreign nationals, the money was returned. The RNC raised another issue to underpin Steele's accusation. It cited an Oct. 29, 2008, story in the Washington Post that called out the Obama campaign for "allowing donors to use largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity." According to the story, revelations about questionable donations from individuals using fake names "prompted conservative bloggers to further test Obama's finance vetting by giving money using the kind of prepaid cards that can be bought at a drugstore and cannot be traced to a donor." The story did not quantify how much the Obama campaign received in prepaid credit cards. The Washington Post claim, though, wasn't that the Obama campaign refused to disclose the donors. It's that the campaign, by accepting donations via prepaid credit cards, made it impossible to verify whether the person was an American citizen or had exceeded donation limits. "You don't know," said Doug Heye, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. "The rhetoric from the Obama campaign (about campaign finance disclosure) never matched the reality." In October 2008, the RNC asked the Federal Election Commission to look into every donation, large and small, made to the Obama campaign. According to the complaint, "The RNC believes that" the Obama campaign "has (1) accepted prohibited foreign national contributions and (2) knowingly done so through its failure to reasonably investigate questionable contributions originating abroad." Heye said the FEC has not yet responded to the complaint. Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said "the Obama campaign required donors to check a box confirming that they were U.S. citizens or green-card holders and refunded any contribution that came from any foreign national or other prohibited source." Woodhouse said the charge by Steele was "a lie – and is just smokescreen by the RNC to distract from the secret money being spent by its allies like the Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove." Contributions from foreign nationals and people using fake names inevitably slip into campaigns accepting donations from hundreds of thousands of people, said Dave Levinthal of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. It's incumbent on campaigns to make a good faith effort to identify those bad donations and return them. Levinthal said he didn't remember the issue of illegal contributions being a "a huge, overriding issue" in the 2008 presidential campaign. In fact, an analysis of campaign contributions by the Center for Responsive Politics found that the Obama campaign scored slightly higher than McCain's when it came to full disclosure of donors. The center found the Obama campaign fully disclosed 90 percent of the donations to the campaign, as opposed to 87 percent for the McCain campaign. The report found no information about the donor's employer and/or occupation listed for 6 percent of the Obama campaign's contributions, as opposed to 9 percent for McCain. We think Steele's comment is misleading in the context of responding to Democrats' complaints about tens of millions of dollars anonymously making their way into this election via independent groups like Crosssroads GPS. Steele's comments aren't directly related to that issue. The RNC says Steele was referring to the fact that the Obama campaign accepted donations from prepaid credit cards, which makes it almost impossible to verify the donor. It may be a legitimate campaign finance issue, but it's not the same as saying that the Obama campaign was asked during the 2008 presidential campaign to reveal its donors and refused (as Steele alleged). The campaign readily provided the names of large donors as required by law. And there's no evidence that contributions from prepaid credit cards were anywhere near the huge sums being spent by independent groups in this election. As for accepting money from foreign nationals, that's an issue all campaigns deal with (though more so for Obama, who got a lot of money from Americans overseas). Again, it's not that the Obama campaign was asked for names of foreign donors and refused. The campaign had names, and in most cases assurances from the donors, that they were American citizens. The allegation in the Washington Post story was that the campaign's vetting of foreign donations was not stringent enough up front. There was no issue of the Obama campaign willfully refusing to disclose the names of foreign donors. In fact, it was the disclosure of those names that allowed AP reporters to discover some of the donations were improper. And so we rate Steele's comment False.

pomt-05127	"Under current law, if you go on a dating website and you say you're 32 and you're actually 42, you've committed a misdemeanor."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/25/christopher-blazejewski/state-rep-blazejewski-says-rhode-island-law-made-w/	Are you a 42-year-old grizzled ogre with no money and chronic halitosis searching for an online date by claiming to be 32, rich and extraordinarily handsome? Good news! Thanks to a new law, you don't risk going to jail for lying through your few remaining teeth. But previously, you could have faced misdemeanor charges in Rhode Island, if you believe state Rep. Christopher Blazejewski, a Providence Democrat. On June 12, he told the Rhode Island House that it was illegal to transmit a lie on the Internet, on radio, on TV, or over the phone about anything. "Under current law, if you go on a dating website and you say you're 32 and you're actually 42, you've committed a misdemeanor under our current law. Any transmission of false information makes you a criminal under Rhode Island state law," he said during the final day of the session. He was pushing for House Bill 7389 to change the law that makes all electronic lying illegal. He wanted to keep the section that made it a felony if you lie to get payment from a claim, but delete the paragraph that made it a misdemeanor to engage in all other types of lying. To say PolitiFact Rhode Island was intrigued would be an understatement. Could many of the Pants-On-Fire politicians and pundits we've exposed during the past two years have faced a fine of up to $500, and up to a year in jail? Well, if it was true then, it isn't now. The bill passed the House and Senate, Governor Chafee signed it on June 20, and the legislation took effect immediately. In Rhode Island, telling white lies on the Internet is now officially legal. But the question persists: Was Blazejewski correct at the time he made the statement? The statute involved is Section 11-52-7 of the Rhode Island General Laws. Paragraph (a), which is still in effect, makes it a felony to transmit false data "for the purpose of submitting a claim for payment." Paragraph (b) dealt with electronic lying for any other purpose. It said, "Whoever intentionally or knowingly: (1) makes a transmission of false data; or (2) makes, presents or uses or causes to be made, presented or used any data for any other purpose with knowledge of its falsity, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . " During a three-minute hearing on the bill on March 13, the lone witness, Steven Brown of the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, called for its repeal because "any other purpose" is overly broad and a violation of free speech. "Make sure that none of us get charged with a crime for lying on a dating site, telling our spouse that we're stuck in a meeting when we're somewhere else, or a variety of other situations that many of us may have encountered over the years," he urged the legislators. At the Rhode Island attorney general's office, spokeswoman Amy Kempe consulted with Ronald Gendron, chief of the white collar crime and public corruption unit. (Note: We talked with her before Governor Chafee signed the bill.) "On the surface, someone could take that portion of the statute literally" and prosecute for any lie, she said. But "that was neither the intent nor is it the application of the statute." Laws need to be interpreted in context, and this statute, as a whole, "was clearly designed to accommodate a fraud for money," said Kempe. Paragraph (a) made it a felony to transmit a lie "for the purpose of submitting a claim for payment," such as for an insurance loss. Paragraph (b), in its reference to "any other purpose," really only applies to other types of deception where financial gain is involved, she said. Finally, Jared Goldstein, a law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, said the plain language of the law did "indeed appear to make it a crime to knowingly or intentionally send any false information over the Internet, without any limitation on the context or subject matter. If read literally, the language would seem to cover giving false information on a dating site. Or lying to a friend in an e-mail message. Or maybe even clicking 'Like' for a friend's photo that you don't really like." "If the provision is read in that literal way," he said, "it would almost certainly be unconstitutionally overbroad because it would prohibit a huge amount of Constitutionally-protected speech. Even if it is not read that way, but construed narrowly to cover only false information that can constitutionally be prohibited, the law may still be unconstitutionally vague, because it doesn't clearly tell the public what is prohibited." Our ruling Rep. Christopher Blazejewski said that "Under current law, if you go on a dating website and you say you're 32 and you're actually 42, you've committed a misdemeanor." That's indeed what the law said at the time. (It has since been changed.) Whether you risked prosecution if you told such a lie would have been another matter entirely. The attorney general's office said the statute was only meant to apply to lies designed to garner financial gain. And the law professor we checked with says it was such a broad, vague limit on free speech, it was probably unconstitutional. Nonetheless, the PolitiFact judges rate Blazejewski's claim as True.

pomt-13687	Says Donald Trump "doesn't make a thing in America."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-went-overboard-calling-out-donald-/	Hillary Clinton followed her history-making DNC speech by staying in Philadelphia for an extra day and giving yet another speech Friday. The location was different, Temple University on North Broad Street rather than the Wells Fargo Center on South Broad, but much of the message was the same, primarily because she spent time attacking Donald Trump. At one point during the speech, Clinton said, "He doesn't make a thing in America." The comment came after a week of DNC speakers taking shots at Trump. Multiple politicians, including U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Clinton, pointed out many of Trump’s products are made in foreign countries, such as his vodka and his neckties. These are indeed made overseas. But what about everything? Has Trump really not made a thing in America? This was a quick fact to check. While many of his products have been made overseas, some are made in America, such as his suits. Amazon features more than a dozen Trump-brand suits. Yes, some are made in China and some have no country listed for where they’re made. But some are made in the United States. A previous PolitiFact check also found Trump-brand wine to be made here in the U.S. For a product to be considered made in the USA, according to the Federal Trade Commission, "all or virtually all" of the product has to be made in the United States. The FTC can bring legal action against companies suspected of making misleading claims about the origins of their products. On Trump’s website, he sells several apparel items, including the "Make America Great Again" hats, as well as t-shirts, signs and buttons. All of them are said to be made in America. Though photos on the internet circulated of one of his hats having been made in China, PolitiFact found that wasn’t true. According to the AP, the "Make America Great Again" hats are stitched at a small factory in Los Angeles. Workers at the factory in which the Make America Great Again hats are made told the AP the some of the materials that go into the hats are imported. Clinton’s campaign responded to an inquiry about Clinton’s statement by providing links to articles explaining where certain Trump items are made. It did not respond to questions about why Clinton said Trump had not made a thing in America or whether the campaign has discovered discrepancies in where Trump items are made that have not been reported. Our ruling Speaking in a packed Temple University gym, Hillary Clinton questioned Donald Trump’s ability to create jobs for Americans and said, "He doesn't make a thing in America." Many of Trump’s products are made overseas, but not all of them. At the least, some of his suits and the campaign memorabilia he sells on his website are made in the United States. We rule the claim False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-01T07:37:53	2016-07-29	['United_States']

pomt-10614	"Barack (Obama) has one of his biggest supporters in terms of funding, the Exelon Corporation, which has spent millions of dollars trying to make Yucca Mountain the waste depository."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/hillary-clinton/exelon-staff-supports-obama/	When candidates debate in Nevada, you can bet Yucca Mountain will be mentioned. And Hillary Clinton had her facts in order during a Jan. 15, 2008, debate in Las Vegas. Yucca Mountain is the proposed site for a controversial proposal to store much of the nation's nuclear waste in one place. Predictably, most Nevadans oppose this. The original opening date for the site was in 1998, but opposition has prevented the project from going forward and its fate is unclear. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is a powerful opponent. Both Clinton and Obama have urged that the project be shelved. A prominent supporter of Yucca Mountain, though, is Exelon Corp., an electric utility based in Chicago. Exelon operates the largest nuclear fleet (17 reactors) in the United States and the third-largest commercial nuclear fleet in the world, according to Exelon's Web site. In a speech to nuclear energy executives in May 2007, Exelon CEO John Rowe said permanent disposal at Yucca Mountain or a similar facility remains "a long-term imperative" for the industry, even while he acknowledged it would not happen soon. We asked a spokesman for Exelon if they've spent "millions" promoting Yucca Mountain. We were told they don't track their spending by project. Public records, though, indicate the company has spent more than $10-million on lobbyists between 2002 and 2007, with Yucca Mountain listed among its top issues. That doesn't count previous years; the Yucca Mountain project has been debated for more than 20 years. Meanwhile, campaign finance records confirm Exelon is one of Obama's top contributors. The Center for Responsive Politics found that Exelon employees were his sixth-largest corporate donor group. (No. 1 was Goldman Sachs.) The Obama campaign points to several mitigating factors: Obama opposes Yucca Mountain. Exelon is one of the largest companies and employers in Obama's hometown of Chicago. Obama has sponsored legislation specifically targeting Exelon after unplanned waste releases in Illinois. Obama has not accepted any money from Exelon lobbyists or Exelon's political action committee; rather, the contributions are from people who work at Exelon. Of all these points, it's the last we find most compelling. Obama is not taking money from Exelon as a corporate entity or PAC, rather he's accepting contributions from Exelon executives and employees. (Clinton, by contrast, accepts federal PAC money, though she hasn't accepted any from Exelon.) It's a small but real difference, so we rate her claim on Obama's ties to Exelon to be Mostly True.

pomt-09667	Senate health care legislation will "levy a new 'abortion premium' fee on Americans in the government-run plan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/20/john-boehner/boehner-claims-senate-health-care-bill-includes-ab/	Republicans have found another flaw in the health care bill: They say Democrats are trying to impose a monthly abortion fee on anyone enrolled in the public health care option. "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-NV) massive, 2,074-page bill would levy a new 'abortion premium' fee on Americans in the government-run plan," wrote House Republican Leader John Boehner on the GOP's Web site. The House version of the health care bill included an amendment promoted by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., to prevent abortion from being offered through the public plan, as well as additional restrictions for insurers who sell on the exchange. But the Senate version of health care reform represents a clean slate and includes a provision similar to one added by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., to the original version of the House legislation that would prevent the government from spending federal dollars on abortion procedures. Here's how the Senate bill would treat the issue: Health insurance companies participating in the insurance exchange, a virtual marketplace where consumers could compare and shop for insurance plans, could decide whether to offer abortion coverage. In each state, there would have to be at least one plan that offers the insurance and one that does not. People who get federal subsidies to help pay for coverage through the exchange could buy plans that offer abortion insurance. But the bill includes accounting rules to ensure that no tax dollars are used to pay for the procedure. The government can only pay for abortions in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, but the Health and Human Services secretary could decide to include abortion coverage beyond that. In any case, the public plan would be subject to the same rules. We've covered the many claims from the left and the right about how abortion would be treated under health care reform, and you can read all of them here . But Boehner's claim that the Senate bill includes a monthly "abortion fee" was new to us. Intrigued, we went directly to Page 122 of Section 1303 of the bill, the language Boehner is concerned about. That section deals with measures the government will take to ensure that no plan offered through the exchange will use federal dollars to cover abortion procedures. If a plan through the exchange does offer abortion coverage, "the issuer of the plan shall ... segregate an amount equal to the actuarial amounts determined under subparagraph for all enrollees," the language says. The Health and Human Services secretary "shall estimate the basic per enrollee, per month cost, determined on an average actuarial basis, for including coverage under a qualified health plan." Finally, the secretary "shall estimate such costs as if such coverage were included for the entire population covered; and may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee per month." All that legalese means this: Because insurance companies participating in the exchange may not use tax dollars to pay for abortion procedures, they must ensure that an adequate amount of private funding -- which will come from private premiums -- is set aside. Per premium, that funding can be no less than $1 dollar a month; otherwise, it's up to the insurance company. All this is to ensure that there's enough private premiums to pay for abortions should participants need them. So, the bill does require that abortion coverage through the exchange be paid for with private premiums. But does the bill language dictate an abortion fee as Boehner says? Usha Ranji, a policy analyst for the Kaiser Family Foundation, says no. "I don't understand what [Boehner's] reference is to," she said. The provision simply "outlines some technical direction of how you would establish cost of an abortion benefit." Lara Cartwright-Smith of George Washington University's public health school concurred, adding that everyone participating in the exchange would have the option of choosing a plan that does not include abortion. So, back to Boehner's claim. The bill does not require a fee, or a charge above and beyond the premium cost specifically to cover abortions. And technically speaking, we don't know whether the public option will offer abortion coverage or not. Instead, it gives the Health and Human Services secretary a minimum for estimating the cost of covering abortions. So we give Boehner a False.

pomt-07671	Says women who need a sonogram in the eighth to 10th week of pregnancy have to get a transvaginal sonogram.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/10/carol-alvarado/state-rep-carol-alvarado-says-women-who-are-10-wee/	In a Texas House debate March 2, Democratic state Rep. Carol Alvarado of Houston pressed the author of a proposal requiring women seeking an abortion to get a sonogram on whether he was aware that a sonogram is intrusive early in a woman’s pregnancy. "There are two different kinds of sonograms," she said. "The abdominal, which I think most of our colleagues may think ‘jelly on the belly’ that would be done there, but that’s not the case. A woman that is eight to 10 weeks pregnant would have to go (to get) a transvaginal sonogram." House Bill 15, which cleared the House March 7, requires women getting an abortion to first allow a medical professional to perform a sonogram, "display the live, real-time obstetric sonogram images in a quality consistent with current medical practice in a manner that the pregnant women may view them" and "make audible the live, real-time" heart beat. The Senate approved a different version of the proposal in February. We decided to check at what stage in their pregnancy women who need a sonogram would require the transvaginal kind. Alvarado told us that she meant to say that women who are up to eight to 12 weeks pregnant need a transvaginal sonogram because the better-known abdominal ultrasound doesn’t always produce a clear enough image. According to a medical encyclopedia on the University of Maryland Medical Center website, the transvaginal ultrasound looks at a woman’s reproductive organs by placing a probe into the vagina. The internal probe "sends out sound waves, which reflect off body structures. A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture." An abdominal ultrasound is performed externally, the site says. A water-based gel is spread over the woman’s pelvic area, which helps the probe transmit sound waves, generating an image. Alvarado’s office referred us to seven physicians to support her statement. Six responded, all saying transvaginal sonograms are usually preferred in the early weeks of pregnancy. Comments ranged from calling Alvarado’s statement "100 percent correct" to describing the transvaginal sonogram as "the best evaluation" that early in pregnancy. Other highlights: — Lisa Hollier, one of Alvarado’s recommended doctors, chairs the Texas district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She told us that if a sonogram is needed up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, a transvaginal is necessary to attain a clear image and pick up the heartbeat. Hollier, who opposes the sonogram proposals, said that at eight to 10 weeks’ of pregnancy, the heart is hard to visualize using an abdominal ultrasound, particularly on obese women. — Matt Romberg, a Round Rock ob-gyn who also opposes the proposals, told us that he performs a sonogram to verify the location of the fetus, its viability and the stage of the pregnancy on women who are up to 10 weeks pregnant before performing the abortion. Ninety-nine percent of the time, he said, "I have to do a transvaginal" sonogram. — G. Sealy Massingill, a Fort Worth ob-gyn, told us that "at eight weeks or less, it’s almost impossible to see anything" without using a transvaginal sonogram. For other perspectives, we contacted the Washington-based Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, which seeks to improve reproductive health care through education. Beth Jordan, the association’s medical director, told us that in the early weeks of pregnancy, fetuses are easier to see on vaginal ultrasounds, though she said "there are cases when it’s difficult to (perform) a vaginal ultrasound and we have to use the abdominal devices." According to current clinical management guidelines produced by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a sonogram in the first trimester may be performed using either an abdominal ultrasound or a transvaginal one. If the abdominal examination "is not definitive, a transvaginal scan or transperineal scan should be performed whenever possible." For a transperineal scan, the external probe is placed between the vulva and the rectum. Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, told us it’s "possible to do an abdominal ultrasound early in pregnancy, but based on a woman’s weight, the position of the uterus, the size of the pregnancy, a transvaginal ultrasound can be more accurate." The federation opposes the Texas sonogram proposals, which Saporta said "put another obstacle in the way of women receiving abortion care." Eugene Toy, president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told us that the medical standard of care for a patient seeking an abortion is to have a sonogram that allows the doctor to determine the stage of the pregnancy and identify problems. At less than eight weeks, "a vaginal probe would be necessary almost all the time," he said, though from the eighth to 10th week, it’s necessary one-third of the time. Kyleen Wright, president of Texans for Life, pointed us to Ralph Wiegman, a Grand Prairie ob-gyn who supports the sonogram legislation. Wiegman told us that the only time a transvaginal sonogram is needed is less than seven weeks into the pregnancy, or if the woman is obese. "At our pregnancy resource center, a vaginal ultrasound is reserved for those cases when you can’t get a good picture abdominal, or very early in the gestation," he said. Where does that leave us? Given that lawmakers were weighing whether to mandate sonograms in advance of abortions, we find reasonable Alvarado’s post-debate clarification that she intended to characterize sonograms through the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and not just a two-week segment. Most of the experts we reached agreed that to produce a clear image, a transvaginal sonogram is best, if not the only choice, up to about the seventh week of pregnancy. But between seven and 10 weeks, another type of sonogram may produce a viewable image, according to some doctors. We rate Alvarado’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00861	Wisconsin is "dead last in the Midwest for job creation."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/16/mark-pocan/wisconsin-dead-last-midwest-job-creation/	When it comes to Madison Democrats making pronouncements about job growth in Wisconsin, the term "dead last" has a recurring allure. Mary Burke relentlessly made dead-last claims while running against Gov. Scott Walker in the 2014 election. In checking two of them, which were made with some variation, we rated one True and the other False. Now comes U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. On March 10, 2015, the day after Walker signed legislation that bars private-sector workers from being required to pay union fees, Pocan appeared on a Wisconsin Public Radio talk show. Host Joy Cardin asked Pocan why he thinks the so-called right-to-work law "is going to be bad for Wisconsin." Pocan, who opposed the measure, began his reply by saying: "Well, first of all, I think Governor Walker has taken us down the path of his presidential aspirations, and I feel that he is really ignoring the needs of Wisconsin. We're dead last in the Midwest for job creation." "Dead last" just won’t die. OK, we’re game for another go at this. So, four months after the election and with Walker positioning himself for a White House run in 2016, where does Wisconsin rank now? The numbers Pocan’s office pointed us to two news articles, both from December 2014, that reported on federal data for the private sector -- that is, non-government, non-farm jobs. The data is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which tracks the economy in rolling 12-month increments. The measurements are done every three months, but they also lag by many months. The quarterly figures have been called the gold standard because they are based on a census of 96 percent of the nation's employers in the public and private sectors. That means the data is far more reliable than monthly jobs data, which are based on a sample of only 3 percent of employers and are often subject to significant revisions. In examining the quarterly figures, we focus on the percentage increase in private sector jobs, rather than raw numbers, an approach that levels the playing field among states of varying sizes. Pocan referred to the latest available quarterly data, which measures job growth from June 2013 to June 2014. So what do the figures show? Among the 10 Midwestern states we’ve checked on previous "dead last" claims, Wisconsin is at the bottom, if not "dead last": State Percentage of private-sector job growth, June 2013-June 2014 1. North Dakota 4.8 2. Michigan 2.7 3. (tie) Indiana, Iowa 1.8 5. Illinois 1.7 6. (tie) Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio 1.6 9. (tie) Wisconsin, South Dakota 1.5 Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick responded to Pocan's claim by pointing out that Wisconsin ranked sixth among the 10 -- ahead of Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota -- in raw numbers of jobs created. But again, that approach doesn't take into account how the states differ in size. Indeed, those four states are all smaller in population than Wisconsin. It’s worth noting that the less-reliable monthly job figures indicate Wisconsin is on the upswing. Employers added 40,600 jobs during the last four months of 2014 -- which was more than were added in the full year in any of the first three years of Walker's first term. But it is certainly fair for Pocan to use the most recent release of the most reliable numbers. The next batch, covering the third quarter of 2014, is scheduled to be released March 19, 2015. Our rating Pocan said Wisconsin is "dead last in the Midwest for job creation." Among 10 Midwestern states -- in terms of percentage growth in private-sector jobs -- the latest figures show Wisconsin is tied for ninth. So, not quite "dead last." We rate Pocan’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-09331	"No one questioned that she (Judge Sotomayor) was out of the mainstream."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/13/charles-schumer/schumer-claims-no-one-questioned-sotomayor-was-out/	With the announcement that Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is retiring, speculation has turned to whom President Barack Obama will nominate to replace him, and -- depending on the nominee -- how much of a fight Obama will encounter from Senate Republicans. On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he doesn't expect a Republican filibuster. What Republican and Democrats alike want is "somebody who will follow the law, not make the law," Schumer said, and he pointed to the pick of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as evidence that Obama would choose someone "in the mainstream." "If you look at who President Obama has nominated, somebody like Judge Sotomayor, who got nine Republicans to vote for her, no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream," Schumer said. "The other nominees in many of the courts of appeals and district courts, he chooses people in the mainstream. So I don't think there's going to be a filibuster or a blocking." We are checking the claim that "no one questioned that she (Sotomayor) was out of the mainstream." We recalled that phrase came up a lot during the Sotomayor confirmation debate, so we did some checking. To start, we direct your attention to a July 13, 2009, AP story under the headline, "Sessions: Sonia Sotomayor 'out of mainstream.'" That's Sessions as in Sen. Jeff Sessions, the leading Judiciary Committee Republican. The AP wrote that just hours before Sotomayor's initial confirmation hearing, Sessions charged that Sotomayor is "out of the mainstream" of legal thinking and has a very activist judicial profile. Sessions criticized Sotomayor's much-discussed comment from a speech in 2001, that she hoped a "wise Latina" often would reach better conclusions than a white male without the same life experience. "She has criticized the idea that a woman and a man would reach the same result. She expects them to reach different results. I think that's philosophically incompatible with the American system," Sessions said on CBS's Face the Nation. Sessions was among 31 Republican senators who voted against Sotomayor's confirmation, though Sessions said afterward that he was glad that during the hearings Sotomayor rejected the "empathy standard" Obama referred to when he nominated her. And Sessions wasn't the only Republican to invoke the "out of the mainstream" claim: • In a press release issued Aug. 5, 2009, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., took issue with Sotomayor's ruling in a gun case, saying, it "shows an alarming hostility to law-abiding gun owners across the country. That is a view that is certainly out of the mainstream in this nation." • In a press release issued Aug. 6, 2009, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that at her confirmation hearing Sotomayor attempted to distance herself from several statements "and explain them away, most likely recognizing that they were controversial and out of the mainstream. However, in my mind, she was not very successful." • In a statement released on Aug. 4, 2009, Grassley said Sotomayor "openly questioned whether 'ignoring our differences as women, men, or even people of color...we do a disservice both to the law and society.' This is yet another example of an out of the mainstream judicial philosophy." • A June 29, 2009, story in Roll Call noted that talking points prepared for House and Senate Republicans urged members to make the case that Sotomayor's written statements, rulings and speeches "show an out of the mainstream view of the role of a judge." Perhaps Schumer's comment was one part hyperbole - that what he meant was "hardly anyone" claimed Sotomayor was out of the mainstream. But we're sticklers for words, and Schumer's absolute claim that "no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream" isn't accurate. We understand that "out of the mainstream" is a subjective term, but the fact is that a number of Republican senators used that exact phrase. We rule Schumer's statement False.

pomt-04419	Says the Obama administration "watered down sanctions" against Iran, delayed them and tried to stop Congress "from putting the tough sanctions in place."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/15/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-obama-administration-watered-down-s/	President Barack Obama’s administration "has no credibility" to challenge Iran’s nuclear aspirations, Rep. Paul Ryan argued in his debate with vice presidential rival Joe Biden. The pair outlined a sharp difference in approach to Iran as they sat side by side in Danville, Ky., on Oct. 11, 2012. The Wisconsin Republican, answering a question from moderator Martha Raddatz about using a military strike to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, argued: "In order to solve this peacefully -- which is everybody's goal -- you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It's because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress." We can’t read the ayatollahs’ minds, but we checked whether the Obama administration "watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop (Congress) from putting the tough sanctions in place." We found Ryan was oversimplifying a difference of opinion between Congress and the White House not over whether to pressure Iran — but the most effective way to go about it. Sanctions against Iran First, a little background. Iran has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The United Nations and other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. The Obama administration’s policy has been to combine sanctions with negotiations, seeking "additional U.S., U.N., and allied country sanctions whose cumulative effect could compel Iran to accept a nuclear bargain." The country now has the "most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world," according to a February 2012 Congressional Research Service report. Last month’s report calls them "what many now consider to be ‘crippling’ sanctions." So, what’s Ryan’s argument? The Romney-Ryan campaign pointed us to news coverage of an Obama administration compromise in 2010 to earn China and Russia’s backing for new sanctions through the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council in 2010 voted to sanction Iran but didn’t include among those sanctions measures against the nation’s Central Bank because of opposition from the two nations, which have veto power on the council. The Obama administration instead said it would also push forward with tougher sanctions on its own. And indeed, Obama has signed into law several rounds of legislation and executive orders strengthening the U.S. position. (For a detailed look at U.S. sanctions against Iran, the Congressional Research Service regularly updates its report with new legislation and enforcement actions.) Ryan: Credit Congress, not Obama The Romney-Ryan campaign argues that Congress deserves credit for much of that, such as legislation targeting the Central Bank. A spokesman for Romney told PolitiFact in February that tougher sanctions imposed by the United States earlier this year "weren’t done by Obama," but through an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that Obama opposed, tried to water down, and won exceptions for. "In implementing them, he was only doing what he was required to by an act of Congress," Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told us. Meanwhile, Obama wrote a signing statement saying that the sanction’s requirements were nonbinding, Williams noted. (Obama wrote that the Iran sanctions section "would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments. Like section 1244, should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding.") Obama also undermined the sanctions’ requirement for countries seeking exceptions to "significantly reduce" their Iranian crude oil purchases by leaving the definition of "significant" to the discretion of the secretary of state, Williams said. (Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., authors of the amendment, argued it should mean at least 18 percent.) The president issued exceptions to 20 of the top oil exporters from Iran, including China, the Romney-Ryan team said, citing a June 2012 New York Times article. For its part, meanwhile, the Obama administration argued that the amendment, which passed despite the administration's objections, could "alienate foreign countries, make it more difficult to pressure Iran and raise oil prices, which could actually help the Iranian economy," according to Foreign Policy’s The Cable. Experts: A push for flexibility, not weakness After decades of U.S. sanctions, there’s little left to ban between the United States and Iran, so new rules necessarily target other countries. But move too fast, and the United States risks losing the cooperation of nations it needs as allies in the wider push to isolate Iran, experts told us. Congress wants a crackdown; the executive branch wants diplomacy. Iran policy experts told us that while the Obama administration pushed back against Congress — including what you might call watering down and delaying enforcement of legislative initiatives — that doesn’t mean the administration wasn’t tough on Iran. Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent, nonpartisan think-tank, told PolitiFact earlier this year that’s not evidence the Obama administration had a weak stance on Iran, it's just that Obama resisted letting Congress dictate the terms. "Flexibility is the watchword," he said. "It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran." Leonard Spector of the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College told us in February that the administration has been a driving force internationally to put pressure on Iran, even if it failed to get the U.N. to target Iran’s Central Bank. "Obama, unilaterally and in concert with the (European Union) and other allies, has gone much further," he said. Avner Cohen, a senior fellow at the Monterey Institute of International Studies and a Democrat, has told us it's legitimate to raise questions about whether the administration should have acted sooner to impose its own tougher sanctions. But he said it's more valuable to get other nations to join the effort. "To make something effective in the real world, it needs to pass the Security Council," he said. It’s true, he said, that the the administration "had to water down some of the language to pass it." But Ryan’s claim is "totally out of context," he concluded. James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser in the Bush administration and ambassador to Iraq and Turkey under Obama, said this kind of back-and-forth between Congress and the executive branch happens all the time. Congress wants to exert unilateral pressure, and the executive needs room for diplomacy with its allies. You could just as easily characterize what Ryan calls watering down as the Obama team "strengthening the ability to enforce" sanctions against Iran, he said. In fact, the United States and European Union, among others, are now putting so much economic pressure on the country that "many judge that Iran might soon decide it needs a nuclear compromise to produce an easing of sanctions," according to the Congressional Research Service’s September report. Our ruling Ryan argued that "this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop (Congress) from putting the tough sanctions in place." He’s right that the Obama administration compromised with Russia and China to earn their backing in the U.N. Security Council, and pushed for legislative waivers and other flexibility from Congress as it organized an international coalition to counter Iran. But just because the administration resisted plans in Congress does not mean it failed to get tough sanctions imposed. In fact, that international diplomacy has resulted in "what many now consider to be ‘crippling’ sanctions." In fact, there’s now so much economic pressure on Iran that Congress’ research arm reports Iran may soon decide to seek a nuclear compromise. That’s the opposite of what Ryan’s critique suggests. He employs a sliver of truth in service of a misleading impression. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-00696	The United States is "about to have the smallest Army since before WWII, the smallest Navy since WWI and the smallest Air Force ever."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/04/david-perdue/sen-perdue-overstates-real-reduction-us-armed-forc/	David Perdue rose on the Senate floor last week to lay out his vision for the country as Georgia’s freshman senator. The former Fortune 500 CEO talked about his fiscal priorities and concerns with the Obama administration’s foreign policy, before tying the two together with an oft-repeated claim. The United States is "about to have the smallest Army since before WWII, the smallest Navy since WWI and the smallest Air Force ever," Perdue said. "This is simply unacceptable." Republican leaders have made similar claims as a talking point against President Barack Obama since Mitt Romney’s failed presidential bid in 2012. The Truth-O-Meter has spun wildly on those statements about military size, and the implications that a shrinking military is a threat to national security, based on how they were framed. (Read more about those rulings here and here .) PolitiFact Georgia decided to see how Perdue would stack up in his statement. We reached out to Perdue’s staff, which cited a 2011 letter from then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, warning that including the Pentagon in sequestration cuts would be devastating. "Rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts," Panetta wrote, "we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history." The problem with that sourcing: the cuts have not come to pass. THE ARMY The Defense Department’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review shows the Army is on pace to pare down to about 450,000 soldiers by 2019. Under sequestration cuts – which lawmakers have so far kept from hitting the military – the number would drop to 420,000. But today, the Army has about 490,000 soldiers. That is a down from the 570,000 soldiers serving during the height of recent wars - but still not as small 460,000 soldiers serving at the turn of the century, after the end of the Cold War but before the 9/11 terror attacks, said David E. Johnson, a military historian and political scientist at the Rand Corporation. And it’s more than double the 269,000 Army soldiers in 1940, before a draft was enacted. "By strict numbers, at this moment, it is heading to among the smallest," Johnson said. "One of the smallest, but not at all the smallest." NAVY The Navy counts about 326,000 active-duty sailors today. But experts measure the Navy and Air Force size in terms of ships and aircraft available for deployment. The quadrennial review estimates a fleet of 234 battle force ships by 2019. In 1915, two years before the U.S. became part of World War I, the Navy had 231 deployable ships. Projected cuts have also not hit the Navy, which has 273 deployable ships today, according to the Department of the Navy website. And our allies and foes alike have kept their word to the 1922 Washington Naval Conference, which limits the world’s navies by tonnage as a solution to an early arms race. In other words, the Navy has been small since WWI not because of any single administration decision but due to a nearly century-old disarmament accord. AIR FORCE The Air Force’s history dates back to 1947, when it became a separate military branch after being part of the Army during World War II. The 2012 fact check on the same claim from Romney found that the branch had about 6,000 aircraft as of 2009. That was the lowest number since 1950, the earliest year available. That means Perdue, is most likely correct on the size of the Air Force, as commonly measured by experts. Moreover, the active duty strength of the Air Force – now at 359,000 – is projected to drop to about 328,000 by 2019, according to Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Coleman. That would be the lowest active duty strength since the 1947 tally of about 309,000, Coleman said. WHAT IT ALL MEANS So, if Perdue is right on the size of the Air Force but off on the other two branches, what does that mean for his overall point? Perdue used military size as evidence that the national debt is crippling the national security and specifically attacked the Obama administration for cutting military spending. Military history experts, though, warn that the comparisons on size are inaccurate, given advances in warfare technology. Johnson said that only 20 percent of bombs dropped in World War II hit within 1,000 meters of their target. Those planes carried up to 10 people. Today, one pilot and one plane can strike with the same precision. "The real issue to be addressed is the U.S. ability to project military power abroad to achieve its key national security objectives and how that power compares to others in the present who seek to prevent us from achieving them," said William Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. Even with recent cuts, the U.S. also still spends as much as the next seven biggest defense-spending countries combined, said Alex Roland, a military history professor at Duke University. While that does not resolve the question of whether current budgets are enough, it helps show that the national interest is clearly focused on spending resources on national security. That’s why sequestration cuts have yet to truly affect the Pentagon, even as resources were shifted to battle a bad economy while also winding down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Stueck said. Perdue might have been better off leaving the numbers out of his argument then, and instead discussing the need to change priorities now that the economy has stabilized. The size does matter, Johnson said. But mostly as a way to show the presence of the United States globally and what happens if a crisis occurs and the U.S. does not have the presence to act swiftly. "The real comparison is, we didn’t do anything until 1942 in World War II," Johnson. "His point is better made to ask: In the world we are now, can we wait until there is an attack and then take another year to get anyone anywhere to do something about the problem?" That’s not what Perdue said. In his first Senate floor speech, he cited a shrinking military that the numbers do not fully bear out. Perdue does have a valid point to make, about a historical success in paying for a military whose strength and size make it more likely to be a deterrent than a singular battle force. But he complicates his point by relying on dated information and the wrong comparisons. His argument can be supported, but not with the numbers he provides. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-10317	Obama said his proposed $1,000 emergency energy rebate "will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next 4 months."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/01/barack-obama/obama-right-about-increased-energy-costs/	In a town hall meeting in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Aug. 1, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama announced a proposal for a two-part emergency plan "to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track." One part is a $50-billion stimulus package that would be split: $25-billion to go to state governments facing big budget shortfalls; and $25-billion toward national infrastructure projects like highways and bridges. The other part of his emergency plan is a $1,000 energy rebate that he said "could go out to families as soon as this fall." "This rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. Or, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills. Or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt." Obama said he plans to pay for the rebate by taxing windfall profits of oil companies. We decided to check Obama's math, to see if his numbers were right about how far $1,000 would go this winter. First up, the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. According to Energy Department figures for the latest available year, 2001, an average family household of four people consumed 1,519 gallons of gas a year. That comes to 506 gallons for four months. Now, here comes the tricky part, because while Obama refers to the increased cost of gas, he doesn't say between when and when. The national average for the price of gas on Aug. 1 was $3.90 a gallon; up from $2.86 on Aug. 1 last year. That's a $1.04 increase. At those prices, the increased cost this year for four months of gas would come to $526, which would obviously be covered by Obama's proposed $1,000 rebate. Even if you project out the increased cost based on the peak price of $4.11 a gallon on July 17, it only comes to an extra $632.50 for the next four months. So that part of Obama's equation is accurate. Next, we looked at whether, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, $1,000 will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills. The National Energy Assistance Directors' Association tracks such things. In New England states, the association projects the additional cost for people who use home heating oil will be about $950. About half of New England's homes use home heating oil. For those with natural gas, the added cost is projected to be about $335 higher; $450 more for people who use propane; and $780 more for those who use electricity. So no matter what form of energy they use to heat their homes, Obama's rebate would cover it. "The numbers are just ridiculous," said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association. "It's going to be really bad in cold weather states. People up there are in a total panic." Consider this stat: for a New England family making $50,000 a year, energy costs last winter ate up 22 percent of their overall pre-tax income; this winter it is projected to consume 38 percent. "How are these families going to make it through the winter?" Wolfe asked. Wolfe said a $1,000 rebate would help many struggling families buy time to transition to the higher costs. We find that Obama's numbers on increased energy costs are True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-01T00:00:00	2008-08-01	['None']

pomt-05621	The changes to Georgia’s tax and fee structure "is an overall tax cut."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/26/brian-robinson/numbers-back-tax-claim-deal-spokesman/	Cheers and celebratory handshakes swept through the Georgia Legislature last week when it overwhelmingly passed a bill to overhaul much of the state’s tax code. But some good government types and fiscal watchdogs were disappointed by the process. It was unveiled and passed in less than a week. One top aide to Gov. Nathan Deal said the legislation, House Bill 386, is good for Georgia. "This pro-jobs, pro-family tax reform broadens the tax base so we can lower the tax burden overall," Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the day after the House passed the bill. "It’s important to remember ... that this is an overall tax cut. We can’t get away from that fact." Since some people have questions about the bill, and it passed so quickly, we wondered whether Robinson is right? Let’s take a look at the 56-page bill. If you’re married, you’ll probably like the bill. It would increase exemptions by $2,000 for married couples who file joint returns and by $1,000 each for spouses who file separately. If you’re retired, you may not like it. The bill would cap the exclusion on the state collecting taxes on nonwork income at $65,000 for Georgians 65 and older. The state’s current policy would allow the cap to rise significantly to $200,000 by 2015 and eventually no cap at all. If you frequently shop online, you may not like it. The legislation would impose a tax on some items purchased on the Internet. There are other changes as well. It would eliminate the annual ad valorem tax on vehicles that the state’s car owners pay on their birthdays. It would be replaced by a one-time title tax. The bill would end the sales tax exemption for film production activities but bring back the sales tax holiday a couple of times later this year and in 2013. HB 368 also would phase out most of the sales taxes on energy used in manufacturing, mining and newspaper publishing. There are other exemptions in the bill concerning agriculture and construction materials. State officials estimate the government will see a $62.8 million decline in revenue between now and the end of fiscal year 2015. Local governments would see a greater decline of nearly $200 million during the same time period, according to the state research, which was put in an eight-page fiscal note. The bill’s proponents believe the legislation will result in increased economic activity in the state and more jobs, which will more than make up for the estimated cuts. Robinson, who also holds the title of Deal’s deputy chief of staff, said he was specifically referring to the impact on state revenue. "Overall [which is the exact word I used], this decreases tax revenue," Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia. Georgia lawmakers tried a similar bill last year, but it never came up for a vote for several reasons, including concerns that the state’s revenue estimates were inaccurate. This year, there have been no widespread complaints about the numbers, although there were complaints that not enough time had been allowed to properly review the proposal. The state’s figures show a $22.7 million surplus in state revenue in FY 2015, which begins July 1, 2014, and ends June 30, 2015. There is a deficit in FY 2013 and FY 2014 of a combined $85.5 million to the state. The difference between FY 2015 and the two other years is that the sales tax holiday and the construction materials exemption are not included in FY 2015. The sales tax holidays amount to an estimated annual $40 million net loss to the state while the construction exemption is projected to cost the state about $20 million a year. Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank, said the Legislature will probably continue both exemptions before they expire because of their popularity with the public. "It took a recession to get rid of the sales tax holiday," he said. Robinson’s claim passed one major political hurdle. The Washington, D.C.-based Americans for Tax Reform has its problems with the bill, specifically that it believes the Internet tax provision is unconstitutional and that the legislation doesn’t go far enough in accomplishing "tax reform." Still, Josh Culling, its state affairs manager, called the bill a "net tax cut," basing that conclusion on the fiscal note. The organization asks political candidates to sign a pledge not to support any legislation that results in a net tax increase. The pledge is virtually a requirement for any fiscal conservative who wants to get in office. Deal has signed the pledge, along with nearly one-quarter of the Georgia Legislature. "While we are not excited about many of the tax changes in the bill, we have informed the Legislature that it is compliant with the Taxpayer Protection Pledge," Culling told us in an email. Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, which constantly monitors fiscal matters at the state Capitol, agreed with Robinson’s statement if you define an overall tax cut as a decline in taxes collected by local and state governments. Speaking about the changes concerning retirement income, McCutchen said "that technically is a tax increase on senior citizens. But I would say [Georgia already has] one of the more generous retirement exclusions in the country." McCutchen, a supporter of the bill, agreed with Robinson’s claim. "Overall, it’s a tax cut, and I don’t think there’s much debate on that," McCutchen said. We’d like to see more years worth of estimates to see how much revenue the state would collect past FY 2015. Some believe the state will see a surplus in revenue if Georgia’s population grows and more people buy cars. They could be right, especially if the sales tax holiday and construction exemption do not continue past FY 2015. Since Robinson’s quote was based solely on the impact to the state, and not to its taxpayers, the current state estimate does back up his claim -- unless the construction exemption and sales tax holiday don’t continue. Based on the current estimates, we rate Robinson’s claim as True.	None	Brian Robinson	None	None	None	2012-03-26T06:00:00	2012-03-21	['None']

pomt-11291	"In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime. We know who those families are."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/23/bill-hightower/1700-families-generate-80-percent-crime-mobile-ala/	Alabama state Sen. Bill Hightower raised a few eyebrows during a debate among Republican candidates for governor when he traced a large portion of crime to a small portion of families in Mobile. Joining Hightower at the April 18 debate were Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle and evangelist Scott Dawson, all of whom are hoping to replace incumbent Gov. Kay Ivey as the Republican nominee after the June 5 primary. Ivey, who stepped into the role after former Gov. Robert Bentley resigned, did not participate in the debate. One AL.com reader asked the candidates, "As the mom of a third grader who had a classmate say he would bring a gun to school, what will you be doing to keep our kids safe?" Hightower proposed placing police officers in schools so that they got to know students and prevent crime. "We know who the difficult students are, more often than not, through their truancy and through their actions," Hightower said. "In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime. We know who those families are." Mobile has a population of about 193,000. Is a small fraction of families generating a majority of crime? Not so fast. It sounded like Hightower was talking about the outsized effects of organized crime in Mobile. But Hightower’s campaign told us he was citing a statistic about school suspensions. That statistic is 15 years old and is the latest study available. In 2003, the Mobile County district attorney researched school suspensions and found that of the 65,000 students in the district, only 1,500 students were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of serious school infractions. The district attorney then cross-referenced the students with home addresses to identify 1,200 households. The office did not study all of the reasons for a suspension, just those that were considered serious — such as burglary or having drugs or weapons on campus. John Tyson, the former district attorney who did the research, emphasized the behavior did not constitute crime under a criminal justice definition. Tyson said there is not a similar data point for more recent years. Still, criminologists were not surprised by the finding. "The general idea that a few people are engaged in a lot of problem behavior and criminal behavior makes a lot of sense and would be consistent with what we see with a lot of other types of crime," said Adam Lankford, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Alabama. Sexual assault on campus came to mind, where the number of reported incidents often heavily outweighs the number of offenders. "A small percentage of the population is responsible for a large percentage of crimes. The same is true of families as criminal behavior often runs within families," said James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University. Lankford took issue with Hightower’s description of the role of families. While social factors play a role in problematic behavior, the research identified correlation, not causation. It did not place blame on a small proportion of families for crime. In fact, Tyson warned against using the word "crime" to describe the behavior, as the research looked at addressing school suspensions and absences to address potential future crime, not actual crime. Tyson said the research was not very relevant for his office. But he did use it as a starting point for the ongoing Helping Families Initiative, which he continues to lead. The initiative pairs K-12 public school students who are identified as at-risk for crime with law enforcement and community resources, such as child services, public health officials and domestic violence experts. The aim is to reduce misdemeanors committed on campus and other criminal acts. The program is active in six districts, including Mobile. Our ruling Hightower said, "In Mobile, it’s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime." Hightower’s point is roughly related to available research. But he did not describe it correctly. He oversimplified research findings of the Mobile County District Attorney’s office about school suspensions. The office learned kids from 1,200 households were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of school infractions in Mobile’s public schools. It did not go so far as to examine the role of the families in those households. Also, it’s important to know the research was from 2003, and we don’t know if the percentage still holds up. And importantly, the study centered on school suspensions and not "crime," in a literal or legal sense. Because the statement is partially accurate but missing critical context, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-11201	Says of MS-13 gang members, "We are getting them out of our country by the thousands."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-number-ms-13-gang-members/	In a ceremony honoring law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, President Donald Trump underlined the threat of MS-13 gang members and his administration’s efforts to deport them. "Recently, MS-13 gang members called for the assassination of New York City police officers so the gang could quote, ‘take back the streets.’ They got it wrong. We are the ones who are taking back the streets. We are getting them out of our country by the thousands," Trump said May 15. "Every week we're setting new records on — we have a ‘catch and release’ program, too. It’s called we catch them and we release them in the country they came back from, we are getting them out. Or we are putting them in prison." There are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. Not all are immigrants. Some are U.S. citizens who can’t be deported. Still, we wondered about Trump’s claim that MS-13 gang members are being deported "by the thousands." We found that thousands of gang members have been deported under Trump’s administration. However, it’s unclear how many of them were MS-13 gang members, because U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement does not track removals by specific gang affiliation. An expert who researches gangs and criminal justice said there is a lengthy process between a gang member’s arrest and deportation. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Removals data does not single out MS-13 ICE does not track gang removals by specific gang, but the agency does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations, said Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for the agency. Bourke said 5,396 gang members were removed in fiscal year 2017 (which includes about four months of the Obama administration, running from Oct. 1, 2016 through Sept. 30, 2017). From Oct. 1, 2017 through Dec. 16, 2017 (the latest data available), 1,082 gang members were removed. It’s impossible to determine how many of them were MS-13 gang members. There is other data indicating the Trump administration’s efforts to deport MS-13 gang members, but that doesn’t necessarily support Trump’s claim. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division arrested nearly 800 MS-13 gang members in fiscal year 2017. ICE’s investigations division arrested 405 MS-13 gang members, Bourke said, citing first-quarter data for fiscal year 2018. "The time it takes to remove a validated gang member can vary depending on whether the alien has started removal proceedings; whether the alien has a final order of removal; or whether the alien has pending criminal charges in a local jurisdiction," Bourke said. It’s unlikely that all of the MS-13 gang members arrested in 2017 were already deported, because of the time required to remove someone after an arrest, said Jorja Leap, an anthropologist and adjunct professor at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs who researches gangs and criminal justice. "Most members of MS-13 that I know that have been arrested are being held in court pending trial," Leap said. "The process is lengthy." Our ruling Trump said of MS-13 gang members, "We are getting them out of our country by the thousands." It’s difficult to determine how many MS-13 members have been deported under Trump’s administration, because immigration officials don’t break down deportation data by gang affiliation. At least 1,200 MS-13 gang members were arrested from Oct. 1, 2016, through the end of Trump’s first calendar year. The time between an arrest and deportation varies per case, but an expert told us the process is lengthy. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12398	Says David Clarke reduced the number of Milwaukee County sheriff's deputies "from about 700 and something to 300 and something."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/26/chris-abele/has-tough-crime-sheriff-david-clarke-cut-number-hi/	Has tough-talking Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who has apparently landed a post in the administration of President Donald Trump, actually slashed the number of his deputies by half or more? That’s the attack from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, the millionaire son of the co-founder of the Boston Scientific medical device company and a political nemesis of Clarke’s. On May 18, 2017, the day after after Clarke announced he would be joining the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as an assistant secretary, Abele was asked on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee what legacy Clarke would leave behind. (Clarke said he would take on his new post in June 2017, but the Trump administration has not confirmed Clarke’s announcement. Two days after Abele’s comments, CNN reported that Clarke plagiarized parts of his master’s thesis. Clarke has denied that accusation, but has said the report could kill his appointment.) Abele, who was once accused by Clarke of having "penis envy," said Clarke’s legacies include reducing the number of deputies "long before I was there from about 700 and something to 300 and something." Given that Clarke, who calls himself "America’s sheriff," has built a reputation on Fox News and elsewhere as being tough on crime, let’s see if Abele’s statement is on point. Sheriff’s role on crime Clarke’s national profile as a favorite of conservatives has risen largely because of his blunt comments on crime, among other topics. In a 2013 interview, he advised citizens, in the context of a home invasion, to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option." But given that all of Milwaukee County is served by city and village police departments, the role of the Sheriff’s Office isn’t on the front line as much in fighting crime. In 2011, we rated Half True a claim by Abele that the sheriff’s office "plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency." We noted at the time that Abele had proposed with his county budget cutting 240 positions from the sheriff’s office. That underscores an important point in weighing Abele’s claim: It’s the not the sheriff alone who determines how many deputies there will be. In the annual county budget process, the sheriff asks for a certain number of deputies; then the county executive recommends a number as part of an overall county budget proposal; and ultimately a number is authorized when the County Board of Supervisors approves the county budget. The numbers (Note: All of the deputy figures in this article are authorized positions, rather than an actual count of deputies, given that the number fluctuates with retirements, resignations, etc.) With the 2002 budget that Clarke inherited after he was elected, there were 649 deputy positions authorized for the sheriff’s office. In the 2011 budget, the final one before Abele took over as county executive, there were 328 deputy positions. The executive during those years was Wisconsin’s current governor, Republican Scott Walker. So, as far as the numbers go, Abele was high with the first part of his claim but on target with the second part. But the thrust of Abele’s claim is that Clarke reduced the deputy positions. This chart shows the number of deputies Clarke sought with his budget request; the number that were recommended by Walker with his full county budget proposal; and the number that were ultimately authorized in the final budget approved by the County Board. Again, we’re looking at the period before Abele took over as county executive. Year Deputies requested by sheriff Deputies recommended by county executive Deputies authorized by County Board 2003 * 627 625 2004 * 573 593 2005 * 588 588 2006 538 519 519 2007 443 443 475 2008 457 457 457 2009 439 435 435 2010 393 393 393 2011 328 328 328 *Not available The figures, from the county budget office, are incomplete for the first three years. The number of deputies ultimately authorized by the County Board dropped by 37 by 2005, but the figures don’t show whether Clarke requested any reductions. In any case, 2005 was an important year. In that budget, Clarke requested and the County Board approved, changing 200 positions in the county jail from deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. The change was not immediate; as deputies left the jail jobs, they were replaced by correctional officers. Over the next several years, the number of deputies steadily declined. In fact, Clarke requested fewer deputies than he did in the previous year in each year but one between 2006 and 2011 -- when he requested and was authorized 328 deputy positions. So, there were 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office and only 328 by the time Abele took office. That’s a reduction of 321 deputy positions. But the reduction in total force was less, given that 200 of the deputies were jailers who were replaced by correctional officers. Our rating Abele said that before he took over as county executive, Clarke reduced the number of sheriff’s deputies from about 700 to about 300. The sheriff’s office had 649 authorized deputy positions when Clarke took office in 2003 and 328 in 2011, the final county budget before Abele took over. That’s a total reduction of 321. Incomplete county records don’t indicate whether deputy reductions during first three years were requested by Clarke or were simply made by the County Board. But in 2005, he requested and was granted a gradual turnover of 200 positions in the county jail from being deputies to lower-paid correctional officers. So, at least 200 of the 321 deputy reductions were specifically requested by Clarke, although those 200 deputies were jailers who were replaced by lower-paid correctional officers.

pomt-00602	Today, "the United States is the most respected country on Earth."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/03/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-today-most-respected-country-/	President Barack Obama expressed pride in how the global image of the United States has improved on his watch during a White House event with fellows of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. "People don’t remember -- when I came into office, the United States in world opinion ranked below China and just barely above Russia," Obama said. "And today, once again, the United States is the most respected country on Earth." We wondered whether it was true that the United States today is "the most respected" country on Earth, so we took a closer look. The evidence we found is something of a mixed bag. When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, they pointed us to a periodic survey by Gallup. The most recent Gallup poll, covering 2014 and released April 21, 2015, is based on face-to-face and telephone interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, age 15 and older, in each of more than 130 countries. The Gallup poll asks respondents whether they approve of the leadership of the United States, Germany, the European Union, China and Russia. In 2014, the United States finished first among this group. The median approval rating for the United States was 45 percent. That contrasts with 2008, President George W. Bush’s last year in office, when the U.S. scored 34 percent, trailing Germany, the European Union and China. That year, Russia was a bit lower at 30 percent. The White House added that the Pew Research Center backs up the notion that the country’s image has improved under Obama. "America’s image began to rally in some nations and to soar by the end of the decade following the election of Barack Obama, at least in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America," Pew wrote in 2014. "After slipping a bit again in the first years of this decade, brand U.S. has stabilized and even recovered in a few nations in 2014." But a different survey we found showed that the United States trailed other countries. Every year, the BBC publishes a survey that asks people for their opinions about a variety of countries’ "influence on the world." The most recent survey was conducted between December 2013 and April 2014. A total of 24,542 people were asked to rate 16 countries and the European Union on whether their influence in the world was "mostly positive" or "mostly negative." The results of the BBC poll placed the United States in the middle of the pack, with a slightly larger number of respondents answering "mostly positive" than "mostly negative." This result ranked the United States behind Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, the European Union and Brazil in positivity, and ahead of China, South Africa, South Korea, India, Russia, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and Iran. Our ruling Obama said that today, "the United States is the most respected country on Earth." International polling by Gallup has found that, in a reversal from the Bush era, the United States now finishes first compared to a limited group of countries -- Germany, China, Russia and the European Union. But a BBC poll that tested a broader group found the United States finishing in the middle of the pack, behind Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, the European Union and Brazil.

pomt-06819	Says that voter identification laws "keep poor people from voting, minorities from voting, the elderly from voting, students from voting."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/10/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-11-percent-eligible-voters-l/	Editor's note: The claim checked in this PolitiFact Ohio item was updated Aug. 15, 2011, to better address the speaker's underlying point. The change did not affect the overall rating of her statement. You need a photo ID to cash a check at the bank and a driver’s license or passport to get past airport security checkpoints. Annoying though this is, it reassures advocates of state voter-fraud laws that they aren’t being unreasonable to want every voter to show a government-issued photo ID before they can be handed a ballot. It’s not for PolitiFact Ohio to say whether such a requirement, upheld in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court in an Indiana case, is necessary or wise. Ohio state legislators have discussed adopting a photo-ID voting law but have not followed through so far. But civil rights groups are concerned about the number of states considering such laws, saying the risk of voter suppression with some citizens being denied the right to vote is far greater than the chance of fraudulent voting that changes an election’s outcome. Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights led a news conference with other Democrats and civil rights leaders on July 13 and said: "I think that people don’t understand that across this country, 11 percent of all people eligible to vote do not have a government-issued ID. That’s 21 million people." She went on to say, "I guess they think that we don't understand they're trying to keep poor people from voting, minorities from voting, the elderly from voting, students from voting." Her statements intrigued PolitiFact Ohio. Do more than one in 10 people over age 18 really lack a driver’s license, passport or other form of government identification? Do photo ID laws significantly undermine voting? Fudge’s office said she got the figure from the Brennan Center for Justice, which operates within the New York University School of Law. The Brennan figure has been cited widely and comes from a 2006 survey conducted by an independent polling firm, Opinion Research Corp. Respondents were asked whether they have a current government-issued ID with their photo on it, like a driver’s license or military ID. If they answered yes, they were asked if this photo ID had their current address and current name, as opposed to maiden name. They also were asked if they had a U.S. birth certificate, naturalization papers or passport in a place they could easily get to if they had to show it the next day and whether those documents had their current name. According to the Brennan Center, as many as 11 percent of U.S. citizens — more than 21 million — did not have current government-issued photo identification. This was based on a sample of 987 randomly selected voting-age citizens contacted by telephone. The pollster reported a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. PolitiFact Ohio readers might remember someone else citing this Brennan Center survey — namely, State Rep. Armond Budish. Budish used it in March to support his statement that "25 percent of voting-age African-Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require." PolitiFact Ohio noted that the specific figure that Budish cited had a rather high margin of error — 8 percentage points — because of the smaller subset of voters (African-Americans) polled on this question. That mean’t the actual statistic was probably between 17 and 33 percent. This was among the reasons Budish’s claim was rated Half True. Fudge’s statement included all voters, regardless of race. That’s why the poll question had a much lower margin of error; it was based on a bigger sample. The actual figure could be as high as 13 percent or as low as 9 percent. But is the survey valid? We looked for other data and made some calls to ask. A 2005 report from a federal voting rights commission chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker said in a footnote that about 12 percent of the United States voting-age population did not have driver’s licenses. The figure came from U.S. Department of Transportation and Census Bureau data. We also found a May 24, 2011, report from Norman Robbins, research director for Northeast Ohio Voter Advocates, that examined driver’s license data specifically in Ohio. The report concluded that 940,000 Ohioans over age 18 lacked driver’s licenses. That’s nearly an 11 percent rate, higher than figures cited by proponents of Ohio voter ID laws. Robbins said in his findings that previous figures were erroneous because they failed to take into account such factors as deceased license holders and Ohioans who had moved out of state but were still in the state license database. Based on these studies, it appeared as if Fudge was in the right range. Yet the more we looked, the more we found that the figures are subject to debate. Susan Myrick, an election analyst at the Civitas Institute in Raleigh, N.C., a conservative group that wants limited government, was dismissive of the figures. She noted that the trial court judge in the Indiana case that went to the Supreme Court called estimates in a similar range "incredible" and "unreliable." That judge, Sarah Evans Barker of the U.S. District Court, was criticizing a study based on Indiana drivers license data, not a national poll. But taking a very basic look at Indiana license data, the judge said the actual figure might be closer to 1 percent. Myrick also pointed to a 2008 study from American University’s Center for Democracy and Election Management. That study asked 2,000 registered voters in three states (Indiana, Maryland and Mississippi) whether they had a driver’s license, passport or military ID. Only 1.2 percent of those surveyed said they lacked these kinds of IDs. "These data suggest that access to IDs and the documents necessary to obtain a valid photo ID, for registered voters, is not a serious problem," the American University study concluded. Note that this study involved people who were already registered to vote. The poor and minorities represent a high percentage who have not registered to vote and those who do not have government IDs, according to legal experts whose work we saw while researching this subject. This presents a chicken-and-egg question: If people do not vote when there is no stringent ID requirement, why not? And would an ID rule even have that big an impact? "It seems clear that the requirement of photo IDs is not an impediment to voting; the problem is that not enough people register, and not all those who register vote," the American University study said. "This was a problem before ID laws, and it remains a problem." About 64 percent of Americas voting-age population turned out in the 2008 presidential election, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And that was considered a good year by modern historical standards. Based on the American University study, lack of a government ID wasn't what kept the other 36 percent from the polls. Americans are highly mobile, and registering to vote in a new precinct, let alone a new city, takes effort. Campaign tactics and commercials before elections turn people off. The nominating process is so front-loaded that by the time some states hold their primaries, the nominee is all but decided. (Ohio could be a good example of this in 2012.) Numerous studies and even books such as "The Vanishing Voter " have examined the problem. Asked specifically about the 11 percent figure that Fudge and others use, Robert Pastor, director of the American University center and executive director of the Carter-Baker commission, did not dismiss it entirely. But he suggested that claims like this miss the broader context. "The problem is not the voter ID," he said. "The bigger problem in America is that we have relatively low voter participation, and that is in part because we have relatively low voter registration, regardless of the reason. That is true regardless of voter ID." If only 11 percent of the eligible population failed to vote, it would give the country an 89 percent participation rate. This would be extraordinary. So how do we rate Fudges claim? We start with the fact that a number of authorities say her source is credible. Daniel Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University, told us that he, too, thinks the Brennan figure "is in the ballpark." He cited another study, "The Disproportionate Impact of Voter ID Laws on the Electorate," done recently by researchers at universities in New Mexico, Arizona and Washington who used national survey data from the 2008 election. From 4,563 respondents, they found that 95 percent of registered white voters said they had current drivers licenses or state-issued photo IDs, while 90 percent of black voters, 89 percent of Latino voters and 86 percent of Asian voters did. But when comparing these voters with specific ID requirements of states like Indiana -- licenses had to be current, and names and addresses on the IDs had to comport with the voter registration records -- the researchers found that the percentage of white voters dropped to 88 percent, and the others to 80 or 81 percent. In other words, the figures change depending on the ID standard and the pool of prospective voters being gauged. In the original version of this PolitiFact Ohio item, we gauged the truthfulness of the statement Fudge made about 11 percent of people eligible to vote not having a photo ID. We rated that statement Half True, partly because the data is five years old. Mainly, though, we rated the statement Half True because Fudge made the statement to emphasize that the photo ID law is a significant impediment to voting. As an impediment, however, the Photo ID law pales compared to apathy. A lot more than 11 percent of eligible voters don't bother to register, let alone vote. But PolitiFact Ohio didn't need to look for Fudge’s underlying meaning in her statement. She flat out said the Photo ID law would be an impediment to voting. That's why we changed the claim we rated in this item. Yes, the Brennan Center figure is widely accepted. And Fudge’s statement sounds and feels accurate to a lot of people, many of them worried that voter ID laws will be too restrictive. But the idea that the Photo ID law would reduce voting ignores an important detail -- that a lot of people just don't vote. When a statement is accurate but leaves out important details needed to understand fully, the Truth-O-Meter has a specific rating: Half True.

pomt-14616	"We have more illegal immigrants here" than we did five years ago.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/31/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-incorrectly-says-illegal-immigrant-pop/	Throughout his Republican presidential campaign, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has tried to distance himself from his involvement in a 2013 failed bipartisan immigration bill. The legislation has proven to be a liability for Rubio because it contained a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and some of Rubio’s opponents say his support for the bill is evidence that he’s not tough on immigration. On NBC’s Meet the Press Jan. 31, host Chuck Todd asked Rubio if he regretted being part of the Gang of Eight senators who authored the bill. "Look, I tried to fix the problem," Rubio said, referring to illegal immigration. "This is a real problem. And where are we today? We are worse off today than we were five years ago. We have more illegal immigrants here. We have two unconstitutional executive orders on amnesty. I went to Washington to fix a problem." Our ears perked up when Rubio said there are more illegal immigrants in the United States than there were five years ago, so we decided to check the numbers. We found that the latest available data doesn’t support Rubio’s statement. A July 2015 headline from the Pew Research Center directly counters Rubio that there are more illegal immigrants than five years ago: "Unauthorized immigrant population stable for half a decade." Pew found that the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has seen very little fluctuation, between 2010 and 2014, the latest five-year period of data available — going from 11.4 million in 2010 to 11.3 million in 2014. The illegal immigrant population peaked at 12.2 million in 2007. (See the chart created by Pew to the left.) The Pew analysis concluded that the illegal immigrant population has been stable the past few years because the number of new immigrants is about equal to the number of those living in the United States who are deported, leave on their own, or die. Pew also found that the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, in particular, has been on the decline — going from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to 5.6 million in 2014. The decline in Mexican immigrants is the primary reason why illegal immigration stopped growing, said Robert Warren, a demographer and senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies. He pointed us to his own recent research on the subject. The report’s executive summary says illegal immigration is a hot political topic, in part, because people believe it’s on the rise. However, the paper finds that "this belief is mistaken and that, in fact, the undocumented population has been decreasing for more than a half a decade." Warren’s report found that the illegal immigrant population has declined every year for the past five years of available data, landing at about 10.9 million illegal immigrants in 2014, down from 11.7 million in 2010. Why the decline in Mexican immigration? In a prior fact-check, we found that demographic change is possibly the biggest driver. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. He said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop in total apprehensions of about 40 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped around a million people coming in from Mexico per year. Last year, it was about 188,000. More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling Rubio said, "We have more illegal immigrants here" than we did five years ago. Multiple estimates show that the illegal immigrant population has stabilized, or even decreased, from its peak in 2007 through 2014, the latest available data. According to Pew, the illegal immigrant population was 11.3 million in 2014, down from 11.4 million five years prior in 2010. This is in sharp contrast to dramatic and steady increases throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. There is no evidence to support the idea that the illegal immigrant population has grown in the past five years.

pomt-04127	Says 31 percent of Texas physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, down from 67 percent in 2000.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/08/texas-medical-association/medical-group-says-31-percent-texas-doctors-accept/	New Medicaid patients may struggle to land a Texas physician willing to accept that coverage, a medical group suggests. The Texas Medical Association, whose membership includes nearly 46,000 physicians and medical students, said in a Dec. 7, 2012, tweet: "Only 31% of Texas physicians accept all new #Medicaid patients compared to 67% in 2000." We soon learned the figures, indicating a possible plummet in patient access, traced to doctor surveys, not government or other records. Some 67 percent of the state’s physicians accepted Medicaid at least once during a recent 12-month period, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. Agency spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us by email that 34,290 Texas physicians had claims paid by Medicaid in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. According to the Texas Medical Board, there were nearly 51,000 practicing physicians in the state at about that time. Goodman said she did not have information on the share of physicians not accepting all new Medicaid patients. Brent Annear, a medical association spokesman, guided us to a March 2012 web post by the group stating that 27,917 physicians and medical residents were asked to fill out its online survey and the group fielded 1,139 responses, a 4 percent response rate. The group’s "preliminary findings" document says the respondents were a "representative sample" of all physicians. The survey reached members and non-members, the association’s Donna Kinney, who oversaw the survey, told us by email. The results: 96 percent of responding physicians said they were generally accepting new patients, but only 31 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients, compared to 42 percent in the group’s 2010 and 2008 surveys. In another 2012 response, 51 percent said they could take on more privately-insured patients in accord with federal health reform, but not more Medicaid patients. The key question lists physician reimbursement methods including private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. "For patients covered by the following payers," the question says, "does your practice currently (1) accept all new patients, (2) limit new patients that you will accept, or (3) accept no new patients?" In reply, 26 percent said they limit their new Medicaid patients and 44 percent said they decline all new Medicaid patients, compared to 32 percent in 2010. Bexar County physicians were most likely to accept all new Medicaid patients; 47 percent marked that choice. But less than 30 percent of physicians in the counties of Dallas, Tarrant, Harris and Travis, which was at 22 percent, said they accept all new Medicaid patients. In the state’s rural counties, 43 percent said they accept all new Medicaid patients. Annear said by email that physicians have difficulties with Medicaid’s rates and bureaucratic hurdles that delay payments. The rates decreased four times from 2000 to 2011, an association spokeswoman, Pam Udall, said by email, though the state also agreed to a 25-percent boost in funds covering certain physician services provided to children on Medicaid, as part of resolving a lawsuit. We asked Kinney to speculate on why nearly 70 percent of Texas physicians submitted at least one Medicaid claim in a recent year. She said about 60 percent of the state’s physicians--including many specialists in radiology, pathology and anesthesiology--must accept Medicaid to maintain their hospital admitting privileges. Those kinds of doctors would have responded to the survey by saying they limit new Medicaid patients, she said by phone. Wondering if the 2012 results could fairly be compared with the 2000 outcomes, we asked if the question’s wording had changed over the years. Kinney said it had not and also that each sample matches the demographics of physicians statewide--with the exception that fewer surveys are filled out by younger doctors, making for a slight, consistent skew through the years of surveying. For outside perspective, we turned to Florida-based pollster Dave Beattie, who called the survey methodology "standard," and Austin pollster Jeff Smith, who told us by phone that his firm once conducted the survey and that his concern all along has been that in contrast to traditional polls, in which the pollster entirely picks whom to question, respondents to the association survey are self-selected. Results are influenced, he said, by which recipients click through to reply. "This is not a random sample," Smith said, adding: "It’s an imperfect world. You can’t ever have a truly random sample." Kinney said that because the overall survey covers various topics, there is not much self-selection bias in relation to any one question. For a "real-world" take, we ran the 2012 survey result by Austin opthalmologist Michelle Berger, the 2013 president of the Travis County Medical Society, which is affiliated with the medical association. Berger said by phone that the society frequently fields inquiries from individuals newly on Medicaid seeking a doctor. Berger said she stopped accepting new Medicaid patients in her practice because related paperwork proved onerous and government payments, which have not kept up with inflation, were not quickly forthcoming. Then again, she said, doctors who do not accept new Medicaid patients may still provide charity care--the result being that some low-income patients are served even though their doctors do not seek payment. Finally, we circled back to Udall about the group’s tweet not saying that the cited percentages were based only on survey responses.

pomt-05022	"The state of Ohio has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation right now and is leading the pack in terms of job creation."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/16/bill-johnson/bill-johnson-says-ohio/	Jobs are a major concern in Ohio's 6th Congressional District, which stretches along the state's southeast border from Youngstown to the southernmost counties in Appalachia. That means job creation is again a leading campaign issue in the rematch between Rep. Bill Johnson, the incumbent elected in the Republican sweep of 2010, and Charlie Wilson, the Democrat he unseated. Johnson raises the issue when he meets with voters, and he mentioned it in June in one of the telephone town halls he uses to keep in touch with his sprawling district. "I don't know if you realize this or not," he told a caller, "but the state of Ohio has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation right now and is leading the pack in terms of job creation." PolitiFact Ohio was interested because its positive tone seemed to contrast with a comment the congressman said, days later: "We have to put America back to work." We asked his office for supporting sources. In a written statement, Johnson said, "Because I talk to so many people in eastern and southeastern Ohio, I know that we need to make much more progress in job creation." He blamed current economic conditions on what he called "the job-killing policies" of the Obama administration. "I often give dozens of speeches and talks a week, rarely relying on a script," he said. "While my precise wording certainly could have been better, the essence of my point is the same one The Plain Dealer's PolitiFact made just a few months ago." He cited PolitiFact Ohio's fact check of April 5, on Gov. John Kasich's statement that Ohio was "the No. 1 job creator in America in February, and we are now the No. 4 job creator in the last year." We rated that statement as True. But statistics are volatile. Kasich’s statement relied on job figures from several months before Johnson’s claim in his teleconference, so we checked the numbers again to see if it still holds up. In discussing job creation, Kasich pointed to employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to the news release issued by the BLS when it posted new numbers on March 30. In February, the BLS said, the nation's largest over-the-month increase in employment and "largest statistically significant" job gain occurred in Ohio, which was up 28,300 jobs. That was then. In March, Ohio went from first to worst by losing 5,200 jobs, the country’s "largest over-the-month decrease in employment," according to the BLS. Another 2,000 jobs were lost in April. Figures for May, which the BLS reported 10 days after Johnson spoke, showed that Ohio posted a gain of 19,600 jobs -- an increase second only to California's for the month. A BLS economist told us that "lots of things can happen other than the economy" to affect job losses and gains over short period. They don't consider a one-month change significant, but prefer to look at longer trends -- such as Ohio's ranking 4th in job creation over a year. We also looked at the state-by-state unemployment figures from BLS to see if Ohio does have "one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation." The most recent BLS figures, for May, were released on June 15. They put Ohio's unemployment rate at 7.3 percent -- tied for 24th place with Arkansas and Missouri. The figures for April, which were the latest available when Johnson spoke, had Ohio and Pennsylvania tied for 28th place with unemployment rates of 7.4 percent. The latest unemployment rate was lowest in North Dakota, at 3 percent, and highest in Nevada, 11.6 percent. At 24th or 28th, Ohio ranks in the middle, not among the lowest. Ohio's rate has been on a downward trend and is below the national jobless rate of 8.2 percent. It also is lower than the rates in neighboring Michigan and Indiana, and lower than those of such large industrialized states as New York and Illinois. What does it add up to? Johnson conceded that his "precise wording certainly could have been better," and we agree. His statement contains an element of truth. While Ohio is not "leading the pack" in job creation, it does rank among the top dogs in the longer-term measurement that Labor Department economists see as statistically significant. But the statement ignores some critical facts. Johnson cited job creation numbers from February, a month in which Ohio was tops in the nation. But monthly stats for March and April, both available at the time of his statement, showed Ohio losing jobs. And while Ohio’s jobless rate has improved considerably since it rose above 10 percent in 2009 and 2010, it is not one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation. It now is below the national average. But now and at the time of Johnson’s claim, the state was in the middle of the pack. On the Truth-O-Meter, Johnson’s claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-10220	"My grandfather came home from ... (World War II) exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/05/john-mccain/history-notes-elder-mccains-passing/	In his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., presidential nominee John McCain made the case for the presidency, describing his policy positions and contrasting himself to Democratic nominee Barack Obama. He also discussed his life story as a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, and his family's long history of military service. "When I was 5 years old, a car pulled up in front of our house," McCain said. "A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination." McCain writes extensively about the grandfather — they share the same name, John Sidney McCain — in his memoir Faith of My Fathers . The senior McCain served in the Navy in the Pacific theater during World War II, most notably as commander of the Second Fast Carrier Force and Task Force 38. He was present at the formal signing of the Japanese surrender on the USS Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945. In his memoir, Sen. McCain recounted that his grandfather was eager to get home after the war ended and didn't want to stay for the ceremony: " 'I don't give a damn about seeing the surrender,' my grandfather told (Admiral William) Halsey. 'I want to get the hell out of here.' To which Halsey replied, 'Maybe you do, but you're not going. You were commanding this task force when the war ended, and I'm making sure history gets it straight.' In his memoir, Halsey described my grandfather 'cursing and sputtering' as he returned to his flagship." The senior McCain returned home soon afterward to his wife in California. The day after his return, his wife hosted a small homecoming party for him. "In the middle of the celebration my grandfather turned to my grandmother, announced that he felt ill, and then collapsed," McCain wrote. "He was sixty one years old. He had fought his war and died. His Navy physician attributed his fatal heart attack to 'complete fatigue resulting from the strain of the last months of combat.' " His obituary ran on the front page of the New York Times , and includes the detail that he had returned home only the day before. "Admiral McCain's groups were called the world's most powerful task force and the destruction they wrought on Japanese military installations and armament centers played a vital role in reducing the country's ability to fight and bringing about final victory," according to the obituary. We find McCain's statement that his grandfather died the day after returning from World War II to be True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-05T00:00:00	2008-09-04	['None']

pomt-08719	Says Rick Perry is a 25-year incumbent.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/03/bill-white/bill-white-says-perry-25-year-incumbent/	The major gubernatorial candidates seem to get their kicks out of plastering each other with derogatory labels. In Gov. Rick Perry's campaign statements, his Democratic rival is "liberal trial lawyer Bill White." To White's campaign, the GOP governor is "part-time Perry." Another White tactic: bringing attention to Perry's many years as an elected official by calling him a "career politician." Perhaps in that spirit, a Wednesday press release from White linking Perry and a widely expected state budget shortfall pokes at Perry's longevity in an eye-catching secondary headline: "25 year incumbent focuses on re-election instead of issues." White spokeswoman Katy Bacon told us in an e-mail that the Wednesday reference was to Perry's time "in one office or another." Indeed, Perry's biography on his state website says his "political career started in 1985." That's the year after he was elected as a Democrat to the Texas House of Representatives from a West Texas district. He served three two-year terms, switching to the Republican Party in 1989. (When we peeked earlier this week, the Perry bio on his campaign website said he spent four terms in the House, but his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, acknowledged that the correct number is three. The bio has since been corrected.) Perry won election in 1990 as Texas agriculture commissioner, a statewide office he held for two four-year terms. By the end of 1998, Perry had spent 14 years in public office. That year, he won the race for lieutenant governor, and in late 2000, he ascended to the state's highest office when George W. Bush left the governorship to prepare for his swearing-in as president. Perry won re-election to the governor's office in 2002 and 2006. The tally: As of January 2010, Perry had been in one office or another more than 25 years. Then again, White's headline could be taken to mean Perry has been governor all those years, especially because the related press release and video are about his performance as governor. We think that's misleading. Also questionable is White's use of the word "incumbent," which implies that Perry was cemented into place a quarter-century ago. According to Webster's New World College Dictionary, an incumbent is "the holder of an office or benefice." In common usage, "incumbent" usually describes someone running for an office that he or she already holds. Bacon said White's campaign was not trying to mislead voters about Perry. "Everyone knows he's been the governor for 10 years," she said. Our call: White's poke accurately tabulates Perry's seven-plus terms in four different offices. But describing Perry as a "25-year incumbent" in a critique focused on his governorship blurs the fact that most of the time Perry's held office, he's not been governor — or in a single elected position. We rate White's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08695	Lindsey Graham endorsed Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/sep/08/blog-posting/lindsey-graham-endorses-charlie-crist-talk-spreads/	The Twitter feeds started buzzing shortly after 10 a.m. Sept. 8, 2010 -- Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham had endorsed no-party, independent candidate Charlie Crist in the Senate race in Florida. "WOW BIG NEWS," wrote Twitter user KenGPDX. BenRay added, "SCGOP Proxy War in FL. Oh my." That's a reference to South Carolina's other U.S. senator, Jim DeMint, actively supporting Republican nominee Marco Rubio. Other conservatives were quick to criticize Graham. "Respect for Graham plummets to 0," KevinWGlass wrote. "We need to publish the names of the RINO (Republican In Name Only) Republicans who are going along with Obama & Pelosi such as Lindsey Graham," wrote ThorntonB1. Put away the pitchforks, users of Twitter. You've been had. The bogus rumor was started by Amanda Terkel, a senior political reporter for the Huffington Post. Shortly after 10 a.m. she posted to her Twitter account "Lindsey Graham endorses Charlie Crist, says he's 'exactly what the national Republican Party needs.' " She realized she'd made a mistake within five minutes, but not before her message had been seen and reposted by hundreds of others. She quickly tried to stop the news from spreading, firing off a quick succession of Tweets. Terkel was looking at an old press release from when Crist was running for Senate as a Republican. The release was sent out on Sept. 8 by Democratic candidate Kendrick Meek's campaign. The Meek campaign has been resending old Crist releases in recent days to highlight his ties to Republicans. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terkel's follow-up Tweets: "Scratch my last tweet. Think I was looking at an old press release. (About Graham/Crist) "@FranklinLDavis @DukeStJournal @BenRay @kombiz @kate_sheppard @LEPHAMMER @Chris_Moody @asherhuey @TimFernholz My last tweet was wrong. "@KevinWGlass Scratch my last tweet. I was wrong. Looking at old release. "@MilesGrant Ignore! I was wrong. Crist" for Senate. But it was dated 5/26/09. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the record, we checked with Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop about the endorsement. "This is an 'old' endorsement, pre-Crist leaving the GOP," Bishop said in an e-mail. "Senator Graham is supporting Rubio." Bishop included a helpful timeline explaining Graham's one-time support for Crist. Sen. Lindsey Graham endorsed Gov. Crist on May 18, 2009, when he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Fund for America’s Future, Sen. Graham's leadership PAC, made financial contributions to the Crist campaign of $1,000 on June 15, 2009, and $4,000 on Dec. 21, 2009. When Gov. Crist announced that he was no longer a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, we sent a letter to the treasurer of the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign asking that the $5,000 be refunded and that Sen. Graham's endorsement be removed from the campaign’s website and literature. Sen. Graham is supporting Republican nominee Marco Rubio in the Florida Senate race. Sen. Graham has co-hosted a Rubio reception in Washington and Fund for America's Future gave the maximum $5,000 contribution to the Rubio campaign in August. Graham endorsed the Republican version of Crist back in 2009, but yanked that support when Crist announced he was leaving the party. The old endorsement came back to haunt Graham, and Crist, on Twitter. But don't be fooled. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-07062	On pay for fired Milwaukee police officers	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/28/alberta-darling/pay-fired-milwaukee-police-officers-Darling-does-/	In the middle of the night on June 2, 2011, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee took up a surprise budget amendment: pay for fired Milwaukee police officers. It’s a topic lawmakers have addressed twice in three years in the wake of public outrage over the treatment of officers fired for their roles the 2004 Frank Jude beating case. Nine officers were fired for their roles in that incident. Anger mounted as officers were paid by taxpayers while they fought their dismissals. The Legislature first blocked pay for cops charged with serious crimes. Then, lawmakers extended the ban to officers dismissed for lesser infractions, including department rule violations. The amendment, authored by the co-chairs of the committee -- state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) and state Rep. Robin Vos (R-Rochester) -- would have rolled back the ban on rule violators, which covers the vast majority of those fired. After pressure from Milwaukee officials, who noted the 2009 police pay change had saved city taxpayers $283,300, Republican Gov. Scott Walker vetoed the provision on June 26, 2011. Among those who urged him to veto it: Darling. Her opponent in a recall election, state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) called it an "astonishing" flip-flop. Was it? Yes, time again to roll out the Flip-O-Meter. A reminder: It does not examine whether a change in position is a good one from a political or a policy perspective. It just measures whether a person has been consistent. Let’s briefly recap Darling’s position on the question of pay for fired Milwaukee police officers. She was a co-sponsor, along with Vos, of the amendment that was added to the budget June 2, 2011. At the time, Vos claimed the Milwaukee police chief could fire officers for "basically no cause." We rated that claim False. Vos has said his information on the fired police matter came from officials with the Milwaukee Police Association, which has about 1,800 members. Once the amendment was adopted by the committee, and then by the Legislature (with Darling arguing for it on the Senate floor), Milwaukee officials pushed for a veto. Under the system, they said, the amendment would have guaranteed fired officers at least 60 days additional pay and benefits while they appealed. Officers in some cases have stretched out the process much longer. The 2009 police pay change has saved Milwaukee taxpayers $283,300 to date, according to Michael Tobin, executive director of the city's Fire and Police Commission. Since then, eight officers have been fired by Chief Edward Flynn for rule violations. In the course of the discussion, Darling said she changed her mind after looking into the matter in greater depth. Darling said fired cops were treated more fairly than she had been led to believe. Said Darling: "There’s a lot more due process and coordination between the chief and the Fire and Police Commission." Vos has said he will introduce a bill this fall to strip the Milwaukee police chief’s power to fire officers. He said it’s part of an effort to streamline the way cops are treated across the state. Chiefs in other jurisdictions suspend officers, and the local commission determines whether or not to fire them. "I told Robin that he needs to talk with Mr. Tobin," Darling said. "A lot has changed." On June 26, 2011, Walker vetoed the provision when he signed the two-year budget. Darling acknowledged she sought a veto of an amendment she co-sponsored. That’s a Full Flop.

pomt-09352	"An audit of the last census found that over 370,000 people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/apr/06/silvestre-reyes/rep-silvestre-reyes-says-census-audit-found-more-3/	Urging constituents to return their filled-out 2010 census surveys to the federal government, U.S Rep. Silvestre Reyes refers to a dramatic blast from the past. The El Paso Democrat states in a March 11 e-mail: “An audit of the last census found that over 370,000 people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result.” Goodness. (And where did that census form disappear to?) Does Reyes get his big numbers right? And if there was an undercount, did it cause Texas to miss out on a big chunk of federal aid? For starters, we found no such audit, and Reyes’ office didn’t provide back-up for his statement. However, a 2001 PriceWaterhouseCoopers study prepared for the U.S. Census Bureau Monitoring Board, an entity that no longer exists, stated that nationally, the 2000 census failed to count some 3.3 million residents, including 373,567 Texas residents. The undercount figures were attributed to the Census Bureau and Eugene Ericksen, a Temple University sociologist. Some perspective: Reyes’ recent e-mail harkens to concerns aired in 2000, especially by Democrats, that without an adjustment the census would fail to account for many residents, mainly racial minorities and renters. The bureau did not adjust its count of the nation’s population. The 2001 report said the undercount could result in a federal funding loss of $4 billion across 31 states (including Texas) and the District of Columbia. It raised the prospect of California and Texas losing the most, $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, from fiscal 2002 to 2012. A press release accompanying the report included this warning from Peter Merrill of PricewaterhouseCoopers' National Economic Consulting group: “Inaccuracies in the census can cause federal funds to be distributed in a way that is not fully consistent with congressional intent. The census undercount not only misallocates funds among jurisdictions, it also causes a net loss to the states of funds from federal entitlement programs. Compounding the problem, many state-funded grant programs to localities also rely on census counts.” Reyes isn't alone in using figures from the 2001 report to argue the importance of participation in the 2010 census. Since last summer, Texas newspapers including the Austin American-Statesman, Dallas Morning News, Fort Worth Star-Telegram and San Antonio Express-News have mentioned figures from the report. Does the report still hold water? Our finding: Like a sunk boat. About two months after the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report came out, the Census Bureau said it would reassess how accurately it had counted the nation's residents in 2000. And in 2003, the bureau announced new estimates for what the 2000 counts for each state should have been. And there was another twist: Instead of undercounting the nation's population, the bureau concluded it had over-counted by about 1.3 million people. David Whitford, chief of the bureau’s Decennial Statistical Studies Division, told us that the bureau ultimately realized that undercounts nationally were more than offset by double-counting of many individuals and other errors. One example: counting students away at college while also recording them as part of their parents' household back home. Some population groups were affected more than others. The bureau said it had overcounted whites, Asians, American Indians on reservations and young children, the Associated Press reported, while many blacks and Hispanics were missed. There was still a small net undercount (by 10,245 people, or .05 percent) in Texas, the bureau said. The census count of Texans should have been 20,862,065, the bureau estimated. Where does this leave the PriceWaterhouseCoopers study? Professor Ericksen told us that by repudiating its initial undercount estimates, the bureau effectively invalidated both the population figures and federal aid estimates. And Merrill of PriceWaterhouseCoopers cautioned against using its 2001 report for another reason: "It is certainly out of date... Our firm is not telling anyone that the analysis done in 2001 is relevant for today." Vincent Perez, Reyes' press secretary, said he's been unable to get the Census Bureau to confirm that it backed off the estimate that more than 370,000 Texas residents weren't counted in the 2000 census. How does Rep. Reyes’ statement stand up? Reyes incorrectly refers to the consultant’s projections as an audit of the census; it was a report. More importantly, Reyes relies -- as have other entities -- on an outdated report based on numbers the Census Bureau has said were flawed. The bureau long ago yanked the statistical rug out from under the claim that more than 370,000 Texas residents were not counted and that Texas stood to miss out on $1 billion in aid as a result. This isn't a close call. We rate Reyes' statement as Pants on Fire.	None	Silvestre Reyes	None	None	None	2010-04-06T16:45:24	2010-03-11	['Texas']
pomt-09995	"There are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/07/lawrence-odonnell/odonnell-alleges-gingrich-laid-bush-record-indicat/	On a recent episode of MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann, liberal political analyst Lawrence O'Donnell accused Newt Gingrich of hypocrisy for criticizing President Obama. Gingrich had said on Fox News Sunday on April 5, 2009 that Obama had a "fantasy foreign policy" that emphasized diplomacy despite threats such as that from North Korea. A day later in an online chat the former House speaker said Obama's response to a recent North Korean missile test was "a vivid demonstration of weakness." Olbermann mentioned these criticisms, playing a clip of the first, then turned to O'Donnell for a response. "Well, we don't have similar clips to show from 2006 in October, the last time North Korea launched one of these things under President Bush's watch," said O'Donnell, a former Senate staffer, Huffington Post blogger and executive producer of The West Wing . "There are no similar clips of Newt Gingrich talking about how ineffective President Bush was in trying to control North Korea." "Yes," Olbermann said. We were less willing than Olbermann to take O'Donnell at his word. So we checked what Gingrich said in October 2006, after North Korea announced it had detonated a nuclear device. Here's Gingrich talking about the incident on Hannity & Colmes on Oct. 10, 2006: "We may wake up one morning and lose Seattle or San Francisco or Atlanta or Boston," Gingrich said. "And that's far too serious to just degenerate into pointing fingers at each other. And, yet, I don't sense any -- I don't sense any real willingness, and I say this about both parties. I mean, this would be a great moment for the president to invite all the senior Democrats in the House and Senate into a White House meeting to sit down and say, 'First of all, our analysts were wrong. Second, our intelligence didn't know where to look. We're not even certain the first weapon was a nuclear weapon.' The Japanese now report a second test. I mean, this ought to be seen as a very substantial crisis of national security." "I'm not defending the administration here," Gingrich emphasized later in the program. "This is not a pro-Bush comment. I'm saying I think we, as Americans, are up against much more serious problems than we understand. And that we are faced with a threat that literally could cost us two or three cities in the next decade." Here's Gingrich a week later on The O'Reilly Factor talking about national security: "I think we have to demand dramatically more," Gingrich said. "We may well have to spend more on national security. But the answer is not to become weaker than President Bush. The answer is to become stronger. I'm not at all comfortable, whether it's in Iraq, or in the intelligence service or dealing with North Korea or dealing with our own border. I'm not comfortable with where we are right now." O'Reilly had not even asked specifically about North Korea. Later on the program Gingrich endorsed Bush's decision not to have one-on-one talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il. But still, in the above exchange, Gingrich went out of his way to suggest Bush was too weak with respect to North Korea. So there are at least two instances of Gingrich critiquing Bush's approach to North Korea -- exactly what O'Donnell said did not happen. We find O'Donnell's claim to be False.

That prompted debate moderator Chris Wallace to ask Clinton to explain her remarks about "open borders" to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau in 2013. Here is that excerpt, as released by WikiLeaks: "My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere." At the debate, Clinton replied that her sentence from the speech related to energy. "I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined," she said. "And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that will be great benefit to us." Trump shook his head, countering again: "She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country." We will fact-check whether Clinton is for open borders. Open borders At a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, Trump made a similar claim, that Clinton had made a "radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all." We rated his claim Mostly False. The Trump campaign referred us to Clinton's pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office and to help Dreamers, children brought to the United States illegally as children. But that doesn’t amount to wanting open borders. Clinton supported 2013 legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship with conditions and billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. As a candidate, she has said she would focus on deportations for violent criminals or those who pose threats. Some experts disagree about what "open borders" means. Steven Camarota, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies which advocates for low levels of immigration, says her focus on deporting violent criminals is only a small share of the undocumented population. "That can reasonably be seen as open borders since almost all those who join the illegal population will not have to leave, rendering the current restrictions and limits mute," he said. Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said Clinton hasn’t released enough specifics about her plans such as her position on the future flow of migrant workers. "Positions on these issues would shed a lot of light on whether or not she supports something approaching open borders (although the term open borders can mean many things)," he said. But generally we heard from experts that although Clinton wants to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status, that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement entirely and allowing open borders. Bank speech excerpt When WikiLeaks posted Clinton’s speech excerpt about open borders earlier this month, we asked immigration experts if her statement was a call for open borders for immigrants. The experts said Clinton’s remarks were not a clear-cut call for open borders. They also said that her statement sounded aspirational and contained no timeline or explanation as to how she would make it happen politically. (We asked the Clinton campaign for her full speech but did not get a reply to that request, so we can only evaluate the excerpt.) "My guess would be that Clinton's Brazil speech reflects this broader call for greater hemispheric cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade," Stephen Kelly, a Duke University public policy professor. "Given this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I would also guess that the ‘open borders’ she mentions relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not people." Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the European Union’s internal borders. For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean an open border for free immigration, but rather for free travel. "I don't think she is calling for open immigration, but the context of her remarks shows that when she says ‘open borders,’ she doesn't just mean open trade," he said. Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance at University of Washington, said Clinton appeared to be talking about both trade and immigration. "I would read the remark as calling for open borders with regard to both trade and immigration. Otherwise the term ‘open trade and open borders’ would be redundant," he said. However, he said he saw no timetable in her remarks beyond "some time in the future," or discussion about how to make it happen. "I don't necessarily see a contradiction between a statement of ideals and a more pragmatic policy agenda for reality," he said. "One can dream of a crime-free world where there is need for neither police nor prisons while still supporting those things in reality." Our ruling Trump said that Clinton "wants to have open borders." Although she wants to make it easier for some undocumented immigrants to stay here, she has repeatedly said she supports border security, so Trump is exaggerating when he says she wants open borders. In a brief speech excerpt from 2013, she called for "a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable." Clinton has said she was talking about clean energy, but we can’t fully evaluate her remarks to a bank because we don’t have the full speech.

pomt-08566	Says he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/28/tom-ganley/tom-ganley-touts-role-fbi-investigation/	In ads and personal appearances, Brecksville auto dealer Tom Ganley likes to say his 1980s run-in with organized crime is one of the top reasons why voters should support his GOP campaign for Congress over incumbent Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton. Ganley’s campaign broadcast its first television ad on Sept. 16, which began: "An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business, threatening his family. But he fought back and won the FBI’s highest civilian award. Tom Ganley for Congress. Tom Ganley will take that same courage and business experience to Washington and stop reckless spending." Earlier that week, Ganley told The Plain Dealer’s editorial board that he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio. In the Sept. 13 interview, Ganley described how he spent two years helping the FBI catch organized crime figures who tried to extort money from his car dealership, how he wore a bulletproof vest, how his personal and business phones were monitored, his children were threatened, and how the Mafia put out a $1 million contract on his life. The FBI subsequently gave him its "Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award." "I’m someone who has taken on the Mafia and won," Ganley told the editorial board. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at his claim. Articles from The Plain Dealer’s archives show two organized crime figures -- former Teamsters Union leader John J. (Skip) Felice and Joseph C. Ilaqua -- were sent to prison by U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler in July 1983 after pleading guilty to conspiring to extort $10,000 and a car from Ganley in 1981 and 1982.. The indictment against Felice said he approached Ganley in April 1981, and told him that high ranking organized crime figures wanted him killed. Felice said he could get the contract on Ganley’s life canceled in exchange for money. Ganley paid Felice $10,000 in two, $5,000 payments on or about May 4, 1981, and Feb. 10, 1982. As part of the deal, Ganley gave Ilaqua a leased 1981 Oldsmobile 98 Regency. "During this investigation, it became evident to these organized crime members that Mr. Ganley was cooperating with the FBI and that he would be testifying against them at trial," says a 2007 press release the FBI issued when Ganley got its Louis E. Peters award. "This realization resulted in additional death threats directed at Mr. Ganley and his family. Mr. Ganley refused to be intimidated by these criminals and consented to having FBI agents live at his residence to provide security for himself and his family." Former FBI agents interviewed by The Plain Dealer said that Ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the FBI’s request that were designed to help it crack other cases. Former FBI agent Carmen LoParo said Felice helped implicate other criminals by answering Ganley’s questions about who ultimately got the extortion money he paid. LoParo described Ilaqua as "a mob strongarm person who would break legs and things." "Skippy Felice was boasting about all the mob connections and how there was money coming in from different organizations in Las Vegas," recalled another retired FBI agent, James Kennedy. "That was eventually used to develop cooperating witnesses within the organized crime family." None of the FBI agents or former federal prosecutors contacted by The Plain Dealer could provide the names of crime figures apart from Felice and Ilaqua who were convicted solely on the basis of Ganley’s evidence. They said the FBI used information from many sources to build cases against organized crime figures. "Every single case was connected to other cases because of this larger structure," says retired FBI agent David Drab. And while he described Ganley’s actions as courageous and important to the FBI’s investigative strategy, he said: "I don’t think anybody would think one person and one case could take out the mob." So where does that leave us? Ganley’s claim to the editorial board does have some element of truth. He did help put several dangerous criminals behind bars. FBI agents who worked with him uniformly praise his actions. But it’s overkill for Ganley to state that his work "took down the mob" in Northeast Ohio. For this reason, PolitiFact rates his claim as Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Tom Ganley	None	None	None	2010-09-28T12:00:22	2010-09-13	['None']

pomt-09770	"Health care mandate will require imprisonment and fines for Americans who can’t afford to purchase insurance or pay hefty government penalties."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/29/patients-first/conservative-group-says-youll-be-imprisoned-not-ha/	As the Senate Finance Committee took up its version of health care legislation, conservatives ramped up their opposition to a variety of provisions in the bill. One of them touches two hot buttons for conservatives: taxes and the long arm of the federal government. On Sept. 29, 2009, a subsidiary of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity sent out an e-mail headlined, "Health Care Mandate Will Require Imprisonment and Fines for Americans Who Can’t Afford to Purchase Insurance or Pay Hefty Government Penalties." The group was referring to an exchange in the Senate Finance Committee between Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., and Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff Thomas Barthold on Sept. 24, 2009. Both the House and Senate bills would impose taxes designed to prod Americans who are currently uninsured into buying insurance. Exemptions would be provided for families of limited means. The idea is that by expanding the pool of Americans paying for coverage, insurers can use the additional revenue to improve benefits, eliminate barriers for pre-existing conditions and reduce costs for others enrolled in the plans. Initially, the Senate version would have had families above 300 percent of the federal poverty level pay $3,800 a year if they did not have health insurance. Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., later agreed to lower that amount by half, to $1,900. Backers hope that no American actually pays the tax; they want to see people spending those dollars on health insurance instead. Still, Ensign is among those who balk at the idea. "Some people hold the Constitution pretty high in their lives, and if they believe that this thing is unconstitutional and they then say ... 'I choose not to have health insurance. I'm not going to buy it,'" Ensign said at a markup of the contentious bill. "We could be subjecting those very people ... to fines or the interpretation of a judge potentially all the way up even to imprisonment." The bill summary that the Senate committee considered did not mention specifics about enforcement and sentencing for violations. So, at the markup, Ensign questioned Barthold — the top professional staffer on the joint House-Senate panel that advises both chambers on tax legislation — about what penalties would be assessed. Barthold told him that they would be "penalties under the Internal Revenue Code." Ensign asked for "the maximum penalty" for a "willful" — that is, intentional — violation. Is it "possible that somebody could go to jail over this?" Ensign asked. Barthold answered, "Could be criminal, yes, if it were considered an attempt to defraud." Later, several news outlets reported that Barthold delivered a hand-written note to Ensign after the hearing confirming that violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in prison or a $25,000 penalty. When PolitiFact contacted the Joint Committee on Taxation to confirm the contents of the letter, a spokeswoman said that such communications were confidential, but she pointed us to Section 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code, titled, "Willful failure to file return, supply information or pay tax." The text of that section appears to jibe with the reported contents of Barthold's note. It says, "Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution." (A House Ways and Means Committee spokesman said that the same rules would apply to the House bill.) After the hearing, Patients First, a project of the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, issued a news release that played up the possibility that people who didn't buy health coverage could end up in prison. The release was headlined, "Health Care Mandate Will Require Imprisonment and Fines for Americans Who Can’t Afford to Purchase Insurance or Pay Hefty Government Penalties," and its first sentence referred to "a draconian health care measure under consideration in Congress that would imprison uninsured Americans who fail to pay a penalty for not buying health insurance." We were struck by the statement that the bill would "require imprisonment and fines" for nonpayment of the tax. Nothing in the Internal Revenue Code suggests that violators would have to go to jail. It's simply one of the possible penalties that could be assessed. When we contacted Eric Novack, the senior fellow in health policy for Patients First and Americans for Health Prosperity who was quoted in the release, he conceded the point. "I would make the case that the headline is hyperbole, but it got people's attention," Novack said. "It is a bit of artistic license. I guess I would agree that it's a bit strongly worded." He added that he believes the news release's larger point stands. Such enforcement of the tax would be "turning people who can't afford health insurance into criminals." The headline would have been correct if it had said the mandate " could require imprisonment or fines." In fact, further down, the text of the release reports more accurately that "under the health care bill outline[d] in the Senate Finance Committee, uninsured Americans who fail to pay a stiff penalty for not purchasing insurance would face up to one year in prison or a $25,000 fine." That part of the release, with its "or," acknowledges that violators would likely face just one of those penalties. And it's worth noting that, as with other violations in which people have refused to pay taxes, sending someone to prison is an extreme measure used as a last resort. First off, as Barthold testified to the committee, the Internal Revenue Service would likely undertake normal collection procedures such as wage garnishments before resorting to a criminal case. Tax lawyers we spoke to said it's possible for an unsuccessful debt collection to be referred to federal criminal prosecutors, though criminal prosecutions more commonly arise from audits. If a nonpayment case with "willful" aspects did make it to the criminal docket, then it still has a long way to go until prison time kicks in. Of the 3,749 criminal investigations initiated by the IRS in fiscal year 2008, the agency recommended 2,785 prosecutions. Of those, 2,547 led to an indictment or criminal information and 2,144 produced convictions. And of those, 1,957 defendants were sentenced to prison, a halfway house or home detention. To put this in perspective, the IRS audited almost 1.4 million tax returns in 2007. That year, the number of confinement sentences was 2,123, meaning that less than two-tenths of 1 percent of audits resulted in prison time. And based on past prosecution trends, it's highly unlikely that someone would be sentenced to prison for a debt as small as $1,900, tax lawyers said. Larry A. Campagna — a Houston-based tax lawyer with the firm Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White, Williams & Martin and vice chair of the American Bar Association Tax Section's Committee on Civil and Criminal Tax Penalties — said that judges in tax cases use sentencing guidelines based on the size of the financial loss to the government. The chart is complicated — and factors like a guilty plea or help in prosecuting others could reduce the sentence — but he suggested that only a tax conviction involving a sum of higher than $12,500 would give a taxpayer a reasonable probability of going to prison. And prison still wouldn't be likely until someone owed $30,000. Both of these sums are vastly more than the $1,900 unpaid amount envisioned in the Senate Finance bill. Much more common in nonpayment cases are fines. On this point, the critics of the Baucus plan have a point: the $25,000 fine in the plan is unusually high compared to fines for other tax matters involving such a small amount of money. Most fines are calculated as a percentage of the sum owed, at a rate as high as 75 percent if fraud is involved. For a $1,900 nonpayment, the fine would be $1,425 — if prosecutors even bothered to chase a haul that small with criminal charges, something they generally don't. One more hurdle before anyone goes to prison: a likely court battle. "I would have a hard time imagining someone going to jail on the health care issue without the case first going to the Supreme Court to test the constitutional merit of the government forcing everyone to get health insurance," said Steven Street, general manager of the Alexandria, Va., accounting firm Ross & Moncure. So let's recap. It is a significant exaggeration to say that the Baucus bill's "health care mandate will require imprisonment and fines for Americans who can’t afford to purchase insurance or pay hefty government penalties." It won't "require imprisonment and fines" — those are simply two of the options for enforcement, and experts say that neither a prison term nor a fine anywhere near that high is likely to be used. The official responsible for the Patients First release acknowledges that his headline overstated what the Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff said, but the release does accurately report the penalties in the body of the text. The notion that one could go to prison for not buying insurance is certainly attention-grabbing, but based on past patterns of prosecution, the likelihood of it happening is extremely small. So while the fear seems to us to be overheated, the possibility exists. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Patients First	None	None	None	2009-09-29T17:43:37	2009-09-29	['None']
pomt-07598	Wisconsin was embroiled in a "constitutional crisis" brought on by the Democratic senators fleeing the state for Illinois to block Gov. Scott Walker's budget-repair bill.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/24/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-/	When the 14 Democrats in the Wisconsin State Senate left for Illinois on Feb. 17, 2011, they threw a monkey wrench in Gov. Scott Walker’s plans for quick approval of a budget-repair bill. The delay gave unions time to launch a fight against the move to curtail collective bargaining for public employees, which drew tens of thousands of protesters to the Capitol. Their maneuver prompted majority Republicans to try to force their return and amped up national and international attention in the battle against the bill. But did the Democrats’ three-week departure put the state in a "constitutional crisis"? Did the consequences of their actions reach far beyond an effort to put the brakes on a bill they disliked? That was the claim of Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), who spent weeks ramping up pressure on the absent Democrats. Their departure meant the 19 Republicans could not act on fiscal matters, since those measures require at least 20 senators to be present. Fitzgerald announced paychecks for the missing senators would be withheld; their staff members were put under the supervision of Republicans; staff access to photocopiers would be restricted; fines of $100 a day would be levied against the missing senators. Finally, on March 3, 2011, the Republicans passed a resolution finding their 14 colleagues to be in contempt of the Senate. And Fitzgerald signed arrest warrants for the missing 14, saying the warrants gave authorities permission to take them into custody, and to use force if necessary. In a March 3 news conference after he signed the warrants, Fitzgerald said that because of the Democrats’ actions: "We’re in a constitutional crisis." In doing so, he framed it all in the big picture: "This is not about a budget-repair bill or about politics," Fitzgerald said. "This is much bigger than that, and the minority party has forced our hand … They are insulting the very fabric of our representative democracy." It was more than a statement of opinion, since the constitutional argument was used as the basis for taking several actions. Fitzgerald’s factual assertion quickly took hold and was repeated by others, including Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) in an interview with an Illinois newspaper. Even though the immediate issue was resolved when Republicans stripped out aspects of the bill and passed without the Democrats, questions remain about the tactic they used and the impact it had on the statehouse. Some Democrats have not ruled out using the approach again. One, Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), argued that leaving the state is merely the equivalent of the filibuster in the U.S. Senate, a claim we rated Barely True. Another, Tim Cullen (D-Janesville), wants to make sure it never happens again. So we decided to dig in. What was the constitutional crisis? The state constitution says lawmakers can be compelled to attend legislative sessions but does not spell out how that can be done. The constitution also says lawmakers can be arrested only for crimes, treason or breach of the peace. The Democrats stalled the process, and said their actions were an effort to delay the budget-repair bill. There was no public indication that they wanted to permanently impede the Legislature’s ability to function. "I went to Illinois to slow down a bill that took away workers' rights," Cullen wrote in an opinion piece that ran in the March 19, 2011, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Cullen has proposed a constitutional amendment that would scrap the three-fifths rule that the Democrats exploited. What’s more, talks were under way to reach a deal on the matter. Emails released by Walker’s office showed that the governor was willing to compromise on some parts of the collective bargaining parts of the bill. The wheels of political give and take were turning behind the scenes. Fitzgerald’s office directed us to Madison attorney James Troupis, hired by the GOP senators to advise them about legal matters after the Democrats left. Troupis said the Democrats created a crisis because their departure meant the Senate couldn’t function. He called it a matter of survival of the Legislature. "If the Legislature cannot continue to function, and its primary job is to legislate, then it has no meaning, no function," Troupis said. "That’s precisely what happened." Troupis compared the situation to a bill passed inspired by the Sept. 11 attacks that spells out how the state would continue to function even if many of its legislative leaders perished. That bill allows the Legislature to meet virtually. An earlier, controversial plan that allowed lawmakers to secretly designate their successors in the case of an emergency died. We asked Troupis: Was the departure of the Democrats a 9-11 type emergency? "Yes," he responded. While it may be similar in that members are missing, it’s also quite different. After all, the 14 were not dead -- just in Illinois -- and in regular contact with GOP leaders, constituents, and, of course, the media. Is that enough? "If the body can’t act, if it’s denied the ability to act, it is no different than throwing somebody in jail and denying them habeas corpus," Troupis said, referring to the right of prisoners to have a prompt court hearing so they can know what charges they face. Said Troupis: The Democrats were "denying them (the Senate) the ability to act and that is a constitutional crisis." He added: "It fundamentally alters the role of the Legislature and in a republic you just can’t do that." If that is allowed to happen Wisconsin would be "no different than fascist regimes throughout the world," Troupis said. Why? The Democrats, Troupis said, jeopardized "the legislative branch of government" and would "give too much power to the executive branch." To some, that will be an ironic point. After all, protesters were claiming Walker was acting like a dictator. But let’s close out the GOP’s case, and start evaluating it. Relying upon that argument, the Senate Republicans voted in favor of holding the Democrats in contempt of the Senate. That move was a step beyond a Senate rule that says that absent members could be summoned to appear when the body was in session. We asked a state constitutional law expert for his take. We talked to him while the Democrats were still away, before the bill was ultimately passed and signed by Walker, though it’s now in judicial limbo. Donald Downs, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science, journalism and law professor, said the situation had the potential to become a constitutional crisis, but had not reached that point because the Democrats had not been hauled in by law enforcement officials. "The basic aspect of a constitutional crisis is when the legally constituted laws or processes are unable to resolve a matter of great political significance," Downs wrote in an email. "This can be due to the fact that established law is either very unclear on the issue, or non-existent. A crisis can also arise when different branches of government profoundly disagree on what the law requires, and the final resolution (often by courts) remains deeply controversial." He noted if the Democrats were arrested, "there will no doubt be a legal case, and the courts will decide." he said. "Whether this will represent a constitutional ‘crisis’ will depend on how secure the legal reasoning is and how it is received." He noted the situation in Madison was murky and the law unclear about how the situation should be handled. Indeed, few would dispute that. After all, both sides were consulting attorneys on how they could and should proceed. Downs concluded: "The Wisconsin case seems to have elements of a constitutional crisis, though it might be premature to call it that. But in my eye it has the potential to be one." Remember, he said this as the issue was playing out -- and emphasized the potential for a constitutional crisis His assessment contrasts that of Fitzgerald, who said the state was in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Of course, there is another side. Democratic lawyers Lester Pines and Susan Crawford issued their own legal memo, saying the Senate has no authority to have members arrested to compel their attendance. "The Wisconsin Senate’s action today in citing 14 members of its members for contempt for their refusal to attend the Senate’s sessions and to issue warrants for their arrest has no basis in the law of this state." Pines said in an interview that the idea of a constitutional crisis was absurd. "The senators were never going to stay away forever, and everybody knew that," he said. He said the Democrats left after it was apparent that they were being asked to consider a major bill in a very short time window. They saw a draft of the bill on Monday, Feb. 14, and it was scheduled for a committee vote three days later -- the day the Democrats split. "The proposal was to overturn 50 years of employment relations law. That was an extraordinary legislative attempt -- there’s no parallel to that," Pines said. The Democrats wanted to buy time for debate. "They wanted to give the public an opportunity to hear, see and participate in what the Legislature was doing," he said. Pines concluded: "They disrupted the majority party’s strategy. But that’s not a constitutional crisis. That’s democracy." We know how it all played out. The Republicans abruptly called a Senate-Assembly conference committee and narrowed the bill to focus on the collective bargaining provisions and the requirement that workers pay more for pensions and health care. Calling what remained non-fiscal matters, the Senate approved the bill March 9, the Assembly the following day and Walker quickly signed it. To a degree, those actions undermine the GOP’s claim that the state was on the verge of a constitutional crisis. Even as Fitzgerald made the claim, Republicans had a means to break the logjam and get key portions of the bill in place. Of course, not everything Walker wanted is in place and the full short-term budget gap has not been closed. If the law takes effect, the pension and health care contributions would mean a projected additional $37 million for the state. The short-term budget gap for the year ending June 30, 2011 is estimated at about $137 million. So, where does that leave us? Fitzgerald argued the absence of the Democrats didn’t create just a political crisis, but put the state into a constitutional crisis. That conjures images of a 9-11 type emergency -- a comparison made by the GOP attorney. But this strikes us as different: The Democrats were talking to their GOP counterparts, and Walker had indicated a willingness to reach a deal for their return. Also, the Democrats were pretty plain in their explanations of their strategy. They were trying to slow down and change Walker’s bill. What’s more, even as Fitzgerald made the statement, he had the tools at his disposal -- the ones the GOP ultimately used -- to break the logjam and get key parts of the bill through. That said, the Legislature was not able to close the short-term budget gap -- and still has not. Had the Democrats stayed away for a longer period of time, and had there been no other tools available, Fitzgerald’s statement would have been closer to accurate. All things considered, we rate Fitzgerald’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

In fact, Tapper noted, Sen. Orrin Hatch, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, credited Clinton with bringing him into the consultation process when Ginsburg was chosen. "What advice would you give President Obama?" Tapper asked. "Because Republicans are saying he's not including them in this." Clinton began by explaining that he faced a different political environment. "Well, I think for one thing, I had to do a little more of that (reaching out to Republicans) because I never had a filibuster-proof Senate," Clinton said. "And now there are 41 of them, although I think that a lot of those who come from more progressive states, the two Maine senators, the new senator from Massachusetts, a lot of them may think they already gave it the store on the health care deal or whatever they're doing on financial reform. I think it will be very difficult to just outright block a Supreme Court nominee that's otherwise qualified." With the close votes on health care reform, we have all become a little more familiar with how important political ratios can be to the legislative process. And so we decided to do a little research into Clinton's claim that he never had a filibuster-proof Senate. A filibuster is an attempt by the minority party to try to block a vote on issue. It takes a three-fifths majority (60 out of 100 senators) to invoke cloture and overcome a filibuster. That's why Scott Brown's election to the Senate in Massachusetts was such an important victory for Republicans. It gave Republicans 41 votes, enough to at least threaten a filibuster. When Clinton came into office in 1993, Democrats held the majority in the Senate. But the ratio was not filibuster-proof. Senate records show Republicans held 43 seats when Clinton came into office, and they added another seat in June of that year with the election of Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. That was the Senate breakdown when Clinton nominated Ginsburg on June 14, 1993, when she was confirmed by a 96-3 vote. And it was the same ratio (56 Democrats to 44 Republicans) when Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer the following year (he was confirmed 87-9). That would be as close as Clinton would ever come to a filibuster-proof Senate. In fact, Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate in the 1994 elections and retained control of both houses throughout the remainder of Clinton's presidency. The party split resurfaced later in the interview when Tapper asked Clinton a nearly identical question to one Tapper posed a week earlier to Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who championed the health care reform bill in 1993 and 1994. Both were asked if they felt that because they had "stormed the castle" on health care back in 1993, they had paved the way for for Obama to succeed. Hillary Clinton said she did not feel that way, only that she was delighted it passed and that it was "a long time coming." Bill Clinton said he "absolutely" did feel that way. Clinton said his health plan ultimately failed because, "We couldn't pass it without five or six Republicans. I had an obstacle President Obama didn't have. They had an absolute, clear filibuster number. That is, they had 45 Republican senators. They could have lost four and still defeated me." We note that Democrats at the time were also more fractured on which health care plan to support. But Clinton is right that Republicans opposed his health care bill and clearly held enough seats to attempt a filibuster in the Senate. It never got to that. Still, that is one issue where Clinton had difficulty because he lacked a filibuster-proof majority (whereas Obama did have that advantage, at least for his first year). We find Clinton's statement True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2010-04-18T16:45:56	2010-04-18	['None']
pomt-09042	“I have filed every disclosure that has ever been required.”	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/05/gail-buckner/financial-disclosure-becomes-issue-democratic-race/	The race for the Democratic nomination for Georgia’s next secretary of state has turned downright ugly. A June 27 debate on Georgia Public Broadcasting between the five Democratic candidates seeking the party’s nomination turned into little more than a prime-time mudslinging. The debate was sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. State Sen. Gail Buckner (D-Jonesboro) quickly found herself on the defensive when she was accused of not filing a personal financial disclosure report as required by the state Ethics Commission. Challenger Gary Horlacher alleged Buckner had not filed within the seven days required after she qualified to run for statewide office. Buckner, a 18-year veteran of the state Legislature, shot back that she had. Buckner was in the state House of Representatives 16 years and has served two in the state Senate. “I have filed every disclosure that has ever been required,” she said. So who’s right? Horlacher, a metro Atlanta attorney, said Buckner was required to file a personal financial disclosure report within seven days after she qualified to run for secretary of state. But the only disclosure she filed was back in January, before she qualified to run for statewide office. She qualified to run for secretary of state in April. The state Ethics Commission Web site has this to say about the required filing: “A Personal Financial Disclosure Statement covering the period of the preceding calendar year shall be filed no later than the fifteenth day following the date of qualifying as a candidate. Candidates for statewide office file not later than seven days after qualifying for office. Only one Personal Financial Disclosure Statement is required per calendar year.” That seems clear-cut. But not so much in this case, according to Stacey Kalberman, executive secretary for the Ethics Commission. Kalberman said Buckner filed a “statewide form” earlier this year that effectively covers her subsequent decision to run for secretary of state. That fulfills the Ethics Commission’s requirements, Kalberman said. “She filed a statewide form in January, so she’s good,” Kalberman said. A check of the Ethics Commission’s Web site shows Buckner electronically filed the form on Jan. 8 at 8:04 p.m. It lists everything from Buckner’s salary, to the value of her home and vehicles. Horlacher said he still thinks Buckner has violated the letter and intent of the filing requirement. And he vowed not to drop the issue. “I am down to deciding whether to formally request an advisory opinion from the [Ethics] Commission,” he said. “I think the state might be better off just to get clarification on this so it is not repeated.” But as of now, Buckner appears to have done what is required of her. We give her a rating of True on this one.	None	Gail Buckner	None	None	None	2010-07-05T06:00:00	2010-06-27	['None']

pomt-03250	Says President Barack Obama "has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in," compared to 367 for President George W. Bush at the same point in his presidency.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/12/al-sharpton/al-sharpton-defends-obama-family-vacation-saying-g/	As President Barack Obama begins a vacation on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, social media and blogs are buzzing with details of Obama’s vacations, past and present. Mark Knoller, the CBS News White House correspondent who is considered the authority on tracking the president’s daily activities, recently tweeted that "no presidential numbers I report stir as much reaction and resentment as vacations -- except one: golf." Obama’s vacation plans have attracted heat from some of his critics, who say the cost of moving the president, his family and his Secret Service protection are an extravagance that taxpayers still stung by the weak economic recovery shouldn’t have to pay for. Obama and his family are reportedly staying at a $7.6 million vacation home of Democratic donor David Schulte. The president’s supporters counter that the unique security concerns for the president mean that he and his family can’t simply head out on the road and plop down at a Motel 6. They add that all presidents have to be accessible for consultation and decisionmaking even if they’re on vacation, and that every occupant of the White House, from both parties, has followed essentially the same procedures for vacations. As the Obamas took off for Martha’s Vineyard, one of their defenders was the Rev. Al Sharpton, who hosts a show on MSNBC. On the Aug. 9. 2013, edition of PoliticsNation, Sharpton said, "We all love summer traditions, fireworks, barbecues, the beach. And we’re seeing the return of a right-wing favorite -- attacking the president’s vacation." Sharpton cut to a clip of Fox News’ Sean Hannity saying that Obama "is living a pretty extravagant lifestyle, isn’t he? Martha's Vineyard, big expensive vacations, Hawaii, while 50 million Americans, Dana, are on food stamps." In reality, Sharpton told viewers, Obama "has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in. How many did President (George W.) Bush take by the same point in his presidency? Three hundred and sixty seven. Yes, more than a full year of vacation." We wondered whether Sharpton was right that Obama’s predecessor took many more vacation days than he has. When we asked MSNBC for the source of Sharpton’s data, a spokeswoman pointed to a story in USA Today. The article says, "At the same point in Bush's presidency, the 43rd president had spent 367 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and his parent's compound at Kennebunkport, Maine, according to a count by CBS News reporter Mark Knoller. Obama, who doesn't own a vacation home, has spent a total of 92 days of his presidency on vacation, according to Knoller." Tweets by Knoller himself back that up. On the eve of Obama’s departure for Martha’s Vineyard, Knoller tweeted that "since taking office, Pres Obama has taken 14 vacation trips spanning all or part of 92 days." Knoller also tweeted that "at the same point in office, Pres. GWBush had made 50 visits to this Texas Ranch totaling all or part of 323 days." Another 26 of Bush’s vacation days are accounted for by trips to Kennebunkport, with 18 days on vacation at miscellaneous locations, according to Knoller’s data. Trips to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland are not included in either president’s figures. It’s worth noting that there was a difference in the two presidents’ patterns of vacations. As the USA Today article noted, Obama doesn’t own a vacation home, unlike Bush, who owned his ranch. So while Bush essentially used the ranch as as a working White House, Obama has traveled to a variety of destinations, including his native Hawaii. Because of this, the government may have been able to accrue some per-trip cost savings for Bush by going repeatedly to one location. But since the White House is traditionally tight-lipped about costs and security details for presidential travel, it’s impossible to know how the total cost of Bush’s travel compares to Obama’s. Our ruling Sharpton said that Obama "has taken 92 days of vacation since he was sworn in," compared to 367 for President George W. Bush at the same point in his presidency. While this discrepancy is explained by the fact that Bush often worked from a family home in Texas whereas Obama has no equivalent family retreat, Sharpton has correctly cited data from the leading authority, CBS News’ Mark Knoller. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-10838	English "is our national language...if it becomes official, that means in a place like New York City you can't print ballots in any other language."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/11/hillary-clinton/little-impact-from-making-english-official-/	In arguing that designating English as the country's official language would have pitfalls, Clinton gets it wrong. Twice. Here's her full quote: "The problem is that if it becomes official instead of recognized as national — which indeed it is, it is our national language — if it becomes official, that means in a place like New York City you can't print ballots in any other language. That means you can't have government pay for translators in hospitals so when somebody comes in with some sort of emergency there's nobody there to help translate what their problem is for the doctor. "So many of us — I did, at least — voted to say that English was our national language, but not the official language because of the legal consequences of that." First, she says that English already is the national language of the United States, a move she says she supported with a vote in the Senate. But her vote was on an amendment for the failed immigration bill of 2007. Congress never has declared English our "national" language. Then she goes on to say more, and she gets that wrong, too. Her claim that making English the nation's "official" (different from "national") language would mean state and local governments could no longer use other languages on ballots or pay for translation services in places such as hospitals doesn't hold up. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service has examined this question several times, most recently in January 2007. It concluded that designating English "official" or "national" would have no practical impact. An official designation alone would not cancel government programs, and although several pieces of legislation now pending in Congress would repeal some federal mandates on things such as non-English ballots, none of the bills would go so far as to prohibit governments from helping non-English speakers as Clinton said. A 2000 presidential executive order, signed by Bill Clinton, makes it federal policy that multilingual services are considered to be among the rights guaranteed in federal civil rights law.

pomt-11611	California’s prisons budget in 1970 "was about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion."	true	/california/statements/2018/jan/25/jerry-brown/has-rate-californias-prison-spending-nearly-triple/	Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown reeled off statistics on California’s prison spending during his final State of the State Address after a total of 16 years as governor. Brown, who has followed a federal court order to reduce the state’s prison overcrowding, warned legislators at the state Capitol not to simply pass more crime laws but instead consider a holistic approach to criminal justice. He suggested California has gone too far on prison spending since 1970. "The corrections budget then was about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion," Brown said. Was the governor right? Has California’s prison spending nearly tripled as a share of the state’s general fund budget since 1970? We set out on a fact check. Our research California’s 1970-71 fiscal year budget, produced under then Gov. Ronald Reagan, backs up the first part of Brown’s claim. It lists the corrections department as 2.8 percent, or nearly $40 million, of the state’s $1.4 billion general fund budget that year. California's 1970-71 fiscal year budget. Brown’s 2018-19 budget proposal, meanwhile, also supports the claim. It shows the state expects to spend 9 percent, or nearly $12 billion, of its $132 billion general fund on the corrections department. That’s up about $1 billion from prison spending two years ago. Franklin Zimring, a UC Berkeley criminal justice professor, called Brown’s claim about the increased share of prison spending "absolutely true." "California’s prison population exploded from 1980 through the late 1990s and prison building metastasized in the state," Zimring said. "We went from a little over 24,000 prisoners in California prisons to over 170,000 prisoners in 2010 and 2011." Zimring attributed the increase to the state’s booming population during that period, tough sentencing laws, particularly 1994’s Three Strikes law, and the national focus on drug crimes. Fewer inmates, higher costs California has sharply cut its prison population following a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. The population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year. But as the inmate numbers have dropped, state corrections spending has continued to rise. That’s, in part, because California has the highest per capita inmate cost in the nation, at an estimated $80,000 annually for 2018-19, as we examined in a recent fact check. There’s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate numbers have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. At the same time, prison staffing costs have increased. Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced. "So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed California’s corrections budget in 1970 was "about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion." California’s 1970-71 fiscal year budget supports the first part of Brown’s claim, listing prison system spending as 2.8 percent of that year’s general fund. Brown’s budget proposal for this fiscal year, meanwhile, shows the corrections department is now estimated to be 9 percent of the general fund, or $12 billion. A UC Berkeley criminal justice professor told us the governor’s spending claim rings true, noting the state’s prison population exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, driven by the state’s overall population boom, strict criminal sentencing laws and a national focus on drug crimes. The governor’s numbers are on the mark and there’s nothing significant missing from his statement. We rate Brown’s claim True.

pomt-09834	The Department of Veterans Affairs has "a manual out there telling our veterans stuff like, 'Are you really of value to your community?' You know, encouraging them to commit suicide."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/michael-steele/rnc-chairman-michael-steele-says-va-has-manual-enc/	Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele jumped into the so-called VA "death book" debate, calling it just the kind of thing that makes people nervous about the Democrats' health care reform plan. "If you want an example of bad public policy, just look at the situation with our veterans where you have a manual out there telling our veterans stuff like 'Are you really of value to your community?' You know, encouraging them to commit suicide," Steele said in a Fox News interview on Aug. 25, 2009. "I mean, this is crazy coming from the government. And this is exactly what concerns people and puts them in fear of what government-controlled health care will look like." But like the claim about "death panels" in the health care reform bill, we find this is another ridiculous falsehood about an important end-of-life issue. At issue here is a 10-year-old VA-funded pamphlet on end-of-life issues called "Your Life, Your Choices: Planning for Future Medical Decisions." The pamphlet entered the national discussion on health care after President George W. Bush's director of Faith-Based Initiatives, Jim Towey, wrote an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal on Aug. 18, 2009, in which he took issue with what he called the "hurry-up-and-die message" of the pamphlet. The issue takes on larger import, of course, due to the heated debate over funding for end-of-life counseling included in the Democrats' health care reform bill. In his op-ed piece, Towey zeroed in on an exercise in the manual designed to "help you think about and express what really matters to you." The worksheet poses a number of scenarios and asks users to finish the phrase "Life like this would be..." by checking options that include "difficult, but acceptable," "worth living, but just barely" and "not worth living." While the scenarios include such things as relying on a feeding tube or breathing machine to keep them alive, Towey notes that it also includes circumstances common among the elderly and disabled such as: living in a nursing home, being in a wheelchair and "cannot seem to shake the blues." "There are also guilt-inducing scenarios such as 'I can no longer contribute to my family's well-being,' 'I am a severe financial burden on my family' and that the vet's situation 'causes severe emotional burden for my family,'" Towey wrote. "This hurry-up-and-die message is clear and unconscionable," Towey concluded. Towey also noted that one of the principle authors of the pamphlet, Dr. Robert Pearlman, was among 42 bioethicists who argued in a 1996 case that physician-assisted suicide should be recognized by the courts as a fundamental right. Worse, he said, is that after the Bush administration shelved the pamphlet in 2007 in order to make revisions, the Obama administration revived it in a July 2009 VA directive that "instructs its primary care physicians to raise advance care planning with all VA patients and to refer them to 'Your Life, Your Choices.' Not just those of advanced age and debilitated condition — all patients. America's 24 million veterans deserve better." We should note that Towey, president of St. Vincent College and founder of the nonprofit Aging with Dignity, years ago created his own advance care planning document called "Five Wishes," and he made an unsuccessful pitch to VA officials in 2007 to have the government buy and distribute his pamphlet. In his op-ed, Towey says that unlike the VA's document, his "does not contain the standard bias to withdraw or withhold medical care." In response, the Obama administration's veterans agency issued a fact sheet to the Plum Line's Greg Sargent on Aug. 25 in which they state that the "Your Life, Your Choices" pamphlet, developed by the VA more than 10 years ago, "helps veterans consider the types of health care they would want to receive if they were unable to make decisions for themselves, and encourages them to discuss their views with their loved ones and their health care providers, and, if they so desire, to complete an advance directive." The pamphlet "does not promote limitation of life-sustaining treatment, assisted suicide, or euthanasia," the fact sheet states. However, the VA did acknowledge in November 2007 that although "clear in its presentation," it has been "interpreted by some to be too negative in tone and not sufficiently sensitive to the perspectives of veterans with prolife perspectives and veterans living with lifelong disabling conditions." At that point, the VA officially suspended use of "Your Life, Your Choices" pending review by an expert panel, including input from faith-based groups as well as disability experts. The pamphlet is currently undergoing final revisions before being posted online, which is set for the spring 2010. But the pamphlet is still posted on the VA Web site, albeit with a disclaimer that it is undergoing revisions. And a July 2, 2009, memo on Advance Care Planning and Management of Advance Directives states that when patients request additional information about advance directives, "Patients may be directed to the exercises in 'Your Life, Your Choices' or other published resources." According to the White House fact sheet, the pamphlet is still officially suspended, but is available on the Web site because, "it is the official policy of the Obama administration not to suppress or alter information or products resulting from federal research grants." Whether the pamphlet should continue to be made available pending its revision is a matter for political debate. Here, however, we are focusing on Steele's claim that the manual encourages veterans to commit suicide. After reading the 51-page pamphlet, we conclude unequivocally that it does not. Rather, the pamphlet encourages vets to think about the kind of advanced care they'd like to receive in various situations, to communicate those wishes to loved ones, and to formally put them into writing (including steps on how to prepare a personalized living will). Alongside positions such as "I believe there are some situations in which I would not want treatments to keep me alive" is the position, "My life should be prolonged as long as it can, no matter what its quality, and using any means possible." The pamphlet also respects that some people may have religious beliefs that come into play. One position is described as "I'd want my religious advisers to be consulted about all medical decisions made on my behalf to make sure they are in keeping with my religious teachings." The document begins like this: "There’s only one person who is truly qualified to tell health care providers how you feel about different kinds of health care issues — and that’s you. But, what if you get sick, or injured so severely that you can’t communicate with your doctors or family members? Have you thought about what kinds of medical care you would want? Do your loved ones and health care providers know your wishes? Many people assume that close family members automatically know what they want. But studies have shown that spouses guess wrong over half the time about what kinds of treatment their husbands or wives would want. You can help assure that your wishes will direct future health care decisions through the process of advance care planning." With regard to the issue of suicide, the pamphlet is quite clear: Q: Can I specify that I want assisted suicide in my directive? A: No. Assisted suicide is currently illegal. Advanced care scenarios are upsetting to think about and discuss. And we certainly can see how some might think it's insensitive to disabled or aged veterans to have a pamphlet with an exercise that poses scenarios such as being in a wheelchair or living in a nursing home, and then to even include the option to check a box saying that life like this would be "not worth living." But we think Steele goes way too far and sensationalizes an important issue when he says the pamphlet "encourages (vets) to commit suicide" — particularly when you consider the pamphlet in its entirety. This is a pamphlet intended to encourage vets to make choices about the kind of advanced care they want. And for the record, there is nothing in the manual that tells vets "Are you really of value to your community?" We rule Steele's statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12931	The Russians "tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/11/donald-trump/trump-says-russians-were-unable-hack-republican-na/	After months of discounting Russian involvement in the election, President-elect Donald Trump admitted that Russia was behind the campaign hacks and document leaks. "As far as hacking, I think it was Russia," he said at a Jan. 11 press conference from Trump Tower in New York, his first press conference in several months. Government intelligence agents have concluded that Russia tried to influence the presidential election in a way that favored Trump over Hillary Clinton. A leading reason for this conclusion is that Russian actors tried to access accounts belonging to both Democrats and Republicans through cyber intrusion, but they only widely disseminated significant information stolen from the Democrats. At his press conference, Trump said the Democrats could have done a better job protecting themselves, like the Republicans did. The Russians "tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through," Trump said. Over the past few weeks, there has been some confusion about whether the RNC had been infiltrated in a manner similar to the DNC. So we decided to put Trump’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. In a Kremlin-directed campaign, online con artists stole, then leaked, emails from Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee. The emails ended up being posted on WikiLeaks and other online sources. The leaks caused many headaches for the Clinton campaign and led to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s resignation. It’s clear that Russian hackers did infiltrate some Republicans and affiliated groups. The website DC Leaks published about 200 emails related to Republican Party business, as well as the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN that Russian actors compromised his campaign emails. But the claim that the RNC specifically was not hacked is significant because the organization is the core of the national Republican Party structure. The New York Times reported Dec. 9 that the Russians did hack the RNC’s computer systems. But the Wall Street Journal reported Dec. 16 that the RNC hacking attempt was unsuccessful. Both reports were based on anonymous sources. Two government reports about the Russian election interference — published Dec. 29 and Jan. 6 — don’t provide any clarity. The more extensive Jan. 6 report says only: "Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign." FBI Director James Comey offered the most definitive statements recently, in a Jan. 10 hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He explained that the Russian hackers had accessed state-level Republican organizations and candidates, as well as outdated email domains associated with the RNC, but not the active RNC or the Trump campaign. "There was evidence that there was hacking directed at state level organizations, state level campaigns and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC," Comey said. "That is, email domains that they were no longer using, and the information was harvested from there, but it was old stuff. None of that was released. We did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked." He added that the methods used to attack the RNC and DNC systems were similar. The Russian actors used a technique called phishing, meaning the cyber intruders sent emails designed to trick the recipient into clicking a link and giving over his or her email password. But Comey said the Russian attackers "got far deeper and wider into" the DNC, though he couldn’t say why they didn’t get into the current RNC system. Trump and other Republican leaders say that the hackers were unable to get into the RNC because of the organization’s superior cyber defenses. While this is a plausible claim, we are unable to independently corroborate it. The RNC pointed us to the December Wall Street Journal article mentioned previously, which reported that "intruders failed to get past security defenses on the RNC’s computer networks." Additionally, the cyber intruders were much less aggressive in their attempts to penetrate the RNC than they were in their attacks against the DNC. This article is based on unnamed sources said to be close to the RNC and the intelligence investigation. The DNC, in contrast, did not have the most-advanced programs for detecting suspicious email traffic installed, and the organization was slow to respond to the FBI’s warning that it had been hacked, reported the New York Times, in an article based on interviews with several on-the-record sources. Our ruling Trump said the Russians "tried to hack the Republican National Committee, and they were unable to break through." While Russians were able to get into the email accounts of some Republican individuals and state-level Republican organizations, they did not break into the Republican National Committee’s current system, according to the director of the FBI. Russians did access email domains associated with the RNC that were no longer in use, but the information was outdated and wasn’t released. Additionally, it’s not completely clear why hackers were unable to get into the current RNC. The gist of Trump’s claim is correct, but it’s important to keep in mind that Russian hackers did access some Republican data, including the outdated RNC account. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-04024	Says ending the direct payment farm subsidy program "could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years that could be used to reduce the deficit."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/01/earl-blumenauer/rep-earl-blumenauer-says-cutting-direct-subsidies-/	With Congress’ tendency to sidestep the really difficult questions on spending and deficits, even old statements remain relevant and worthy of examination. That’s what happens when the country is governed in two-month increments. So once again Congress is sweating mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts called "the sequester" unless they are able to intervene between now and March 1. And yes, the matter was supposed to be settled. It remains because Congress enacted only a temporary fix. So for PolitiFact fact checkers everywhere, we express our bemused but sincere thanks for the budgetary gift that keeps on giving. It’s also the reason a statement Rep. Earl Blumenauer made in December is still relevant as Congress looks at ways to avoid $109 billion in automatic spending cuts that begin in March. "This is why I've worked to end the wasteful direct payment farm subsidy program that funnels payments to large corporate agribusinesses. This action could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years that could be used to reduce the deficit," the Oregon Democrat said in a Dec. 21, 2012, news release. That’s a lot of money at a time when Congress is desperate for big numbers. But is the number real? Let’s take a look. Trimming back or totally eliminating farm subsidies is one of the most popular ideas for cutting federal spending. President Barack Obama called for eliminating them in 2011, at a savings of $5 billion a year. Blumenauer has long been one of the most outspoken critics of the payments that provide federal dollars to recipients. The payments pour forth, according to the taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, "regardless of current crop prices, and there’s not even a requirement these crops actually be grown on the land receiving payments." It’s time to change, Blumenauer says, especially now when farm incomes are near record highs and the blunt, inefficient nature of the subsidies qualifies even rich "city slickers" such as investment CEO Charles Schwab for payments. It’s not isolated. Five hundred fifty-one people with Portland addresses collected farm subsidies totaling $2.8 million in 2010, the Environmental Working Group found using federal records. Those recipients are part of an agriculture "safety net" erected in 1996 that, in this case, provides payments to farmers (both genuine and hobby) who raise wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The Congressional Budget Office calculated that ending those subsidies would save $28.4 billion over 10 years. Blumenauer wants that money diverted from what he says are stable and profitable companies to paying down the nation’s $1.1 trillion deficit. The politics are jumbled since legislation that would trim direct payments passed the Senate last year but never came to a vote in the House. But the number is solid. It was generated by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of then-Rep. (and now Sen.) Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who introduced legislation in 2011 to eliminate direct payments to farmers. If you need help breaking the code, direct payments are federal payments made to qualifying producers "paid at a set rate every year regardless of conditions." The merits of the program can be debated and the politics will remain tangled. But just as farmers return to the field every spring and seeds sprout into crops by summer, Blumenauer’s numbers are certain and correct. For that reason, we are this claim: True.

pomt-14462	"For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes (on gambling), somebody loses $6."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/03/charles-van-zant/gamblers-lose-6-every-1-florida-gets-rep-van-zant-/	While the Senate signaled its gambling bills were all but dead this year, they’ve stayed on life support in the House. But one lawmaker wanted his fellow representatives to remember gaming revenues come at a high price. Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, said lawmakers should remember that all gaming revenue is money someone has lost. "Every time you lose a dollar at gaming, there's six more dollars that are lost," Van Zant said during a Feb. 29, 2016, meeting of the House Finance and Tax Committee. "For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6, is another way of saying that." Van Zant was speaking against HB 7109, a wide-ranging gaming bill that in part allowed for the ratification of the contentious gaming compact the Seminole Tribe of Florida negotiated with Gov. Rick Scott in 2015. The bill also included all sorts of provisions for pari-mutuels, licenses and permits, care of racing greyhounds, and more. While the measure passed and was reported favorably to the House, the Senate postponed its own gambling bills March 1. Barring some extraordinary procedural move, the Senate measure is likely tabled for the rest of the session, which ends March 11. That means the new compact likely won’t be ratified. Van Zant opposes gambling in general, so his point of view is that any gambling revenue, whether for the state or a casino or track, is all money taken from people who have placed a bet of some form. We’re not going to focus on his moral objections, but we were curious whether people lose six times what the state gets in taxes from gaming. It turns out that it depends on what kind of gambling you’re talking about. Gambling revenues Van Zant was not specific in the hearing about what form of gambling he meant, but his office referred us to a 2005 report in the National Tax Journal about state and local government taxes on casinos nationwide. "The American Gaming Association (2004) reports that 443 commercial casinos in 11 states generated more than $27 billion in gross gaming revenue in 2003," the report read. "State and local governments derived $4.32 billion in direct gaming taxes from this economic activity, or about 16 percent of gross gaming revenue." That 16 percent rounds to $1 of state revenue for every $6 gamblers spend, Van Zant’s office said. Those numbers are more than a decade old, so we looked up a more current snapshot. The American Gaming Association in 2014 said casino gaming revenues (from gambling, not hotel rooms or drinks or some such) were $67 billion, and casinos paid out $10 billion in state and local taxes. So more recently, the nationwide figure rounds up to almost 7 to 1. But applying that logic to Florida’s gambling environment is difficult, at best. It would have helped if Van Zant had been more specific, because Florida has several forms of gambling. There are cardrooms, where people play poker and other games; pari-mutuels, which are essentially horse and dog racing; slot machines; lotteries; and Indian-owned casinos. The state gets a cut of all these forms of gambling, but the percentage varies depending on the game. For example, cardrooms are taxed at 10 percent. The slot machine tax rate, meanwhile, is 35 percent. There are various fees and permits and other charges involved, too. "I think the national statistic stands on its own merit, but it is problematic to apply it to Florida’s specific tax and revenue-sharing structure related to legal gambling," state economist Amy Baker from the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research told us. "The gaming taxes are all on different bases and aren’t designed to be functionally equivalent." She added the state hadn’t done a comprehensive revenue analysis across all forms of gambling combined, but it wouldn’t be a fast or simple calculation. To even try to make a direct comparison to Van Zant’s stat, we could look at only casino revenue. Seven of Florida’s eight casinos — which share revenue with the state — are owned by the Seminole Tribe. The state’s cut of casino revenue is spelled out in the Tribe’s compact, a business agreement that sovereign Indian tribes must enter into with their home states in order to run casinos on their land. (This is the agreement the Tribe wants the Legislature to renew with some new provisions.) The state is technically not allowed to tax the Tribe, because that’s against federal law. But the compact allows the state to agree with the Tribe to get money via "revenue sharing." Under terms of the compact that expired last year, the Seminoles agreed to share gaming revenues with the state based on tiers: The Tribe would pay 12 percent of net revenue up to $2 billion, 15 percent of revenue between $2 billion and $3 billion, and so on. Some of that revenue was guaranteed, while the rest depends on how well the casinos did in a given year. Calculating net revenue can get pretty complicated, but the shorthand version is that the state said the effective cut those casinos gave the state was 12.24 percent in 2015. That ratio comes out to about 8 to 1 — in effect, people gamble away $8 for every $1 the state gets, using Van Zant’s reasoning. That’s more than the 6 to 1 ratio he cited, but again, that’s just casino dollars. As we’ve noted, other forms of gambling bring in more taxes per dollar, some less. We also should point out that the vast majority of this money is what economists refer to as "cannibalized." That is, it’s money coming from people already in the state who gamble instead of spending that money elsewhere. Our ruling Van Zant said, "For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6." His argument is that the taxes states receive from gaming revenue is money other people have lost while gambling. Van Zant was using nationwide figures from 2005 for the amount of tax money state and local governments received from casinos. That ratio changed to about 7 to 1 by 2014. But that comparison is tough to apply to Florida. The state has more forms of gambling than just casinos, and the state gets money from all of them in different ways and at different rates. If we look at just the terms of how the Seminole Tribe shares its casino revenue, the state gets about $1 for every $8 people spend in casinos. Van Zant’s larger point stands that state tax revenue comes at the expense of comparatively high gambling losses, but the details are fuzzy at best. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-11514	"Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."	false	/florida/statements/2018/feb/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-repeats-false-claim-about-backgroun/	Like many other politicians before him, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., repeated a false claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background checks. "We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole," Sanders said Feb. 18 on NBC’s Meet the Press. "Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks." Three years after we first debunked this statistic, it’s still not true. The statistic comes from a 20-year-old study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an "off-the-books" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, and a Florida gun control advocate earned a False in 2017 after the finding was diminished by new research. The latest research suggests the percentage is almost half of what Sanders cited. The sample size of the 1997 study was very small, with just 251 participants. Furthermore, the statistic stems from survey data that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sales. This is an important point. When the authors of the NIJ study — Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University — adjusted the results to include only the guns sold (not given), the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. That statistic more closely resembles the new findings in a relatively new 2017 study. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That’s about half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, "At last, a good estimate of the magnitude of the private-sale loophole for firearms." In it, he wrote, "Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks." "It appears the number he cited may be outdated," Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "But whether it’s 40 percent or 22 percent of guns being acquired without a background check, millions of Americans still obtain guns without background checks. That's absurd. No one should be allowed to purchase a gun without a vigorous background check." Our ruling Sanders said, "Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks." That statistic is outdated. It stems from a 20-year-old survey that has been overtaken by another study that shows that 22 percent of gun buyers obtained their weapons without background checks. That’s just over half the percentage in the zombie claim Sanders cited. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09396	The health care bill will subsidize families of four that make more than $80,000 a year.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/24/orrin-hatch/hatch-says-families-earning-more-80000-could-get-h/	In the many months of debate over health care reform, we don't recall hearing much about how low your income will have to be to qualify for federal health insurance subsidies. But on March 21, 2010, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah -- who, like all congressional Republicans, voted against the Senate version of the Democratic health care bill -- tackled the issue directly. "Do you realize they're going to subsidize families that make over -- families of four that make over $80,000 a year?" Hatch said in an interview on CNN's State of the Union. That struck us as high, so we decided to see if Hatch was right. First, a word about how the subsidies work in the bill, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The subsidies will take effect in 2014 and are available to Americans who buy insurance on exchanges, which will be virtual marketplaces for health plans. The exchanges are designed to serve people who do not already have insurance through their employer and who are not covered by a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The bill offers two kinds of subsidies to people who buy through the exchange -- one for insurance premiums and one for out-of-pocket medical costs. Under the premium subsidy, the government will pay the difference between the premiums for a designated plan and a set percentage of your income. As for the cost-sharing subsidy, the mechanism is still evolving, but the idea is to reduce the amount that beneficiaries have to shell out for co-pays and other medical expenses. The subsidies will operate on a sliding scale, benefiting those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. At the upper end of the range of those who qualify for premium subsidies -- those earning 300 percent to 400 percent of poverty level -- the government will pay whatever amount of the premium that exceeds 9.5 percent of the beneficiary's income. (Those earning less than 133 percent of the poverty level qualify for Medicaid.) Officially, the federal poverty limit for a family of four is $22,050, and 400 percent of that amount would be $88,200. We checked with several health care experts and they confirmed that that would indeed be the top income at which someone could receive subsidies. That means that many people earning the subsidies will actually earn more than the median income for married couple familes -- $73,010. On the other hand, how big $88,200 is depends on where you live. In four states, $88,200 is actually below the median income for a family of four -- in New Jersey ($94,441), Maryland ($94,017), Connecticut ($93,821) and Massachusetts ($89,347). In each of these states, the cost of living is quite a bit higher than the national average, and in many cases these states have health insurance mandates that boost premiums above the national average. By contrast, $88,200 is well above the median income in Arkansas ($52,185), Mississippi ($52,992) and Hatch's state of Utah ($63,586). The bill does not include any mechanism to even out such geographic variations. Another point: Families making $88,200, wherever they are, will have to spend significantly before they see any federal subsidy kick in. The maximum someone would have to pay for health insurance premiums before subsidies kick in is $8,379 (or 9.5 percent times $88,200). For most people, that's a hefty premium. On average, a worker's share of health care premiums at smaller companies (three to 199 employees) that use an HMO for full-family coverage amounted to $5,039 in 2009, according to the annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust. Still, premiums north of $8,000 are conceivable. Costs would be higher for those seeking insurance on the individual market (if coverage can be found), and the price would likely be higher in more expensive states. In the meantime, premiums could be especially steep for older Americans who are not yet 65 -- the age they can enroll in Medicare. "Those aged 64 can be charged up to three times as much as an 18-year-old for the same coverage," said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "So families that include older adults could face very high premiums relative to their incomes, even at 400 percent of the poverty level, making it unaffordable for such families to purchase coverage without a subsidy." All of this helps explain the rationale for why a family earning $88,200 might need federal assistance. But it doesn't undermine the validity of Hatch's point. Starting in 2014, the health care bill will indeed "subsidize ... families of four that make over $80,000 a year." So we rate Hatch's statement True.

pomt-12738	Says the proposed Texas Privacy Act "is very different from" North Carolina’s law "in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/mar/02/lois-kolkhorst/lois-kolkhorst-says-texas-bathroom-proposal-very-d/	Opponents of a Texas proposal intended to limit residents to public bathrooms matching the sex on their birth certificate hold out fallout in North Carolina as a warning. After Tar Heel State Republicans reached a bathroom law curbing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, economic losses, mostly tied to boycotts, quickly added up to as much as $201 million, PolitiFact North Carolina confirmed in May 2016. Those fact-checkers later found Mostly False a claim that the law hadn’t hurt the economy. Jobs and money were sacrificed, though even hundreds of millions of dollars in losses wouldn’t greatly dent the state’s economy. Texas Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have pooh-poohed economic arguments against the Texas proposal, Senate Bill 6. Patrick otherwise said in a Jan. 11, 2017, Texas Tribune interview: "But let's say there is some economic impact. Are we for sale? Are our values for sale? I don't think so." Patrick and state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, the proposal’s author, maintained at a Feb. 6, 2017, press conference there’s a meaningful difference between what North Carolina adopted and what they seek. Kolkhorst said: "This bill is very different from the North Carolina bill in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not." A month earlier, though, the Texas Association of Business called SB 6 strikingly similar to North Carolina’s HB 2 law. Both "ban transgender people from using public school, university and government building restrooms," TAB said in a press release, "and prohibit municipalities from passing transgender-inclusive public accommodations policies." So, which is it? Kolkhorst’s backup Kolkhorst, asked how she reached her assessment, replied with a statement singling out two elements of North Carolina’s HB 2 missing from SB 6. Specifically, Kolkhorst correctly noted in an email sent by an aide, the Texas proposal has no language affecting worker wages or labor conditions while the North Carolina law does. Also, Kolkhorst said, North Carolina’s law amends the state’s anti-discrimination law to add a bar on discrimination based on a person’s "biological" sex; that section confusingly goes on to say that it doesn’t give anyone the right to sue about violations under state law. Kolkhorst told us this change "prevents local governments from creating a protected class of people other than what the federal law already provides." SB 6, we confirmed, doesn’t have a similar provision. Nearly identical bathroom provisions On the other hand, the bathroom provisions of the Texas legislation and the North Carolina law struck us as similar, both versions preventing public institutions including schools from letting transgender people enter bathrooms of choice. For instance, North Carolina’s law requires local boards of education to "require every multiple-occupancy bathroom or changing facility that is designated for student use to be designated for and used only by students based on their biological sex." Similarly, the Texas legislation directs each school district to adopt a policy "requiring each multiple-occupancy bathroom or changing facility accessible to students that is located in a school or school facility to be designated for and used only by persons based on the person’s biological sex." Also, the North Carolina law and the Texas proposal each says schools aren’t restricted from providing, on request "due to special circumstances," an accommodation including a single-occupancy bathroom or changing facility or the "controlled use" of a faculty bathroom or changing facility. Equality Texas notes other differences We also asked Equality Texas, a group that says it advocates for "full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Texans," about Kolkhorst’s claim. By email, spokeswoman DeAnne Cuellar provided a spreadsheet showing a provision-by-provision comparison of the two states’ measure. Cuellar noted that both measures apply to public agencies and schools. "The only difference in application is that under SB 6," Cuellar wrote, "a private entity leasing a publicly owned facility (like a stadium) can set its own bathroom and changing room policies while it is occupying the building." We confirmed that contrast. Kolkhorst’s proposal, unlike HB 2, says a private entity renting a public building isn’t subject to the bathroom limit. The Texas proposal states that a state agency or political subdivision may not "require or prohibit" a private entity that leases or contracts to use a building owned or leased by the state or a political subdivision from adopting a policy on the "designation or use of bathroom or changing facilities" in the building. Cuellar suggested another notable distinction, saying the North Carolina law broadly nullifies "LGBT-inclusive municipal nondiscrimination ordinances," while SB 6 limits its restriction to local ordinances that allow transgender residents to enter bathrooms of choice. We confirmed North Carolina’s law contains that all-inclusive restriction: "The General Assembly declares that the regulation of discriminatory practices in places of public accommodation is properly an issue of general, statewide concern," the law says, so the bathroom directives and "other applicable provisions of the General Statutes supersede and preempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a unit of local government or other political subdivision of the state that regulates or imposes any requirement pertaining to the regulation of discriminatory practices in places of public accommodation." Kolkhorst’s proposal is explicit by barring political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing a measure relating to a private entity designating a bathroom or changing facility for particular persons--or not. Cuellar further told us that SB 6 -- unlike North Carolina’s law, which lacks enforcement provisions -- sets fines that could be levied for violations of the bathrooms mandate. The Texas legislation, we confirmed, says political subdivisions including school districts that violate the law are liable for a per-day fine of $1,000 to $1,500 for the first violation and $10,000 to $10,500 for the second and subsequent violations. On citizen complaint, the proposal says, the state attorney general may sue for payment. Our ruling Kolkhorst said her proposed Texas Privacy Act "is very different from" North Carolina’s law "in that theirs covers a whole list of things that the Texas Privacy Act does not." Both the North Carolina law and the Texas bill mandate policies preventing state and local government entities including public schools from letting transgender residents enter bathrooms of choice. But the Texas proposal lacks North Carolina’s section on wages and it doesn’t have North Carolina’s language barring anyone from going to state court to allege discrimination due to the law. Also unlike HB 2, SB 6 doesn’t unplug all local ordinances pertaining to discriminatory practices in public accommodation. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01780	Brookhaven homeowners pay hundreds of dollars less in property taxes compared with owners of the same-value homes in unincorporated DeKalb County.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/28/city-brookhaven/claim-exaggerates-tax-savings/	When Brookhaven became Georgia’s newest city in December 2012, supporters promised a local government closer to residents and their needs. Last month, leaders of the city of 50,000 mailed out a flier to every property owner in the north-central DeKalb County city, touting the "facts" about property taxes there. Two pie charts in the flier show details such as how the city uses its tax collections. But even more specific was a chart listing the hundreds of dollars city homeowners would save on their tax bills compared with their counterparts in unincorporated DeKalb. The chart shows owners of a home worth $200,000 save $260.84 vs. the same home in the county. For a home worth $500,000, the savings are $631.28, according to the chart. Claims of similar tax savings began when Sandy Springs became Georgia’s seventh-largest city overnight in 2005. Brookhaven backers promised in meetings a new city would mean lower taxes and better services. Opponents, meanwhile, have claimed the new cities overstate revenue in their budgets and therefore need to either cull services or raise taxes. Such broad battles are out of our purview for a single fact check. But PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d take the specific tax bill for a ride on the Truth-O-Meter to get at the general idea of whether cities can mean lower tax bills. Brookhaven Mayor J. Max Davis said the city mailed the fliers to address internal division in the city, which was created with 55 percent of the vote. The city had planned to maintain its municipal rate of 2.85 mills for the second year. Several vocal residents, though, correctly argued that the city was effectively raising taxes by not adopting the rollback rate of 2.569 mills. (Adopting the rollback rate ensures governments will raise the same amount of money through taxes, regardless of property values, each year. Even maintaining the same rate can mean higher taxes if an individual’s home value increases). Davis said leaders felt the rollback rate would be premature for the young city. The Brookhaven City Council finally adopted a rate of 2.795 mills in late June. "Our main impetus behind the flier was to educate residents that we were not raising taxes, that they still save money from being in the city," Davis said. Brookhaven property owners with a homestead exemption qualify for the city’s assessment freeze, which will hold the value steady on the city portion of taxes. But that doesn’t address the more complex issue of county taxes. And that picture is plenty complicated in DeKalb, one of only two counties in the state where voters have approved the homestead option sales tax, or HOST, to offset property taxes. As long as buying is up, and values don’t explode, DeKalb then has the cash from sales tax revenue to offset about half of the county millage rate, which remains 21.21 in the unincorporated county. This year, the HOST credit will reduce county taxes on a home by about 58 percent. The chart that appeared in Brookhaven’s flier came from internal working documents, which estimated the HOST credit would be about 45 percent. The higher HOST credit means much lower county taxes. That disproportionately benefits homeowners in unincorporated DeKalb, who get the credit on a bigger part of their tax bill since they do not pay city taxes. That closes the gap between the tax bill for the same-value home in the city and county. But Brookhaven’s chart is also missing the 1.67 mill tax that residents of unincorporated DeKalb pay to cover the debt of new parks and libraries. Brookhaven residents must still pay that debt, since they were part of unincorporated DeKalb when the money was borrowed. Brookhaven’s finance director, Bonnie Kline, acknowledges missing the park/library debt in her calculations. Adding that cost – which does not qualify for any HOST credit – further narrows the gap between homes in the city and county. Based on millage rates alone, a homeowner with property valued at $200,000 in Brookhaven would save $58.52, assuming both a frozen assessment and homestead exemption. The tax bill for a home worth $500,000 would be $110.93 lower. Add in the fact that Brookhaven residents pay $12 more in stormwater fees than those in unincorporated DeKalb, and the final savings is less than $50 and $100, respectively, DeKalb Deputy Tax Commissioner Robert Goodman said. "On the face of it, to say your property tax bill will be lower in Brookhaven is correct, but not nearly by the amounts stated," Goodman said. Brookhaven claimed very specific savings, to the tune of hundreds of dollars, to residents on their tax bills in a recent flier. The premise of savings is accurate, but the numbers are off significantly. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Brookhaven	None	None	None	2014-07-28T00:00:00	2014-07-21	['None']
pomt-06673	"Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/09/we-are-ohio/we-are-ohio-ad-says-issue-2-would-bar-negotiations/	The first TV commercial about the Issue 2 ballot war recently hit the airwaves. It features a firefighter talking about how his job will be more dangerous if the issue passes. Issue 2 is the voter referendum on Senate Bill 5, the Republican-backed law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio’s public unions. If voters reject the issue on Nov. 8, SB 5 is overturned and will not take effect. If Issue 2 passes, the law takes effect after the election and will be applied as current collective bargaining agreements expire. Although the 30-second commercial focuses on firefighters, SB 5 would affect about 360,000 public workers from teachers to prison guards to municipal workers. The commercial shows a burning house and firefighters suiting up to respond. Ohio firefighter Doug Stern, as he is identified in the commercial, urges voters to vote against Issue 2 because it will endanger firefighters and the neighborhoods they are responsible for protecting. "Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job," Stern says. Issue 2 is expected to be the most high-profile race on the fall ballot. Accusations of misinforming the public have flown from both sides since the law was introduced earlier this year. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the central claim of the first commercial in what will be an ongoing effort to keep both sides honest. SB 5 is a complete overhaul of Ohio’s collective bargaining law, which originally passed in 1983. A spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, an anti-Issue 2 political action committee that produced the commercial, pointed us to a provision in SB 5 that she said verified the ad’s claim. The law sets new rules for what topics cannot be negotiated and specifies other topics that are negotiable only if management agrees to do so. Overall, these new rules give management significantly more power at the bargaining table. Melissa Fazekas, a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, said the number of firefighters on the job is among the topics that cannot be negotiated under SB 5. Specifically, the law amends a portion of Sec. 4117.08 of the Ohio Revised Code to say "the number of employees required to be on duty or employed in any department, division or facility of a public employer" is a subject "not appropriate" for collective bargaining. Other topics prohibited from negotiations under this section of the law include pension pickups – the practice of employers paying a share of workers’ pension contributions – and health care benefits. But supporters of Issue 2 and SB 5 insist that workers will be able to negotiate staffing as long as management agrees to do so. Jason Mauk, spokesman for the pro-Issue 2 group Building a Better Ohio, pointed us to other language in a different part of that same section that he says allows management to initiate talks on staffing. The law lists "the number of persons required to be employed or laid off" under topics that can be negotiated at management’s discretion. "Nothing says that employees cannot discuss staffing levels with employers," Mauk said. The two sides of this argument are an example of how confusing SB 5 can be. We have two similar topics that are treated differently under the law. One provision – "the number of employees required to be on duty" – is among topics prohibited from collective bargaining. The other – "the number of persons required to be employed" – can be discussed at management’s discretion. The key difference between the two is the phrase "on duty", said Mark Sanders, president of the Ohio Association of Professional Fire Fighters. Any negotiations related to the latter provision would only ensure, for example, that a city has a certain number of firefighters on the payroll, Sanders said. It would not cover the number of firefighters required to be on a fire engine, he said. The distinction between the two provisions, however, would be moot if management unilaterally decides it doesn’t want to discuss staffing at all. And Mauk said the bill is designed to give management, such as police chiefs and fire chiefs, the authority to decide staffing levels. Mauk said that is the way it is done in the private sector. Supporters of SB 5 like Mauk say Issue 2 is needed so mayors and others in management positions can cope with tightening budgets without cutting services or laying off workers. A key tenet of PolitiFact is that words matter. In this case, the words used in the statement were that "Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job." We think the natural reading of "enough firefighters to do the job" is how many would be needed to fight a fire -- or on duty. Scenes in We Are Ohio’s ad show firefighters responding to a call, buttressing that notion. There is language in SB 5 that could allow negotiations on overall staffing levels -- a point of clarification -- but only if management allows the topic to be part of negotiations. And there is a clear prohibition against negotiating the number of workers "on duty." On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate, but needs clarification rates Mostly True.

pomt-15174	Says Donald Trump "was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/24/jeb-bush/bush-says-trump-was-democrat-longer-republican-las/	After losing ground to Donald Trump in the polls following the first GOP presidential debate, Jeb Bush has gone on the attack, questioning the real estate mogul’s Republican bona fides. "Mr. Trump doesn't have a proven conservative record," Bush said at a town hall in Merrimack, N.H., on Aug. 19, 2015. "He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican." Bush also said Trump has given more money to Democrats than he has given to Republicans, a claim we’ve previously rated Mostly False. Bush tweeted video of the town hall the same night, calling Trump "a tax-hiking Democrat." In his defense, Trump said on Face The Nation on Aug. 23 that living in Manhattan for years affected his alignment. "I was from an area that was all Democrat," Trump said. "And, frankly, over the years, I have — and especially as I have gotten more and more involved — I have evolved." We know Trump has changed his political affiliation several times over the years, but we wanted to figure out just when and how the billionaire liked to party. Choosing sides Trump has regularly said that he has a broad range of political positions. "I identify with some things as a Democrat," he told MSNBC in July. He had told CNN the same thing back in 2004. He’s also expressed interest in running as a third-party candidate. According to the New York City Board of Elections, Trump has changed his party affiliation five times since registering as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987. A form that year notes he had previously been registered in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, where he grew up, but his prior affiliation was not identified. Trump’s affiliations have gone back and forth since then. Here’s a quick look: Month and year of registration Party affiliation July 1987 Republican October 1999 Independence Party August 2001 Democrat September 2009 Republican December 2011 No party affiliation (independent) April 2012 Republican We don’t need to go back as far as 1987 for this check, of course, but it shows Trump has switched quite a bit. After 12 years as a Republican, he registered with the Independence Party in 1999. That moved Trump to New York’s version of the Reform Party, which is neither Democratic nor Republican. He even won the Reform Party’s California primary for president in March 2000, despite withdrawing from that contest. Bush’s campaign told us that "the last decade" meant when Trump was registered from 2000 to 2010. Trump was registered as a Democrat for 8 years, 1 month in that time span. But we think a reasonable person could mistake "the last decade" to mean the last 10 years. When we added up the years since 2005, we found Trump has been registered as a Democrat for 3 years, 9 months, and registered as Republican for 5 years, 6 months (and counting). Media reports said Trump’s switch in December 2011, where he checked "I do not wish to enroll in a party," made him an independent voter before the 2012 presidential election, in which he considered running himself. His attorney Michael Cohen told Politico that Trump made the change "in order to preserve his right to run as an independent if he is (not pleased) with the GOP nominee." Trump decided not to run that year. He switched back to Republican in April 2012. One last note: Party affiliation in New York matters for who a person can vote for in a primary contest, because New York has a closed primary, just like Florida. If someone wants to vote in a primary, they must be registered to that party. But according to a partial voting record from New York state, Trump hasn’t cast a ballot in at least the last two presidential primaries. Our ruling Bush said Trump "was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican." The Bush campaign said he meant 2000 to 2010, during which Trump was a Democrat for a bit over nine years. Trump had largely been a Republican in the years prior to that. If that’s what Bush meant, he phrased his statement poorly. When we reviewed Trump’s voter registration in the 10 years leading up to the present, from 2005 to 2015, we found that he has been a Republican for more than five years. He was a registered Democrat for not quite four years in that time frame. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04064	The Milwaukee County Board’s staff grew from four workers to 38 over four decades and now costs taxpayers "a lot more," while the total county workforce was more than cut in half in the same period.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/24/chris-abele/county-executive-chris-abele-says-milwaukee-county/	Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele is blunt about one of the reasons he backs state legislation to drastically cut the pay and office budget of the county’s legislative branch. Supervisors elected to the County Board, says Abele, have much less to do than in county government’s heyday, but the board’s budget has ballooned. "In the ‘70s the county had about 11,000 employees," Abele said in a Jan. 18, 2013 interview on WTMJ radio (620 AM). "A lot of big functions have been moved from the county. Now we have 4,400 employees." In the 1970s, Abele continued, elected supervisors were part-time and the total County Board staff numbered three or four -- a couple committee clerks and a secretary. Now the staff totals 38 and supervisors’ pay is full-time. Abele concluded by claiming that supervisors "have a lot less to do and we are paying a lot more," and he offered the opinion that "government worked pretty well; you didn’t have a pension scandal back then." The state legislation to cut Milwaukee County supervisors’ pay by 70 percent (to $15,000) and the County Board budget by 85 percent is still in draft form. County Board defenders say it will gut the legislative branch and throw checks-and-balances to the wind. State lawmakers could take the measure up soon and Milwaukee County voters might be asked in a spring 2013 referendum to approve the salary cut. Let’s take a look at Abele’s assertion that the County Board staff has gone from "three or four" to 38 in four decades, and costs taxpayers "a lot more" even though the total county workforce is less than half its former size (11,000 to 4,400). Of course, we are not fact checking Abele’s opinion that things worked better in the old days. Nor are we checking in this item his assertion that supervisors are less busy today. County workforce Abele’s numbers on the overall county workforce are on target. County government employed 11,340 in 1975, compared to something between 4,000 and 4,600 today depending on how you count heads, according to county budget books and other documents we examined. The most recent payroll showed 4,397, according to the county’s human resources department. Since the 1970s, the county has sold Doyne Hospital, contracted out the bus system, sold off a power plant, stopped operating a baseball park, partially privatized the Milwaukee Public Museum and outsourced numerous services previously performed by county employees. The state took over the county’s child welfare, food aid and child care programs. The parks system alone has shed hundreds of workers. County Board staff Did the board have just three or four staff members at some point in the ‘70s, compared to 38 today (not counting the elected officials)? Close. In 1970, the board’s budget listed five staffers (typist, administrator, board secretary, researcher and fiscal analyst). But for an accurate comparison to the set-up today, you have to throw in three committee clerks who in 1970 were housed in the County Clerk’s office. Today they are under the County Board budget. So that’s a total of eight back then. Today, the board has 38 staff positions. Abele would have been slightly better off citing the 1960s instead of the 1970s as a reference point. By 1973, the board’s non-elected staff had jumped up to 21, and by 1975 it was 24. So for much of the decade, the staffing was closer to today’s levels. What’s changed? There are actually fewer elected supervisors now (18 today vs. 25 then) and they earn less in inflation-adjusted dollars compared to their 1970 counterparts. (The actual unadjusted salaries: $11,500 in 1970 vs. $50,679 now). But today, each lawmaker has a legislative aide to handle constituent calls and perform other tasks. Also, the board’s research staff has grown considerably, as has the number of general support staff. The board also has hired people to publicize its work and more formally communicate with the public. And it has its own staff to lobby other units of government on county issues. County Board budget Speaking broadly about the County Board budget, Abele said it costs taxpayers "a lot more" now than in 1970. Over a 40-year span, a big increase in raw numbers is hardly surprising. It went from $535,000 then to $6.6 million today. So, it’s more instructive to measure the change in inflation-adjusted dollars. When we ran those numbers, we found the County Board budget increase was more than double the inflation rate. By contrast, the overall county operating budget grew at slightly below the inflation rate for the period. Budgets are proposed by the County Executive and his department heads, then adopted with changes by the County Board. The system dates to 1960, when John Doyne became the first elected county executive. Our rating Abele said the County Board’s staff grew from three or four workers to 38 since the 1970s, and now costs taxpayers "a lot more," while the total county workforce was more than cut in half in the same period. He slightly overstates the growth in Board staff, and the time frame needs some clarification, but it’s accurate to say the County Board staff has grown notably since the early 1970s. And even in inflation-adjusted dollars, the board costs a lot more today than in 1970, from a budget standpoint, even though there are fewer elected supervisors. We rate Abele’s statement Mostly True.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2013-01-24T09:00:00	2013-01-18	['None']
pomt-05694	Says 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state "is heading in the right direction" and a majority say they will "grow their companies in 2012."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/11/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-94-percent-wisconsin-employe/	Democrats behind a recall of Gov. Scott Walker consistently mock the lack of progress on his promise to spur 250,000 new jobs in four years. In response, Walker emphasizes the falling unemployment rate and what he says is new optimism among business owners -- "job creators" in the current GOP parlance. As part of his case that things are trending well, Walker almost invariably says private businesses are nearly unanimous in their good feelings about the Walker era. "Looking ahead, we went from two years ago when 10 percent of our employers in the state thought we were heading in the right direction, to now, this year, 94 percent think we’re heading in the right direction – and a majority of them are going to grow their companies in 2012," Walker said in a Feb, 25, 2012 interview with Politico . He made that claim, almost word for word, in his Jan. 25, 2012 "state of the state" speech, saying "94 percent of our job creators believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction." That 94 percent is a big number, especially when you consider there are some 160,000 business establishments in the state. Is Walker right about such overwhelming support among state employers? And are more than half planning growth in 2012? Asked for backup for the two-part claim, Walker pointed to a December 2011 online member survey by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce of 281 chief executives. The powerful statewide trade organization backed Walker in 2010. In the WMC survey, 94 percent of the respondents said they "think things are going in the right direction" in Wisconsin. (Even more gave Walker positive marks as governor, which WMC officials said made sense given the success Walker had in enacting business tax cuts, regulatory reform and limits on liability lawsuits over the fierce objections of Democrats. By contrast, in a June 2010 WMC survey when Democrat Jim Doyle was governor, just 10 percent of respondents to the WMC survey said the state was on the right track. On the second part of the claim, a slim majority of CEOs -- 52 percent -- said their companies will see growth in the first half of 2012. That was down from a June 2011 WMC survey that found that 60 percent of CEO respondents predicted growth. When you reach back to the survey in Doyle’s last year, 55 percent saw growth ahead. So, Walker is right on the numbers. But what do they represent and how accurate are they? The survey was made available online to 1,167 CEOs, and WMC got responses from 24 percent -- 281 executives. That’s an acceptable response rate for such a survey, said David Wegge, a survey expert and political scientist at St. Norbert College. But Wegge said it’s not valid, from this kind of survey, to make a generalization about what businesses statewide think, because we don’t know the view of those who didn’t choose to join the group. It’s OK, he said, to draw conclusions about the WMC members’ views -- if the survey respondents are representative of WMC’s membership. The other critical question: Is WMC’s membership representative of the state’s employers as a whole? Let’s take a look. We compared the survey pool to a breakdown of Wisconsin’s business establishments by sector, based on data from the state Department of Workforce Development. The survey was heavy on manufacturers, followed by service providers -- pretty closely mirroring WMC’s membership, we found. But the survey respondents over-represented larger employers when compared with the group’s membership. Meanwhile, the survey respondents don’t match up well with Wisconsin’s statewide business profile. While a majority of survey respondents were manufacturing executives, manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses. WMC represents some small businesses, but half its 3,500 members have more than 50 employees. A much larger trade group, the National Federation of Independent Business, has 12,000 members, most of whom have fewer than 20 workers, including many mom-and-pop shops. NFIB has not surveyed its members. State director Bill Smith said the would expect his members would be as enthusiastic as WMC’s about the state’s direction, but there is no concrete evidence of that. The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, another trade group, conducts similar membership surveys. Bret Mayborne, research director for the association, said such polls are not scientifically rigorous but provide insight into trends over time. Our rating Walker says 94 percent of Wisconsin employers believe the state’s headed the right direction – and a majority of them say they are going to grow their companies in 2012. The numbers are correct, but they come from a small survey by one trade group and amount to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. Walker, however, presents it without noting the critical limitations. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-03-11T09:00:00	2012-02-25	['Wisconsin']

pomt-07417	"As far as standing committees, we have 10 fewer standing committees. So we’ve saved the state about a quarter-of-a-million dollars through the reduction of the standing committees."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/27/cheryl-grossman/state-rep-cheryl-grossman-says-gop-cuts-standing-c/	Republicans, who control the Ohio House, called a news conference April 12 to pat themselves on the back for the work they had done the first 100 days of their two year stretch in the 129th General Assembly. The group, led by Speaker William G. Batchelder, is quite proud of some of its early accomplishments. A particular claim that state Rep. Cheryl Grossman, a Republican from Grove City near Columbus, made when it was her turn at the podium resonated most with Politifact Ohio. "As far as standing committees, we have 10 fewer standing committees. So we’ve saved the state about a quarter-of-a-million dollars ($250,000) through the reduction of the standing committees." said Grossman, a former Grove City mayor. At a time when Ohio’s economy is still struggling to recover from a devastating national recession in recent years which helped blow an $8 billion deficit in the state’s budget, any amount of savings is a good thing. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Grossman’s figures. We called the House Republican caucus (basically, Batchelder’s office) for an explanation and information to back up Grossman’s comments. The caucus said it verified its numbers through the House clerk’s office, which is considered independent but is run by a Republican appointed by Batchelder. (The speaker always gets to appoint the clerk and usually it is someone from the same political party.) To start with, Batchelder eliminated 10 standing committees that existed during the 128th General Assembly under House Speaker Armond Budish, a Democrat. That dropped the number of standing committees from 27 to 17. Above their standard annual pay, stipends are paid to leaders of the each committee: $6,500 for the chairman and $5,000 each to the vice-chairman and ranking minority member for a total of $16,500 in extra pay each year per committee. Multiply that by 10, the number of committees eliminated, and you come away with $165,000 in annual savings. Grossman didn’t say it, but can we give her the benefit of the doubt? She meant in each year of the biennium considering lawmakers salaries are paid on an annual schedule. So, that $165,000 over two years becomes $330,000 in savings, and that is not including the additional cost for benefits for lawmakers who receive the stipends. But Batchelder did add three new standing sub-committees that did not exist under Budish in the previous two years. The sub-committee chair gets $5,000 and ranking minority member $2,500 (there is no vice chairman for these committees) totaling $7,500 per subcommittee. By adding three sub-committees Batchelder created a new line of expense totaling $22,000 a year in extra pay for lawmakers, not including benefits. Subtract that from the savings generated from the elimination of sub-committees and House Republicans still save the state about $286,000. But hold on. While state representatives can serve in a leadership role on more than one committee they can only be paid one stipend. There were seven Democrats who pulled double duty under Budish, meaning they served as a chair or vice chair on more than one committee, but they were only paid one stipend, says House minority caucus spokesman Keary McCarthy. Michael Dittoe, a spokesman for House majority caucus, provided the math in an e-mail. The savings on stipend payments, when the unused stipends are removed, amounts to $217,000, he said. Adding in savings from retirement costs and administrative costs that aren't incurred raises that about 17 percent to just under $254,000. So it seems Grossman was right on the money as far as the dollars and cents in her claim. But wait, there’s more. Grossman says the House Republicans are "saving" the state money. That’s an attractive claim in the middle of budget season. Gov. John Kasich last month proposed a $55 billion, two year spending proposal that closes the deficit. The House is currently reviewing the proposal. According to an analysis of the House of Representatives budget proposal, Batchelder’s leadership team is requesting the same appropriation in each of the next two years as the House is spending in the current year, just shy of $20 million per year. "I’m not sure how one can claim savings when they are spending the exact same amount," said the Democrats McCarthy. Politifact Ohio followed up with Dittoe. Preparing the House budget request involved use of cost projections made prior to the new General Assembly being sworn into office. Those projections anticipate increased costs, particularly for health care benefits, that prompted the House to recommend a spending plan that could cover some "worst case scenarios," he said in an e-mail. He notes, though, that while the projections suggest healthcare costs could rise nearly $500,000 for just the members of the General Assembly, the requested budget was flat. The hope is that cuts elsewhere will cover those increases, if they come to pass. And, he added, that the exact funding level for the House won't be known until the budget is passed. So where does that leave us? There is an element of truth in Grossman’s claim: there are 10 fewer standing committees and the amount paid for leadership stipends will be less. But the bigger point she made that day while standing before a throng of media, including television cameras, was that Republicans are saving Ohio $250,000. Where’s the savings? Republicans may have cut spending in one area -- committee costs -- but the budget request for House operations is at the same level, which means that money was redirected to be spent elsewhere. And Dittoe cited one area in particular - health costs. That’s a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression of Grossman’s claim -- that characterizing the committee changes as a savings to the state of Ohio is misleading. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Grossman’s statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Cheryl Grossman	None	None	None	2011-04-27T06:00:00	2011-04-12	['None']

pomt-01032	Only "18 percent of jobs are accessible by transit for metro Atlanta residents. 33 percent for those living in the city."	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/28/keith-parker/marta-official-correct-about-commuters-limited-opt/	One day before a pedestrian death last Thursday triggered a massive traffic jam that made thousands of Atlanta workers late for work, the head of MARTA posted a provocative Tweet. MARTA General Manager Keith Parker wrote, "18 percent of jobs are accessible by transit for metro Atlanta residents, 33 percent for those living in the city." The statement came with the hashtag OpportunityATL, days after yet another major business, Mercedes-Benz USA, announced a corporate relocation that puts it next to both highways and MARTA rail. Is there something to the claim that stretches beyond the miles of snarled traffic on four highways last week? We decided to check it out. First, as the hashtag indicates, the statement did not come out of the ether. Parker posted the figures as he live-Tweeted presentations at a forum sponsored by the Atlanta Regional Commission and St. Vincent de Paul Society. Author Rebecca Burns was the keynote at the Building Opportunity event focused on poverty and transportation. She cited The Brookings Institution for those statistics on a slide during her presentation. To find out if those stats are accurate, we reached out to Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program. That’s the unit that conducts research for cities and their surrounding suburbs and exurbs. A 2011 report, "Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America," found that the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta metro area was among the worst in the nation for residents trying to reach work via transit. The study, the most recent available, looked at how many people can reach work in 90 minutes between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. on a Monday morning. Typical residents in the nation’s largest 100 metro areas can reach about 30 percent of jobs by transit in 90 minutes, the study found. In Atlanta, the transit systems studied included MARTA, Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) and regional bus services in Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Yet workers here can reach just 22 percent of jobs that way. That ranked Atlanta 91st out of the 100 largest metro areas studied. The numbers are, as Parker’s Tweet suggested, even worse for the region’s suburbanites. The study found that 33 percent of the region’s jobs are accessible for city residents by public transportation and just 17 percent for suburbanites. "In some ways, it’s not surprising, given the age the cities developed in," said Adie Tomer, a research fellow at Brookings who co-authored the study. "Atlanta was really built in the era of the car, and so it’s built out in a suburban style." So the numbers are pretty on target and somewhat expected. More than the exact numbers, though, is the overarching point. Tomer said cities with more transit access are effectively providing more options for workers. They can drive to work, ride a train, ride a bike, or even walk. Meanwhile, the traffic jam last week showed the "virus" effect a back-up can have on highways as well as surface streets when those options are limited. That ripple effect is prompting more suburban counties to gear up for serious talks about transportation options and has even put "public transit" in the mix of the state Legislature’s debate this year about transportation improvements. The challenges are clear. An exclusive Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll recently found that almost 70 percent of Georgians support new bus and rail lines. But only 36 percent said they’d pay higher taxes to pay for transportation improvements. Yet the benefits are just as clear. Mercedes-Benz USA’s CEO recently cited easy access for workers as a factor in its planned to move to Sandy Springs – suburban but adjacent to rail lines. Other major firms, from State Farm to PulteGroup, have made similar statements about their relocations. MARTA and other public transit projects have likewise had a run of good headlines. Clayton County residents voted in November for their county become the third to join MARTA – the first in 40 years. The Atlanta Streetcar's launch in December, the first expansion of a new rail line in years, drew attention nationally. To that end, Parker said he posted that Tweet because the statistics startled him. Looking at them another way, at least six out of every 10 metro workers lacks access by public transportation to jobs. Like Tomer, Parker hopes the existing collaboration between MARTA and bus lines in outlying counties will be seen by policy makers as an option - one to further investigate and expand. "We want people to look at us as a real alternative to get them to work, to school, to recreation," Parker said. "You can know with a sense of certainty that 95 percent of the time we are on time with train service. I dare say we don’t have that level of certainty on the highway system right now. We want people to see this is a viable option." So as state and local leaders hash out ideas to discuss those options, can they count on the statistics reflecting workers’ access to jobs by public transit today? Parker posted a Tweet from a forum, claiming 33 percent of people in the city and 18 percent elsewhere have that access. An independent analysis confirmed the point, if not the precise number for suburbanites. We rate the claim True.	None	Keith Parker	None	None	None	2015-01-28T00:00:00	2015-01-21	['Atlanta']
pomt-13586	Says military commanders have said that if Donald Trump were elected, "they would not follow his orders."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/17/joe-biden/joe-biden-rips-donald-trump-over-commanders-fears-/	During a joint speech with Hillary Clinton in his ancestral home of Scranton, Pa., Vice President Joe Biden riffed on the ways he sees Donald Trump as being unfit for the presidency. One of the things that Biden said troubled him among Trump’s past comments is his suggestion that the United States may need to utilize "torture." Biden said that Trump has floated the use of torture "when he knows it's illegal, and says he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders. When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders?" Biden has a point that Trump has advocated loosening laws on torture, including -- but not limited to -- waterboarding. Just one example: Trump said on CBS’s Face the Nation that the United States needs to "strengthen the laws so that we can better compete" with the brutal tactics of ISIS, and he dismissed the idea that allowing torture would be stooping to ISIS' level. "We have to play the game the way they're playing the game," Trump said. "You're not going to win if we're soft." In addition, Trump has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a policy that, as we have written before, would violate the Geneva Conventions. However, Biden’s remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by Trump. That’s an overstatement, although one that contains some degree of truth. Let’s take a closer look. Who has said what about Trump so far? We could find no evidence -- and Biden’s staff couldn’t point to any -- showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a President Trump. Typically, military officers do not comment on political matters while on active duty, in order to stay within the strictures of Defense Department Directive 1344.10. Senior national security retirees, though, are another story. Biden’s staff pointed to comments made in February by former CIA director Michael Hayden on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. When Maher brought up Trump's idea of killing family members of terrorists, Hayden said, "If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act." Maher responded, "What? Well, that’s quite a statement, sir." In the meantime, 50 senior Republican national security officials signed a letter on Aug. 8, 2016, arguing that Trump "lacks the character, values and experience" to be president and "would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being." The letter did not explicitly say that the signers would personally refuse, or encourage active commanders to refuse, an illegal order from Trump. But the letter represented a sharp rebuke to Trump’s fitness for office by members of his party’s national security establishment. We should point out that Trump does have some senior military retirees on his side as well, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael T. Flynn, decorated Army Maj. Gen. Bert Mizusawa, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Mark Bircher, retired four star Air Force Gen. Robert Oaks, and retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely. Bottom line: In his Scranton comments, Biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said "they would not follow" illegal orders from Trump. There’s no evidence of that. What does the law say? That said, Biden’s overstatement is somewhat moot -- because whether or not military commanders have publicly said in advance that they would refuse illegal orders, there’s solid legal precedent that they should refuse an illegal order if one came their way. "Under both international law and domestic law, a soldier has a duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order," said Steven R. Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. "It doesn’t matter who gave it." According to the Manual for Courts-Martial, if "an order is patently illegal, a service member has an obliga­tion to disobey it," said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Texas Tech University's Center for Military Law & Policy. The so-called "Nuremberg Defense" to criminal activity — "I was only following orders" — excuses a service ­member’s crimi­nal actions "only if the ordered actions are not palpably illegal," Rosen said. This represents a pretty high standard. However, the types of orders at issue here -- such as the infliction of torture and the intentional killing of civilians -- would likely qualify, experts said. "I believe that an order to target and kill civilians intentionally, such as killing the families of terrorists, is patently illegal, and I would advise commanders and soldiers not to follow the order," Rosen said. He cited the Vietnam War case of Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader who was accused of killing civilians, including women, children, and elderly men, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. Calley’s defense was that he was executing the orders of his company commander, but both the Army Court of Military Review and Court of Military Appeals rejected Calley’s defense, Rosen said. How unusual is the backlash against Trump? Finally, experts say Biden has a point about the unusual extent of senior military concern about a presidential candidate’s potential for ordering illegal acts from the White House. "There have certainly been overt disputes between presidents and commanders," such as between President Abraham Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan and between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rosen said. "But I am not aware of cases in which active-duty servicemembers actually took sides in a political campaign." Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, agreed. "I can think of no historical precedent for members of the military and foreign policy community making statements relating to the need to disobey unlawful orders during a presidential campaign," Arend said. "This truly seems unprecedented." Our ruling Biden said military commanders have said that if Trump were elected, "they would not follow his orders." Biden has a point that retired military officials have spoken out against Trump. But he exaggerated when he described them as "military commanders." The current active leadership has not spoken out against Trump. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2016-08-17T18:37:07	2016-08-15	['None']

pomt-00686	"Baltimore spends the third highest per capita on its public schools."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/05/chris-wallace/foxs-wallace-baltimore-ranks-third-school-spending/	The Baltimore riot has many people talking about how life could be improved in neighborhoods that have been in the grip of poverty for many decades. Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., said on Fox News Sunday that investing in schools is an obvious step. But host Chris Wallace pushed back. "It’s not a matter of money," Wallace said on May 3, 2015. "One of the things that we learned this week is Baltimore spends the third-highest per capita on its public schools. Baltimore was already spending plenty on public schools, and the schools were still lousy." To get to "third-highest," Wallace is counting only the 100 largest school districts -- and lopping off more affluent communities in the process. Fox News told us that Wallace relied on a Census Bureau release that compared the 100 largest school districts nationwide. (Wallace misspoke slightly. He should have said per-pupil spending, not per capita.) Among the 100 largest districts, Baltimore does spend more per pupil than all-but two other districts: School district Enrollment $ per pupil New York City 990,145 $20,226 Boston 55,027 $19,720 Baltimore 84,212 $15,287 Anchorage 48,765 $14,963 Montgomery County 146,459 $14,873 The problem is there are more than 15,000 school districts across the country, and there are hundreds that spend more. Among school districts with at least 5,000 students, Baltimore ranks 160th in spending. Or to give another example, Baltimore ranks 20th among the 500 largest school districts: Rank School District Enrollment $ per pupil Rank School District Enrollment $ per pupil 1 Newark 35,543 $23,946 11 Jersey City 27,397 $18,259 2 New York City 990,145 $20,226 12 Brentwood, N.Y. 17,143 $18,034 3 Elizabeth, N.J. 23,386 $20,220 13 New Haven 20,554 $17,615 4 Boston 55,027 $19,720 14 District of Columbia 44,618 $17,468 5 Buffalo 32,723 $18,971 15 Arlington County, Va. 21,892 $17,338 6 Hartford 20,931 $18,843 16 Christina, Del. 16,303 $17,026 7 Yonkers 25,326 $18,798 17 Waterbury, Conn. 18,061 $16,030 8 Rochester 31,432 $18,762 18 Pittsburgh 26,653 $15,615 9 Paterson, N.J. 24,365 $18,590 19 Springfield, Ma. 25,185 $15,374 10 Syracuse 20,491 $18,387 20 Baltimore 84,212 $15,287 The spending vs. results debate Wallace simplified a complex problem when he said improving Baltimore’s schools "is not about money." There are studies on both sides of that debate. To pick one that supports Wallace’s view, researchers looked at four years of data on Pennsylvania schools. In 2010, the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education in Philadelphia compared spending in nearly 500 school districts to 11th grade test results. The strongest predictor of high scores was the fraction of adults in the district with a four-year college degree. F. Joseph Merlino is the organization’s president. "You would think that spending more money would lead to better outcomes," Merlino said. "But the results are very weak." The report said "Spending per pupil, regardless of expenditure category, had either no association with student achievement or at best only a weak positive or a weak negative correlation with student achievement. " On the other hand, professors at Northwestern University and the University of California-Berkeley looked at four decades in school districts where spending increased under court order. In a report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they said that for low income children who spent all 12 years in schools where spending rose at least 20 percent, graduation rates rose by 23 percentage points. There were also "25 percent higher earnings, and a 20 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty." At the same time, increased spending had little impact on the education of children from families making more money. Our ruling Wallace said that Baltimore ranks third in per capita school spending. That's only true if you look at the 100 largest school districts. Among the top 500, Baltimore ranks 20th. Among school districts with at least 5,000 students, Baltimore ranks 160th in spending. Wallace's claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Chris Wallace	None	None	None	2015-05-05T11:55:41	2015-05-03	['None']
pomt-03827	Says we will pay the new chancellor "a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year ... an amount that does not include the costs of this public employee’s benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance, and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/20/gene-mcintyre/does-ous-chancellor-get-lavish-house-upscale-car-a/	Grumbling about the salaries and benefits of public employees is a longtime favorite sport of political observers. That was certainly the case following the recent appointment of Melody Rose as interim chancellor of the state’s seven public universities. Rose, who previously served as vice chancellor, replaced George Pernsteiner, who announced his resignation in January. Rose faces many challenges as the state revamps its higher education system, and she will apparently be compensated well for her work — too well, according to Keizer resident Gene H. McIntyre. In a Feb. 22 guest opinion column for the Keizertimes, McIntyre wrote that "We will pay (Rose) a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year, and that’s to start, an amount that does not include the costs of this public employee’s benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance, and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar." That got our mouths watering and our minds wondering. Fine dining practically every day? A lavish house and upscale car? (Perhaps journalism was not our true calling?) We obtained a copy of Rose’s employment agreement, which shows that she earns an annual base salary of $260,004. Rose receives $14,424 in annual medical benefits, the same as other employees in the Chancellor’s Office, according to Di Saunders, spokeswoman for the Oregon University System. Rose is not enrolled in the Public Employees Retirement System. Instead, she chose the Optional Retirement Plan, a defined contribution plan created in 1996 for unclassified academic and administrative employees. The university system contributes the maximum $51,000 toward her retirement every year. Rose also receives a $12,000 annual car allowance for her to drive to various campuses and meetings. She does not receive mileage reimbursements. Then there’s the annual $20,694 she receives "for professional development and expenses," according to her contract. The money is paid to Rose like salary and is considered taxable income, Saunders said. The money is intended to cover membership dues for civic clubs, conference fees, and "appropriate and necessary expenses that might not be eligible for expense reimbursement under OUS policy," Saunders wrote in an e-mail. "Let’s say there’s somebody coming to speak at a conference, and they take them out to dinner," Saunders said. "It’s things that you wouldn’t want to use your general fund budget for, but they’re expenses a chancellor should take care of." Rose is not required to submit receipts for those expenses, so she could theoretically use all of that money at upscale restaurants. If she spent $100 on each fine-dining meal, she could treat herself to about 207 fancy meals. Now about that "lavish house." The chancellor is offered Treetops, a mansion adjacent to the University of Oregon in Eugene. The 8,000-square-foot mansion, built in 1911, was the official home of Pernsteiner, who split his time between Eugene and Portland. Rose declined to move to Treetops and lives in Portland with her family, Saunders said. All told, Rose receives $358,122 annually in salary, benefits and expenses. She’s also entitled to the usual reimbursements for work-related expenses and travel. Is Rose’s compensation out of line? Saunders directed us to a 2011 chart on the website of The Chronicle of Higher Education that shows median salaries— not including benefits — of senior college administrators. Administrators at Rose’s level have an overall median salary of $322,700. McIntyre based his column on information he had gathered through his years working in education and state government, he said in a phone interview from his Keizer home. McIntyre says he’s a retired language arts and social sciences teacher who served about a decade on the now-defunct Oregon Educational Coordinating Commission, which oversaw the distribution of federal education money. "I know people can live very, very well on a lot less money than we’re paying these people," he said. "We have a lot of social problems — a lot of kids are going hungry, a lot of folks have lost their homes — and yet, we continue to pay some of these people just what I’d consider excessive amounts of money." But is it true that Rose receives "a basic salary of nearly $300,000 a year" and "benefits, perks and living expenses for a lavish house, an upscale car, a spending allowance and fine dining almost every day on the taxpayer dollar" as McIntyre wrote in his column? Rose earns $260,004 in base salary -- not quite the $300,000 McIntyre cites. It’s accurate to say her base salary does not include the $65,424 she gets in medical and retirement benefits. McIntyre’s description of Rose’s other perks is partially true: Rose receives a car allowance and an expense account, but she does not live in Treetops and likely isn’t treating herself to fine dining almost every day.

pomt-14092	"We've already lost $500 million in economic impact" from HB2 fallout in North Carolina.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/may/16/chris-sgro/democratic-representative-says-north-carolina-has-/	In calling on state leaders to repeal House Bill 2, a Democratic state representative – Chris Sgro, who also leads a group suing over the new law – cited both his moral opposition and the financial backlash North Carolina has suffered. "We've already lost $500 million in economic impact and now we are violating federal civil rights law and risking Title IX funding," Sgro said in a press release after the Obama administration announced its belief that HB2 violates various federal laws. "This is a travesty and embarrassment for North Carolina." The General Assembly passed HB2 in March. The wide-ranging state law includes a requirement that people in government facilities use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. A number of businesses, performing artists, conventions and more have announced boycotts of the Tar Heel State in response. That led Sgro (who was appointed to the General Assembly after HB2 passed and is the only openly gay legislator in North Carolina) to claim the law has cost North Carolina half a billion dollars. North Carolina’s gross domestic product in 2015 was about $500 billion. So a $500 million loss wouldn’t be that much in the grand scheme of things. But it would still be important for the individuals and businesses who had counted on having that money. ‘Really tangible losses’ Sgro said he was quoting a study from the Center for American Progress (CAP). The D.C.-based liberal think tank published a study April 13 that detailed the actual and potential economic losses through 2018, due to boycotts over HB2. North Carolina had already lost $86.3 million by mid-April, according to the report. So why did Sgro say $500 million a short time later? It’s worth noting that the CAP study isn’t the only one – Time Warner Cable News put the losses at $77 million. But since Sgro said he was citing the CAP study, we’ll look at that one. Reading further, the CAP report goes on to say that North Carolina could lose an additional $481.2 million in the future, for a total of $567.5 million. That’s the number Sgro said he was referring to. The key here is the distinction the report makes between money that’s at risk versus money already lost. In an interview, though, Sgro defended combining the two. And his group, Equality NC, later repeated the figure in a second press release. "I really think the higher number is the more accurate way to couch the economics of this," he said. "There are some really tangible losses already." There are indeed tangible losses. But even throwing in an estimated, yet-to-be-verified loss suffered by the High Point Furniture Market – which happened between when the study was released and when Sgro made his remarks – the "already lost" tally still isn’t even half of the $500 million Sgro claimed. We double-checked each of the individual losses listed in the study that made up the $86.3 million figure and were able to confirm all of them except for $3 million attributed to Lionsgate pulling a comedy film crew from Charlotte. CAP used an outdated report to come to that conclusion; we found a more recent report that put it about $1 million lower. The CAP study was released before Asheville announced more than $1 million in losses after a conference cancellation. Since that essentially cancels out the difference, we’ll continue to use the $86.3 million cited by CAP. Sgro said there are also losses that can’t be counted, like businesses that have quietly decided not to consider coming to North Carolina. Google’s venture capital branch has also pledged not to invest in North Carolina, and several studios have said they won’t film in the Tar Heel State – all losses that are difficult to quantify. "It’s significant, and it's compounding every single day we don't repeal the bill," Sgro said. Still, though, those are future potential losses – not money that has already been lost or pulled. And we weren’t convinced by the argument that it’s accurate to lump the two together. That’s because a closer look shows that many of the companies listed in the CAP study haven’t actually promised to pull their investments out of North Carolina if HB2 remains state law. ESPN "said it’s re-evaluating its plans," to bring the X Games to Charlotte, according to the Charlotte Observer. That’s a potential loss estimated at $50 million, but it might not happen even if HB2 remains the law. The same goes for another $127.5 million from Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Red Ventures, the NCAA and various conferences in Raleigh. In each of those cases, the groups said only that they would reconsider plans in North Carolina. None said for certain that HB2 would derail those plans. Two big hits The NBA has been more certain about moving its 2017 All Star Game from Charlotte if HB2 remains intact, but that’s still only a potential loss – and one that the CAP study may have over-exaggerated. The study lists its economic impact as $195 million. That’s the same number estimated for the 2015 All Star game in New York City. But not only has the accuracy of that 2015 estimate been called into question, it’s also worth asking if New York is really the best comparison. When doing its own estimates, the City of Charlotte used the 2014 All Star game in New Orleans, a city much closer in size, tourism draw and prices than New York. That game likely brought New Orleans a much lower impact of $106 million. And what about CAP’s estimated $143.4 million from High Point Furniture Market losses? The law was condemned by many businesses and trade associations connected to the twice-yearly market, which has generated more than $5 billion in recent years and has been called North Carolina’s largest economic event. The $143.4 million number would represent a small decline in its economic impact. But we have no way of knowing whether it’s an accurate estimate. Tom Conley, the market’s CEO, told us the market is still trying to get an accurate count of this April’s attendance and any possible losses. But for the sake of argument, we’ll give CAP and Sgro the benefit of the doubt here. Using CAP’s formula and attendance numbers from previous spring shows, we calculated that of the $143.4 million that could be lost at some point, $55.4 million could’ve already been lost at last month’s market. A researcher with CAP told us he thinks the group’s number was even a bit conservative, pointing to a story from CBS News that estimated the losses from this spring alone could hit $115 million. Neither number, though, gets Sgro’s "already lost" claim even close to $500 million. If the CAP estimates on the furniture market turn out to be accurate, then combined with the $86.3 million in already lost and documented funds, we come to a total of $141.7 million already lost from North Carolina’s economy. That’s less than a third of what Sgro said. Using the CBS estimate for the furniture market, the total rises to $201.3 million. Finally, it’s important to note that that some of the already-lost money might even return to North Carolina in the future. PayPal and Deutsche Bank stopped plans to hire hundreds of workers, but they also both said they might change their minds if HB2 is repealed. Our ruling North Carolina’s economy has already lost, by various counts, either $77 million, $86.3 million, $141.7 million or $201.3 million. None of those are even close to the $500 million Sgro claimed has already been lost. It’s true that the state might eventually lose up to $567.5 million in economic impact, according to one study. Sgro was using that number, but the vast majority of that money hasn’t already been lost, like he claimed it had been. What’s more, many of the businesses threatening boycotts haven’t even said for certain that they will cancel if HB2 remains law, meaning the $567.5 million figure could drop substantially. And if HB2 is repealed, it’s also possible that some of the "already lost" money might return in the form of new jobs and investments.

pomt-15257	"We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/31/cory-booker/was-prison-built-every-10-days-house-fast-growing-/	With criminal justice reform in the national spotlight, first-term Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., commented on the growth of the prison system in recent years. "We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders," Booker said in a post to his Instagram account on July 27, 2015. Before joining the Senate, Booker served as mayor of Newark. Is Booker’s claim correct? We decided to check. Prison growth, 1990-2005 We’ll start by evaluating the first part of Booker’s claim about a new prison being built on a near weekly basis between 1990 and 2005. Booker’s communications director, Jeff Giertz, pointed to an almost identical quote in Bryan Stevenson’s book, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, published in 2014. Stevenson is a law professor at New York University School of Law and executive director of a nonprofit group in Montgomery, Ala., called the Equal Justice Initiative. "Between 1990 and 2005 a new prison opened in the United States every 10 days," Stevenson wrote. Neither Booker’s nor Stevenson’s statements specify state or federal prisons, but if we assume they are referring to both types of prisons, then data and an expert we contacted largely corroborate this claim. According to a Congressional Research Service report, "the number of state and federal adult correctional facilities rose from 1,277 in 1990 to 1,821 in 2005, a 43% increase." That’s an increase of 544 new facilities. There are 5,478 days in a 15-year span, which works out to almost exactly one facility every 10 days on average. John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School specializing criminal justice and the recent boom in mass incarceration, said Booker’s claim is correct if it includes both types of prisons. Pflaff said Booker is actually underselling the statistic by not going back to 1984. Between 1984 and 2005, the number of facilities grew by about one every 8.5 days. That said, Booker’s time frame makes some sense because "crime began to drop in 1991," and 2005 is the latest available year from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities. Mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders The second part of Booker’s claim is somewhat less clear. Grietz of Booker’s staff pointed to data that showed the total number of nonviolent offenders incarcerated between 1980 and 2013 grew from 122,000 to 607,000 in 2013 -- a 400 percent increase, compared to a 300 percent increase of incarcerated violent offenders. But for the specific period discussed in Booker’s Instagram post, the data runs counter to his point. Pfaff pointed to data gathered by a study in the Harvard Journal on Legislation that shows violent offenders contributed 60 percent to state prison growth between 1990 and 2009, while nonviolent offenders (drug and property offenses combined) contributed only 27 percent. Pfaff also added that the universe of state inmates is much larger than the pool of federal inmates. All told, 86 percent of prisoners are in state systems while only 14 percent are in the federal system. As it turns out, the big increase happened earlier. The data shows that 55 percent of state inmate growth came from nonviolent offenders between 1980 and 1990, before declining to 27 percent between 1990 and 2009. So Booker is wrong to focus on the period 1990 to 2005 when discussing a "mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders." A big rise did occur, but it started earlier than Booker’s post indicated. Finally, we’ll note that in the much smaller universe of federal inmates, 76 percent and 72 percent of those sentenced to federal prison were sentenced for nonviolent offenses, according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data for 2012 and 2013. Our ruling Booker said, "We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders." Booker is right that a new prison was built every 10 days during that period. But while there was a significant rise in the incarceration rate of nonviolent offenders, it took place over a longer time period than the post indicates -- between 1980 and 2013. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Cory Booker	None	None	None	2015-07-31T14:17:30	2015-07-27	['None']

pomt-03416	The Southern Baptist Convention voted 13 years ago "that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/28/jimmy-carter/carter-baptist-group-diminishes-roles-women/	Former President Jimmy Carter recently gave a striking example of what he says is one particular way women are ill-treated by an influential group in this country. "As you may or may not know, the Southern Baptist Convention back now about 13 years ago in Orlando, voted that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands, and ordained that a woman could not be a deacon or a pastor or a chaplain or even a teacher in a classroom in some seminaries where men are in the classroom, boys are in the classroom," Carter said in an interview with Time magazine. "So my wife and I withdrew from the Southern Baptist Convention primarily because of that." News accounts and the organization’s website confirm the SBC’s belief that only men can be pastors. What was less clear to us was whether the organization "voted that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands." PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some research. Carter, a Democrat, gave the interview in advance of the Mobilizing Faith for Women conference, which was scheduled from June 27 to 29 at his presidential center in Atlanta. The conference is aimed at improving the lives of women around the world. The Carter Center’s website says prior conferences have helped combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual violence. Carter, a former Georgia governor, is listed as a speaker. The Southern Baptist Convention, which organized in Augusta in 1845, claims nearly 16 million members from more than 45,000 churches. It believes in the basic tenets of Christianity, supports mission work worldwide and has claimed some of the nation’s most powerful political leaders among its membership. Former President Bill Clinton grew up as a Southern Baptist. Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said the former president based his comments on a resolution concerning the family structure that the Southern Baptists passed in 1998. The four-paragraph statement, Article XVIII, aims to define the roles of men and women in marriage. The most pertinent portion of the section, the third paragraph, reads: "The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation." The section was based, in part, on Ephesians 5:21-24, which is in the New Testament. Verses 22-24 of the New International Version of the Bible say: "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything." Southern Baptist leaders said the article was written to encourage Americans to seek traditional family values in response to rising divorce rates, children born out of wedlock and violence by children against their parents. The language about women made national news. Some activists and others were outraged at what they deemed sexist language by the Southern Baptist Convention. Others, including many Christian women, said they agreed with the Southern Baptist resolution, The Chicago Tribune reported in 1998. "It doesn't mean that the husband gets the last say every time," Susan Robinson, a secretary at Riverside Baptist Church in Denver, told the Tribune. "It's spiritual leadership." Carter, who announced he was leaving the Southern Baptist Convention in 2000, was quoted in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the time as saying Southern Baptist leaders were taking biblical passages out of context. "President Carter interprets the word ‘submit’ as placing women in an inferior position. (Submissive and subservient are synonyms.)," Congileo told us via email. Webster’s list of synonyms for submissive include amenable, compliant, docile and obedient. Congileo said she had no further comment to our follow-up questions concerning Article XVIII’s use of the word "equal" in the resolution. To sum up, Carter claimed the Southern Baptist Convention voted in favor of a resolution that women were inferior and had to be subservient to their husbands. Carter is wrong on the "inferior" portion of his statement. The resolution says wives are of equal value before God. Carter gets closer on his "subservient" claim. The former president interprets the line in the resolution about wives submitting themselves to the "servant leadership" of their husbands as tantamount to wives being subservient. That is certainly open to interpretation, given the definition of "servant leadership" (one who "serves" the people he/she "leads"). Carter has a case if you cherry-pick the document. But the former president begins sliding down the Truth-O-Meter if you look at Article XVIII and its possible interpretations. Overall his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That meets PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False.

pomt-03679	Says 315,000 mostly minority Texas students are enrolled in failing schools.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/24/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-315000-mostly-minority-texas-stud/	Advocating a bill he introduced to help public school students pay for private school, state Sen. Dan Patrick said in an April 9, 2013, committee hearing, "We have 315,000 mostly minority students in failing schools." The Houston Republican’s Senate Bill 23 would provide a tax credit to businesses that donate to a private school scholarship fund. Since he and Lt. Gov. Dewhurst announced the plan in December 2012, they have referred to the plight of students in schools rated academically unacceptable. In the April 9 hearing, Patrick spoke of "trapping a poor student in a poor-performing school -- of which we have 532 in our state, out of 8,500 campuses." Overall, about 70 percent of Texas’ 5 million students in 2011-12 belonged to groups traditionally considered minorities, according to 2011-12 Texas Education Agency data. We wondered how the picture changed when looking only at students in schools rated unacceptable. Patrick’s chief of staff, Logan Spence, sent us a spreadsheet from the education agency showing 2011-12 enrollment data for 530 schools rated unacceptable, the lowest category in the state’s most recent accountability ratings, which are from 2011. No rulings were issued in 2012, as the state is phasing out TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills) tests and replacing them with STAAR (State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness) exams. Via email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe verified the numbers for us and said that the tally of campuses rated unacceptable had fluctuated as schools appealed ratings, ending up at 530. By our calculations using the agency’s data, the number of nonwhite students in "unacceptable" schools was 315,073 in 2010-11, but 304,139 in 2011-12. Spence told us Patrick has used totals from both years in speeches. We calculated that non-white students made up 77.8 percent of the enrollment at "unacceptable" schools in 2010-11 and 78.4 percent of the enrollment at "unacceptable" schools in 2011-12. The breakdown for 2011-12 enrollment at schools rated unacceptable, using the agency’s categories: Hispanic -- 51.4 percent African American -- 23.5 percent White -- 21.8 percent Asian -- 1.5 percent "Two or more races" -- 1.2 percent American Indian -- 0.5 percent Pacific Islander -- 0.08 percent At schools rated acceptable or better in 2011-12, we found, the enrollment was 68.5 percent non-white. And those schools accounted for the vast majority of Texas’ 4.98 million students in 2011-12. Schools rated acceptable or better served 91.4 percent of Texas students, including 91 percent of the state’s 3.4 million non-white students. Again using the agency’s data, we broke out the percentage of non-white students for the other school rating levels, and found that the percentage of non-white students decreased with each step up: "Exemplary" schools -- 14.7 percent of Texas students, 56 percent of them non-white. "Recognized" schools -- 35.4 percent of Texas, 69.5 percent non-white. "Acceptable" schools -- 41.3 percent of Texas, 73 percent non-white. "Unacceptable" schools -- 6.1 percent of Texas, 78.4 percent non-white. Our ruling Patrick said Texas has "315,000 mostly minority students in failing schools." That matches an outdated figure -- the 2010-11 non-white population at such schools. For 2011-12, there were 304,139 students in "unacceptable" schools. In both cases, about 78 percent of the students in the faltering schools were "minority," meaning non-white. In contrast, schools rated acceptable or better in 2011-12 had enrollments of nearly 69 percent non-white students. We rate Patrick’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-03622	Says only about 250 Texans have been killed in action since 9/11.	false	/texas/statements/2013/may/07/leticia-van-de-putte/van-de-putte-says-about-250-texans-killed-action-9/	Leticia Van de Putte says that thankfully, few Texans stand to benefit from her proposed tax break for surviving spouses of Texans who die in action. The San Antonio Democrat, who chairs the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, told colleagues on the Senate floor May 1, 2013: "According to Department of Defense data, there would only be about 250 killed in action, who were Texans, since 9/11." Michael Brick, an Associated Press reporter based in Austin, brought her claim to our attention via Twitter, wondering if that tally was low. It was, according to a table of figures emailed to us by Van de Putte spokesman Lee Nichols. The table indicates 588 Texans were killed in action from Oct. 1, 2011, to Jan. 24, 2013. It was prepared by the Defense Manpower Data Center, which is the Department of Defense’s "human resource information source." Some 310 of the Texans were married when they died, the table indicates, while 253 were not married; 24 were divorced; and one had an unknown marital status. By email, Nichols noted that Van de Putte generally focused in her remarks on Texas members of the armed services killed in action with surviving spouses in the state who might benefit from her proposed constitutional amendment, which cleared the Senate and awaits House consideration. Under the proposal, which also would require voter approval to take effect, spouses who have not remarried could be exempt from paying property taxes on their homesteads. Shortly after declaring the 250 figure, Nichols stressed, Van de Putte clarified by saying: "So we’re talking probably about 250 folks who would even qualify for this, and that’s since 9/11." Nichols said Van de Putte gave the incorrect figure due to staff error. By telephone, Bill Wilson, chief of staff for the Senate committee, told us that as Van de Putte spoke, he gave her the 250 figure by drawing from the wrong column on the table. His intent, he said, was to let her know that 310 of the Texans killed in action since 9/11 were married, which is of relevance to the fiscal impact of her proposal. Finally, Defense Department spokeswoman Leslie Hull-Ryde guided us to up-to-date online counts of Americans killed in action, enabling us to confirm that as of May 2, 2013, 588 Texans had been killed in action since Oct. 1, 2011. Those Texans comprised 11 percent of the 5,258 Americans killed in action since 9/11, according to the government figures. Precisely, the government counts indicate, 411 Texans were killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom (which ran through August 2010); 170 in Operation Enduring Freedom (occurring in Afghanistan and other countries); and seven in Operation New Dawn (in Iraq and nearby countries since Sept. 1, 2010)--with all but 11 of the dead being men. According to the information, the deaths occurred from Jan. 4, 2002, through Dec. 24, 2012. We calculated the average age of the victims as 26. (See our breakout, including individual names and other details, here.) Brick, the AP reporter, responded to Nichols’ email on this topic by tweeting a May 2, 2013, update, followed by a confessional tweet: "Related: This reporter once spent weeks gathering string on a story," as in detail, "then spelled Sen. VDP's name wrong, so nobody's perfect." Our ruling Van de Putte said about 250 Texans have been killed in action since 9/11. That’s off by more than half; 588 Texans perished in action from January 2002 through the most recent Texan's death on Dec. 24, 2012, according to the federal government. The senator likely drew her number from the wrong column on a table. Regardless, what she said rates as False.	None	Leticia Van de Putte	None	None	None	2013-05-07T06:00:00	2013-05-01	['None']

pomt-13256	Says allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances on a female sheriff’s deputy "were found by two separate judges to not have merit."	false	/california/statements/2016/oct/17/scott-jones/scott-jones-falsely-claims-judges-ruled-allegation/	Republican congressional candidate and Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones continues to face questions about his personal conduct following allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a 26-year-old female subordinate more than a decade ago. They came to light in court documents in July. Jones has strongly denied the accusations, which his opponent Democratic Congressman Ami Bera has used against him in campaign ads. The two are competing to represent the 7th Congressional District, which includes eastern Sacramento County and the cities of Folsom, Rancho Cordova and Elk Grove. Jones, who has a law degree, has done more than just personally deny the claims. In an August interview with Capital Public Radio, Jones said two judges had determined the allegations have no merit. "These allegations that supposedly happened 13 years ago, but were never brought up until in this lawsuit a year or so ago, were found by two separate judges to not have merit," Jones said. News coverage of the case indicates the claims about sexual misconduct never advanced to trial for procedural reasons, which is far different than Jones’ assertion that they were evaluated and found to have no merit. We decided to fact-check whether any judges found the claims against Jones have "no merit." Claim part of larger lawsuit The accusations about sexual advances are from Tosca Olives, who, beginning as a young sheriff’s deputy, said she had about 30 inappropriate encounters with Jones between 2003 and 2005. Her claims were inserted into a larger lawsuit brought against the Sheriff’s Department by four deputies alleging workplace retaliation, sexual harassment and sexual discrimination by their supervisors. Only the retaliation claim advanced to trial. A jury sided with the deputies on that charge and awarded them nearly $3.6 million. Before the trial started, deputies used Olives’ subpoenaed testimony to support their claims of a hostile work environment based on sexual favoritism. Sacramento Superior Court Judge David I. Brown, however, did not allow the sexual harassment and favoritism claims, including Olives’ supporting testimony, to advance. He did not because the deputies "failed to initially plead the cause of action or raise it with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing," according to a Sacramento Bee fact check. The Bee examined a nearly identical claim from Jones, made in a prepared statement in July, that a judge had found Olives’ allegations have no merit. It labeled Jones’ claim false and described it as "misleading." "Nothing in the court record indicates the judge passed judgment on the merits of Olives’ accusations," the Bee fact check said. Jones’ response We asked the Jones campaign to explain the candidate’s statement. Kyle Macdonald, Jones’ campaign manager, noted that Judge Brown dismissed the charges tied to the Olives testimony before trial. He said in an email that decision "can lead a reasonable person to conclude that the Judge found insufficient merit in them." Once the trial started, Macdonald said a second superior court judge, David DeAlba, ruled Olives could not testify. He described this decision "as close as Sheriff Jones can get to an exoneration in this format." Macdonald added: "In sum, no Judge did - or would ever - say ‘I find no merit to these allegations,’ but each of the Judge's rulings in that regard is as close as it would get, and can reasonably be taken with that meaning." A Bera campaign spokeswoman responded to Jones’ claim saying: "Not advancing to trial is distinct from being dismissed by a judge." Our ruling Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones recently claimed that allegations he made unwanted sexual advances on a young, female sheriff’s deputy "were found by two separate judges to not have merit." News coverage, including a Sacramento Bee fact check, found the allegations by the deputy never advanced to trial for procedural reasons. It also found there’s no evidence in the court record that a judgement was made on the merits of the claims. A spokesman for the Jones campaign acknowledged that no judge has ever stated in court that the claims had no merit. Without any evidence to point to, Jones and his campaign ask the public to make a leap of faith about the candidate’s claim, and interpret what the judges might have been thinking. We can’t make that assumption. We rate Jones’ statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-14079	Says Donald Trump said of women, "And you can tell them to go f--- themselves."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/18/priorities-usa-action/priorities-usa-donald-trump-women-ad/	Donald Trump's attitude toward women has been a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign since Megyn Kelly grilled him about some of his negative comments at the GOP’s first presidential debate. With Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, Priorities USA, a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC, has released a commercial called "Speak" showing people — all but one of them a woman — wearing T-shirts with Trump images mouthing some of the comments the billionaire has used when referring to women. The quotes: "You know you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever." "Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely." "You like girls that are 5-foot-1? They come up to you-know-where." "If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her." (with an image a father and daughter) "And you can tell them to go f--- themselves." In the last quote, the expletive is bleeped out, but it’s clear what word the woman in the ad is mouthing. The ad then asks, "Does Donald Trump really speak for you?" Apparently, the "f--- themselves" portion of the ad doesn't speak for Trump either, at least when it comes to referring to women. Our partners at the Political TV Ad Archive helped us identify that Trump's voice in that quote was taken from an Feb. 4, 2016, speech he made in New Hampshire. His comment dealt with businesses leaving the United States, not women. "We're going to bring businesses back. We're going to have businesses that are now in Mexico come back to New Hampshire and you can tell them to go f--- themselves," Trump said. "Because they let you down, and they left." Trump clearly mouths the expletive, but he says the word very softly, if at all. Watch for yourself. When we contacted Priorities USA, spokesman Justin Barasky said, "we never claimed it was a reference to women at all." That ad "wasn't just about Donald Trump's overt sexism. It was actually about how divisive he is and how his character is that of someone who should never be president of the United States," he said. "In no way do we ever claim he was saying that to women. There is no fast one trying to be pulled." However, at the very end, when the announcer asks, "Does Donald Trump really speak for you?" the images of seven women — and no men — flash across the screen. The super PAC said it plans to spend $6 million airing that ad and a companion Trump attack ad in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada over a three-week period. The second ad focuses exclusively on women's issues. In a news release announcing the ad buy, Priorities USA, said, "Our paid media campaign starts by highlighting (Trump's) divisive views on women." Trump, in a tweet about the ad, complained that he wasn't talking about women in the clip, although he mistakenly said he was referring to China. Actually, that was a mistake, too. The clear context was about businesses that left for places like Mexico. Our ruling Priorities USA, in an anti-Trump ad, quotes the candidate as saying, "And you can tell them to go (bleep) themselves." It comes after multiple comments critical of women. The super PAC says the sound clip wasn't meant to be taken as a reference to women. That, as Trump might say, is a huuuuuuuge stretch. The ad is all about women. It features seven women and two men, only one of whom has a speaking role. All of the mouthed phrases — except the one in question — clearly attack, criticize or make disturbing references to women. The ad offers no indication that the "f--- themselves" line refers to anything but women. In fact, it refers to businesses that left the United States. The statement in the ad represents a ridiculous misrepresentation of what Trump said.

pomt-08833	"I've taken on the federal government and won."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/11/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-took-federal-government-court-and-won-he-/	Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican running for attorney general, is trying to push back against criticisms that he's a politician first and lawyer second by highlighting his success in the courtroom. At a July 31, 2010, debate with GOP rivals Holly Benson and Pam Bondi, Kottkamp said that he'd put his legal experience up against anyone running. Then he offered his proof. "I've taken on the federal government," Kottkamp said. "And won." We wanted to see if Kottkamp is accurately describing his legal career. According to the Florida Constitution, the state attorney general must have been a member of the bar of Florida for the preceding five years. That's a standard Kottkamp must, and does, meet. Kottkamp attended the University of Florida College of Law and received his Juris Doctor degree in 1987. He clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Joe Eaton and U.S. District Court Judge Sidney Aronovitz. From 1991-2005, he was a shareholder in the Fort Myers firm of Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt, and before becoming lieutenant governor, he spent a brief time as a partner at Morgan & Morgan. Kottkamp remains a member in good standing with the Florida Bar. Kottkamp's campaign pointed us to case from the 1990s to back up his claim. What follows is an account cobbled together from court documents of the case, Robert B. Reich vs. John C. Davis, P.A. In that case Kottkamp represented John C. Davis, a Fort Myers Beach accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for firing two employees. Darlene Smiley and Cynthia Fellows claimed that they were terminated for speaking up about not getting paid overtime. Davis paid overtime during tax season -- roughly January to April -- but offered only compensation time the rest of the year, Smiley and Fellows said. When Smiley asked Davis to pay her the money she was entitled in the fall of 1986, Davis refused. So Smiley complained to the Department of Labor. Investigators interviewed both Smiley and Fellows and determined Davis needed to pay. He did, and then promptly fired both Smiley and Fellows. In court, the Labor Department claimed that Davis violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and argued that the two women should be offered their jobs back. Davis, through his attorney Kottkamp, said that while the overtime controversy was one of the reasons Smiley and Fellows were fired, they would have been fired anyway, because of poor work habits and poor work product. In a 1993 ruling, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida sided with Davis, saying that Smiley and Fellows were not fired because they complained about the overtime. The district court's ruling actually was vacated on appeal in 1995 because the appellate court determined that the complaints were a reason the women were fired. But the appellate court said that as long the complaints were not the only reason, Davis acted lawfully. The case returned to district court and quickly was dismissed, giving Kottkamp the victory he claims over the feds. Kottkamp said during a televised debate that he has taken on the federal government as a lawyer and won. In the 1990s, Kottkamp represented an accountant who was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Hegar, the former state senator elected Texas state comptroller in 2014, told reporters early this year there are benefits to falling oil prices. "Lower fuel costs should reduce the price of importing goods, which is great for consumers and, ultimately, our economy," Hegar said, according to an Austin American-Statesman news story. "In fact, the average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices." The same story noted the price of oil had fallen about 50 percent since June 2014 to just more than $50 a barrel. And are lower fuel prices equivalent to a 2 percent pay raise for taxpayers? By email, Hegar spokesman Chris Bryan said Hegar drew that percentage from a December 2014 news story in the Economist magazine. The story said, in part: "Cheaper oil should act like a shot of adrenalin to global growth. A $40 price cut shifts some $1.3 trillion from producers to consumers. The typical American motorist, who spent $3,000 in 2013 at the pumps, might be $800 a year better off—equivalent to a 2% pay rise." The magazine didn’t engage with our inquiry about how its figures were worked up. We went on to query James Hamilton, a University of California, San Diego, economist quoted by the Wall Street Journal in November 2014 saying lower gas prices "relative to the average of the past three years will in effect put an extra $108 billion into U.S. consumers’ pockets, generating a nearly 0.8 percent increase in disposable personal income." By email, Hamilton pointed us to his Dec. 21, 2014, blog post stating: "The average U.S. retail price of gasoline right now is about $2.40 a gallon. Last year," in 2013, "American consumers and businesses bought 135 billion gallons of gasoline," per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at an average price of $3.60 a gallon, he wrote. Hamilton wrote: "If gasoline prices stay where they are and if we buy the same number of gallons of gasoline this year as last, that leaves us with an additional $160 billion to spend over the course of the year on other items. If we restate the total savings for U.S. consumers and businesses in terms of the 116 million U.S. households, that works out to almost $1,400 per household." We checked his bottom-line figure—$1,400 per household—and compared it to what the U.S. Census Bureau estimates to have been the median household income for the U.S. and Texas, respectively, from 2009 through 2013. In Texas, the estimated $1,400 in unspent money shakes out to a 2.7 percent increase on the median income of $51,900. Nationally, it would amount to a 2.6 percent increase from the median household income of $53,046. Also, EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan noted by email that in December 2014, the agency predicted the average U.S. household would spend about $550 less on gasoline in 2015 than in 2014 due to falling gas prices and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks—which would be 1 percent of the median household income in Texas. Our ruling Hegar said the "average taxpayer will see the equivalent of a 2 percent pay raise as a result of low fuel prices." Provided gas prices don’t go back up, that percentage seems in the ballpark for how much Texans could save on gas compared to what they spent, though it's also possible to get to higher and lower projections.

pomt-07120	"The tax on job creating businesses is 35 percent in the United States, second worst in the entire world."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/18/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-corporate-tax-rate-second-hig/	Republican Senate candidate George Allen recently complained that corporate taxes are too high and discourage economic expansion. "The tax on job-creating businesses in the United States is 35 percent, second worst in the entire world," he said during a June 14 news conference at which he unveiled his Blueprint for America’s Comeback.. We wondered if the U.S. really is No.2 in the world when it comes to high corporate taxes and asked for the source of Allen’s information. Katie Wright, spokeswoman for Allen’s campaign, pointed to a March 8, 2011, report from the right-leaning Tax Foundation. It indeed showed that the U.S. had the second highest total corporate tax rate among industrialized and emerging nations. Only Japan placed higher levies on business profits. But taxes are a complicated subject, and Allen’s claim needs elaboration. Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted most corporate income is taxed at the top U.S. federal rate of 35 percent, which Allen cited. The tax applies to American companies doing business here and abroad as well as to profits earned in the U.S. by affiliates of foreign companies. Allen understates his argument when he says the 35 percent federal corporate tax rate is the second highest in the world. Actually, it outstrips Japan and is the highest national rate among nearly three dozen industrialized democracies, according to 2011 data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But national tax rates on companies don’t tell the whole story. When looking at how the U.S. corporate tax liability compares to other countries, analysts usually examine a combination of federal and state corporate income tax rates. By that measure, the combined average corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 39.2 percent this year, according to the OECD. Among industrialized democracies, only Japan’s combined corporate rate of 39.5 percent is higher. Japan had planned to lower its corporate tax rate by 5 percent on April 1. But it delayed making the cut after a disastrous earthquake and tsunami struck in March. The OECD report only discusses statutory corporate tax rates. It does not address deductions and credits companies can claim in various countries to lower their liabilities. These loopholes produce an "effective tax rate" - the percentage of profits companies actually pay in levies. The World Bank published a report last November containing the effective corporate tax rates of 183 nations. The U.S. had an effective corporate tax rate of 27.6 percent, according to the study, which is still pretty high. Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand had higher effective tax rates on corporate profits. Allen, during his news conference, said he would like to lower the 35 percent national corporate tax rate to 20 percent and eliminate loopholes. Let’s sum up: Allen said the U.S. corporate income tax of 35 percent is the second highest in the world. The national rate of 35 percent is actually the highest among democratic industrial nations. The U.S. combined corporate tax rate -- the average total of state and national levies on business profits -- is 39.2 and ranks second among industrialized democracies. So Allen is a smidgen off on tax rates, rankings and definitions. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2011-06-18T07:00:00	2011-06-14	['United_States']
pomt-08935	Twenty-two million jobs were created during Clinton’s two terms but only 3 million during Bush’s.	true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/25/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-touts-job-grown-during-clinton-presi/	Politicians can slice and dice monthly job reports expertly, a useful skill for scoring economic talking points. Include a few months’ worth of job losses here, exclude some job gains there, or do it in reverse, and pretty soon it’s all some scoundrel’s fault. (Never mind whom that scoundrel is.) So U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown caught our attention when he took a broader historical look while appearing July 14 on Rachel Maddow’s program on MSNBC. "We saw jobs created, 22 million in the Clinton years," said Brown, a Democrat who’s not up for reelection until 2012. "Because they were responsible about cutting taxes selectively and increasing taxes selectively and they were responsible about what government programs they formed and they dismantled. Twenty-two million jobs created and incomes went up in those eight years for the average American. And in the next eight years, the eight Bush years, only 3 million jobs created and that wasn`t even enough to keep up with population growth." The quantitative claims seemed worth checking out, and in doing so we found a surprise: Brown is wrong – but not in a way he’ll likely mind. No fan of President George W. Bush, Brown grossly understated the poor job growth that occurred on Bush’s watch. The comparison should have been this: Job growth through Clinton two terms was 22.7 million. Through Bush’s two terms, it was 1.1 million. Brown isn’t alone in making this error. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee used the 3 million figure in a news release on July 20 when trying to use Bush’s record on jobs as a weapon against one of his former top aides, Rob Portman. Portman is the Republican in the U.S. Senate race to succeed George Voinovich, who is retiring. Brown’s office wasn’t sure where the senator got his figures, but we did some tracing and concluded it probably came from a Wall Street Journal online story of Jan. 9, 2009. That’s where the Democratic committee says it got its numbers, too. The Wall Street Journal examined net job growth for more than half a century and declared that Bush had the "worst track record on record." That doesn’t mean it’s the worst ever. It’s just the worst since the Labor Department started keeping payroll records in 1939. Said the Journal: "The Bush administration created about three million jobs (net) over its eight years, a fraction of the 23 million jobs created under President Bill Clinton’s administration and only slightly better than President George H.W. Bush did in his four years in office." We wanted to look at those numbers ourselves, so we turned to the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. Getting guidance on the data from BLS and using Excel spreadsheets, we discovered not only that Brown and the Democrats have been wrong, but also why. It was a matter of timing. BLS had only preliminary data on Bush’s final performance at the close of his second term, when the Wall Street Journal was doing its story. BLS subsequently updated the data. It turned out that things were way worse than the preliminary numbers showed. We shared this assessment with the Journal reporter, who agreed. It’s not a matter of whose numbers were better. It’s a matter of what was known and when. You, too, can do the math. The jobs numbers are based on a monthly survey of employers for the 12th of each month, but the initial reports are revised as more employers complete their survey over the following couple of months. A fuller census of employment and wages is conducted quarterly and is considered more accurate, so BLS eventually adjusts the monthly numbers to reflect that accuracy. Here are the latest numbers: Number of jobs as of January, 1993, a week before Clinton took office: 109.725 million. Number of jobs as of Jan. 2001, a week before Clinton left office: 132.469 million Net Gain under Clinton: 22.7 million jobs. Now for Bush, who succeeded Clinton in the White House. As already noted, the nation had 132.469 million jobs as he was taking office. Number of jobs on Jan. 12, 2009, a week before Bush left office: 133.549 million. Net gain under Bush: 1.08 million jobs. OK, but what about Brown’s claim that incomes went up under Clinton? The numbers bear this out, too. BLS data, adjusted for inflation, show that average weekly wages grew by 21 percent from the start of Clinton’s first term to the end of his second term. They grew by only 2 percent under Bush’s two terms. Is it fair to compare job growth under these presidents? Just in case we were missing some context – because these numbers seemed to turn conventional wisdom of its head -- we ran this by Dan Mitchell, an economist and fan of fiscal restraint who works as a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented think tank. Mitchell said he didn’t find the numbers surprising. Luck and the economic cycle played a role in both presidencies, but the officeholders’ policies played bigger roles, he said. Citing free-trade agreements, welfare reform and deregulation in the telecommunications and agriculture industries, Mitchell said that Clinton’s economic policies were actually geared more to free markets than Bush’s, and the results speak for themselves. But that’s for others to argue. Bush, while insisting on tax cuts, faced a national security crisis unparalleled in the last half-century, and his response – including wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – had serious economic consequences. Political values, including those of Sen. Brown, shape the debate on whether the president took the right or wrong approach. As for us, we’re sticking to the factual claims. Brown’s numbers on Bush were off, but his point was right on target. We rate his statement True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04663	"$500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/09/joe-biden/biden-says-500-billion-bush-tax-cuts-wealthy-would/	Vice President Joe Biden moves into high-dudgeon mode when sharing his view that Republican budget cuts would harm average Americans. He was in that zone during swing-state stops after the Republican National Convention, shouting out this line of attack at a Green Bay campaign rally on Sept. 2, 2012. "They didn’t tell you why they are eviscerating all these efforts to help the working and middle class people of America," Biden said. "They are doing it all in the service of massive tax cuts for the very wealthy … $500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families. Hear what I just said! One-half trillion dollars will go to 120,000 American families!" Let’s examine Biden’s math and his characterization of the tax cuts enacted during Republican George W. Bush’s two-term presidency. The Bush tax cuts The Bush tax cuts, mostly in 2001 and 2003, lowered federal income tax rates at all levels, decreased the marriage penalty, lowered taxes on capital gains and dividends, boosted the child tax credit and phased out restrictions on how much higher-income people could deduct in mortgage interest and personal exemptions. Those cuts were set to expire in 2010, but President Barack Obama and Congress agreed to extend them until Jan. 1, 2013. Going forward, Obama thinks the cuts should stay in place for 98 percent of taxpayers, but wants to end them on income over $250,000 earned by couples or income over $200,000 for individuals. Republicans, including Romney, want to make all the cuts permanent -- and that’s what drew Biden’s ire. Biden’s claim What about Biden’s half-trillion dollar claim? His campaign said he based it on 10-year projections by White House budget officials, and private studies. Federal budgets typically look ahead 10 years. Biden took a budget projection of $968 billion in tax savings, based on the cuts expiring for the top 2 percent. Then he determined that, within that group, the top 0.1 percent includes about 120,000 families -- and got 55 percent of that $968 million in tax savings. The math comes out to $532 billion for those families -- the "half trillion" Biden shouted about. Biden got the 55 percent and the 120,000 figures from two studies by the independent Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute that is a primary source of detailed reports on tax plans offered by elected officials and candidates. One of the studies said those 120,000 taxpayers have an average annual income of $8.4 million. The vice president’s methodology got a thumbs down from Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, but a thumbs up from Andrew Fieldhouse, the federal budget policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. We asked both -- and a third expert, from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- to take their own look at the slice of tax benefits for 120,000 families at the top of the income range. And the Romney campaign offered up its own figures. Here’s what we learned: -- Williams did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on Tax Policy Center data and estimated the 120,000 families would save more than $400 billion but less than $600 billion over 10 years if the Bush cuts were extended. He called that a "best guess." -- Fieldhouse, of the Economic Policy Institute, used Tax Policy Center data and came up with $523-$570 billion, with the caveat that there are some limitations to the data and complicating factors. -- William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, called Biden’s number "plausible" but considers the Tax Policy Center model too limited. "The economy is much more integrated than they pretend, so tax cuts ‘for the rich’ or ‘for the poor’ are really tax cuts for the private sector ultimately in that the money flows back and forth through multiple transactions," he said. Meanwhile, Romney campaign spokesman Darrel Ng said they came up with $407 billion, based on another set of data from the same source. Williams said the Romney campaign number was from outdated figures, but in the ballpark of other estimates. So, there’s a basis for Biden’s $500 billion figure, with the footnote that the numbers are unofficial and somewhat rough. Let’s turn to the VP’s view that the Bush tax cuts were "for the wealthy." One way to judge that is who would benefit if they were permanently extended. The benefits of the reduced capital gains rates and dividends rate, and the cuts in top income tax rates, skew heavily in favor of higher earners, the Congressional Research Service found in a December 2010 study. But the marriage penalty change and cuts in the lowest three income tax rates benefit taxpayers of all incomes, that study showed. The expanded child tax credit helps all but the top fifth of earners. Overall, the top fifth of earners got 65 percent of the savings from the Bush cuts as a whole, according to a Tax Policy Center study of the cuts’ impact as of 2010. In contrast, the three-fifths bunched in the middle-income tiers got 34 percent. The top 0.1 percent -- the group Biden referred to -- got 19.7 percent of the savings. The same trend held for the effect on tax rates. The upper 20 percent saw a much greater reduction in their tax rate than did the lower tiers. The takeaway from all of that: the Bush cuts were not just "for the wealthy," but benefited higher earners more than people in lower income tiers. One more note: Biden is taking just one point from Romney’s tax plan when he tosses out numbers. Romney also wants to close off or limit some tax breaks. "If Romney fulfills all of his tax promises, the rich would save relatively little," Williams wrote to us. "They would save something, however, to the extent that economic growth contributes to the plan’s revenue neutrality." Our rating Biden said that "$500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families." We couldn’t find a definitive study confirming Biden’s figure, but four sources said it’s in that range. His math, and the description of the Bush tax-cut package, needs some clarification. But, overall, we think this is Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-09-09T09:00:00	2012-09-02	['None']
pomt-07886	"Ten retired nuns were barred from voting in the 2008 Indiana Democratic primary."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/05/leticia-van-de-putte/texas-sen-leticia-van-de-putte-says-10-nuns-indian/	Battling a proposal requiring Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte suggested that Indiana’s photo-ID law had disenfranchised 10 elderly nuns. In remarks on the Senate floor, Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, said Jan. 25: "In South Bend, Indiana, 10 retired nuns were barred from voting in the 2008 Indiana Democratic primary. Some of them were in their 80s and 90s. ... These nuns were not able to (vote) because they did not have an ID." The Texas legislation soon cleared the Senate. Still, to quote Van de Putte, we wondered: "What happened to these nuns?" Responding to Van de Putte’s claim was Jerry Bonnet, chief legal counsel for the Indiana secretary of state, who was on the Senate floor to give testimony about Indiana’s experience with its law requiring that voters at the polls have a photo ID that was issued by the state or federal government. "It’s my understanding ... the nuns did have passports; they did have a form of ID that was acceptable," Bonnet said. "But they refused to present that. They were eligible for other exceptions under the law, absentee voting exceptions, and it was really a media event because the media had been brought to the scene before. And they also refused to vote provisionally." Under Indiana’s law, upheld in state and federal courts since taking effect in 2005, a voter without an acceptable photo ID may cast a provisional ballot that will be counted if the person presents authorities with acceptable identification within 10 days. According to the Indiana secretary of state’s website, an Indiana driver license, state photo ID, military ID or U.S. passport is usually sufficient. The law also allows some voters — including those at least 65 years old — to cast absentee ballots by mail. A photo ID is not required in those instances. Answering our request for information on the nuns, Van de Putte spokeswoman Sarah Gomez pointed us to two May 2008 news articles, including one by The Associated Press, which reported that nuns from Saint Mary’s Convent in South Bend "were turned away from a polling place by a fellow nun because they didn’t have state or federal identification bearing a photograph." They had been told they would need such an ID to vote, the article says, but "the nuns, all in their 80s or 90s, didn’t get one but came to the precinct anyway." Some showed up with outdated passports, according to the story. During the Senate hearing, Van de Putte balked at Bonnet’s suggestion that the dust-up was a media event: "You’re saying that this was orchestrated by these devious nuns to actually (provoke) Indiana law and really, they intended to mess you up purposefully?" "Yes," Bonnet said. Bonnet later told us that he’d learned from media reports that some of the nuns toted passports to the polling place. However, he wrote in a Jan. 27 letter to Van de Putte that the nuns "may not have had valid photo IDs." May not or did not? In a Feb. 3 e-mail to us, Bonnet said his "understanding" was that some of the nuns "presented themselves for in-person voting" without any acceptable ID. Bonnet also noted other ways that any of the nuns could have voted without showing a photo ID, including by casting a provisional ballot at the polling place and signing a document at the county election office within 10 days swearing that she was indigent. Indigency is one exception to Indiana’s photo-ID requirement. Bonnet also said the nuns were entitled to receive a free state-issued photo ID. Graig Lubsen, deputy communications director for the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, told us that on election day Hoosiers can go to one of the agency’s offices to obtain a temporary version of the ID that can be used at the polls. At the time of the 2008 primary, Indiana residents seeking the state IDs were required to show four different documents, including at least one "primary" document such as a birth certificate or a passport, plus proof of a Social Security number and Indiana residency. Asked why the nuns had not cast provisional ballots, Bonnet cited the AP story, which quotes Sister Julie McGuire, a poll worker, saying that it would be impossible to get the nuns to a state motor vehicle office within the 10-day deadline. "You have to remember that some of these ladies don't walk well," McGuire was quoted as saying. "They're in wheelchairs or on walkers or electric carts." The day after the May 6 primary, McGuire told the South Bend Tribune: "They wanted to vote. It was heartbreaking for all of us." The Tribune story said a request to interview some of the nuns was turned down. Bonnet told us that the state did not initially investigate the incident because no complaint was filed. However, he said it reappeared in a lawsuit filed in state court in June 2008 challenging Indiana’s voter ID law, which was upheld last year by the Indiana Supreme Court. In their suit, the League of Women Voters of Indiana said the photo ID law had prevented "an indeterminate number of citizens … from casting a vote that counts." The incident involving the Saint Mary’s nuns was among the examples. In its June 30 opinion, the Indiana Supreme Court stated that none of the allegations made by the league "creates any basis for a declaration that the state may not require any voters to identify themselves at the polls using photo ID. Some of these allegations, if substantiated, may entitle specific voters to more tailored relief, but none has been sought in the plaintiffs' complaint." Next, we reached Amy Smessaert, a spokeswoman for the convent, who told us in an e-mail that 10 nuns in their 80s and 90s tried to vote in the May 2008 primary. She said none had "a valid government-issued picture ID." The nuns knew about the ID law, Smessaert said, but "a few didn’t understand that their ID did not meet the requirements." She said one nun had an expired passport that was not accepted. Smessaert said she doesn’t know what kinds of ID the other nuns brought because the convent didn’t keep a record of that. More than 100 retired nuns were eligible to vote, she said, and many had done so earlier by absentee mail-in ballot. Smessaert said that while "the option to vote by provisional ballot was available" to the sisters who lacked acceptable ID, none chose to do so. She said she didn’t know why. "The sisters are U.S. citizens and have the right to vote," she said. "The manner in which each sister votes is a personal decision." "This situation was in no way a publicity stunt nor was there anything devious about it," she said. Smessaert said that several of the nuns who were unable to vote have since died and that the others couldn’t be interviewed because of health reasons. So, were the nuns barred from voting, as Van de Putte says? According to media reports and a spokeswoman for Saint Mary’s convent, the elderly nuns were barred from casting a regular ballot because they lacked proper identification. But they were not barred from voting in another way, such as casting provisional ballots — though their votes wouldn’t have counted unless the sisters took additional steps to meet state qualifications. We rate Van de Putte’s statement as Half True.	None	Leticia Van de Putte	None	None	None	2011-02-05T06:00:00	2011-01-25	['Indiana']

pomt-00077	"Household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high."	true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/hispanic-household-income-record-high-donald-trump/	At a rally in Wheeling, W.Va, on Sept. 29, President Donald Trump touted economic advancement by Hispanic Americans. "Household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high," Trump told the crowd. Is that correct? We took a closer look. Every year, the U.S. Census Bureau releases its annual Income and Poverty Report. The 2017 statistics, released in September 2018, contained the following chart showing median household income by race from 1967 to 2017. The chart shows that the 2017 median household income for Hispanic-Americans of any race -- $50,486 when adjusted for inflation -- was higher than it was for any previous year. Between 2010 and 2017, inflation-adjusted incomes for Hispanic households rose by about one-third. The rise in Hispanic income wasn’t unusual -- as the chart indicates, incomes have risen consistently for every racial and ethnic group since the recovery from the Great Recession began, with the exception of a recent downturn for Asian-Americans.. The timing of the income rise for Hispanic households means that this is not an accomplishment only for the Trump administration. Hispanic incomes began rising in 2011 and continued to increase for most of President Barack Obama’s administration. They have continued that rise under Trump. Our ruling Trump said that "household income among Hispanic Americans has just set a new record high." Census Bureau data confirms a new record high for inflation-adjusted, Hispanic household income in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available.

pomt-15306	"If you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country" as a refugee.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-if-youre-syria-and-christianyou-/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been making many bold statements recently, but one that caught a PolitiFact reader’s eye involved religion and the admittance of refugees into the United States. "If you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country, and they're the ones that are being decimated. If you are Islamic ... it's hard to believe, you can come in so easily," Trump said in a speech in Las Vegas on July 11, 2015. "In fact, it's one of our main groups of people that are coming in. Now, not that we should discriminate against one or the other, but if you are Christian, you cannot get into the country. You cannot get into the country." Trump has made similar arguments before, such as in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in June. So we decided to see if Trump’s claim was accurate. Neither Trump nor the White House responded to an inquiry, but we did communicate with representatives of a range of refugee-assistance groups and scholars who study the issue. The most that can be said for Trump’s claim is that there is a sizable difference between the number of Muslims and the number of Christians that have come into the United States as refugees so far. Between Oct. 1, 2014, and July 17, 2015, according to federal data, 859 Sunni Muslims, five Shiite Muslims and 42 people identified only as "Muslim" arrived in the United States as refugees from Syria, for a total of 906. Meanwhile, 28 Christians arrived from Syria. (Other arrivals included two atheists, two of the Baha'i faith and one with no stated religion.) So, on its face, Trump’s claim that you "cannot come into this country" if you’re a Christian from Syria is wrong. Still, this data finds that 96 percent of the refugee arrivals from Syria were Muslim, compared to only about 3 percent who were Christian. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the population of Syria is overwhelmingly Muslim to start with. The CIA World Fact Book says Syria’s population is 87 percent Muslim and 10 percent Christian. In other words, the refugee numbers are a bit more heavily Muslim and a bit less Christian than the population at large, but not dramatically so. "While there may be higher numbers of Muslims from Syria who have come to the U.S. than Christians, this is not reflective of any policy making it easier for Muslims and harder for Christians," said Shaina Ward, associate director of Refugee Council USA. Ward noted that the the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees does most of the initial screening of refugees seeking resettlement. UNHCR, she said, "identifies and refers the most vulnerable, whoever they are," using a variety of criteria in addition to religion More importantly, there is no evidence whatsoever for the most explosive element of Trump’s charge -- that the U.S. government is discriminating against Christians as a matter of official policy. "The U.S. refugee resettlement program is open to Muslims and Christians, as well as to members of other targeted religious groups," said Jennifer Moore, a law professor at the University of New Mexico. Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, agreed, calling Trump’s charge "completely untrue." "The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims," Jacobsen said. Representatives of three human-rights groups we contacted -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Refugee Council USA -- also agreed that Trump’s accusation is off-base. Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, agreed, adding that he has "worked with Christians from Egypt and Syria, so I know they are getting in." Some experts argued that the biggest problem with the refugee flow from Syria is not that it’s discriminatory against Christians, but that the trickle has been so small. In September 2014, the State Department wrote that "the refugee crisis caused by the conflict in Syria is the worst the world has witnessed in a generation, with more than 2.9 million refugees in the region. More than 9 million people need assistance, including 6.5 million displaced inside Syria." Yet the U.S. government, as noted before, has let in a tiny fraction of those numbers -- less than 1,000 in the past nine months, and only about 2,500 prior to August 2014. One reason for the small number of admittances is the long process facing refugees. Once a case is referred from the UNHCR to the United States, a refugee must undergo a security clearance check that could take several rounds, an in-person interview, approval by the Department of Homeland Security, medical screening, a match with a sponsor agency, "cultural orientation" classes, and one final security clearance. The background checks are often particularly complicated for refugees who were forced to flee their homes without the opportunity to gather important paperwork. Given these requirements, Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University, takes issue with the claim by Trump that if you’re a Muslim, "you can come in so easily." "I know from my own research and the literature on resettlement that no one comes in 'easily,’ " she said. "The security checks are very comprehensive and very time consuming. When I was looking at resettlement of Iraqi refugees in Jordan a few years ago, I met with a number of families who had been approved for admission to the United States by the Department of Homeland Security but were awaiting their security checks. Most had been waiting for months, including families with young children who were in need of specialized medical care. I don't think any of them would have characterized the process as easy.’ " A final note: There is one step that the U.S. government could take if it wished. It could give Christian refugees from Syria a leg up on resettlement by granting them status as a "priority 2" or "P-2" class -- "groups of special humanitarian concern identified by the U.S. refugee program," according to the government. P-2 groups have long included Jews, evangelical Christians, and Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox religious adherents from what used to be the Soviet Union, as well as dissidents from Cuba and a variety of religious minorities in Iran. It also included Vietnamese refugees until 2009 and Bosnian refugees during the 1990s-era civil war. It now includes Iraqis who helped United States military or diplomatic efforts after the Iraq War, as well as certain Burmese, Bhutanese and Congolese refugees. So far, no group from Syria, Christians or otherwise, has been granted this status. Our ruling Trump said that "if you're from Syria and you're a Christian, you cannot come into this country" as a refugee. This is wrong on its face -- a small number of Syrian Christians been admitted as refugees over the past nine months -- and also false in spirit, since there is nothing in the United States’ laws or regulations that discriminates against Christian refugees. We rate the claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-20T10:00:00	2015-07-11	['Syria']
pomt-03375	"More Americans receive food aid than work in (the) private sector."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/10/allen-west/allen-west-says-more-americans-receive-food-aid-wo/	Former U.S. Rep. Allen West, a staunchly conservative Republican who represented a Florida district for one term, recently sent a tweet that resurrected one of the themes used by Mitt Romney and others during the 2012 presidential campaign -- the idea that there are makers and takers in America. Here’s what West tweeted: "More Americans receive food aid than work in private sector. ‘Fundamental transformation?’ Nope, nation destruction." The tweet linked to an article in the conservative website CNSNews that provided data to support his claim. The CNSNews article cited a report by the inspector general of the Agriculture Department, which operates most federal food-assistance programs, as well as employment data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The inspector general’s report said that "FNS estimates that a total of 101 million people currently participate in at least one of its programs." The CNSNews article compared this figure to BLS data showing that there were "97,180,000 full-time private-sector workers in 2012." However, we see a number of problems with this comparison, and how West framed it. The employment figure is likely higher than 97 million We looked at the BLS figures for April 2013 so we could match them to the most recently available figures for participation in food-assistance programs, which are from that month. According to BLS, 113.6 million Americans had a private-sector job during April 2013. That’s more than the 101 million figure for food assistance. The CNSNews number -- 97 million -- was smaller because it subtracted part-time workers and used 2012 data, neither of which were qualifications made by West. The food-assistance number is likely lower than 101 million For means-tested benefits such as these, it seems plausible that an individual who qualifies for one program may also qualify for another. It would be odd if at least some fraction of children qualifying for a free or reduced-price school breakfast wouldn’t also qualify for a free or reduced-price school lunch, and if some of the these same children didn’t also qualify for food stamps at home. In fact, studying overlap was actually the whole purpose of the inspector general’s report. It concluded that "the potential for overlap and duplication exists" among the department’s nutrition programs. But participation in all of these categories is counted separately. No steps were taken to avoid double- or triple-counting people who receive more than one type of food assistance when the 101 million figure was calculated, an approach confirmed to PolitiFact by Agriculture Department spokeswoman Jessica Milteer. "Many participants in our programs are eligible to take advantage of more than one nutrition assistance program," she said. Here's the breakdown of participation in the food-assistance programs listed on the Agriculture Department’s website: Program Participants Period Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps) 47,548,694 April 2013 National School Lunch Program 30,839,021 April 2013 School Breakfast Program 13,481,128 April 2013 Food aid for adult and child care 3,535,000 Highest month, fiscal 2012 Summer Food Service 2,347,000 Highest month, fiscal 2012 Women-Infants-Children 2,032,248 April 2013 Indian Reservation Food Program 76,500 All year, fiscal 2012 Commodity Supplemental Food Programs (non-elderly) 17,600 All year, fiscal 2012 Commodity Supplemental Food Programs (elderly) 576,600 All year, fiscal 2012 Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program 863,097 All year, fiscal 2011 WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition 1,900,000 All year fiscal 2011 TOTAL 103,216,888 This is quite close to the 101 million cited in the inspector general’s report. If efforts had been taken to weed out overlap between the programs, the figure would be much lower. (Unfortunately, the inspector general’s report didn’t provide an estimate of how much overlap exists.) The comparison isn’t especially enlightening The universe of people who could potentially receive food aid is the entire U.S. population. But the universe of people who could potentially hold a private-sector job consists only of those 16 years old and over. And one could easily make that universe smaller by excluding those who are 16 or 17 (and who are supposed to be in school) or those older than 65 (who have reached retirement age). If you adjust for the differences in the size of these universes, one could easily come to the opposite conclusion than the one West offered. Using the 101 million figure for food aid, which as we noted is likely overstated, means that about 33 percent of the U.S. population receives food assistance. By contrast, about 47 percent of people age 16 and up work in the private sector. If you restrict it to people age 18 to 64, the percentage working in the private sector rises to 59 percent. So, the percentage of working-age people with private-sector jobs is at least twice as high as the percentage of Americans who receive food assistance -- the opposite conclusion to the one West drew. And a final note: The categories of "employed in the private sector" and "receiving food aid" are not mutually exclusive. According to the department, "over 30 percent of (food stamp) households had earnings in 2011, and 41 percent of all (food stamp) participants lived in a household with earnings." Our ruling West tweeted that "more Americans receive food aid than work in (the) private sector." However, the data West used appears to have undercounted the number of people with a private-sector job and overcounted the number of people receiving food aid. In addition, the comparison isn’t really apples to apples. We rate the claim False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2013-07-10T16:15:48	2013-07-08	['United_States']
pomt-13616	"I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton/economic-speech-hillary-clinton-offers-cherry-pick/	During a high-profile speech on the economy in Warren, Mich., Hillary Clinton said that she would stand up for workers hurt by trade agreements -- an issue that her opponent, Donald Trump, has been hitting hard on the campaign trail. "My message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership," she said. "I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president. As a senator, I fought to defend New York's manufacturers and steel-makers from unfair Chinese trading practices. And I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there, because it didn't meet my high bar." We have already given Clinton a Full Flop for switching her view on the Trans-Pacific Partnership from supportive to opposed. Here, we’ll look at whether Clinton is correct to say that she "opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there." The statement glosses over the different types of trade agreements that exist and Clinton's past support for them. Clinton’s trade record As we have previously noted, Clinton’s views on trade have zigzagged somewhat over the years. "Some people are generally pro-trade or anti-trade. She’s case-by-case on trade," said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, to the Washington Post in 2015. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, signed by President Bill Clinton. "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal," she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History. As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She voted no on the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and a deal with Andean countries. However -- and this was not reflected in Clinton’s speech -- Clinton actively voted for five bilateral trade deals during her tenure, namely Chile, Singapore, Australia, Morocco, and Oman. She also chose not to object to a unanimous consent vote on a sixth bilateral pact (Bahrain) and she said she supported two others that she never officially cast a vote on (Peru and Jordan) because they came up during her first presidential bid. Here’s a summary of the 10 significant votes taken on trade deals during Clinton’s tenure in the Senate, which is the time frame she referenced in the speech: Year Legislation Clinton’s vote 2002 Trade Act of 2002 (includes Andean countries)* Voted against** 2003 Chile-United States Voted for 2003 Singapore-United States Voted for 2004 Australia-United States Voted for 2004 Morocco-United States Voted for 2005 Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) Voted against 2005 Bahrain-United States Voted for*** 2006 Oman-United States Voted for 2007 Peru-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2007 2007 Jordan-United States Didn’t vote, supported in 2005 * This deal is not included in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s list of free trade agreements, but contains many free trade provisions. ** This is a vote for "fast track authority" — allowing trade agreement to move through Congress without amendments or filibusters. *** The free trade agreement with Bahrain passed by unanimous consent, not a recorded roll call vote. So, to sum up, Clinton did indeed vote against one multilateral trade bill that came up while she was in the Senate -- CAFTA -- and voted against another bill that could be characterized as a multilateral trade deal, which was the Trade Act of 2002. Seen through this lens, these votes provide support for what she said in her speech. But just outside that lens, the picture gets murkier. Clinton has tailored her claim so narrowly that it obscures the bigger picture. Clinton explained her seemingly inconsistent positions in a 2005 speech to Congress: "The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward." While separate deals with Chile, Australia and Singapore similarly excluded labor rights standards, Clinton said she "supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations." In the meantime, we’ll note that as a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA "a mistake" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. And as secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Clinton campaign told PolitiFact that she has been clear in the past that she's supported some deals and opposed others based on whether they meet certain standards. The campaign also argued that multilateral deals have a broader impact, making those votes the most important. Our ruling Clinton said, "I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there." Clinton did oppose one multilateral deal (CAFTA) and opposed another that could be characterized as a multilateral deal (the Trade Act of 2002). However, focusing only on multilateral agreements, as Clinton does, obscures her overall voting record on trade pacts while serving in the Senate. When it came to bilateral agreements, Clinton cast votes to support five of them, and she supported -- but never cast a formal vote for -- an additional three. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-12T14:23:57	2016-08-11	['None']

pomt-14115	"The market is making this decision. The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-market-forces-made-coal-compa/	Some coal country voters see Hillary Clinton as a threat, someone who would install regulations that would hurt rather than help the struggling coal industry. But Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that she thinks it's necessary to move away from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, and she wants to do what she can to help current coal mine workers make that transition. "But the market is making this decision," she said May 4. "The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt. So what I'm offering is a $30 billion plan to really revitalize coal country, to provide support for coal miners and their families, and I think that is the least the country owes these brave people." Coal has historically been the country’s primary electricity generator. But several major coal companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. We decided to dig into the question of how much of that change is due solely to market forces, rather than environmental regulation. We talked to coal industry experts who told us that the primary forces working against coal are market-based, notably the growth of natural gas as a cleaner, cheaper alternative. But now that coal is vulnerable, environmental regulations may seal coal’s demise. "Coal has always been able to absorb new regulations," said Robert Godby, a professor and expert in energy economics at the University of Wyoming. "But the impact natural gas has had since the fracking boom has been amazing to watch." He added: "This would all still be happening regardless of regulations." Natural gas is eating coal’s lunch, and the coal companies made a bad bet on Chinese demand. Coal used to generate about 50 percent of electricity in the United States, but now it’s down to about 30 percent. Just in the past couple years, natural gas has begun to displace coal. (In this Energy Information Administration chart, the grey line represents coal, and the orange line represents natural gas.) A recent boom in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the United States has dramatically increased the availability of natural gas. Natural gas prices are low, and it produces about half as much carbon. Consequently, demand for natural gas is going up, and demand for coal is going down, and fast. While natural gas is the main threat, a growing demand and diminishing costs for renewable energy, like wind and solar power, also takes away from coal demand, said West Virginia University law professor Patrick McGinley. He added that on top of all this, it’s getting harder to produce cheap coal in the Appalachia region because a century of mining has depleted supply, and so the costs of mining new coal are going up. This is all a huge problem for coal, because electricity is about 90 percent of the coal market, said Andy Roberts, research director for global thermal coal markets at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. He said the trend is unlikely to reverse. But it was a big, failed bet on the international coal market that ultimately pushed companies to a point where they couldn’t pay off their debts, forcing them to file for bankruptcy reorganization. About five years ago, the big coal companies — Arch, Alpha and Peabody — took out massive loans to invest in metallurgical coal, a type found in the Appalachia region. They thought fast-growing Asian countries, particularly China, would want the coal to facilitate economic development. But China’s growth slowed, and the demand never materialized. The companies have been unable to pay back their debts on this project, and that’s what sent them into bankruptcy, Godby said. Regulations may make electricity companies apprehensive about investing in coal down the line. This is the best way to think about how environmental regulations affect coal: If you’re an electricity company considering building a new coal-powered plant or rehabilitating an outdated one, you’re already on the fence about whether that’s a good investment, because of the threat of natural gas. But then you remember you might have to face strict carbon emission limitations down the line, which convinces you to go with a natural gas plant instead of a coal plant. Take President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a major initiative that would affect coal-powered plants by reducing carbon emissions. It isn’t in effect yet, and it faces court hurdles. Even so, the uncertainty of what kinds of carbon limitations coal plants will face, and the possibility that they could be significant, has already reduced coal plant investment, Roberts said. "So, investment in coal plants is now basically nil," Roberts said. "And when the CPP begins in earnest in 2022, coal demand, already suffering, will more rapidly and inexorably decline." Similarly, the 2015 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards is a federal regulation that has had a significant impact on the coal industry and contributed to coal-powered plant closures. But it’s impossible to tell how much of the changes in the coal market can be attributed solely to the regulations, rather than the regulations plus the market forces. Multiple experts we asked said that so far, it’s primarily been the market putting pressure on coal. But looking toward the future, as coal becomes more vulnerable and environmental rules get bigger, regulations may play a larger role. "Yes, as Secretary Clinton notes, the market is sorting this out," Roberts said. "Competitive natural gas, the ‘market,’ does indeed have something to do with that. But so do the CPP and federal subsidies for renewable generation. The combination of all these elements has been toxic for coal companies and lethal for those with too much debt. In reality, the ‘market’ for coal is partially economic but increasingly regulatory." In October, Appalachian Power President Charles Patton said coal power won’t be able to rebound "with or without the Clean Power Plan" — the economics just don’t make sense. Our ruling Clinton said, "The market is making this decision. The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt." Economic forces on both the national and international markets are the main reason coal’s prominence in the American energy sector is now vulnerable, forcing coal-burning plant closures and several high-profile bankruptcies. For a long time, coal has been impervious to government regulation. But more recently, regulations — a non-economic force — might be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, especially going forward now that coal is on shaky ground. Clinton’s claim is missing this important context, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c44bd88a-1f3a-4aae-8838-67544690874a	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-10T12:00:21	2016-05-04	['None']
pomt-02186	"In 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-2013-job-growth-wisconsin-was-be/	In the wake of formally launching his re-election bid, Gov. Scott Walker is rolling out a new jobs statistic to combat criticism over the pace of Wisconsin’s employment recovery. "You don’t hear this from a lot of the other media outlets out there, and you certainly don’t read about it in most of the newspapers in the state," Walker told conservative talker Jay Weber on Milwaukee’s WISN-AM (1130) April 16, 2014. "In 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s." Now, it’s been well documented that Wisconsin’s private-sector job growth has trailed the national average and Walker is lagging on his promise of adding 250,000 private sector jobs in his first term. Despite all that, did Wisconsin job growth in 2013 outpace gains in every year for nearly the last decade and a half? Digging into the numbers When we asked Walker’s office to provide backup, his spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster pointed to monthly jobs estimates based on government surveys of a small sample of employers. Those numbers showed that 2013’s private job-growth of 39,700 is the highest since 1999’s 55,700. To be sure, those numbers are far less reliable than the job-count data reported in the U.S. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which tallies job creation from a census of 96 percent of the nation’s employers. Notably, over the last three years Walker has criticized the monthly numbers as unreliable, arguing for using the quarterly figures. Here, he does the opposite. But the latest figures from the more-reliable quarterly census run only through September 2013, so we think it’s fair game for the governor to use them, though as we shall see they are subject to change. The year-end 2013 figures are expected out in June. Researchers we spoke to said the percentage of growth is a better measure because economies grow over time. By that measure, the 1.66 percent growth in 2013 also was the best since 1999’s 2.37 percent. The numbers didn’t surprise Laura Dresser, who tracks Wisconsin’s employment picture as labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, a nonprofit think tank. Two national recessions bookended the 2000s, Dresser noted, with the one early in the decade spawning the phrase "jobless recovery." Three years (2001 and 2008-09 in the Great Recession) saw big job losses in Wisconsin’s private market. And the state’s job total still hasn’t rebounded to 2007 pre-recession highs. Digging a little deeper There are multiple ways to slice jobs data. So hang with us, there’s a bit of technical job-count speak ahead. Walker’s figures are based on seasonally adjusted data for December each year. Under this counting method, actual changes in job growth are adjusted to account for cyclical economic factors such as weather, vacation periods and holidays. But some researchers prefer to use unadjusted figures, saying the seasonal adjustments are not necessary when comparing year-over-year changes. (The most important thing is to use one or the other method consistently.) The counts can vary significantly. In fact, the unadjusted figures for 2013 show 15,000 fewer jobs created in 2012 than the seasonally adjusted figures. At this point, using unadjusted figures, the 2013 result (24,400 jobs added) trails five years, namely, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2011 and 2012 which ranged from 28,100 to 39,000 jobs added. "If he is talking about actual counts of jobs, this is the number you want to use," Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us. Others are fine with the seasonally adjusted data that backs up Walker’s claim. It’s frequently used in year-over-year comparisons published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official scorekeeper on job growth. Seasonally adjusted figures have several advantages and are more familiar to the general public than other types of data, BLS economists told us. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue uses it as well. Dresser, of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, uses the seasonally adjusted data for annual comparisons, but said the unadjusted data is defensible as well. PolitiFact Wisconsin tracks Walker’s progress on his 250,000 jobs promise in part using seasonally adjusted figures. Our "Walk-O-Meter" includes a footnote that explains we combine the more reliable quarterly census data with the latest monthly survey data to come up with the "best available" up-to-date figures for the current month. In the end, Walker’s claim may have a limited shelf life. That’s because the monthly survey numbers have not gone through final revisions for the fourth quarter of 2013. Those revisions are made based on what happens with the more accurate quarterly-census data, so it is still a bit of a moving target. Based on past changes, the revision -- expected this summer -- could be large. "To know how many jobs were added in 2013, we just have to wait for the (quarterly census) data," said Knapp. Our rating Walker said that "in 2013 we had the largest, the best, private sector job growth we’ve had in this state since the 1990s." The claim is accurate based on the best available data source and using a common method of comparison. But it needs some clarification because the number is not final, so the ranking is subject to change. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-04-27T05:00:00	2014-04-16	['None']
pomt-07678	A bill before the Georgia General Assembly would make presidential candidates meet citizenship requirements that are not in the U.S. Constitution.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/09/loren-collins/birther-foe-says-ga-bill-gets-constitution-wrong/	My, how Georgia’s political winds shift. By last Wednesday, 93 state House members had signed on as co-sponsors to Rep. Mark Hatfield’s so-called "birther" bill, which would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state’s ballot. The next day, more than 20 had crossed their names off the list. Several more did by Friday afternoon. That same day, an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution by local attorney and anti-birther blogger Loren Collins took more wind from House Bill 401’s sails. The bill would require presidential candidates to sign an affidavit saying they have never held dual citizenship. This means the bill would create requirements for president that don’t exist in the U.S. Constitution, Collins wrote: "There is not and never has been any constitutional rule mandating that the president ‘has never held dual or multiple citizenship.’ This is pure birther fantasy, a nonexistent bit of pseudo law that an attorney such as Hatfield should know better than to promote." It sounds like the bill has a huge flaw. Is Collins’ claim true? "Birthers" believe in the oft-discredited theory that President Barack Obama is not eligible for office because the Constitution says that a president must be a "natural born citizen." Obama was born in Hawaii, but many birthers think he was born in Kenya. Obama was born to an American mother and Kenyan father. He had Kenyan citizenship and lost it. Kenya’s constitution grants citizenship to the children of Kenyans at birth, but those who are also citizens of other countries lose it at age 23 unless they take certain steps. Obama never took them. We called Collins, author of the blog Barackryphal, who said he voted for Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr in 2008, not Obama. He cited the Constitution’s Article II: "No Person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President." This language does not and should not exclude candidates who are or were dual citizens, Collins argued. Foreign law decided who qualifies for dual citizenship, and foreign law should not decide who is eligible to be U.S. president. We called Hatfield, who does not describe himself as a "birther," but wants more proof that Obama is eligible to be president. Hatfield, a Waycross Republican, said the founders thought that presidents should be born in the United States, their parents should be citizens, and dual citizens should be barred to avoid foreign influence. That’s why the Constitution uses the term "natural born citizen" instead of "citizen." Under Hatfield’s definition, Obama couldn’t be president. Hatfield noted that in 2008, scholars debated whether Republican nominee for president Sen. John McCain was eligible because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone. His father, a Navy officer, was stationed there. We presented Hatfield’s argument to legal experts on U.S. citizenship. They agreed that Hatfield’s concept of "natural born" citizenship makes little, if any, legal sense. "If that [the bill] passes in Georgia’s Statehouse, it will be challenged and it will be struck down as unconstitutional. I am 100 percent confident," said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Hatfield’s bill contains a dual-citizenship ban that does not exist in the Constitution. "It’s trying to add an additional requirement to the eligibility for president," von Spakovsky said. The concept of "natural born citizen" is more complicated than it seems, scholars said. The founders did not clarify what the term meant, but experts have long interpreted it to refer to those who are U.S. citizens at birth. Scholars agree that the Constitution’s authors intended to block naturalized citizens, or those who became citizens after their birth, from becoming president. But the law has yet to be tested, Spiro noted. The Supreme Court has never ruled on the issue, and no candidate with dual citizenship or who was born outside the country has won the presidency. That’s why scholars debated whether McCain was eligible for office. Since he was not born in a U.S. state, he may not have been a citizen at birth, some argued. But that debate was not about dual citizenship. Emory University professor Polly Price explained. The United States adopted the concept of "natural born citizenship" from the English, Price said. For nearly 180 years before the Constitution was drafted, people were natural born citizens of England if they were born on English soil. This understanding was widely accepted in the U.S. during the colonial period. People born in a colony were considered citizens of that colony, Price said. "It may be that some of the founders intended to include only birth on U.S. soil as their understanding of ‘natural born citizen’, but it certainly would not have included that their parents also had to be U.S. citizens," Price said. Collins is right. HB 401 does create eligibility requirements that aren’t in the Constitution. We rule his claim True.	None	Loren Collins	None	None	None	2011-03-09T06:00:00	2011-03-04	['None']

pomt-02780	"The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/	On Nov. 27, 2013, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group used a mass email to promote protests that were planned against Walmart stores for two days later -- Black Friday. The demonstrations aimed to "expose Wal-Mart’s shameful labor practices and support workers," according to One Wisconsin Now, which then made this claim: "The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined." That reminded us of a March 2011 claim by filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore. He said in a Madison speech that 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined, a statement we rated True. Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever. So we wondered about the Walmart claim. Wealth, not income In the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama called the growing income gap a "defining challenge of our time." The pope said that while the earnings of a minority "are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few." Walmart, of course, is a big target. According to Forbes, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States. The corporation has been criticized for low wages; and in December 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a claim that more Walmart employees are on Medicaid and food stamps than other companies. But let’s be clear up front: Although income and wealth are related, they’re not the same. Wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth -- the value of a person’s assets minus liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income. One more point before we get to the wealth figures. Walmart was founded by the late Sam Walton, who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other news reports, the Walton family members still have control of the company, owning about half of the shares. Group's evidence Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group’s claim is a July 2012 article by economist Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Bivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier. (Median wealth refers to the American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half.) As for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families. Rounded up, 41.5 percent would be 42 percent, the figure One Wisconsin Now claims. But let's keep shopping around a little. Similar claim It turns out that a statement nearly identical to the one made by One Wisconsin Now was uttered in July 2012 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sanders said the Walton family owns "more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America," a claim PolitiFact National rated True. Our colleagues found that Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, compared the Waltons’ cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. That survey was published in August 2012. Allegretto found that the Waltons’ wealth in 2010 was valued at $89.5 billion -- equal to the entire bottom 41.5 percent of American families. The 2010 figures are the latest available for doing comparisons with the net worth of the overall population. But we found, using the Forbes 400 list for 2013, that the wealth of six of Sam Walton’s descendants has continued to grow. Here are their rankings and their wealth: No. 6 Christy Walton (daughter-in-law), $35.4 billion No. 7: Jim Walton (son), $33.8 billion No. 8: Alice Walton (daughter), $33.5 billion No. 9: S. Robson Walton (son), $33.3 billion No. 95: Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $4.7 billion No. 110: Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4 billion Total Walton family wealth: $144.7 billion. A note before we close: Allegretto told us the housing crisis is a key reason that the gap between the Walton family wealth and the wealth of other American families has grown. More Americans were left with "negative wealth" because they lost their biggest asset -- their home -- and often significant amounts of their savings, as well, she said. Our rating One Wisconsin Now wrote: "The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined." For comparison purposes, the latest data available, for 2010, the figure is 41.5 percent. We rate the statement True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's website.

pomt-09000	Says that President Obama said if Congress passed the economic stimulus bill, "we would have unemployment at 8 percent and no higher. And it went higher."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/13/george-will/will-obama-said-stimulus-would-cap-unemployment-8-/	On ABC's This Week on July 11, 2010, host Jake Tapper played a video of a recent speech by President Barack Obama in which he mocked Republicans for "peddling the same old snake oil that they've been peddling for years." Tapper said it appeared Obama was trying to frame the midterm elections as a choice between Democrats and Republicans rather than a referendum on the administration. Tapper asked conservative columnist George Will if he thought Obama's strategy would work. "No," Will said, "because he (Obama) is an expert on snake oil. This is the man who said if we pass the $767 billion stimulus bill -- which it turns out cost $862 billion, a $95 billion oops -- we would have unemployment at 8 percent and no higher. And it went higher." This is a claim with staying power. In fact, we first dealt with a similar claim a little more than a year ago when House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said, "We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)." Since then, it has become frequent conservative talking point -- cited repeatedly by Fox's Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and others. So we thought it was worth revisiting. First, we could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making such a public pledge. Rather, it comes via a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. As Will rightly noted, it went higher. The unemployment rate peaked around 10 percent in late 2009 and is now around 9.5 percent. And Will is also right that the cost of the stimulus rose dramatically. But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. So, is the fact that unemployment rose even as the stimulus unfolded proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that the stimulus is working, that even though the unemployment rate has risen above where it was projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus. That was the gist of Obama's claim in a town hall meeting on the economy in Racine, Wis., on June 30, 2010. "Now, every economist who has looked at it has said that the recovery did its job," Obama said. "It put a brake on the collapse of the economy. We avoided a Great Depression. We are now growing again. The problem is, No. 1, it’s hard to argue sometimes, things would have been a lot worse. Right? So people kind of say, yeah, but unemployment is still at 9.6. Yes, but it’s not 12 or 13, or 15." That comment was ridiculed by the Daily Show's Jon Stewart who commented, "I believe we can all agree as Americans there are many numbers bigger than nine." Obama is correct that many independent economists agree that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that). But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The same holds true for Republicans who say the rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus isn't working. Again, it's difficult to empirically prove whether they're right or wrong. Will didn't use the word "promise" as Cantor did when we checked the same claim a year ago, but the meaning is the same, that Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. So we find Will's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08732	"The Great Lakes Compact has a loophole. And the loophole is that while you cannot remove the water in a big transport, you can remove it in containers of 5.7 gallons or less."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/01/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-warns-loophole-great-lakes-compact/	Think of the Great Lakes compact as a fence. The agreement is meant to wrap around the Great Lakes watershed and keep people from taking water out. But U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich isn’t so sure. He fears the states could be powerless to stop Great Lakes water from being exported from the watershed in small bottles. The lakes, 84 percent of North America’s surface water supply, are one of the world’s greatest natural resources that must be protected, he says. "The Great Lakes Compact has a loophole. And the loophole is that while you cannot remove the water in a big transport, you can remove it in containers of 5.7 gallons or less," he says in a video posted to You Tube. Kucinich, along with Democratic Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Bart Stupak of Michigan and Betty McCollum of Minnesota, introduced legislation he says will address the issue. Could the Great Lakes compact have such a big hole in it that it doesn’t hold water? We thought we’d take a look. For starters, a little about the agreement formally known as the Great Lakes – St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. The eight states and two Canadian provinces in the watershed negotiated the agreement. President George W. Bush signed it into law after approval by the Congress in 2008. It is intended to prevent diversion of water from the Great Lakes themselves and the rest of the watershed. Negotiations got serious after a proposal in the ’90s to send water from Lake Superior to Asia as a humanitarian effort. A group obtained a permit from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment to export about 160 million gallons a year, one transport ship at a time. The uproar and objections were so great that the permit later was revoked. The compact bars most diversion of water from the Great Lakes basin. One exception, the language to which Kucinich refers, is a provision that opens the door to removal of water in containers of 5.7 gallons (about 20 liters) or less. The figure originated with the province of Ontario, which decided it wasn't going to worry about "the small stuff," withdrawals smaller than 20 liters, Annin said. The exception was created for the bottled water industry and was one of the most emotional issues during the compact’s negotiation, said Peter Annin, an expert on Great Lakes water and author of the award-winning book "The Great Lakes Water Wars." The book has been called the definitive book on the water diversion controversy. Some states were unconcerned, but others like Michigan and Wisconsin, which both have water bottling industries, viewed it was a serious issue, he said. Some negotiators doubted an agreement could be reached if included a bottled-water ban. The compact gives each state and province the ability to restrict removal of water in small containers within their jurisdictions. The language in the compact is just a starting point, Annin said. But Kucinich fears that the compact redefines water as a commodity and that agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement could be used to prevent states from exercising that authority. "So, if someone wants to set up a bottling business, theoretically, either on the lake or on the shore, there’s nothing that stops the water from being defined as a product if it’s 5.7 gallons or less, and therefore, put it within the realm of us not being able to stop someone from removing the water for their own private profit," he says in the video. That is a minority view, Annin says. "The vast majority of the environmental advocates, attorneys and politicians in the Great Lakes basin do not believe that there is a bottle loophole in the compact," he said. "We don’t know if the majority is right or the minority is right. What we do know is that armies of lawyers have signed off on it." An answer may not be known until someone litigates and there is a court ruling, he said. Meanwhile, Annin said, the impact on the broader Great Lakes ecosystem that bottling companies might have from tapping the lakes for water is not a raging issue among environmentalists. Annin said most hydrologists he has talked to are more concerned with the impact that bottled water can have on a localized watershed, rather than the region as a whole. And there already are some sizable diversions that predate the compact. The largest is in Chicago, where nearly 2.1 billion gallons a day are removed from the Great Lakes basin for water to Chicago suburbs that are outside the Great Lakes basin and to connect the Chicago River to the Mississippi via the Ship and Sanitary Canal. It opened in 1900. That’s enough water to fill 13.4 billion 20-ounce bottles each day, every day. Food & Water Watch, a non-profit organization based in Washington that promotes healthy food and affordable drinking water, estimates that the total amount of tap water and spring water bottled in PET plastic for sale in retail stores across the United States in 2009 amounted to about 5.2 billion gallons. That's for the entire year. Kucinich is correct that the Great Lakes compact allows water to be removed in small containers. But experts appear skeptical that that "loophole" will have a serious impact. We rate Kucinich’s statement Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-09757	During the Reagan era, "the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/06/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-during-reagan-years-richest-h/	In his latest film, Capitalism: A Love Story , Michael Moore takes more than a few swipes at President Ronald Reagan, essentially asserting that under Reagan's watch, the rich got richer at the expense of everyone else. During the Reagan era, he said, "the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half." Moore is correct that the top marginal tax rate — the rate of income tax charged to an individual on their last dollar of earnings — decreased from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1989. That's not the same as saying the richest had their taxes cut in half. In 1980, the top marginal tax rate was 70 percent on earnings over $161,300. The rate was substantially lower for the income earned below that. For example, that year, there were no taxes on the first $2,300 of income; 14 percent on income between $2,300 and $4,400; and on up via a graduated scale. So if you made $162,000 in 1980, for example, you paid far less on average than 70 percent of your income in federal taxes. The marginal tax rate also doesn't take into account various available deductions and tax credits, said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. When Reagan revamped the tax code and dropped the top marginal tax rates to 50 percent in 1982, and then down to 28 percent by 1988, he also closed some of the tax loopholes available to people at the top. It's much fairer, we think, to look at effective individual income tax rates. That's the actual percentage of income that people paid in income taxes, factoring in not only the graduated percentages along the marginal tax rate scale, but also the deductions and tax credits that people were entitled to. In 1980, the effective individual income tax rate for the top 1 percent of earners was 22.3 percent. In 1989, that rate dropped to 19.9 percent. That's a decrease of 2.4 percentage points, which works out to an 11 percent drop. That's sizable, but nowhere near 50 percent. If you widen the field and consider the top 10 percent of earners, instead of just the top 1 percent, the drop in effective individual income tax rate was about the same, just over 10 percent. For middle incomes, the effective individual income tax rate also dropped, from 8 percent to 6 percent. That's a 25 percent decrease. In other words, it wasn't just the rich who saw their income tax rates drop under Reagan. One more thing. When the top marginal tax rate dropped between 1980 and 1989, it went from 70 percent on earnings over $161,300 in 1980 to 28 percent on earnings over $128,810 in 1989. Obviously, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Did the rich get richer during the Reagan years? Yes. And Moore is technically correct when he says that "the richest Americans had their top income tax rate cut in half." But we suspect some may mistake that for the richest having their taxes cut in half. In fact, we first began to look at this claim from a fact sheet provided on Moore's Web site before the movie was publicly released. And in the fact sheet, it states that "the richest had their taxes cut in half." We were prepared to give that a False, as the effective tax rate for the richest was cut by about 10 or 11 percent. But in the movie, Moore describes it as "the top income tax rate," apparently referring to the highest marginal rate. As we said, some may misinterpret that, but we think Moore has been careful enough with his words to get a Mostly True.

pomt-10176	"Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/several-ratings-rank-obama-lower/	In the first debate of the 2008 general election, John McCain accused Barack Obama of being too liberal. "Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate," McCain said. "It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left." Republican candidates often brand their Democratic opponents as liberals to portray them as lefties who favor big government and high taxes. Linguists who study political rhetoric say Republicans have been so effective at giving the word a negative connotation that many Democrats won't call themselves liberals. They prefer "progressives." Still, many political scientists and journalists use the term to represent the Democratic extreme of the political spectrum, and National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine, uses a liberal-conservative scale for its annual rating of congressional votes. The magazine's editors and reporters choose key votes on major issues and those that they believe exhibit a split between liberals and conservatives and then calculate how often senators and House members vote each way. They calculate the liberal/conservative votes in three areas — economic, social issues and foreign policy — and then average them for a composite score. The annual rankings generate some publicity for the magazine, especially in election years. In 2004, the magazine said the most liberal senator was Sen. John Kerry, who became the Democratic nominee for president. On Jan. 31, 2008, five days before the Super Tuesday primaries, National Journal published an article headlined "Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007." The article said Obama had missed 33 of the 99 votes that were rated but that it was enough for a calculation. The magazine said McCain was not rated because he missed more than half the votes in the economic and foreign-policy categories. Since Obama's rating was announced, McCain and other Republicans have frequently cited it to criticize Obama. Yet other ratings don't show Obama as the Senate's top lefty. He wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate according to National Journal . He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005. The McCain campaign has previously cited a 2006 rating by the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action that gave Obama 95 percent, which the campaign noted was the same as Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer. But there's a little sleight of hand in that one. Although the McCain campaign is correct that Obama earned a 95 percent rating that year for voting the way ADA wanted, there were 10 senators who got more liberal scores than Obama, including Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois. (In the latest ADA rating, for 2007, Obama missed five of the 20 votes the group scored, so he received a 75 percent rating. But he voted the way ADA wanted on each of the 15 votes he attended.) Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated there were nine senators more liberal than Obama in the current Congress, including Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "Obama is a liberal, but he’s not the most liberal," said Keith Poole, a University of California-San Diego professor who runs the site, whom we interviewed when we first looked into similar statements in June 2008. Ratings from Congressional Quarterly don't measure liberal/conservative votes, but they show Obama is not quite as partisan as other senators. In CQ’s calculation of party unity, which measures how often members vote with their party on bills where Republicans and Democrats split, Obama got a 97 percent rating last year. Ten Democrats had higher scores. On votes where President Bush indicated his position, CQ found Obama supported the Republican president 40 percent of the time in 2007, which put Obama in the middle of the pack for Democrats. He supported Bush 49 percent the previous year. If McCain had made a more general statement about Obama's ideology, he could have been more accurate. But McCain's statement that Obama "has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate," suggests it is a cumulative rating for all of Obama's time in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for only one rating for one year. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal — in some cases, far from No. 1. So we find McCain's statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14147	"Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-hillary-clinton-doesnt-do-very-/	During a May 2 interview on CNN’s New Day, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on his charge that his potential Democratic rival in November, Hillary Clinton, is playing the "woman card." "She's playing the woman card," Trump told host Chris Cuomo. "And if she didn't play the woman card, she would have no chance whatsoever of winning." Trump went on to say that Clinton’s standing among female voters in particular is nothing to write home about. "Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women," Trump said. "If you look at what happened recently, … in the last two weeks, including New York. I won with women by vast, vast majorities. I was way, way up with women far above anybody else in the exit polls of the recent election." Clinton may have gleefully embraced Trump’s "woman card" attack line, but we thought it’s still worth checking whether Trump is right that Clinton "doesn’t do very well with women." Trump, as it turns out, couldn’t be more wrong. The recent primaries Let’s give Trump his due: He has a right to be braggadocious about his own record with women voters in recent GOP primaries. Trump unquestionably routed his opponents among female voters during the four recent primaries for which exit polls exist. He won 57 percent of women in the New York primary, 55 percent of women in the Connecticut primary, 50 percent of women in the Maryland primary, and 54 percent of women in the Pennsylvania primary. That said, even among women voting in these GOP primaries, Trump experiences a gender gap: According to these exit polls, women -- by a modest but consistent margin -- supported Trump by smaller margins than men did. In New York, he was six points stronger among men. In Connecticut that gap was five points, in Maryland it was nine points, and in Pennsylvania it was seven points. And there’s an even more important problem for Trump’s claim: His own success among Republican women doesn’t have anything to say about how well or poorly Clinton is doing with women. Polling a Clinton vs. Trump matchup We found seven April polls at realclearpolitics.com that asked respondents about how they would vote if Clinton faced off against Trump in November. Here’s a rundown: Poll Clinton share of female vote Trump share of female vote Lead among women IBD/TIPP 51 36 Clinton +15 Rasmussen 41 35 Clinton +6 USA Today/Suffolk 55 34 Clinton +21 GWU/Battleground 54 35 Clinton +19 NBC News/WSJ 56 33 Clinton +23 Fox News 55 33 Clinton +22 CBS News 58 31 Clinton +27 Average 53 34 Clinton +19 Clearly, this doesn’t support Trump’s assertion that Clinton "doesn’t do very well with women." We are still a long way from Election Day, of course, but if this pattern holds, it would represent a gender gap of historic proportions. Here’s how women have split their vote in presidential elections going back to 1980, as collected by Rutgers University's Center for the American Woman and Politics: Year Democratic candidate’s share of female vote Republican candidate’s share of female vote Independent candidate’s share of female vote Major party faring better among women 2012 Obama 55 Romney 44 Dem +11 2008 Obama 56 McCain 43 Dem +13 2004 Kerry 51 Bush 48 Dem +3 2000 Gore 54 Bush 43 Nader 2 Dem +11 1996 Clinton 54 Dole 38 Perot 7 Dem +16 1992 Clinton 45 Bush 37 Perot 17 Dem +8 1988 Dukakis 49 Bush 50 GOP +1 1984 Mondale 44 Reagan 56 GOP +12 1980 Carter 45 Reagan 46 Anderson 7 GOP +1 So, Clinton’s 19-point average lead over Trump among women -- if it held all the way to November -- would give her the biggest winning margin among women of any presidential candidate since at least 1980. Finally, it’s worth noting that Clinton is not universally beloved by women -- but her ratings are a whole lot better than Trump’s. In April’s GWU/Battleground poll, for instance, Clinton scored a 51 percent favorable rating among women, with 47 percent unfavorable. By contrast, Trump’s rating among women in the same poll was 26 percent favorable, 71 percent unfavorable. The flip side is that Clinton does under-perform among men; the GWU/Battleground poll found that views of Clinton among men are 33 percent favorable, 66 percent unfavorable. Karlyn Bowman, a poll analyst for the American Enterprise Institute, considers this "a big problem for her." But the silver lining, she added, is that "if past elections are a guide, more women will vote than men – probably about 53 to 54 percent." Our ruling Trump said, "Frankly, (Hillary Clinton) doesn’t do very well with women." The evidence he used to support this claim during the CNN interview -- his large margins among women in recent GOP primaries -- is undeniable, but says nothing about how well Clinton does among women. In fact, looking at a cross-section of April polls, Clinton’s average lead over Trump among female voters is bigger than any nominee has registered in an actual presidential election election in at least 36 years.

pomt-12128	Chicago city officials "have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents."	false	/illinois/statements/2017/aug/16/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-stretches-link-criminal-aliens-and-c/	When Chicago filed a lawsuit Aug. 7 to block the U.S. Justice Department from withholding federal police grant money from so-called sanctuary cities, U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions reacted swiftly and fiercely. "To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system," Sessions said in a press release. "They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — Federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents." Under its Welcoming City Ordinance, which defines Chicago’s "sanctuary city" status, the Chicago Police Department "will not question crime victims, witnesses and other law-abiding residents about their legal status." It also will not use immigration status alone as grounds for detention, and it imposes strict limits on interaction between police officers and federal immigration agents. Like other cities with similar policies, Chicago says doing so fosters trust between immigrant communities and the police department, so immigrants won’t fear coming to police to report crime or assist police investigations. Accusing the Chicago Police Department of maintaining "an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents" is a pretty serious charge from the nation’s top law enforcement officer. We thought this deserved a closer look. Punching bag city Chicago was one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he repeatedly invoked the city’s murder and gun-crime rate as a byproduct of everything from its gun laws to its leadership. After he was elected, he threatened to "send in the feds" to tamp down the city’s crime. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sessions’ invocation of "criminal aliens who prey on their own residents" refers to a theme that has been prevalent in Trump’s platform ever since the day he announced his candidacy with a speech highly disparaging of Mexican immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The central premise is that undocumented immigrants present an unusually high propensity for crime. On Aug. 16, Sessions doubled down on the alleged link between Chicago’s violent crime and its sanctuary city status in a speech in Miami, which dropped its sanctuary status to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. "Respect for the rule of law has broken down. In Chicago, their so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies are just one sad example," Sessions said. "...We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had an historic number of shooting deaths – zero." The alleged link between illegal immigrants and surges in crime is an idea that has been debunked repeatedly for decades in numerous academic, government and advocacy-group studies. So we started our look at Sessions’ statement by contacting the Department of Justice with a request for data to back up his claim. The response we got back was obtuse and weird. It came from a justice department press aide and was so loaded with swampy beltway caveats--"deep background," "background," "not for attribution," and "off the record" -- that we consulted our dog-eared copy of "All The President’s Men" for guidance. But to no avail. To be clear, we never agreed to any preconditions in seeking official comment and feel under no obligation to abide by them. And we won’t. So what follows, in full, is the official DOJ response to our question. (Click here to view in pdf format.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Where to start? Perhaps with the link to the Washington Post story, which argues vigorously against the position taken by Sessions even while acknowledging that there’s no way to be 100 percent sure there’s no link between illegal immigration and Chicago’s homicide rate. At the same time, the article does state flatly, "There’s no link between a jurisdiction being a sanctuary city and higher crime rates." It also cites a pair of statistics that would argue strongly against the DOJ’s position. While 84 percent of Chicago’s undocumented immigrants come from Latin America, 82 percent of its murder victims at the time of the article were black vs. only 4 percent Hispanic, the Post reports. "FBI data show that most killings in the United States are carried out by people in the same racial group as the victim. The reason for this is obvious: Homicides are usually a function of personal relationships, and people generally associate with family members and friends who share their racial identity," the article states. It’s not conclusive evidence that immigrants aren’t driving up Chicago’s homicide rate, it continues, but "this isn’t what we’d expect the demographics to look like if Chicago’s homicides were tightly intertwined with a population of immigrants who are in the country illegally from Latin America." DOJ also referred us to a 2016 study by the Murder Accountability Project, a non-profit group that tracks unsolved homicides and advocates for better crime reporting, that showed Illinois had the lowest homicide clearance rate in the nation. But the report attributes the state’s poor showing to record-keeping methods used by the Illinois State Police in gathering crime data statewide. Still, the DOJ spokesman argues that combining those articles with Chicago’s status as a sanctuary city -- in which police do not collect immigration information -- validates Sessions. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, however, has a simpler explanation. "The vast majority of our issues in Chicago and our violent crime is committed by homegrown people - either individuals that were born and raised in Chicago or most certainly in this country," Johnson said in an NPR interview Aug. 7. "So our instances of undocumented people committing horrific crimes and murder in particular in Chicago is just - it's nominal." Against those two articles stands a mountain of research that casts doubt on Sessions’ assertion that illegal immigrants cause crime to rise and that Chicago’s official police policy on immigrants endangers residents. "Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates," said a 2015 report by the National Academy of Sciences. One of the authors of that report explained why to PolitiFact in 2016: Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. "They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," he said in an email interview. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence." Crime went down even as the immigrant population increased, the report said. The NAS study reinforced the findings of a 2005 paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. "Despite the widespread perception of a link between immigration and crime, immigrants have much lower institutionalization (incarceration) rates than the native born. More recently arrived immigrants have the lowest comparative incarceration rates, and this difference increased from 1980 to 2000," that report said. These studies blow a big hole in Sessions’ underlying assertion of "criminal aliens" being significantly responsible for the increase in gun violence in Chicago. Sanctuary safety But what about Sessions’ allegation that Chicago’s "official policy" protects "criminal aliens?" CPD’s directive "Responding to Incidents Involving Citizenship Status" lays out the do’s and don’ts for officers dealing with undocumented immigrants. Essentially, it prohibits officers from detaining anyone based on questions about citizenship status and sharply limits interaction with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. However, it also establishes exceptions for suspects with outstanding criminal warrants, who are known gang members or convicted felons or are on trial for a felony. The city defended its policy in its lawsuit against the federal government: "(T)his policy promotes public safety by ensuring that no city resident or visitor, regardless of immigration status, is afraid to cooperate with law enforcement, report criminal activity to the police, testify as a witness in court, or seek help as a victim of crime; and by ensuring that police officers focus on criminal activity occurring in Chicago instead of federal civil immigration infractions." A 2017 report by the National Immigration Law Center that focused specifically on counties that employed "sanctuary city" policies bolsters Chicago’s case. "Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary (sic) counties," the report said. "The data support arguments made by law enforcement executives that communities are safer when law enforcement agencies do not become entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts." The problem for Chicago here is that, because its police department does not collect immigration data, the city can’t unequivocally state that its murder or gun violence rates are not attributable to immigrants. The anecdotal evidence in Chicago’s favor appears strong, but it’s still anecdotal. Our ruling U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions said Chicago’s leaders "have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents." Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance does prohibit Chicago police officers from using citizenship information as the sole grounds for detaining people and sharply limits the interaction between city police and federal immigration agents. But evidence overwhelmingly suggests this is much less a matter of "protecting criminal aliens" than of fostering trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. Yet because Chicago does not collect immigration data in police interactions, it can’t be known conclusively how many of its murders and gun crimes are committed by illegal immigrants "who prey on their own residents." That absence of conclusive data to disprove Sessions doesn’t give him license to make claims that are groundless. Chicago’s sanctuary city policy does not protect undocumented people who commit crimes, despite what Sessions claims. Only the microscopic sliver of ambiguity about conclusive data prevents us from labeling his statement "Pants on Fire," our lowest possible credibility rating. Instead, we rate it False.

pomt-01258	Georgia has led the nation in student fatalities caused by motorists illegally passing stopped school buses.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/nov/11/sloan-roach/gwinnett-spokeswoman-target-claim-about-school-bus/	About two dozen Georgia school systems have added cameras to their school buses since 2011. The cameras have one purpose: catching motorists who break a state law that requires them to stop for school buses that are picking up and dropping off students. Gwinnett County, the state’s largest school district, will be issuing warnings soon — and tickets after the Christmas break — to violators caught by its cameras. "Prior to the law being passed that allowed for the use of cameras to enforce the law that addresses those who illegally pass a school bus, Georgia led the nation in student fatalities resulting from motorists illegally passing stopped school buses," Sloan Roach, the executive director of communications and media relations for Gwinnett County Public Schools, told reporters Nov. 6. That’s a grim statistic. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look. Georgia law allows police officers who witness motorists passing a stopped bus to issue a $1,000 moving violation misdemeanor. But after 5-year-old Karla Campos was killed when a driver sped past her stopped school bus in Cobb County in 2009, parents lobbied lawmakers to allow video cameras to catch violators. Their case was bolstered by a report that Campos was one of five Georgia children to die that year in bus-related accidents. That accounted for 38 percent of the 13 child fatalities occurring in 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to the 2009-2010 National School Bus Loading & Unloading Survey by the Kansas State Department of Education. They included a 7-year-old struck and killed crossing the street with another child to catch his bus. The elderly driver said he couldn’t see the boys because of fog. The 7-year-old’s companion survived. Georgia changed state law in 2011 to allow the installation of video cameras on school buses to catch violators. By the following school year, Cobb and Fayette County schools had already begun arming some of their district buses with cameras. At the time, Cobb estimated that about 1,000 violations occurred per day, or nearly one violation for each bus the district has on the road. By the end of the school year, the Cobb program caught 871 violators using cameras on 102 of the district’s buses. But because the law still required police to issue citations, those motorists only received warnings. State lawmakers have since updated the 2011 law to allow the districts or outside vendors to issue violations. Fines are $300 for the first offense and up to $1,000 for the third offense in five years. There is evidence that the increased enforcement has cut violations. In April 2013, Cobb filed 1,300 citations. This April, there were 767 citations in the state’s second-largest school district. A statewide poll of bus drivers, who reported the number of motorists who blew past a stopped bus, also saw a decline from 8,102 in the 2010-2011 school year to 7,619 last year, according to an annual survey conducted by the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Services. Carlton Allen, Georgia’s representative to that group, said the new law has helped. So, too, did a blitz by the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety two years ago to focus on the problem. But Georgia still had 13 student deaths during bus loadings and unloadings in the past five years, said Allen, who is director of of pupil transportation services at the Georgia Department of Education. "To me, part of that is the loss of a school bus safety unit in the state patrol and a reduction in our staff," Allen said of his office, down to three trainers from seven plus a clerical worker. That leaves it to the local systems to seek other ways to reduce violations, which in Gwinnett numbered 2,000 in a single day. American Traffic Solutions, which has taken over the program in Cobb, now sends video of violators to the county police to confirm a violation before they issue a citation. In the metro area, Decatur, Clayton and Marietta schools also use the video cameras. Atlanta and Fulton have signaled they plan to install the devices in the coming year. Georgia at one time did lead the nation in the number of students killed by motorists passing stopped school buses. That was in the 2009-2010 school year, before the state adopted a law allowing video cameras to help tackle the problem. The state has since updated the law to make it easier to ticket offenders. A growing number of school districts have begun using the video cameras as deterrents. Georgia has not had a year as bad as the record-setter of 2009-2010, with five child deaths. But it also has not been fatality-free as more than 40 states are each year. Even with the cameras, some motorists remain a problem. Roach correctly stated that a study showed Georgia led the nation for bus-related fatalities at the time lawmakers passed a bill allowing the use of the cameras. We rated her statement as True.

pomt-07000	Says the average government worker won't be impacted in the first two years under the reform of state health benefits.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/10/stephen-sweeney/senate-president-stephen-sweeney-claims-average-wo/	After thousands of protesters had descended on Trenton in recent days, New Jersey Assembly members gathered on the evening of June 23 for what would be the final passage of the divisive pension and health benefits reform legislation. That night, Senate President Stephen Sweeney -- one of the principal architects behind the bill -- explained how the health benefit changes would impact the average worker during an "Ask the Senate President" interview on New Jersey 101.5 FM. "Right now, everyone pays 1.5 percent for healthcare," Sweeney, a Democrat who represents the southwestern part of the state, told host Eric Scott. "For the average worker, government worker, for the first two years, on that grid that we created, they're not even impacted. They won't even feel it until the third year where they'll see any kind of an increase." Two years without any increases in health care expenses? Based on the senator’s own numbers, PolitiFact New Jersey learned that Sweeney is right about the first year, but in the second year, the average worker’s costs would rise for every type of coverage -- including a nearly 80 percent jump for a family plan. First, let’s talk about the health benefits reform piece of the legislation. Signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie on June 28, the legislation requires all public employees to contribute toward their health care based on a percentage of one’s premium. The contributions, which vary according to salaries and levels of coverage, will be phased in over four years for existing employees. The new regulations apply to all employees whose contract has expired and take effect after existing contracts expire. They also apply immediately to employees not covered by a union contract. But contributions won’t go below 1.5 percent of one’s salary, the minimum amount currently paid by most public employees. Once the premium-sharing percentages exceed that minimum amount, employees would contribute according to the percentages. Now, let’s turn to that "grid" Sweeney referred to in the radio interview. The grid breaks down the premium percentages according to salaries. Because Sweeney referred to the "average worker," we focused on someone earning $60,000, because federal data puts the average annual pay for a New Jersey state employee in that range. Based on the grid, that average worker would continue paying 1.5 percent of his salary in the first year, but starting in the second year, the percentage of premiums would increase his health care costs in each level of coverage. An average worker with family coverage would continue paying $900 in the first year, and then $1,615 in the second year, according to the senator’s grid. Sweeney spokesman Chris Donnelly, who said the senator was aware of our correspondence, acknowledged in an email that the average worker would be impacted in the second year. "The Senate President's goal with these reforms was to create a phase in system that was as fair as possible to lower and middle income workers. He succeeded in doing that," Donnelly wrote in an email. "While he firmly believes the cost of the new plans will lower premiums, if his comment that night mislead(s) anyone, he apologizes. It certainly was not done maliciously, so he hopes to avoid seeing his pants being on fire." But there’s one more problem with the senator’s calculation: we don’t know what the premiums will be yet. Sweeney used projected premiums in his grid, but the new legislation calls for two new committees to design new plans with an anticipated start date of Jan. 1, 2012. The senator argues the new plans could reduce premium costs. Alan Monheit, a professor of Health Economics at the Newark-based University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said the average premium may be lower than it would have been under the old system, because the new cost-sharing could drive employees to opt for cheaper plans. Still, premiums depend on a group’s level of health care spending, and the recent reform is mainly focused on shifting costs, Monheit said. Let’s review: Sweeney said in a radio interview that the average worker won’t pay higher health care costs until the third year of the new health benefits reform. But the senator’s own figures prove him wrong, showing increases starting in the second year. Also, the premiums at the heart of this debate have yet to be determined by the new committees. Have no fear, senator, this statement isn’t getting a Pants on Fire. We rate the statement Barely True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14104	University of Texas undergraduate student debt "is less than $21,000… probably one of the lowest debts across the nation."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/may/12/bill-mcraven/bill-mcraven-university-texas-says-ut-students-gra/	The University of Texas System’s chancellor suggests that if you’ve been a UT undergraduate--on any campus--you’re likely not buried in school debt. Bill McRaven prefaced his January 2016 declaration: "I’m proud to say, and I checked these numbers for about the hundredth time yesterday, because I always make sure that I don’t get my pants on fire in terms of that Pants on Fire meter." "But across the University of Texas," McRaven told the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, "our undergraduates..., their debt is less than $21,000… That’s probably one of the lowest debts across the nation--and so we’re proud of that."

A 12-year median Asked what McRaven was recalling, a UT System spokeswoman told us the median cumulative debt for certain UT graduates was $20,755 (meaning half the graduates had more debt, half had less) in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars. By email, Jenny LaCoste-Caputo said McRaven’s figure, based on data collected for graduates from UT institutions over the dozen years through 2012-13, reflected borrowing related to tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies as well as transportation and other expenses. Those figures show some graduates accumulating far less debt, others more. For instance, some 10 percent owe $5,415 or less while at the high end, 10 percent owe $42,051 or more. LaCoste-Caputo, asked why McRaven highlighted the 12-year median, said the chancellor seeks to show that a UT degree pays off. She said that according to a UT System analysis, median annual earnings of graduates 10 years after graduation run about $60,000. Whatever the chancellor's intention, 12 years struck us as a pretty wide time window. So to our request, LaCoste-Caputo provided the median debt for loan-taking graduates of UT schools solely for the latest available year, 2012-13. That median debt load was $23,350, some 13 percent greater than the 12-year median. Transfer students not considered We confirmed another wrinkle: UT's median debt figures don’t reflect every graduate or loan. LaCoste-Caputo said the median calculations consider only graduates who also had been first-time students on a UT campus--not reflecting any debts accumulated by transfer students from non-UT institutions such as community colleges. For the dozen years, she advised, McRaven relied on data for 43,900 bachelor’s degree recipients and didn’t have sufficient data for 82,380 degree recipients who borrowed money while attending other schools besides UT. Put another way, she said, the median figure McRaven touted considers information for about 35 percent of the student-borrowers to get a UT degree in the period. Brace yourself. We're about to share other ways of looking at UT student debt plus some national figures. Another Texas analysis More research made us think a graduate's debt level can be influenced by which UT school she or he embraces. On behalf of the coordinating board, spokeswoman Kelly Carper Polden replied to our email queries by saying loan-taking UT students who graduated in the 12 months through August 2015 had average debt ranging from less than $17,500 to more than $39,000, counting state, federal and reported parent loans. Average Debt, Loan-Taking Graduates, University of Texas Schools, Fiscal 2015 Institution Average Debt UT-Arlington $24,970 UT-Austin $39,305 UT-Brownsville $23,634 UT-Dallas $24,028 UT-El Paso $22,593 UT–Pan American $17,264 The University of Texas of the Permian Basin $20,516 UT-Rio Grande Valley* Not Available* UT-San Antonio $30,406 UT-Tyler $28,474 SOURCE: Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (chart fielded by email from Kelly Carper Polden, assistant director of communications, May 6, 2016) *UT-RGV, bringing together the former UT-Brownsville and UT-Pan American, started operations in September 2015. From beyond Texas, Sandy Baum of the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute nudged us to information on a federal website enabling us to peg the median federal-loan student debt for 2013-14 graduates from each of nine UT campuses. By our calculation, the median across the UT schools averaged $18,465. Graduates of UT-Pan American had the lowest median debt, $12,994. Graduates of UT-San Antonio had the biggest, $23,723. Also, Sara Goldrick-Rab at the University of Wisconsin responded to our inquiry by suggesting we consider work by the Oakland-based Institute for College Access & Success, an independent nonprofit that says it works to make higher education more available and affordable for people of all backgrounds. Next, the institute’s Matthew Reed said by email that according to data volunteered by the majority of U.S. colleges to Peterson’s, which publishes a college guide, among 2013-14 graduates from UT schools who took out loans, the average debt level (not adjusted for inflation) ranged, by campus, from $14,900, at UT-Pan American, to $27,337, at UT-San Antonio--with average debt at the Austin flagship being $27,207. An institute spreadsheet also showed average loan totals for graduates of UT-Dallas ($19,613), UT-Arlington ($23,210) and UT-El Paso ($24,000). All told, these figures suggest a 2013-14 average debt level for loan-taking UT graduates of $22,711--about $2,000 more than McRaven’s 12-year inflation-adjusted median figure. But the "transfers" caveat persists: Reed said that like McRaven, the institute was limited to data for students who went to the same institution before graduating; no transfers considered. What gives? Reed said colleges resist efforts to collect data for all students, saying it’s unfair to hold them accountable for students who borrowed while studying elsewhere. Separately, Mark Kantrowitz, a Chicago-based expert, said by phone that Congress even barred the government from tracking individual students and their respective debt loads. "Not perfect data," Reed said, "but they’re the best available." UT versus nation McRaven also said UT students probably carry smaller debt loads than peers nationally. Asked how he reached that judgment, LaCoste-Caputo pointed out the College Board’s Trends in Student Aid 2015 report, which states that in 2012-13, the average cumulative debt for bachelor’s degree recipients from U.S. public, four-year institutions was $25,500. Worth noting: 61 percent of students who earned bachelor’s degrees in 2013-14 from the public or private nonprofit four-year institutions at which they began their studies graduated with debt, the report says. Such borrowers, it says, averaged $26,900 in loans, reflecting an inflation-adjusted increase of 17 percent over a decade. Separately, we spotted an institute web page stating the average debt of 2013-14 graduates of public four-year institutions was $25,902 with the average debt in federal loans equaling $22,901. The average debt for graduates of private nonprofit institutions was $29,567, according to the page. And by our read of the spreadsheet provided by Reed, the average debt for loan-taking graduates of six reporting UT schools exceeded the average debt for graduates from about 200 other institutions nationally. But the UT average trailed the average for graduates of about 910 U.S. colleges and universities. By phone, Kantrowitz said that by his estimate, debt accumulated by 2015 loan-taking U.S. college graduates averaged $35,000, counting federal and private-institution loans. Worse: Kantrowitz said he projects 2016 graduates to average about $37,000 in accumulated debt. We wondered why his figures considerably outpace estimates from others. Kantrowitz said he rolls in data from more institutions, public and private. He also emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that about 70 percent of recent graduates carry some school-loan debt. Our ruling McRaven said that across the UT system, undergraduate student debt "is less than $21,000… probably one of the lowest debts across the nation." The experiences of graduates over a dozen years supports this figure. Data also support the notion that UT graduates wind up less debt-burdened than most peers. Still, UT's analysis (like others) doesn't account for debts piled up by transfer students. Significantly too, UT graduates in 2012-13 had a median debt of $23,350, which outpaces the long-term figure aired by McRaven by more than $2,000. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-08707	Jim Dunnam "has not lived in the district he represents for years now."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/06/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-democratic-house-leade/	When the chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus goes home, does he stay in the Waco-area district he represents? That’s turf covered -- actually, re-plowed -- by the Republican Party of Texas in an Aug. 30 e-mail blast saying state Rep. Jim Dunnam "has not lived in the district he represents for years now." The party chairman, Steve Munisteri, had earlier levelled the same charge in a Waco press conference. We wondered what was what, and where. Some background: Article 3 of the Texas Constitution says House members must be Texas residents for two years and, before their election, must have lived for at least a year in the district they would represent. A similar one-year provision applies to Senate candidates, though they must have lived in Texas for five years; that hurdle has been in the news in connection with Republican Brian Birdwell’s eligibility to fill the Texas Senate seat he recently won in a special election. Birdwell has acknowledged voting for president in Virginia in 2004. Dunnam’s legal residency has been challenged before. After the 2002 elections, Dunnam was sued by his defeated GOP foe, who said the legislator, his wife and children had lived since 1998 near McGregor (a Waco suburb) in a house no longer in the district Dunnam represents. Dunnam’s house was cut out of his district when a state board redrew districts in 2001, according an Associated Press report from the time. The story quotes Dunnam saying he’d moved to a smaller house in his redrawn district (which he told us he later sold), but also kept the house near McGregor because he didn't want to uproot his kids from the Midway school district until absolutely necessary. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a judge. This August, the Waco Tribune-Herald quoted Munisteri saying the party now plans no legal challenge to Dunnam’s legal residency. The chairman said "residency cases are extremely difficult to win" because the state’s standard for determining residency is based in part on a candidate’s intended residence. "You can be absent from a location for a significant period of time and still be determined to be in the district legally," Munisteri said. But "there’s a difference between legally being in the district and really in the district." The Tribune-Herald and the Dallas Morning News subsequently quoted Dunnam saying he owns the house outside his district so his children can attend Midway schools--plus a rural home he considers his homestead in nearby Falls County, which is in Dunnam’s district. Dunnam told the Morning News that he votes in Chilton in Falls County where he and his wife built their house on 90 acres. Using Google Maps, we determined the Falls County home is about 20 miles south of Dunnam’s house near McGregor. On a website titled "Done With Dunnam," the GOP presents two from-the-road photos of the Falls County house, both taken July 31, according to a notation. The GOP’s caption: "No activity in and out of house and no cars in the driveway." The Republican Party also presents two photographs taken from the street of Dunnam’s house near McGregor, one taken July 18 and the other July 31. In one photo, two of three cars are clearly visible; one has a "state official" license plate. The photos are captioned: "Plenty of activity in and out of the house and cars bearing state official plates in the driveway." Dunnam, objecting to the criticism, told the Morning News: "My constituents have no issue with me and my roots. I've been there 46 years and was literally born in the district -- and my dad was too, and my kids were." Separately, the Texas Tribune quoted Dunnam saying that since his homestead is in his district, Dunnam was confident he clears the constitution’s residency hurdle. Falls County confirmed that Dunnam claims the house as his homestead. According to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, one can do so if the home is their "principal residence" on Jan. 1 of the tax year. We also checked the Midway district’s residency requirement. Its website says that admission is free to students if they "and either parent reside in the district." Generally, district spokeswoman Traci Marlin told us, students must live within the school district with a parent who has legal custody or a legal guardian. Marlin said for the purposes of enrolling a student, the district doesn’t weigh whether their families take their homestead exemption on a house outside the district. So, where does Dunnam actually live? When we initially put that question to the legislator, Dunnam said, "I’ll be in Houston tonight, I spent three nights in Austin last week ... I have a residence (the country place) and I spend time at various locations." Hmmm. Is it reasonable to conclude that Dunnam lives apart from his wife and children in his homestead residence in Falls County? Or -- since the Midway district requires at least one parent or guardian of a child to live in the district and Dunnam and his wife appear to be an intact couple -- does it make more sense to conclude the family stays mostly at the house near McGregor? In a follow-up interview, Dunnam said he lives in the Falls County house, which he’d earlier said the couple completed about five years ago. "I live in Chilton," Dunnam said. But "I do spend time at my other house." Dunnam said too that both he and his wife are registered to vote in Falls County and have driver’s licenses with the Falls County address. And, he said, the Midway district has the Falls County address as his home address. We asked if he’d provide us access to that record--which would confirm he’s told the district he doesn’t live at the home near McGregor. Dunnam said he’d do so if we could assure him that would "be dispositive" -- ending our inquiry. We couldn’t guarantee that. He added: "It is unreasonable for you to assume anything about my personal life because you don’t know." True, and neither does the Republican Party. The party’s statement hinges on what is meant by where someone "lives." By a strict interpretation -- the one used by the GOP -- that would be where Dunnam stays most often. But determining that would take significant detective work, far more than a few photos. A broader interpretation would allow for the possibility Dunnam hasn’t lived exclusively in his House district for years, but instead flits between -- and lives in -- both houses. Our take: The party’s statement has an element of truth, but more than that isn’t proven; we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Texas	None	None	None	2010-09-06T06:00:00	2010-08-30	['None']
pomt-04298	Says Matt Wand has sided with anti-choice activists "to restrict access to reproductive health care services."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/01/democratic-party-oregon/did-matt-wand-side-activists-limit-acc/	The Democratic Party of Oregon has sent a mailer in a heated east Multnomah County legislative race, criticizing incumbent Rep. Matt Wand, R-Troutdale, as a know-it-all who doesn’t trust women to make their own medical decisions. "Wand wants to take away a woman’s right to make her own personal medical decisions," the mailer reads. "Matt Wand thinks he knows better than women or their doctors. Matt Wand has sided with extreme anti-choice activists to restrict access to reproductive health care services." The mailer urges a vote for the Democrat in the race, Chris Gorsek, who is endorsed by Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon. We wanted to know whether Wand, who is endorsed by Oregon Right to Life, sided with activists "to restrict access to reproductive health care services." The mailer doesn't mention the word abortion at all -- not once -- but the evidence cited for the claim is Senate Bill 901 from 2011. The legislation would have re-defined Planned Parenthood and other clinics that provide abortions as "ambulatory surgical centers," subject to the same regulations as centers that do plastic surgery, spine surgery, vision laser surgery, and so on. The legislation would have applied to places that advertise as offering abortions, 10 or more in a month, 100 or more in a year. Wand, a freshman, signed on to the bill, along with 11 state senators, all Republicans. The legislation was introduced in February and assigned to a committee in March, where it died. There was no hearing. House Republicans, who suggested the fact check, and Oregon Right to Life, the anti-abortion group behind the legislation, say the bill was aimed at making abortions safer, not at restricting them. "Terming SB901 as a ‘restriction to reproductive health service’ is pretty much over the top," said executive director Gayle Atteberry in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. Oregon Right to Life opposes abortion except in cases where the mother’s life is in immediate danger. Planned Parenthood advocates, on the other hand, say that Atteberry’s characterization is highly misleading. Abortions are already safe, they say, and the bill is part of a national agenda to burden abortion clinics with structural regulations -- for example, corridor and door width -- that have nothing to do with patient safety. Jimmy Radosta, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, said the legislation would have required major renovation of its clinics. "The only way to comply would be to tear down and start all over again," he said. Clearly, the bill was aimed at clinics that offer abortion services, which are likely the first stops for women who lack insurance or a regular ob-gyn. Planned Parenthood also has contracts with insurers and provides abortions for physicians who contract with those insurance carriers. But it’s important to note that the legislation would not have applied to all abortion providers. Physicians could continue to offer both medical and surgical abortions at private medical offices, or at hospitals such as Oregon Health & Science University’s women’s health clinic. The legislation also would not have applied to the Lovejoy Surgicenter because the Northwest Portland facility is already an "ambulatory surgical center." Lovejoy is a significant provider and claims on its website that in calendar year 2008 the center performed 55 percent of the 7,100 abortions in the tri-county area. We figured we should hear from Wand on why he supported the bill. He said he couldn’t recall who had brought the legislation to him, although it was probably one of the state senators. Wand said it made sense to consider regulating abortion clinics the same way as places that do "face lifts and tummy tucks." He said Democrats’ "lying about my respect for women is pretty egregious." Trent Lutz, executive director of the Democratic Party of Oregon, noted in an e-mail that Wand has accepted campaign money and other assistance from Oregon Right to Life. "SB 901 would have effectively shut down every provider in the state. We continue to believe that Matt Wand is out of touch and wrong on women's health," he said. Whether Wand is out of touch is an opinion to which he and Democrats are entitled. We do, however, take issue with the assertion about the bill’s impact. Anyone reading the mailer cold might assume that Wand is an extreme anti-abortionist who wants to take away a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions. Given the "reproductive health care services" language, maybe he’s even against contraception. But the bill wasn’t nearly as drastic as that. The legislation focused on abortion, targeting clinics that provide them. But with abortions performed in a variety of places -- at private medical offices, at the women’s health center at Oregon Health & Science University, at Lovejoy Surgicenter -- the legislation would not have shut down every provider as Lutz claims. Wand co-sponsored legislation that in all likelihood would have translated into fewer places for women to go; his stated motivation was safety, not necessarily a desire to restrict access. We realize that for some advocates, this issue isall or nothing; either you’re with us or against us, on both sides. We take a middle road. The statement is partially accurate -- Wand did side with Oregon Right to Life on legislation that would have affected providers -- but it leaves out important details. The legislation did not target all providers and, in fact, would not have affected a significant provider in the metro area. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01909	U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston "requested more earmarks than any other GA Congressman and all GA GOP members combined."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/01/david-perdue/does-kingston-bring-home-bacon/	Earmarks are the money lawmakers yank from the federal budget to benefit their jurisdictions. Critics of the system tend to use the pejorative term "pork" for the same taxpayer-funded projects. A pivot to that first definition helped U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi beat a tough tea party-backed challenger in the GOP runoff last week. Cochran focused on the money he brought to the Magnolia State. A recent attack in Georgia’s tight Republican runoff for the U.S. Senate focused more on the second understanding of the term, with a tweet for all the Internet to see. "Jack Kingston requested more earmarks than any other GA Congressman and all GA GOP members combined." David Perdue wrote over pictures of pigs feeding at the trough, lest anyone miss his contempt. That’s a pretty specific claim. And if there’s anything PolitiFact Georgia loves to check, it’s the specifics, especially with the July 22 runoff between Perdue and Kingston looming. Perdue said he based his claim on databases created by the Center for Responsive Politics of OpenSecrets.org. Perdue, a former Dollar General CEO, is running as an outsider who sees earmarks as a type of overspending from longtime Washington representatives such as Kingston. "Before my congressman brings money back to Georgia, I want to know what debt I am going to be responsible for," Perdue said. "The earmark provision drives up the debt and is a free pass on the budget responsibility we want from our congressmen and senators." That kind of criticism prompted Congress to abstain from pork in 2010. Kingston told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2008 that he had cut back on his requests for earmarks over those complaints. But he also noted his concern that other states would get more money if he and other Georgia lawmakers quit the practice. Open Secrets allows searches to see how much money members of Congress steered to their district for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. Fiscal years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Our review of those databases shows Kingston made 145 requests in those three years, pulling in about $211 million. His next closest colleague had 213 earmarks, totaling about $202 million. But that’s from U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, a Democrat from Albany. Next on the list from the GOP was U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta, who lost to Perdue and Kingston in the May primary. He had 58 earmarks that totaled about $94 million. Together, Georgia’s GOP delegation had about $327 million in earmarks for the three years. Kingston’s total was larger than the other six Republican lawmakers combined. Rep Party/District 2010 2009 2008 Total Jack Kingston R-1 $66,787,000 $44,295,625 $100,273,800 $211,356,425 Sanford Bishop D-2 $60,565,000 $66,440,894 $75,141,000 $202,146,894 Lynn Westmoreland R-3 $0 $0 $4,976,000 $4,976,000 Hank Johnson D-4 $26,688,000 $24,785,750 $14,763,000 $66,236,750 John Lewis D-5 $24,529,000 $18,009,500 $15,135,500 $57,674,000 Tom Price R-6 $0 $0 $2,705,000 $2,705,000 John Linder R-7 $1,000,000 $0 $2,255,000 $3,255,000 Jim Marshall D-8 $40,781,000 $31,510,000 $50,070,500 $122,361,500 Nathan Deal R-9 $2,092,000 $0 $8,552,000 $10,644,000 Paul Broun R-10 $0 $0 $0 $0 Phil Gingrey R-11 $15,800,000 $48,537,750 $29,696,500 $94,034,250 John Barrow D-12 $5,350,000 $15,046,000 $21,280,000 $41,676,000 David Scott D-13 $38,828,000 $27,940,500 $13,432,500 $80,201,000 Tom Graves R-14 n/a n/a n/a n/a Source: Open Secrets website To double-check our numbers, we reached out to Taxpayers for Common Sense, who provides the raw data for the searchable Open Secrets site. The nonprofit, with staffers who have worked for both Democrats and Republicans, shows slightly different tallies for those years – but comes to the same broad conclusion. It counts 146 earmarks from Kingston, totaling about $213 million. That compares with $116 million in earmarks from the other six GOP congressmen. Kingston, who represents five of Georgia’s eight military installations, noted that much of the funding was for defense or military spending such as an IED simulator at Fort Stewart and hospital renovations at installations statewide. Kingston contrasted that record with Perdue’s, whose business record includes a brief leadership of Pillowtex, a troubled North Carolina textile firm that went under shortly after he left. "The majority of what we did was for the military," Kingston said. "I don’t know that we need lectures on fiscal responsibility from somebody with his abysmal track record." In isolation, those costs don’t appear to be a problem, said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers For Common Sense. But money spent there is money not available for other projects that may be more critical. But without the procurement process that follows other federal spending, there’s no way to judge the merit of the projects being funded, he said. "If a congressman is saying they know their district better than a pointed-headed bureaucrat, that’s absolutely true," Ellis said. "But with earmarks, they’re saying they know what’s best for all 435 congressional districts. And that’s not true at all." Perdue said Kingston had more earmarks than any other congressman in the state and more than Georgia’s other GOP congressmen combined. Two separate databases back him up. It’s up to voters to decide whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing. There is one caveat to Perdue’s claim. It covers three years, and Kingston has been in office for two decades. It’s that bit of context that moves it down just a notch on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate Perdue’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05263	Says Sen. Sherrod Brown "cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-cast-deciding-vote-/	Republican Josh Mandel, the Ohio state treasurer hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from his U.S. Senate seat in November, makes the most of the 30 seconds in his TV ad "Change." The campaign spot makes at least five separate claims about the two candidates. PolitiFact Ohio will take a look at several of them in the days ahead. For this factcheck item we’ll look at the statement that Brown "cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care." The statement claim caught our attention because it combines two claims we've examined before. To back it up, the commercial cites the Senate's roll call vote of Dec. 24, 2009, on H.R. 3590, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law commonly known as Obamacare. Did Brown cast the deciding vote? That depends on how you define "deciding." Mandel's campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee both have explained their logic in crediting or blaming Brown for the deciding vote: The measure passed with the 60 votes that were required. Anything short of that would have effectively killed the legislation through the equivalent of a filibuster. Every vote is decisive, therefore every vote is "deciding," they say. The NRSC has made the same claim about other Democratic senators, too. There is, however, also this to consider: Before the votes were taken, Democrats and Republicans kept a count of supporters and opponents, and Democrats could only round up 59 proponents to end debate -- until Ben Nelson of Nebraska agreed to join in. News coverage on that day, Dec. 19, 2009, described Nelson as the crucial 60th vote to break the filibuster. Brown’s vote was actually the seventh "yes" among the 60 senators who supported a Senate bill that had to be reconciled with a House version on Christmas Eve 2009. His vote was cast early in the roll call, which is done in alphabetical order. When the two sides came together and the Senate voted on the final version, on March 25, 2010, Brown voted eighth. Both measures passed with exactly 60 votes. Brown's vote was crucial. Following the rationale of the Mandel camp and of the NRSC, any of those 60 votes could be called a deciding vote. But Brown did nothing (such as holding his support until the last moment) that would justify singling him out. What about the other part of the claim, where Mandel's ad refers to the health care act as "the government takeover of health care"? Mandel’s ad repeats a claim that has been reviewed numerous times by PolitiFact and rated False or Pants on Fire. PolitiFact national recognized it as the 2010 "Lie of the Year." FactCheck.org called it "nonsensical" and a "whopper," saying the reform plan is neither "government-run" nor a "government takeover." The Washington Post Fact Checker classified it as myth. It is true that the law does significantly increase government regulation of health insurers. But it is a system that relies on private companies and the free market. Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. Brown’s vote for the health care reform legislation was crucial, but was it the deciding vote? A listener hearing the Mandel ad could be lead to believe Brown’s vote had more weight than other votes. Yet, he certainly did not cast the 60th vote, and he did not have to be wooed for support. And it is not accurate to state that he voted for a "government takeover of health care." On the Truth-O-Meter, this claim from Mandel’s ad rates False.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-05-30T06:00:00	2012-05-23	['None']
pomt-01848	The Obama administration "manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/15/lou-dobbs/lou-dobbs-obama-administration-manipulated-deporta/	If you want to make a point about immigration, there’s probably a statistic for you. Immigration numbers are often more complicated than they appear, and the mire induces partisan fights among those who consider President Barack Obama a record-setting "deporter-in-chief" and others who say he’s doing a lousy job securing the border and handling the influx of migrant children. An enduring claim about Obama’s deportation numbers from Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs epitomizes this issue. "They manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration," Dobbs said July 1, 2014. "The Homeland Security secretary had to admit before Congress that was not the case -- that, in fact, they were manipulating the numbers." Dobbs is not only accusing the government of fudging the numbers to make Obama look tougher, he’s saying a Cabinet-level adviser admitted as much. We found some debate about the deportation numbers, but Dobbs goes too far in calling it a deliberate scheme. We’ll walk you through it. Crash course: Immigration lingo Defining deportations is not as easy as it sounds. In federal government lingo, official judicial or administrative orders to leave the country are called "removals," and they can happen right at the border or anywhere else on American soil. A removal is what most people would consider a deportation. But for people caught illegally crossing the border and simply turned around, there’s another term: "return." Unlike removals, a return does not bar someone from legally entering the country someday, though that is hard for most because they do not have a family or employment connection necessary to get in line for citizenship, said David Martin, a University of Virginia School of Law professor. Martin also worked as Immigration and Naturalization Service general counsel in the Clinton administration and as DHS deputy general counsel from 2009-10 under Obama. The Border Patrol primarily handles voluntary returns to Mexico, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, equipped with immigration judges and detention center beds, generally handles removals. Over the past several administrations, the Department of Homeland Security has shifted its immigration focus to undocumented immigrants who commit crimes or are caught at the border. The idea is to get them out, and keep them out. The shift picked up in the George W. Bush administration and intensified under Obama’s watch. Whereas many immigrants previously caught at the border simply were bused back to Mexico, they now are returned with official deportation orders, prosecuted, or moved to different parts of the border so they cannot reconnect with their smuggler, Martin said. In short, these people previously would have been classified as a "return," but the policy has been to put them through removal proceedings. As such, they are classified as a "removal." Counting removals Dobbs said the government is twisting its statistics to make it look like it’s deporting more people than Bush. He didn’t return our request for comment, but it’s likely he’s focusing on the policy shift we just described to formally remove people trying to cross the border. What he’s getting at: Obama is boosting his "removal" statistics by including people who used to be on the "return" list. To check the numbers, we turned to two different sources, though each has its problems. The first comes from Immigration and Customs Enforcement data. The following chart from the Bipartisan Policy Center reflects the trend of more total removals, according to ICE data. Starting in FY 2008, the data is broken down by interior removals and border removals. Breakdowns of removals prior to 2008 are not available. . The chart shows the total number of removals is up, and the share of removals from the border has been increasing since 2008. By 2013, 64 percent of the year’s 369,000 ICE removals were people who crossed the border and put through a formal process before leaving the country, a jump of 28 percentage points from 2008. The number of people deported from within the country fell accordingly, from 64 percent in 2008 to 36 percent in 2013. The second set of data from the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which measures removals and returns separately for each fiscal year (Oct. 1-Sept. 30). It includes data from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which houses the Border Patrol. The most recent data is through 2012. According to Homeland Security data, removals have indeed climbed over recent years, starting in 2006 and continuing under Obama. But returns, which don’t carry formal consequences, have gone down. The recession and increased border resources are partially credited for the decline in returns, as is the shift in policy. "To me, the thing that really stands out with the lower number of returns is fewer number of people are getting apprehended at the border in the first place," said Matt Graham, a Bipartisan Policy Center immigration analyst. "(Obama) has fewer opportunities to return people." Removals are highest on an annual basis under Obama, says Theresa Brown, Bipartisan Policy Center director of immigration policy. But if you factor in returns, Bush indeed outpaces Obama. "If you want to say that he’s removed more people than any other administration, then that’s true," Brown said. "If you want to say he hasn’t actually expelled more people than any other president, that might also be true." People should be more precise so we know exactly what they mean by "deportation," Brown said. "It’s the difference between getting off with a warning and going to court." ‘Manipulating deportation data’ So that’s a look at the data -- and why it can be confusing. Now we want to look at Dobbs’ accusation that the Obama administration "manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration." This, too, goes back to the policy change of how people crossing the border illegally are handled. Usually pundits and politicians say ICE is the agency inflating its numbers by formally removing people handed over from the Border Patrol. "These numbers show that the president is hardly the deporter-in-chief as so many of the ethnic advocacy groups have tried to paint him," said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that opposes Obama’s proposed immigration reforms. Right-leaning news sites and pundits revived these claims after Department of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson appeared before a House subcommittee to answer questions about his budget requests. Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, tried to drill down into the agency’s methodology, and Johnson noted a large chunk of the 368,644 people deported by ICE in 2013 were essentially caught at the border. (Again, we’re talking about how people were previously handled as a "return" but are now processed as a "removal" with consequences.) Culberson: "But under the Obama administration, more than half of those removals that were attributed to ICE are actually a result of Border Patrol arrests that wouldn't have been counted in prior administrations." Johnson: "Correct." The "correct" was heard around the conservative blogosphere, with some sites taking it as Johnson finally admitting administrative malpractice. Vaughan’s Center for Immigration Studies billed it as "a truth finally admitted" that ICE is taking credit for arrests made by Border Patrol agents to beef up its deportation numbers. But is the change in tactics a manipulation of data? Experts we talked to said no. "Under these previous administrations, they would have been voluntarily returned, not formally removed," Brown said. "Now they are formally removed." "Transferring of people from Border Patrol to ICE is not trying to trick the numbers," said Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute immigration policy analyst. "It’s a result of punishing illegal immigrants more heavily than they did before." Our ruling Dobbs said the federal government "manipulated deportation data to make it appear that the Border Patrol was deporting more illegal immigrants than the Bush administration." Deportations or "removals" under Obama are tracking higher than during the Bush years using the most literal deportation statistics, as well as those solely from ICE. Dobbs’ contention that the Obama administration is inflating its number is an interpretation of a change in federal policy to process and remove people trying to enter the country illegally rather than just turn them around. Whether you agree with the policy, those formal removals are occurring. That strategy is rooted in previous administrations but was accelerated by Obama so that people trying to cross the border illegally face more significant consequences and receive formal deportation orders. We rate the claim False.	None	Lou Dobbs	None	None	None	2014-07-15T11:00:00	2014-07-01	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush', 'United_States_Border_Patrol']
pomt-01132	Says President Barack Obama has said "that everybody should hate the police."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/23/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-obama-propaganda-says-everybody-should-ha/	Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani blamed President Barack Obama for anti-police "propaganda" that eventually led to the shooting death of two New York City police officers. The Dec. 20 shooting happened amid rising tension between the black community and law enforcement across the country over racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Commenting on the shooting on Fox News, Giuliani said politicians’ rhetoric, as well as protests, exacerbate the tension. "We’ve had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police," Giuliani said. "The protests are being embraced, the protests are being encouraged. The protests, even the ones that don’t lead to violence, a lot of them lead to violence, all of them lead to a conclusion: The police are bad, the police are racist. That is completely wrong." Giuliani’s claim that Obama said something akin to "everybody should hate the police" struck us as overheated right off the bat, so we decided to look into it. We asked Giuliani for a response but we didn't hear back. Almost one month ago, Giuliani faced backlash for some controversial remarks about race and the criminal justice system. He questioned why the same Americans protesting black deaths at the hands of white police officers do not voice similar outrage about black-on-black crime. In response to his most recent comments, we sifted through Obama’s statements and interviews on the subject since August, when the situation first bubbled up after a white police officer killed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Even the most distorted readings of Obama’s remarks cannot be interpreted as encouraging people to "hate the police." Obama has repeatedly emphasized that the work police do is dangerous to themselves but very important to the community. He has said that although "a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement" (an oft-repeated talking point), the vast majority of law enforcement officers do not carry out the law in a discriminatory manner. He has also argued that improvement -- achieved through peaceful and cooperative means -- is necessary. Part of Giuliani’s point is that Obama has been empathetic to the protesters, which he has been -- though cautiously so. And he has always discouraged violent protests and excessive police response. Here’s a selection of telling passages from Obama’s comments on race and the criminal justice system since August. We fail to see how they support Guiliani’s point. Aug. 14, Obama's first statement following Brown's death: There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.... Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority. Aug. 18, Obama’s second statement following Brown’s death: I’ve said this before -- in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement... This is not an argument that there isn’t real crime out there, and that law enforcement doesn't have a difficult job and that they have to be honored and respected for the danger and difficulty of law enforcement. Sept. 28, speech at the Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner: In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement… One recent poll showed that the majority of Americans think the criminal justice system doesn’t treat people of all races equally…. And that has a corrosive effect -- not just on the black community; it has a corrosive effect on America. It harms the communities that need law enforcement the most. It makes folks who are victimized by crime and need strong policing reluctant to go to the police because they may not trust them. Nov. 24, remarks following a grand jury’s decision not to indict the officer who shot Brown: Understand, our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They’ve got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law…. The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color. Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country. And this is tragic, because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates…. There are issues in which the law too often feels as if it is being applied in discriminatory fashion. I don't think that's the norm. I don't think that's true for the majority of communities or the vast majority of law enforcement officials. But these are real issues. Dec. 1, remarks after meeting with community and law enforcement Ferguson laid bare a problem that is not unique to St. Louis or that area, and is not unique to our time, and that is a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color…. We also heard law enforcement and were reminded of what a tough job it is to be in law enforcement. Whether you’re in a big city or in a small community, as (Attorney General) Eric Holder put it, police officers have the right to come home. And if they’re in dangerous circumstances, we have to be able to put ourselves in their shoes and recognize that they do have a tough job. Dec. 3, remarks after grand jury decision not to indict New York City officers involved in death of Eric Garner I say that as somebody who believes that law enforcement has an incredibly difficult job, that every man or woman in uniform are putting their lives at risk to protect us, that they have the right to come home, just like we do from our jobs, that there’s real crime out there that they’ve got to tackle day in and day out -- but that they’re only going to be able to do their job effectively if everybody has confidence in the system. And right now, unfortunately, we are seeing too many instances where people just do not have confidence that folks are being treated fairly. And in some cases, those may be misperceptions; but in some cases, that’s a reality. Dec. 8, interview with BET And one of the things that I want us to make sure we understand is that, communities of color need good law enforcement. I mean, there’s a lot of crime, and one of the things that we talked about on Monday here was you’ve got young people who end up getting caught between police that they don’t trust and folks on the streets who are trying to rough them up…. And I’ve said it before: The vast majority of law enforcement officers are doing a really tough job, and most of them are doing it well and are trying to do the right thing. But a combination of bad training, in some cases; a combination in some cases of departments that really are not trying to root out biases, or tolerate sloppy police work; a combination in some cases of folks just not knowing any better, and in a lot of cases, subconscious fear of folks who look different -- all of this contributes to a national problem that’s going to require a national solution. Our ruling Giuliani said Obama has said "that everybody should hate the police." Throughout all of his comments since August, when the latest unrest over racial disparities in the criminal justice system began, Obama has continuously encouraged working with police to find solutions and make change. He has also repeatedly emphasized the importance of law enforcement in communities of color and the fact that police officers have a dangerous job. Giuliani’s claim is an outlandish distortion of what Obama actually said. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-14440	Says Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay prison and bring terrorists "right here to Colorado."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/mar/08/jon-keyser/jon-keyser-says-michael-bennet-wants-bring-gitmo-t/	Even before President Barack Obama sent a plan to Congress to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Republican opponents were accusing Colorado's incumbent Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of pushing to "bring terrorists" to a Colorado prison. No one's banged the drum louder against Bennet than Jon Keyser, who's among more than a dozen GOP candidates vying to claim Bennet's Senate seat in the November general election. "We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado," Keyser said at a Feb. 11 GOP Senate candidates' forum at the University of Denver. Keyser and his campaign have made similar statements at other campaign stops, in news releases and on social media. We looked at Bennet’s record over the years on the Guantanamo Bay prison -- informally called "Gitmo" -- for evidence that he advocated bringing suspected terrorists to Colorado. Bennet's closing conditions Since 2009, Bennet has backed Obama's plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, saying: "I do support the closure because I think it is an important signal to the rest of the world about our devotion to the rule of law." The United States has faced international criticism about the treatment of prisoners at Gitmo, and some Western countries have said the accused terrorists should be granted prisoner of war protections under the Geneva Conventions. However, Bennet has placed conditions on his support for relocating Gitmo detainees from the start. He said they are being tried in military tribunals, so if they are moved to the United States, they should be held in a military prison. He also has pressed the administration to provide a plan on relocating detainees and consult with local and state officials before prisoners are moved. "President Obama and his administration owe the American people a much more detailed plan of what they are going to do with the detainees," Bennet said in 2009. Colorado doesn't have a military prison, and Bennet opposes housing detainees in the state’s civilian prisons, including the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence -- known as ADX or "supermax" -- the highest-security federal prison in the country. In May 2009, Obama pledged to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010. The move, without a plan of where the prisoners would be relocated, irked congressional lawmakers. On May 20, 2009, Bennet voted with fellow senators to reject an effort to spend $80 million to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and to relocate the terrorism suspects, possibly to U.S. prisons. But an amendment Bennet backed to prohibit funding to transfer Gitmo detainees to the United States was stripped out of the bill by a conference committee that irons out legislative language differences between Senate and House bills. Bennet did not serve on that committee. A freshman senator, Bennet got into a dust-up during the 2009 debate with senior California Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- a fellow Democrat -- who said in a floor speech that Colorado’s supermax prison would be a perfect home for Gitmo detainees. "This facility houses not only drug kingpins, serial murderers and gang leaders, but also terrorists who have already been convicted of crimes in this country," she said. Bennet disagreed in a statement, saying, "I strongly support the Senate's decision to withhold funding for the transfer of the detainees until the Administration comes up with a plan for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Because the detainees are being tried by military tribunals, they should be held in military facilities. Military detainees should not be transported to and held at Supermax because it is not a military facility." In the same 2009 bill, Bennet voted for a Republican senator's nonbinding resolution calling on the defense secretary to consult with state and local government officials before making any decision about where Guantanamo detainees may be transferred if Gitmo was closed by a presidential executive order. We asked the Keyser campaign for evidence supporting the candidate’s claim that Bennet wants to "bring [terrorists] right here to Colorado." Keyser campaign spokesman Matt Connelly replied that "Bennet knew that Colorado was at the top of the list" of U.S. prisons where the Obama administration has considered transferring Gitmo detainees. He cited a 2009 address in which Obama suggested that Supermax could be a potential home for detainees. "As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists," Obama said. Yet, other prisons have also been reported as possible replacements for Gitmo, including military facilities like Fort Leavenworth, Kan., or the U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. Connelly said that Bennet has voted against two Republican amendments to ban the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United States. He also voted against an amendment to block funds to prepare U.S. facilities to house detainees. Connelly said such votes effectively laid the groundwork for Gitmo detainees to be transferred to the United States, including Colorado. "It’s laughable that after years of silence, Sen. Bennet is now arguing that he didn’t want to send Gitmo terrorists to Colorado, even though he voted three times to make it happen," he said. Keyser's case Let’s examine the Keyser campaign’s defense of its candidate’s claims. They point to Bennet’s 2013 vote against an amendment by Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would have prohibited the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo bay to facilities in the United States. Congressional records confirm Bennet’s vote that helped kill the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2014 fiscal year. Bennet spokesman Adam Bozzi said Bennet disagreed with the Ayotte amendment’s requirements about how the Defense Department certifies the security of a foreign government before a Guantanamo detainee could be transferred to that country. Bennet supported another proposal for safeguards on transferring detainees to foreign countries, Bozzi said. Ultimately, Bennet voted with an 84-to-15 Senate majority for a compromise on Guantanamo, which retained a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States while easing the transfer of detainees to foreign countries. It was part of the defense-funding bill that was signed into law. Keyser’s spokesman added that Bennet also voted against a 2012 amendment by Ayotte to block funding for transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. But Bennet’s spokesman counters that the senator voted against the amendment because it would have imposed a permanent ban on funding the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States, which a legislative report confirmed. The amendment would have also blocked other Obama administration options, including prosecuting detainees in a federal court in the United States. Given that Bennet supports closing Gitmo and potentially moving some detainees to a U.S. military prison, the senator opposed the permanent ban, his spokesman said. The permanent domestic-transfer ban amendment and a similar House amendment were left out of the final version of the 2013 defense appropriations bill to avoid a threatened White House veto. Records show Bennet instead voted for a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States that was included in the 2013 defense-funding bill. Lastly, the Keyser campaign points to Bennet’s 2009 vote to kill a Republican amendment that would have barred the use of funds to construct or modify prisons in the United States or its territories to hold Guantanamo Bay detainees. Bozzi, Bennet’s spokesman, again noted that Bennet, who supports closing Gitmo and moving at least some detainees to a U.S. military prison, of course opposed the amendment that would have blocked construction funding that could be used to prepare a military prison to securely hold the prisoners. "I’ve repeatedly said I do not support the transfer of prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay military facility to Colorado," Bennet said recently in response to President Obama sending his Guantanamo-closure plan to Congress. "I’ve voted to close the prison, but I believe military detainees should be held in military prisons. Colorado does not have that type of facility. This plan has done nothing to change my mind. These detainees should not be transferred to Colorado." Our ruling Keyser said, "We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado." Keyser’s campaign pointed to Bennet’s votes against a permanent ban on transferring detainees to a U.S. military prison and his opposition to blocking construction funding for a prison to hold Gitmo prisoners in the United States. While Bennet has long supported closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, his statements and legislative record show that, since 2009, Bennet has opposed attempts to relocate detainees from Guantanamo to a Colorado prison, including Colorado’s federal supermax prison. Bennet has said repeatedly he thinks detainees should be held in military prisons, and there is no military prison in Colorado. We rate the statement False.

pomt-08483	"Groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/11/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-foreign-money-coming-u/	Stumping for Democratic candidates in the past few weeks, President Barack Obama has repeatedly warned that foreign money may be bankrolling many of the attack ads being run against Democrats. And now he says he has found an Exhibit A: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Here's what the president said at a rally on Oct. 7, 2010, on behalf of Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley: "Just this week, we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations. So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections. And they won't tell you where the money (for) their ads comes from." On ABC's This Week on Oct. 10, 2010, George Will connected the dots: "Well, he won't tell us who he's talking about. He's talking about the Chamber of Commerce, which does indeed receive dues from foreign entities that are associated with American business, just as the AFL-CIO receives dues from foreign entities associated with it. And -- and the shock and awe that we're supposed to feel from this is somewhat selective." We have looked previously at more general Obama administration claims about foreign money financing attack ads against Democrats. We will take a look at Will's retort about the AFL-CIO in a separate fact-check. But here, we will examine Obama's claim about the Chamber, that, "Groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections." For example, the chamber has run ads against Democratic U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson in Florida, calling him a "lap dog" who supports "job-skilling energy taxes." The Chamber has also run ads against Senate candidates Charlie Crist in Florida and Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut, attacking them for supporting the health care law. Current federal law prohibits "a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country" from making "directly or indirectly" a donation or expenditure "in connection with a Federal, State, or local election," to a political party committee or "for an electioneering communication." But Obama has repeatedly warned that a Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission case opened the floodgates for special interests -– including foreign corporations (a claim many Republicans dispute). With independent groups outspending the actual campaigns in some midterm elections -- the Chamber has vowed to spend more than $50 million nationwide -- it's a theme that has been oft-repeated by Democratic party leaders lately. A video released by the Democratic National Committee states that "it appears they are even taking secret foreign money to influence our elections." First off, White House officials confirmed Obama's comment was, in fact, aimed at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And when Obama said "just this week, we learned...," he's referring to a posting on ThinkProgress, a blog affiliated with the liberal Center for American Progress, which ran under the headline "Exclusive: Foreign-Funded 'U.S.' Chamber Of Commerce Running Partisan Attack Ads." The article details the Chamber of Commerce's many overseas affiliates, and claims the Chamber has "spearheaded an effort to raise money from foreign corporations, including ones controlled by foreign governments." The article claims foreign members of the Chamber send money either directly to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, or the foreign members fund their local Chamber, which in turn, transfers dues payments back to the Chamber, and that the funds are commingled with an account used to pay for the attack ads. Chamber officials readily acknowledged their group has 115 foreign member affiliates in 108 countries, and that it received foreign money. But Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the chamber, told the New York Times that overseas American Chambers of Commerce pay a total of less than $100,000 in membership dues that go into its general fund. In addition, the Chamber gets membership dues from foreign corporations. While the total was not quantified, Josten said it amounts to a small fraction of the group's total budget of more than $200 million. More importantly, the Chamber maintains that none of that foreign money is used to finance the Chamber's political agenda in the United States. The Chamber put out a statement saying all foreign money received by the organization is properly segregated from money used to fund political activity. "We're careful to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws," Chamber spokeswoman Tita Freeman said in a statement. "No foreign money is used to fund political activities. All allegations to the contrary are totally and completely false." According to ThinkProgress, however, "while the Chamber will likely assert it has internal controls, foreign money is fungible, permitting the Chamber to run its unprecedented attack campaign." But here's the thing: Neither Obama nor the DNC offer any evidence that foreign money is actually being used to fund the attack ads. Rather, the argument is that it could be a problem. "We simply don't know," said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. As a 501 (c)6 non-profit trade association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not required to disclose its donors. And it doesn't. Foreign companies with American divisions can form PACs and collect contributions from their American employees, or those with green cards. The Center for Responsive Politics lists more than 140 foreign-connected PACs, from pharmaceuticals like GlaxoSmithKline to BP. These PACS have raised more than $12 million this election cycle. "The law of the land right now is that if an organization like the Chamber of Commerce is using generally accepted accounting principles to show that you are not using foreign money to finance regulated activities, then you're in the clear," said Paul Ryan, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center. "It is hard with no disclosure to pin it down," David G. Vance, a spokesman for the Campaign Legal Center. "That's the big problem. There's no way to check any of it. As it is, they just have one big pie, and no one knows where it all goes." So far, though, no one has offered any evidence that the Chamber of Commerce is not complying with that law. "It's unverifiable," Levinthal said. "You've got to take their word for it. There is no way to tell, unless the group wants to put up identifiable evidence on its own...The Chamber of Commerce is not volunteering that information. Nor do they have to by law." Levinthal cautioned that it's not just a problem with right-leaning groups. The same rules apply whether you are a left group or a right one, Levinthal noted. A New York Times story by Eric Lichtblau sums it up this way: "A closer examination shows that there is little evidence that what the chamber does in collecting overseas dues is improper or even unusual, according to both liberal and conservative election-law lawyers and campaign finance documents. "In fact, the controversy over the Chamber of Commerce financing may say more about the Washington spin cycle — where an Internet blog posting can be quickly picked up by like-minded groups and become political fodder for the president himself — than it does about the vagaries of campaign finance." Some Republicans say the Democrats' stance amounts to "guilty until proven innocent." David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, was asked by Bob Schieffer on CBS' Face the Nation on Oct. 10, 2010, if he had any evidence that the chamber was using secret foreign funds to influence the election. ''Well, do you have any evidence that it's not, Bob?'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The fact is that the chamber has asserted that, but they won't release any information about where their campaign money is coming from. And that's at the core of the problem here.'' President Obama and other Democrats may have a legitimate concern about disclosure. The campaign finance experts we spoke with said there's no way to know for sure if the Chamber of Commerce is keeping foreign money it receives separate from the pot of money used to fund attack ads -- other than the Chamber's assurances that it does. And the president is technically correct when he says the Chamber of Commerce "takes in money from foreign corporations ... So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections." But we think that statement suggests foreign money is, for sure, being used to directly fund the attack ads. The Chamber said it isn't. And Obama and other Democrats have offered no evidence so far that it has. And so we rule his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-10-11T19:30:43	2010-10-07	['United_States']
pomt-01866	"There are more than 46 million Americans living in poverty today -- the largest number in 54 years."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/11/kirk-cox/kirk-cox-says-number-americans-poverty-historic-hi/	House Majority Leader Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, recently objected to Democrats’ claims of a moral high ground in their bid to expand the state’s Medicaid rolls. During a floor speech, Cox laid out reasons for the House GOP’s refusal to make Medicaid available to as many 400,000 additional low income and disabled Virginians -- despite the federal government’s offer to pay almost all the costs. He said the expansion was a broadening of ineffective Great Society programs, including Medicaid, that began under President Lyndon Johnson in the mid-1960s. Despite Johnson’s goal of launching a "war against poverty," Cox said blight persists. "There are more than 46 million Americans living in poverty today -- the largest number in 54 years," Cox said. There’s been a lot written about whether Great Society programs have succeeded. Coming to a conclusion on that debate is beyond the purview of a single Truth-O-Meter. But we were curious whether Cox is correct in saying more Americans are living in poverty than at any time during the last 54 years. Kelly Gee, Cox’s legislative aide, pointed us to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. They show that in 2012, the latest year that figures were available, 46.5 million Americans lived in poverty. That’s the highest number going back to 1960, when 39.9 million lived below the poverty line. But several analysts told us economists typically measure poverty over time by examining the poverty rate -- the percentage of the population living in blight. While the number of people in poverty has risen, so has the nation’s population. In 1960, there were 179.5 million people in the U.S. and by 2012 that grew to 310.6 million. "It is important to put any number in context," emailed Greg Acs, director of the Income and Benefits Policy center at the Urban Institute. "If the population is growing, the number of people in any income category is likely to grow as well." The 1960 poverty rate was 22.2 percent. Had it stayed at that level, there would be 70 million Americans in poverty today, said David Betson, an associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Notre Dame. "Both numbers are important, but when looking at poverty over a long period when population is growing, poverty rates in my opinion are a better indicator than the number of people in poverty to judge whether we have made progress or not," Betson wrote in an e-mail. The poverty rate in 2012 -- the latest year available -- was 15 percent. While it has dropped since 1960, the rate is high compared to more recent years. The rate has has hovered at 15 percent for a three-year period beginning in 2010. That’s the longest stretch at or above that threshold since 1959-1965, when the poverty rate started at 22.4 percent and wound up at 17.3 percent. "We are at very high levels of poverty, one of the highest streaks in recorded history," said H. Luke Shaefer, an assistant professor of social work at the University of Michigan. "We’ve been high since the start of the Great Recession. We are also at some of the highest levels of deep poverty." The average poverty threshold in 2013, the latest year available, is $15,156 annual income for a family of two and $23,836 for a family of four. Our ruling In arguing the Great Society programs have failed, Cox said more than 46.5 million Americans are living in poverty, more than at any time since 1960. Cox’s figures are correct, but offer an incomplete picture of the U.S. poverty over the last 54 years. What he fails to note is that the U.S. population has grown by 73 percent over that span -- or by about 131 million people. Analysts say a fuller measure is offered by poverty rate, which takes into account population growth. It shows that poverty has decreased, from 22.2 percent in 1960 to 15 percent in 2012 -- the latest year available. So Cox’s statement is accurate but, in its context of evaluating a half-century poverty trend line, needs additional information. That makes it Mostly True.

pomt-06864	"For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000."	true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/02/patrick-murphy/allen-west-challenger-says-he-has-raised-more-mone/	Democrats may not yet agree on who offers the best chance to beat U.S. Rep. Allen West in 2012, but they all know this: it will take a lot of money. West raised more than $6.5 million in 2010 for his successful campaign against incumbent Democrat Ron Klein in a Broward/Palm Beach swing district. And he's only gotten more popular in many Republican circles since going to Washington. West has become something of a spokesman for the tea party movement (which also makes him a lightning rod for criticism), having appeared on NBC's Meet the Press as well as being a frequent guest on Fox News. West already has raised more than $2.2 million through the first two quarters of 2011. Yet Democrats think West may be vulnerable in a South Florida district that they say might not fully embrace his tea party mentality. Already, two Democrats have filed to run against him in 2012: former West Palm Beach mayor and state legislator Lois Frankel and Patrick Murphy, a 28-year-old businessman. Murphy -- a former Republican who switched party affiliation in January 2011 -- has never run for political office in his life, but on July 16, 2011, he claimed that he has raised more cash than any other congressional challenger in the country. "For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000," he said on his website. "Some political insiders doubted we would be able to do it again, but our second quarter haul of over $450,000 proves that not only are people fed up with Allen West but that I am the candidate they want to replace him." Has Murphy two quarters in a row raised more money than any other challenger in the nation -- over $800,000? Through June 30 (the first two quarters of 2011), Murphy raised $808,671.59, according to the Federal Election Commission. The amount includes no loans, but Murphy did donate $36,100 to the campaign. (A donation is different from a loan in that Murphy has no expectation he'll be repaid.) We called the Federal Election Commission -- the repository of Congressional campaign finance reports -- and asked spokesman Christian Hilland if Murphy had raised more than any other congressional challenger in the nation two quarters in a row. Based on campaign finance reports submitted to the FEC, Hilland sent us back a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of the top 10 fundraisers among congressional challengers in the first and second quarters in 2011. The chart shows that during the first quarter, Jan. 1 through March 31, 2011, Murphy took in about $352,448.99. He took in $456,222.60 during the second quarter, April 1 through June 30, 2011. A few other fundraisers taking on incumbents did take in more than Murphy in the first or second quarter. But they only surpassed Murphy because they either gave themselves large loans or because they transferred money from a U.S. Senate campaign. • John Atkinson of Illinois raised $173,550.18 more than Murphy in the first quarter of 2011 but included a $270,000 loan. (Atkinson dropped out of his House race in June 2011.) • Abel Maldonado of California raised $80,867.40 more than Murphy in the second quarter. But his figures included a $250,000 loan. And then there were two candidates from Texas with the last name of Williams who switched their campaigns from the U.S. Senate to the U.S. House. • Roger Williams' total for the second quarter was $1,017,535, but he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2008 and then switched to a congressional race in June 2011. • Michael Williams raised $418,619.20 during the first quarter, which was $66,170.21 more than Murphy's, but he launched his U.S. Senate campaign in 2008 and then switched to a congressional race in June 2011. For the record, Murphy's Democratic primary opponent also made the top 10 list: Frankel raised $698,545.88 for the first two quarters combined. Murphy said, "For the second quarter in a row, my campaign has raised more money than any other challenger in the nation and brought our fundraising total to over $800,000." A couple of other candidates technically raised more money, but that is thanks to either personal campaign loans or switching from a statewide U.S. Senate campaign to a run for the House. We think Murphy is on solid footing to leave those scenarios out when making his claim. So, we rate it True.	None	Patrick Murphy	None	None	None	2011-08-02T09:05:23	2011-07-16	['None']

pomt-07871	"Before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans. After it became law, the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/08/bill-posey/rep-bill-posey-claims-nearly-half-will-lose-curren/	Do you have a one-in-two chance of losing your health care plan as a result of the 2010 health care law? That's what Republican Congressman Bill Posey, who represents Florida's 15th District in Central Florida, claims in a Feb. 1, 2011, letter to Florida Today. He wrote to explain to voters "which aspects of the health care law I’m against," and this was his first point: "Before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans. After it became law, the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan." He also argued that the law will not produce savings in health care costs, nor will it reduce health care spending. But for this fact-check, we are going to look at Posey's first statement. Before the health care law passed, were Americans told they could keep their current plans? And after the law passed, did the federal government issue regulations that result in nearly half of Americans losing their current plans? On Feb. 4, Posey spokesman George Cecala sent us two 2009 videos of Obama posted on You Tube. In the first video, Obama said: "If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what." In the second video, he said: "If you like your doctor or health care plan, you can keep it." Three experts on the health care law whom we interviewed all agreed the message was clear: Obama told Americans that they could keep their health plan. Our experts are Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, which has been critical of the health care law; Edwin Park, co-director on health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has supported the health care law; and Gerard Anderson, a professor and director at the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The second part of Posey's claim -- that nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan -- is more complicated. Our colleagues at National PolitiFact reviewed a similar claim on Feb. 2 by Texas Republican Blake Farenthold, that the health care law would force 70 percent of workers to "lose their current health plan." Here's what we found: How grandfathering works The law allows plans that existed on March 23, 2010, to be "grandfathered," which means that they do not have to comply with new requirements that took effect last fall, such as providing preventive services without cost-sharing and direct access to ob-gyn care without a referral. To keep their grandfathered status, these plans must not significantly cut benefits or increase out-of-pocket spending for consumers. (Minor policy changes and increases to keep pace with medical inflation do not threaten a plan’s grandfather status.) A fact sheet provided by the Obama administration on HealthCare.gov estimates how many plans are expected to opt for grandfathered status, both for the 133 million Americans whose plans are provided by large employers and the 43 million with plans provided by small employers (fewer than 100 employees). Together, those groups account for 91 percent of insured Americans. According to administration projections, between 36 and 66 percent of the large-employer plans will remain grandfathered by 2013. For small employers, the administration expects between 20 and 51 percent to be grandfathered in 2013. Cecala also sent us a link to a June 2010 Federal Register report that looks at how many employer plans will relinquish their grandfathered status in 2013, rather than how many retain it. Table 3 estimates between 39 and 69 percent of all employer plans will relinquish that status. So Posey's claim refers to plans that will lose their grandfathered status, and "nearly half" is clearly within the government's own estimates. But the question is whether losing grandfathered status means the same thing as losing your current plan. Just because a consumer's plan loses its grandfathered status doesn't mean he or she will be forced to switch to an entirely different provider or a radically different plan. What PolitiFact found The Truth-O-Meter on Farenthold summarized it this way: "Health care specialists said they expect that in many cases an employer (or the insurance carrier the employer uses) will change the plan in ways that are significant enough to end grandfather status but which will not terminate the plan or result in a radical change in its coverage. While some employers may decide to end health care coverage entirely (and thus pay a penalty under the law), many will continue to offer a similar plan but perhaps with more extensive requirements mandated under the law, possibly along with higher premiums." Also, when Obama made his promise that Americans could keep their plans, he failed to acknowledge that many Americans already don't keep their "current" plan every year. Insurers change rules and costs, employers switch providers, and Americans lose or change jobs or retire, effectively switching their plans. That is something that Farenthold, and now Posey, also fail to explain. The Feb. 2 Truth-O-Meter attempted to quantify how many Americans switch plans unrelated to the new law and found a study by Mercer, a private consulting firm that does an annual national survey of employer-sponsored health plans. Beth Umland, the head of research for Mercer's health and benefits consulting practice, said that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly 25 percent of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, she said, that percentage rose to one-third of companies. PolitiFact concluded that the data is too scattershot to know how many workers change plans every year, but it seems reasonable to assume that the number is not trivial. The experts on grandfathering Our experts also weighed in on the second part of Posey's claims. Park said he wouldn't equate grandfathering with losing your health plan. "Let's say the same plan loses grandfathering status because it raises the deductible," Park said, but employees are kept on a revised Blue Cross plan. "It's still a Blue Cross plan -- it's the same insurer, the same rules, the same providers being covered, and now it doesn't have the grandfathered status. Essentially it's the same plan with some changes to comply with the health reform law. The rhetoric implies that the plan is completely different. ... 'Losing your plan' makes it sound like you are being forced out of your plan into something else completely. These kinds of changes happen all the time, and it happens today with or without the enactment of the health care law." Anderson also agreed that losing grandfathered status shouldn't be equated with consumers losing a plan. Tanner explained: "Over time the current plans are likely to go away and the new plans will all meet the government's requirements. To some degree, that is an advantage for people who get benefits they don't get now, but it will also likely cost them more to do so. It's a little bit like telling everybody who has a Toyota now they have to get Lexus. They got more car, but it cost them more." And initially Americans were told they could keep that Toyota and now they can't, he said. While some consumers may not be forced from one plan to another -- say from Kaiser to Aetna -- consumers who have Blue Cross now may still have Blue Cross "but the plan itself will have different benefits and different costs." The differences will really affect smaller businesses that are offering bare bones coverage now and will have to provide more expensive policies, Tanner said. We asked Cecala, why does Posey believe that a plan that loses its grandfathered status is equivalent to Americans losing their current plan? "It is a different version of what you were having before," Cecala said. If an employer can't afford the new option, then the employer might drop the plan entirely or switch to a different plan, he said. Our ruling On the first half of Posey's claim, we agree that "before this law was passed, Americans were told they could keep their current health care plans." But the second half of his claim, that "After it became law the administration issued regulations stating nearly half of Americans would lose their current plan," is not so simple. Posey's math is correct when he points to the government estimates of employer plans that will lose grandfathered status. But telling the public that "half of Americans would lose their current plan" implies that they will be forced into a different provider's plan, a substantially worse plan or even no plan at all. By that definition, some Americans "lost" their current plans routinely for years before the health care law was signed. For those omissions, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14518	"Two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-two-thirds-us-kids-cant-read-grad/	Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pulled out a stunning statistic about the current state of K-12 education while making the case for school choice. "Two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level," Rubio wrote in a recent Medium post. We wondered whether the situation in American schools was really that bad, so we took a closer look. Rubio’s source was the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, a closely watched, federally sponsored standardized-testing effort. The most recent NAEP data for fourth- and eighth-grade students covers 2015. It offers four categories of achievement. From lowest to highest, they are "below basic," "basic," "proficient," and "advanced." The two most relevant categories for this fact-check are basic and proficient, and neither level’s definition mentions reading on grade level. Basic is defined as "denoting partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade assessed. Proficient is defined as "representing solid academic performance for each grade assessed" and "competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter." Rubio is using the proficient level as his benchmark, and the picture that produces isn’t pretty. In 2015, just 36 percent of American fourth graders were categorized as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here’s the chart: And that same year, just 34 percent of eighth graders rated as either proficient or advanced in reading. Here’s the chart: Using that metric, Rubio supports his point. But education experts advised caution. Most important is that it’s a bit of a stretch for Rubio to equate a NAEP rating of "proficient" with being "at grade level." "There is no commonly accepted definition for what ‘grade level’ performance is or should be," said Christopher B. Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. NAEP, he said, is developed independently of the knowledge required by any specific state, district or school. David Bills, a professor of education at the University of Iowa, agreed. "As far as I know, no one has ever tested those labels against what kids actually need to know to do well in school," Bills said. Indeed, after the No Child Left Behind education law was enacted under President George W. Bush, "each state had to choose a level of ‘proficiency,’ and on average, this came closer to the NAEP basic level," said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow in education policy at the conservative Hoover Institution. If this is the case, then one could instead use the "basic" level under NAEP and find that the success rates are 69 percent and 76 percent for fourth and eighth graders, respectively. Still, despite such words of caution, experts said Rubio’s decision to use the "proficient" level as his benchmark was defensible. Experts also ratified Rubio’s use of the NAEP tests as his data source. "Sure, there are lots of problems and it’s not a perfect measure, but that doesn’t mean it’s meaningless in all contexts," said Patricia M. Cooper, an associate professor and program coordinator for early childhood education at Queens College-City University of New York. There aren’t many credible alternatives to the NAEP numbers, she said. Cooper added that even the best-case scenario isn’t that great. "Even if Rubio’s off by half, that means one-third of our kids aren’t reading on grade level," she said. "Would that make us feel better?" Our ruling Rubio said that "two-thirds of our kids can’t read at grade level." The numbers from the NAEP reading test for fourth and eighth graders provide some support for his statement. However, experts said that there is no accepted definition of what being at "grade level" means under the NAEP tests. While Rubio's use of NAEP's higher "proficient" standard is a reasonable choice, experts said, it's not the only one -- many states have set standards aligned with NAEP's "basic" level instead. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-02-18T17:02:20	2016-01-26	['None']

Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. Biden was particularly direct summing up Clinton's tenure, saying, "There's not a major bill I know with Hillary's name on it." In some ways, Biden's assessment is correct: Clinton has not been the lead sponsor of legislation dealing with a major national issue that made its way to President Bush's desk. But New York's junior senator has had comparatively few opportunities after spending four of her seven years in the chamber as a member of the minority. Instead, she has worked the way many senators do, introducing bills that wind up getting included in another's initiative, drafting a Senate companion bill to a popular House initiative or working with home state Republicans to send money to New York or protect local interests. After eight years as first lady, Clinton deliberately sought a lower profile in the Senate, respecting the seniority system and tending to steer away from contentious national debates such as health care. She also has adopted moderate — some would say carefully calibrated — rhetoric on abortion, the war in Iraq, fiscal policy and social issues. The approach surprised many of her critics, who suspected she would stake out more liberal positions and primarily use New York and the Senate as a stepping stone for her national ambitions. She was the leading Democratic sponsor of a 2003 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to order drug companies to test their drugs to determine the proper dosages for children. The effort was inspired by cases in which children died or were injured taking drugs or using medical devices shown safe for adults. She worked with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2006 to get portions of legislation she authored to extend health coverage to National Guard troops and reservists included in a fiscal 2007 defense authorization bill. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Clinton authored a companion bill to House legislation ensuring that public safety officers killed or injured in the line of duty during the attacks would receive expedited payment of benefits. On another matter closely related to her home state, Clinton worked with Republican congressman Tom Reynolds to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open at a time when the Pentagon was closing bases — a move that saved 800 jobs. Clinton has effectively used her senatorial power to influence a handful of issues and to focus on local politics. Biden is correct when he says her name is not on a major bill, but as Biden knows better than most, that's not a fair measure of a legislator's accomplishments. We rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-13265	"After how hard you work and how much you pay in taxes, New York City ends up getting the money. I'm Chris Jacobs. I think it's time we have someone in Albany that's making sure our region gets our fair share"	false	/new-york/statements/2016/oct/14/chris-jacobs/state-spends-more-western-new-york-it-receives-tax/	It’s not a new tactic for upstate Republicans running for state office: link rival Democrats to New York City, where more than half of state lawmakers come from, and promise to stand against that big liberal base. Republican Christopher L. Jacobs is following a similar tack in his Senate race in Buffalo. In an ad released in September, Jacobs says Buffalo does not receive its fair share from the state. "After how hard you work and how much you pay in taxes, New York City ends up getting the money," Jacobs says. "I'm Chris Jacobs. I think it's time we have someone in Albany that's making sure our region gets our fair share." Jacobs, the current Erie County Clerk, seeks to replace outgoing State Sen. Marc C. Panepinto. Panepinto, a Democrat who has held the seat since 2014, decided not to seek re-election. Jacobs is running against Democrat Amber Small, the executive director of the Parkside Community Association. Is Jacobs right? Does Western New York not get its fair share from the state? Where your money goes A 2011 report from the Rockefeller Institute found downstate New York typically pays more to the state in taxes than it gets back. Jacobs implies Western New York pays more to the state than it gets back. Data from the state Department of Budget shows otherwise. In total taxes collected by the state, 4.1 percent comes from the Western New York counties of Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany. Three percent comes from Erie County. And 56 percent of the state’s tax collection comes from New York City. The State Legislature passed a $147.8 billion budget in April. The Department of Budget estimates $96.2 billion of that is state spending. The state said it could not break out total spending by region. But it did provide data showing the state receives less in taxes from Western New York than it spends in the region in major spending categories like education, economic development, roads and human services. Economic development The Department of Budget says $5.6 billion of the state’s economic development spending went to Western New York between 2012 and 2016. That’s 10.4 percent of the spending in that category statewide. It includes funds meant to boost the economy broadly through recreation, hospital capital and more. It also includes spending on job creation and business incentive programs like the Buffalo Billion. When looking at economic programs like those alone, Western New York received about 25 percent of the state’s spending over that time. Roads and bridges State infrastructure funds are also included under the economic development category. From 2012 to 2016, the state spent $1.6 billion on the region’s infrastructure. That’s another category in which Western New York received a bigger share of the money than the 4.1 percent it contributed in taxes. The state spent 9.7 percent of its road and bridge money in the region. Education aid The same is true for education aid, one of the largest spending categories. • Western New York received 9.1 percent of the state’s school aid in the most recent budget. That came to about $2.2 billion, the state says. • Erie County received 5.5 percent. • New York City received 39.9 percent. The state puts a cap on property tax increases. New York City does not have such a cap. State foundation aid to school districts is based on a formula from the State Education Department. It’s another source of revenue. Districts receive other state funds, like reimbursement for construction or BOCES funding, but foundation aid is the largest source of funding from the state for a district. More foundation aid was spent on students in Buffalo than New York City last school year. Buffalo Public Schools received close to $465 million in foundation aid during the last school year. With some 32,165 students, according to the department, that averages out to $14,450 per student. New York City’s schools, attended by slightly more than 1 million students, received almost $6.8 billion in the foundation aid. That averages out to $6,500 per student. Human services Western New York also gets a disproportionate share in human services spending, which includes child welfare, food stamps, foster care and more. New York City also receives more than it puts in for these services. • Western New York received 6.8 percent of human services spending in the last budget. That’s about $979 million, according to the state. • Erie County received 4.6 percent. • New York City received 59.1 percent of the human services spending, a percentage that is slightly more than its percentage contribution to the state’s tax receipts. Medicaid Western New York and Erie County hold almost even in Medicaid spending. • Western New York received 4.5 percent of Medicaid spending. • Erie County received 3.1 percent. • This is another spending category in which New York City receives a bigger percentage than its percentage contribution in taxes. New York City received 58.4 percent of Medicaid state spending. What’s he talking about? Jacobs’s campaign says his ad refers to local issues like education funding and the cost of electricity. Data shows he’s wrong on education aid. His claim on electricity refers to the Niagara Power Plant. "New York State has literally taken billions of dollars over the decades out of that plant to subsidize the other power plants that lose money and worse yet, billions have been dumped into New York State’s general fund budget," Jacobs said. The New York Power Authority confirms the Niagara plant ranks as the most lucrative among its 16 generating facilities. A certain amount is earmarked for Western New York, and any surplus power is sold on the open market. The power authority says its other facilities have not relied on revenue from the Niagara Power Plant. But how the power agency chooses to use the revenue is besides the point in the context of upstate versus New York City. The power plant is a state facility - not a regional one. "While the Niagara project is a cornerstone for the Western New York economy, it is a statewide asset," said Paul DeMichele of the authority. Our Ruling In his ad, Jacobs says "New York City ends up getting the money" from taxes paid by Western New York residents. Data obtained from the Department of Budget shows Western New York, including Erie County, consistently receives a bigger percentage share of state spending than its residents’ percentage contribution in taxes. Jacobs implies the region is not getting its fair share. Data shows it’s getting more than its fair share in the state’s largest spending categories. There are a few categories in which New York City receives more than it puts in, but overall, the difference between how much is paid in taxes and how much is spent on services and projects benefits Western New York - not New York City. We rate this claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/324147a5-c7af-4d1b-9304-7a38f810cb0e	None	Chris Jacobs	None	None	None	2016-10-14T13:40:36	2016-09-01	['New_York_City', 'Albany,_New_York']
pomt-07050	Says President Obama "has fired more cruise missiles than all other Peace Prize winners combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/30/yard-sign/yard-sign-claims-barack-obama-has-fired-more-cruis/	The decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama in 2009, the first year of his presidency, has long rankled his opponents, who felt he was inexperienced and hadn't earned the prestigious award. And even many of Obama’s supporters were disappointed by his decisions to continue the U.S. role in Iraq and send more troops to Afghanistan. So when Obama in March 2011 decided to enforce a "no-fly zone" to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from crushing rebel forces, criticism flared. One of the most cutting lines, which ricocheted around blogs and even appeared on bumper stickers from a Libertarian website, stated: "Obama’s fired more cruise missiles than all other Nobel peace prize winners combined." A version of that slogan was put on a sign (with "missles" misspelled) along Route 12 near Keene, N.H., by Mark Edgington, a libertarian talk-radio host whose program, Free Talk Live, is heard on about 100 stations around the country. Edgington said he believes the sign is true because of what he's read on the Internet -- plus the fact that cruise missiles were not so available when other wartime leaders won Nobel peace prizes. "They didn’t have cruise missiles around then, so I felt relatively confident that it was true," said Edgington, who said his concern was also directly tied to Obama’s decision to intervene in Libya without seeking congressional authorization. "I find the actions to be unconstitutional. And I still think there is a greater message: he’s an awfully big killer to have received the Peace Prize, and I would have said the same thing about (former President George W.) Bush," he told PolitiFact. But is Barack Obama really a warmonger? And does the Dalai Lama (winner, 1989) know about this? First, a crash course in cruise missiles. They include everything from the short-range Chinese Eagle Strike missile to the U.S. Tomahawk Land Attack missile, which has a range of 1,500 miles. The Federation of American Scientists, an independent Washington-based group created in 1945 to analyze national security issues related to science and technology, defines cruise missiles as "an unmanned self-propelled guided vehicle that sustains flight through aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path and whose primary mission is to place an ordnance or special payload on a target." More simply put, cruise missiles, often fired from sea or air, are jet-propelled, as opposed to rocket-propelled missiles. Rather than the arc of a rocket, they fly more like a plane to avoid radar. At least 12 exporting countries -- Great Britain, the United States, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Taiwan -- have developed them, according to the FAS website, and dozens of other countries have some variant in their arsenals. They aren’t cheap, either -- Tomahawks now cost about $1.1 million apiece, the Navy said recently. Cruise missiles can trace their antecedents to the infamous German V-1, or "buzz bomb," of World War II. And some countries have had short-range, anti-ship cruise missiles for years. John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington-based website of military information, said the U.S. relied on them as part of its nuclear arsenal for most of the Cold War and then began to deploy them as conventional weapons. Pike said current-day cruise missiles’ major debut came in 1991 during the Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush. That campaign saw almost 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired. An elite group Given the limited time frame that cruise missiles have been used, the number of Nobel laureates who could have fired them is limited. For starters, Nobel laureates such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (1997), Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi (1991) and Doctors Without Borders (1999) aren’t going to be firing cruise missiles -- ever. Similarly, while the United States fired them in Serbia as part of a NATO air campaign, they can’t be attributed to 1991 Nobel laureate Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, which had peacekeeping troops in the Balkans. And former President Jimmy Carter, who won the prize in 2002, was not directly involved in any major hostilities while in office, outside of trying to rescue the American Embassy hostages in Iran. Mikhail Gorbachev (Nobel, 1990) was known for helping to end the Cold War and reducing the nuclear arsenal, but did preside over the Soviet Union during its final years in its invasion of Afghanistan. Pike noted that western accounts of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are "necessarily incomplete," but says he "cannot imagine what type of cruise missile they would have used" there. And while the Israelis have also developed cruise missiles over the years, some reportedly for nuclear purposes, they have held them largely in check. Accounts of the 1973 Yom Kippur War indicate that the Egyptians used about two dozen short-range Soviet-made anti-ship cruise missiles against the Israelis, which would implicate then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat (who won the Nobel along with Israel’s Menachem Begin in 1978). And the Israelis reportedly fired anti-ship Gabriel missiles at Egyptian and Syrian targets, sinking 10 of their boats. But even if these were to be considered true cruise missiles, future Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, who shared the prize with Yasser Arafat in 1994, were not in power at the time, nor was Begin. And the numbers fall short of U.S. salvos. The Obama Tally So is Obama a cruise-missile-firing standout among Nobel laureates? He has fired at least 192, according to the Pentagon’s March 28 briefing about Libya, and is the fourth American president in a row to launch them. But he's the only president in that group to win the peace prize. Vice President Al Gore, who went on to win his Nobel in 2007 for his work on global warming, supported the American use of cruise missiles in the 1999 NATO effort to protect Kosovo. And, in fact, as president, Bill Clinton deployed Tomahawks repeatedly, sending well over 600 cruise missiles during his administration at targets in Iraq, Serbia, Sudan and Afghanistan. But, Clinton was commander in chief, not Gore. It’s also worth noting that the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner, former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, has been linked to the secret bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. But he and Richard Nixon used bombers, not nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, for that campaign. Experts said they believe the sign's claim about Obama and cruise missiles appears technically true, but also merits some context. George R. Lucas Jr., the chairman in ethics at the Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership at the U.S. Naval Academy and a professor of ethics and public policy at the Naval Postgraduate School, said by e-mail that the statement was probably "true by definition" and undoubtedly "deliberately ironic" to score a point. "My own sense is that this president (has) behaved very responsibly with the use of military force, but that, like all recent presidents, he has faced circumstances that are profoundly complex, and in which the decisions to use force are open to question and criticism," Lucas wrote. For his part, Obama, in a March 28, 2011, speech, defended the Libyan strikes, saying they were for a humanitarian purpose, intended to save the city of Benghazi "and the people within." Based on our review of historical records and interviews with military historians, it appears the sign along the New Hampshire highway is correct. The next closest contender was Sadat during the Yom Kippur war, but it appears he was far short of the number fired by Obama, even in combination with other laureates. If we hear of additional evidence, we'll revisit this item. But in the meantime, the numbers indicate the sign is correct. We rate the statement True.

pomt-09163	"Our school test scores are right at the bottom."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/08/thurbert-baker/baker-says-test-scores-show-georgia-failing-studen/	When you're a candidate for governor from a party out of power, you look for the ruling party's weak spots. So when Democrat Thurbert Baker recently made his kickoff speech for his run for governor, he mentioned a litany of problems in the state, including Georgia's low educational ranking. "Now, we may be No. 1 in bank failures, but our school test scores are right at the bottom," Baker said. "This isn't the fault of our teachers or our students. It's the fault of our leaders who talk a good game about education but do nothing. In fact, they do worse than nothing. Whenever the politicians go looking for money to fund their pet projects, guess where they get it? They cut education!" In his speech, the outgoing attorney general gave us plenty of red meat to chew on. We decided to take a look into his claim about school test scores. Is Georgia "right at the bottom"? Baker campaign official Edward Chapman was happy to tell us where his boss came up with that statement: an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article last year reporting how Georgia's students fared on the SAT. "Georgia finished ahead of only South Carolina, Hawaii, Maine and the District of Columbia," the Aug. 30, 2009, article reported. (That may not be something to boast about, but Georgia's students ranked last in the nation in 2004, so they've improved.) So, with the caveat that educators often warn against state comparisons because of wide variations in the types of students who take the tests, yes, the SAT alone indicates Georgia is close to the bottom. But we decided to look at scores on another college admission test -- the ACT. (There's a caveat with this one, too, because a smaller percentage of Georgia students take it than in many other states.) Georgia fared better here. It ranked ahead of 10 states and the District of Columbia in the average ACT composite score. Another element of the ACT measures the percentage of students who passed its benchmark scores in English, math, reading and science. On this one, Georgia finished 38th, ahead of 13 others states, and just below students in the District of Columbia. Baker campaign officials still contend their candidate's statement is true because more Georgia students take the SAT as opposed to the ACT. "We have always been at or very near the bottom among the states," Chapman said. So overall, Georgia's test scores on the two main college entrance exams paint different pictures. On the SAT, the state ranked 47th. But on the ACT, the state was 38th or 40th. So it's not, as Baker said, "right at the bottom." We find his claim Half True.

pomt-11215	"Eric Schneiderman helped NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/10/ny-evening-news/no-eric-schneiderman-didnt-sell-child-sex-slaves-c/	After New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stepped down amid allegations that he abused women, a story without any evidence circulated on Facebook that he covered up a sex cult. "Eric Schneiderman helped NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons," said a May 9 headline by the NY Evening News, a website that has sections on conspiracies and UFOs. The story attributed the information to Your News Wire, which frequently posts fake news. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story smashes together an actual federal criminal case against organizers of a sex cult to falsely allege that it involves Schneiderman selling children to the Clintons. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Schneiderman resigned May 7 following a report by The New Yorker that four women accused him of physical assault. He denied the allegations. The NY Evening News story said, "Schneiderman used his position as Attorney General to cover-up the crimes of NXIVM – a cult recently exposed as selling child sex slaves to the Clintons." The criminal case about the sex cult NXIVM (pronounced Nex-e-um) is real, although the NY Evening News story makes up details. We previously rated a claim that defendant Allison Mack, an actress on the TV show Smallville, sold sex slaves to the Clintons as Pants on Fire. Mack and co-defendant Keith Raniere face real federal charges for sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. Both have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere. The victims were then exploited, including sexually. We searched news accounts for connections between Schneiderman’s office and the case. In March, Schneiderman’s office filed a court case asking a judge to order Brandon B. Porter, a medical doctor who conducted controversial research on behalf of NXIVM, to turn over records related to studies. The case also asked Clare F. Bronfman, heiress to Seagram and NXIVM operations director, to turn over records. But Schneiderman’s office suspended the state investigation after the March 25 arrest of Raniere on federal charges. A 2017 story by the Albany Times-Union said that law enforcement had fielded complaints about NXIVM for years and that Schneiderman’s office had begun to examine dealings. "The new interest comes after multiple law enforcement agencies, including Schneiderman's office, had for years brushed aside the concerns from Raniere's critics and others about the murky inner workings of NXIVM, which one expert has characterized as an 'extreme cult,' " the Times-Union wrote. We read federal court records and news articles about the case and found no evidence that Schneiderman helped "NXIVM sell child sex slaves to the Clintons." This mash-up of headlines in the news has no basis in fact. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-01858	"This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/13/beto-orourke/texas-democrat-obama-offered-fewer-executive-actio/	Lately, President Barack Obama has emphasized his willingness to take as much action as he can without congressional approval, much to Republicans’ chagrin. For example, at the end of June, Obama announced that he would do as much as he could by himself to address immigration reform -- an issue magnified by the recent influx of an estimated 52,000 undocumented child immigrants from Central America. He painted House Republicans as unwilling to move forward with critical legislation. "I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing," he said. "America cannot wait forever for them to act. And that's why today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress." Republicans are saying his actions are brash and unconstitutional. Some, like former vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, say it’s grounds for impeachment. The topic came up on the Sunday talk shows amid discussion of immigration legislation and House Speaker John Boehner’s plan to sue Obama over his decision to delay the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, stood up for Obama and his use of presidential power. "This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history," said Beto, who is from El Paso. We decided to check it out. Obama’s place in executive order history Earlier this year, we looked into how many executive orders Obama had signed compared to previous presidents. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. For example, Obama cannot use executive orders to raise the minimum wage for the entire country, but he did use an executive order recently to raise the minimum wage for workers hired under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour. The use of executive orders picked up under Ulysses S. Grant, who issued 217 executive orders, nearly 140 more than his predecessor Andrew Johnson, who himself almost doubled Abraham Lincoln, the previous record holder. The current record holder is Franklin Roosevelt, who issued 3,522 executive orders throughout his time in office. Here’s what we found for the past 10 presidents, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara: President Number of executive orders Obama 182 George W. Bush 291 Bill Clinton 364 George H. W. Bush 166 Ronald Reagan 381 Jimmy Carter 320 Gerald Ford 169 Richard Nixon 346 Lyndon Johnson 325 John F. Kennedy 214 So in the past 50 years, Obama has so far signed fewer executive orders than every other president except two -- Gerald Ford (who finished Richard Nixon’s second term) and George H. W. Bush (who served one term). And he’s signed fewer per day than every president back to Grover Cleveland, according to research by the Brookings Institution. But O’Rourke said ‘actions’ O’Rourke is on solid ground had he said "executive orders." But he said "executive actions." That’s a different and tougher to prove statistic. Executive action is a hard-to-define and broad category that encompasses any unilateral presidential action -- including the executive orders listed above, pardoning criminals, amending the internal structure of the executive branch, issuing signing statements, writing letters and memoranda, and more. The White House recently released a document touting 45 solo actions Obama has taken this year alone. The list includes his executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal employees. It also talks about his recently unveiled Environmental Protection Agency plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent, which is not an executive order. And there are smaller measures, like creating working groups and encouraging local leaders to commit to end veteran homelessness. John Woolley, a political science professor at University of California Santa Barbara, outlined three types of executive actions: Officially enumerated orders and proclamations; Presidential orders conveyed in writing in forms other than executive orders and proclamations; Discretionary actions by executive agencies that a president encourages or tolerates and could stop or reverse. Woolley noted, though, that while the federal register catalogs executive orders, there is not a consolidated tally of all executive actions. This makes comparing Obama’s use of unilateral action to other presidents’ difficult, said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "There is no single metric you can point to and say, ‘This president has executed more unilateral actions than other presidents,’ " Mayer said. Additionally, some scholars and politicians might disagree on what counts as unilateral presidential action and how important that particular action is, he added. But based on his research, Mayer said Obama has done nothing exceptional in terms of unilateral actions, compared to other presidents. Similar criticisms have been thrown at presidents from the opposing party for centuries, starting with George Washington’s decision to proclaim neutrality in the war between England and France. But unless agencies or scholars start to tally and examine all executive actions, not just orders, it may be impossible to quantify a president’s use of unilateral power. "People who say Obama has issued fewer (or certainly no more) executive orders than his immediate predecessors are correct," Woolley said. "However, the claim that he has directed fewer executive branch discretionary actions is far less certain. For the record, O’Rourke’s office provided us evidence about executive orders, not executive actions. Our ruling O’Rourke said, "This president has offered fewer executive actions than almost any other president preceding his presidency in recent history." People often point to the number of a president’s executive orders to indicate his use of unilateral action, and by that metric, Obama has a lower record than most presidents in recent history. That’s likely what O’Rourke meant when he said "executive action." But executive action includes much more than just orders, and there’s no way to definitively calculate how many Obama has carried out in order to compare him to other presidents. O’Rourke is right when it comes to one type of executive action -- executive orders -- but the rest of the record is unclear. As such, we rate, we rate O’Rourke’s statement Half True.

pomt-03949	"Every dollar we invested in high-quality, early education programs can save more than $7 later on by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing crime."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/19/barack-obama/does-obama-get-education-claim/	President Barack Obama called on Congress to expand access to early childhood education in his State of the Union address. "Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than $7 later on – by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime," Obama said. Obama name-dropped Georgia and Oklahoma as states that have prioritized early education, and traveled to an early childhood education program in Decatur to reinforce his point. The president used nearly the same language about the economic benefits of early education in his speech at the College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center in Decatur and posted the claim on his Twitter account. We wanted to know whether "high-quality" pre-school really provides states about $7 in bang for their buck and whether Obama’s right about the other aspects of these programs. Obama is touting a number familiar in the debate on Head Start, the federal program created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 that aims to prepare children from birth to age 5 from low-income families for school. Services for enrolled children and their families include health, nutrition, social services and education. Others have questioned efforts by Georgia and other states to implement universal preschool for 4-year-olds, citing the cost and its results. A White House official referred us to a recent report on a prominent long-term study aimed at determining whether early education programs can have a positive impact on a child’s future. A White House fact sheet says Obama plans to expand the federal government’s Early Head Start program, which serves children from birth to age 3. First, let’s look at whether the president’s math is correct. In the early 1960s, a team of researchers started what’s known as the HighScope Perry Preschool Program. The study targeted 123 economically disadvantaged, at-risk African-American children in a small town called Ypsilanti, Mich., which is about 30 miles from Detroit. Fifty-eight of them were randomly selected to participate in a program to which they had access to early care education; the rest received no preschool program. The 123 students were tracked over various stages of their childhood and at the ages of 19 and 27. Obama’s press team pointed us to a University of Chicago’s report that analyzed the benefit-cost ratio for the Perry program in the footsteps of other studies. The paper said "each dollar invested returns in present value terms 7 to 12 dollars back to society." A 1999 report by the Libertarian Cato Institute concluded there’s scant empirical evidence to back up the claim that there is a $7 return for each dollar invested in these programs. Our friends at PolitiFact Ohio explored a similar claim about the economic effectiveness of Head Start in 2011. Their fact check focused on a 2007 study on Head Start by Jens Ludwig, a University of Chicago professor, and Deborah A. Phillips of Georgetown University. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly True. W. Steven Barnett, a co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, wrote a commentary where he included a benefit-cost analysis using data from three programs similar to Head Start (including Perry). The estimated return for Perry was 16.1 to 1. Now, let’s examine whether Obama has a point about the impact of early education on graduation rates, teen pregnancy and crime. The students who had access to the early education program in Michigan were more likely to graduate from high school and earn higher salaries, and less likely to be arrested, Perry researchers concluded. One of the University of Chicago researchers also told us that they found girls who enrolled in the early care program were half as likely to be pregnant as teenagers compared with those who did not enroll in the program. Some researchers are less impressed by the Perry program, saying the sample of students studied was too small and it was designed to help enrollees do well. The author of the 1999 Cato study cites other research that says students who enrolled in the Perry program dropped out of school at higher rates than students who were not considered at-risk and that there is no consensus on what components of the program were responsible for the children's gains. Regarding Head Start, some researchers found children who experienced Head Start were more likely to finish high school and have better jobs with greater earning power, and less likely to commit crime when they grew up. They also thought an emphasis on medical screenings and preventive care reduced Medicaid expenses. Head Start critics say the program is inefficient and wasteful. Some point to a 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study of Head Start that showed few advantages by the end of the third grade for students who entered the program as 3-year-olds as opposed to children who enrolled in Head Start at the age of 4. Since Obama mentioned the programs in Georgia and Oklahoma, we thought we should see what has been the extended impact of them in those states. A 2009 study of Georgia’s pre-k program concluded it was a positive learning environment, but "leaders may want to consider increasing time spent on literacy and math while continuing to ensure that children engage in a broad array of activities." Oklahoma news outlets have reported that fourth grade math and reading scores have declined in the past decade since that state was declared a leader in early education. Our ruling The president says every dollar the federal government invests in high-quality early education programs can save more than $7 later on by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy and crime. Obama’s figure is widely shared and based on academic reports that have tried to determine the cost of Head Start and the Perry program. Whether these programs are "high-quality" is a more difficult discussion. There is debate about the long-term effectiveness of the Perry program and of Head Start because there are so many factors involved in a child’s development after the child leaves these programs. Additionally, there’s little research on the long-term impact of these programs in Georgia and Oklahoma, so the president’s remarks seem to be a stretch at this point. The president’s statement is partially true but needs an awful lot of context to be fully understood. We rate Obama’s claim Half True.

pomt-07003	"Fifty-one percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/08/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-51-percent-american-households-pa/	In a July 7, 2011, floor speech, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, offered a striking statistic about how few American households pay federal income taxes. "Let's talk about federal tax reform," he said, referring to suggestions that a restructuring of the tax code could emerge from bipartisan negotiations over extending the federal government’s ability to borrow money. "There has been a lot of discussion about that, where we want to take the tax code with all of its multiple provisions and get it on the table and take a look at it to make sure it is, in my view, flatter, fairer and simpler. "But right now, the fact (is) that according to the Committee on Joint Taxation, 51 percent -- that is, a majority of American households -- paid no income tax in 2009. Zero. Zip. Nada. … Actually, to show how out of whack things have gotten, 30 percent of American households actually made money from the tax system by way of refundable tax credits -- the Earned Income Tax Credit, among others. So 51 percent of American households paid no income tax in 2009, but 30 percent actually made money under the current system." In a sign that this is becoming a Republican talking point, Cornyn’s comments echoed those made on the floor the same day by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. So, is it true that a majority of Americans aren’t paying any federal income tax? The answer is that Cornyn is correct. And the backstory is interesting. As Cornyn noted, his statistics come from a document produced by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected bipartisan committee of Congress. The JCT found that for tax year 2009, roughly 22 percent of "tax units" (not exactly "households," but we’ll give Cornyn a pass on the terminology) ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. By contrast, JCT found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government. How did we get to the point where most Americans don’t pay federal income taxes? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia explained it a few months ago while checking a similar claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va. The main reason is that the U.S. employs the tax system not just to collect funds but to distribute them as well. Bob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called "tax expenditures." "There are lots and lots of them," he said. "We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution." However, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don’t lower their taxes to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook. Concern about the wisdom of providing so many tax expenditures is one of the reasons why some are calling for fundamentally restructuring the tax code, perhaps as part of the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations. A tax code that included fewer specialized exemptions and deductions would enable basic tax rates to fall for all tax brackets. As an added benefit, the tax code would become simpler. We should note that Cornyn worded his statement carefully enough to avoid potential pitfalls. Here are a few of them: Cornyn made clear that he meant 2009. The percentage of households with no tax liability bounces around quite a bit year by year, partly due to changes in the tax code and partly due to changing economic conditions. Figures from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center show that since 2004, the percentage of no-liability tax units has been as low as 39.9 percent in 2007. In fact, 2009 -- the year Cornyn cited -- may prove to be a high point. The center’s projections suggest that the rate could fall to 49.5 percent for tax year 2010 and 46.4 percent in 2011. Cornyn took care to refer to households that pay no "income tax," rather than suggesting that they paid no taxes at all. Many Americans who pay no income tax pay other federal taxes, most notably the payroll tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working American’s paycheck. Estimates by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center project that for tax year 2011, 46.4 percent of households won’t have any income tax liability. However, of this number, 28.3 percent will pay payroll taxes, the center projects. Of the remaining 18.1 percent with neither income nor payroll tax liability, 10.3 percent are elderly and 6.9 percent are not elderly but have incomes lower than $20,000. In other words, all but a tiny sliver of Americans without either income tax or payroll tax liability are either elderly or poor. Some families who pay no federal income tax may be liable for state income taxes (and local property taxes, sales taxes and the like). But Cornyn began his remarks by talking about "federal tax reform," so we won't fault him for not mentioning that. There are enough different ways to look at the tax burden to allow all sides to pick and choose tax statistics that favor their positions. Conservatives have a point that richer Americans pay the lion’s share of federal taxes. In 2007, according to the Urban-Brookings Center, the richest 20 percent paid 68.9 percent of federal taxes, and the top 1 percent paid 28.1 percent. (One would expect the rich to pay more, since they earn more, but these percentages are even higher than their share of the nation's total income. According to one frequently cited academic study, the top 20 percent earned 61.4 percent of income in 2006 and the top 1 percent earned 21.3 percent of income that same year.) In addition, the richest 10 percent, 5 percent and 1 percent of taxpayers each paid significantly higher effective tax rates than Americans lower on the income spectrum. On the other hand, PolitiFact rated as Mostly True a recent statement by President Barack Obama that "if you're a … wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are … lower than they've been since the 1950s." And by international standards, the U.S. tax burden remains modest. In other words, scoring points on tax policy depends on how you frame the issue. So where does this leave us? A full understanding of U.S. tax policy requires a lot of additional context that Cornyn didn’t supply. Still, at PolitiFact, words matter, and on the specific point Cornyn was making -- that a majority of American households paid no income tax in 2009 -- he not only accurately cited a credible study but also took care to cite a specific year and to explain that he only meant to refer to federal income taxes. So we rate Cornyn’s statement True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2011-07-08T16:07:55	2011-07-07	['United_States']
pomt-03906	In annual surveys of Rhode Island communities that receive Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/01/nancy-devaney/chairwoman-ocean-state-prevention-alliance-says-ma/	As Rhode Island lawmakers debate proposals to legalize marijuana, health officials and others opposed to drug use are warning of serious consequences. Among their concerns is that efforts to legalize the drug may lead teenagers to believe there is no risk of serious harm in using it. Some national surveys say that marijuana use among young people has increased in recent years, after surveyed declines during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nancy Devaney is chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a Rhode Island organization that opposes marijuana legalization. In a Feb. 20 news release from the Alliance, this statement is attributed to her: "In annual surveys of Rhode Island communities that receive [federal] Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm." PolitiFact Rhode Island contacted Devaney to ask about the claim. She e-mailed us numbers she said came from surveys conducted in five of the eight Rhode Island communities that make up the alliance, which works to pursue grants aimed at preventing and reducing drug use. Devaney said the communities conducted the surveys to fulfill requirements of federal grants they received. Devaney gave us survey numbers but not the survey questions and results, so we sought to verify them. We contacted officials from the communities involved and got results from six of the eight communities in the Prevention Alliance. Some of the communities surveyed middle school students and some didn’t, but all surveyed high school students, so we’ll focus on those results. When we looked at the numbers, things became a bit complicated because the communities asked the question and tabulated the results in different ways. Tiverton, Middletown and North Kingstown, for example, asked high school students whether daily use of marijuana posed risk of serious harm -- the way Devaney phrased her statement. But other communities asked variations of the question. For example, some asked whether smoking marijuana a few times a week -- not daily -- posed a serious risk. And when the responses were tabulated, some grouped results, combining "moderate" and "great risk." All of the survey results we reviewed, however, supported Devaney’s general point -- that a majority of young people didn’t believe that regular marijuana use was risky. PolitiFact Rhode Island also looked at national research. The survey Monitoring the Future, done yearly by University of Michigan researchers since the 1970s, asked more than 45,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 questions including about their perception of the risk of harmfulness of marijuana. Asked about people who smoke marijuana "regularly," according to Monitoring the Future, about 67 percent of eight graders said great risk. In the 2012 survey, about 51 percent of 10th graders said great risk of harm for people who smoke marijuana regularly and 44 percent of 12th graders said they perceive great risk of harm. By contrast, in the early 1990s, the percentages of 12th graders who saw great risk of harm for marijuana were in the high 70s. A survey released in September 2012 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said that nationally 44.8 percent of people ages 12 to 17 in 2011 perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once or twice per week. And less than 28 percent perceived great risk in smoking marijuana once a month. That survey said that in Rhode Island, from 2010 through 2011, an estimated 21.5 percent of people ages 12 to 17 perceived great risk for those who smoked marijuana once a month. In other words, the national surveys generally supported Devaney’s claim as well. Our ruling Nancy Devaney, chairwoman of Ocean State Prevention Alliance, said in a news release: "In annual surveys of RI communities that receive Drug Free community grants, many report that more than 50 percent of RI youth surveyed do not think daily marijuana use poses any serious risk of harm." The percentages from surveys in several communities we checked generally supported her statement, though not all students asked about their perceptions of risk based on daily use of the drug. For those reasons, we rate the statement Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-07585	Woonsocket needs a garbage-burning power plant because "residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/27/jon-brien/rep-brien-says-woonsocket-needs-garbage-burning-po/	State Rep. Jon D. Brien, D-Woonsocket, has proposed legislation that would override Rhode Island’s 20-year ban on trash incinerators and permit Woonsocket to host a waste-to-energy plant. In a news release from the State House, and later at a hearing on Thursday before his House Committee on Municipal Government, Brien made two arguments. First, he said it makes no sense to continue dumping garbage at the Rhode Island Central Landfill, which the state has to continually expand, especially because the garbage could be transformed into a viable alternative energy resource. "Rather than burying trash in the ground and that being the end of it, why not use it to create electricity?" Brien said in an interview. That puzzled us, because the state’s Resource Recovery Corporation already generates electricity from garbage, collecting methane gas produced by the decomposing trash deep in the landfill and piping it to a commercial plant that burns the gas to produce power. But it was his second point -- that the waste-to-energy plant is needed because "residents are paying through the nose for electricity that’s fueled by foreign oil, at prices that are skyrocketing" -- that really jumped out at us. Power plants in Rhode Island converted long ago from burning oil to burning natural gas. Most new plants burn natural gas. The one big exception remains the Brayton Point power plant in Somerset that burns coal, and a little natural gas. So we wondered how the Woonsocket waste-to-energy plant that Brien supports would have any effect on our dependence on foreign oil. We contacted ISO New England, the independent, not-for-profit corporation that oversees the distribution of electricity throughout New England. Spokeswoman Ellen Foley directed us to a chart showing electric power energy sources in New England. The chart shows that natural gas accounted for 32 percent of the power generation in New England in 2010. Nuclear was the next biggest source, at 29 percent. Coal generated 11 percent of New England’s power. Hydropower generated another 5.5 percent. Renewable sources such as wind, solar, and landfill gases provide 6 percent. The power plants that can run on either oil or natural gas produced 12 percent of the region’s power. But ISO officials say they burn mostly gas, because oil is so expensive. In fact, it’s so expensive that the amount of power generated by oil, according to ISO, was only 0.4 percent. In other words, nearly zero. When we asked Brien about this discrepancy, he insisted that oil is used to generate electricity used locally. And with oil trading at a two-year high, he said it is possible that oil is affecting electricity prices. That is certainly true nationally, he said. No, it’s not. Nationally, oil produces less than one percent of the nation’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Bottom line: an extremely small percentage of Rhode Island’s and New England’s electricity comes from high-priced foreign oil. One would expect a state representative who is pushing a power plant in his district to know that. We rule his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-01793	Under President Ronald Reagan, illegal immigrants "were not pouring in like" they are now.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/24/deirdre-imus/deirdre-imus-more-illegal-immigrants-pouring-now-u/	The crisis of young Central Americans showing up at the border has presented pundits another opportunity to compare the records of President Barack Obama and President Ronald Reagan. We caught Deidre Imus, a Fox Business contributor, debating presidential immigration scorecards with Fox News analyst Lis Wiehl on July 23, 2014. "What has happened under President (Barack) Obama, is people thinking they can come here, especially unaccompanied minors, thinking they are getting amnesty," Imus said on her husband Don’s show Imus in the Morning. Wiehl shot back that this had been going on a long time and in fact, it was no different under Reagan. Imus was nonplussed. Imus: "They were not pouring in like that, Lis. Are you really going to say that?" Wiehl: "Yes, they were. They were pouring in. Yes, they were." Imus: "No, they weren’t. No, they were not." A reader asked us to find out who was right. The weight of the evidence favors Wiehl, not Imus. Less people are illegally entering, or trying to illegally enter, the country under Obama than Reagan. There are two ways to measure the pressure at the border. You can look at total apprehensions by the U.S. Border Patrol and you can look at changes in the estimates of the undocumented population in the country. Neither is perfect, but apprehension numbers have the advantage that at least they are based on the actual reports of people detained by federal agents, rather than surveys by the Census Bureau. We’ll look at the apprehension data first. Apprehensions Using data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection we can see the number of people stopped along the southwest border. This table covers the number of attempted crossings during the Reagan years. Year Apprehensions 1988 942,861 1987 1,122,067 1986 1,615,844 1985 1,183,351 1984 1,058,276 1983 1,033,974 1982 745,820 1981 749,808 Average 1,056,500 And this one covers the same border for the Obama years. Year Apprehensions 2013 414,397 2012 356,873 2011 327,577 2010 447,731 2009 540,865 Average 417,489 It’s worth noting that apprehensions include everyone who is caught in the United States illegally. This would include the unaccompanied minors who have stirred such concern recently. We know the number of these young people has been rising rapidly and the data in this table only run through 2013. It’s fair to ask if the exponential growth among children would be enough to change the results of this comparison if we had a complete count for 2014. The answer is, not likely. In 2013, the unaccompanied children represented about 6 percent of the total. While they might be the focus of the current debate, even if they continue to grow dramatically, they have a limited impact on the overall numbers. There is another issue. Susan Martin, a migration policy expert at Georgetown University, cautions that border patrol tactics changed between the 1980s and today. "The basic strategy in the 1980s, and before, was to apprehend and then return people immediately back to Mexico," Martin said. "A substantial number attempted re-entry until they were successful. It was, in effect, a revolving door. Beginning in the Clinton administration, the strategy shifted to deterrence." For a while, that deterrence strategy, which included fingerprinting and a hardened border, tended to push the numbers down. For the purposes of this fact-check, the point is that changes in tactics and policies will change the apprehension statistics. With that caveat, there were far more apprehensions during the Reagan administration than during the Obama administration. Estimated undocumented population Measuring the number of undocumented people during most of the Reagan years is difficult. Before 1986, the Census Bureau made no allowance for people who were in the country without authorization. The bureau’s best estimate was that starting in 1980, about 200,000 undocumented people entered the country each year. In 1986, the Census Bureau began tracking these numbers, but much more significant than survey methods, 1986 brought a major immigration reform law that offered amnesty to people who had been in the country continuously since 1982. In short order, more than 1.5 million people applied for and gained legal status. The standard way to measure the flow of unauthorized people into the country is to see how that population changes from year to year. But with people converting from illegal to legal status, simple comparisons became tricky during the last two years of Reagan’s term. Jeffrey Passel is a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center and is a leading authority on immigration statistics. Allowing for the people who changed their status, Passel finds "a net increase of about 1.6 million" during the Reagan years. To put that in annual terms, while the flow might have gone up and down, the average rate of 200,000 per year held true throughout Reagan’s administration. For Obama, Passel said the numbers are "far less than under Reagan." Passel said there was a net increase of 370,000 undocumented people and the average annual change was 120,000 from 2009-12. Data from the Department of Homeland Security show an actual decline. The estimated undocumented population in 2010 was 11.6 million. For 2011, it was 11.5 million, and in 2012, it was 11.4 million. (We don’t include 2009 because of a major revision in Census Bureau methodology that prevents a direct comparison.) By definition, estimating is not an exact science and so Homeland Security summarized the trend as "little to no change." "It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007," the department wrote in 2011, "given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement." Martin at Georgetown University underscored that much of the trend is due to basic economics. "Employer demand is certainly a major factor in explaining shifts in movement," Martin said. "When the economy tanked in 2008, particularly in sectors such as construction, the number of new arrivals plummeted to what is estimated to be net zero growth in undocumented migration." According to the Pew Research Center, the unauthorized immigrant population rose slightly in 2012 to 11.7 million. But that still leaves the Obama years with fewer new undocumented people than Reagan. Our ruling Imus said that people "were not pouring in" under Reagan like they are now. The numbers tell a different story. The apprehension figures, even allowing for changes in tactics, show an average of over a million attempts by people to cross the border during the Reagan years. For Obama, the average is about 417,000. If we count the size of the undocumented population, the best estimates are that it rose 200,000 per year under Reagan. The highest estimate for Obama is 120,000 per year. We rate the claim False.	None	Deirdre Imus	None	None	None	2014-07-24T16:02:43	2014-07-24	['None']

pomt-09319	"Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/16/sarah-palin/palin-says-americans-spend-100-days-paying-their-t/	On April 14, 2010, former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin addressed a tea party event in Boston and tried to characterize the scale of the tax burden in the United States. "Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves," she said. By making her point this way, Palin was using a yardstick that receives both attention and criticism every April 15, the day federal tax returns are due. So we thought it would be as good a time as any to look once again at the skirmishing over "Tax Freedom Day." (We last studied the question more than two years ago, when Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee cited a similar statistic.) Tax Freedom Day is the date when "Americans . . . have earned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the federal, state and local levels," according to the Tax Foundation, the Washington, D.C.-based group that has calculated it for decades and also determined it retroactively back to 1900. The foundation calculates Tax Freedom Day by taking the amount of tax revenue collected and dividing it by national income created, producing "an average tax burden for the U.S. economy as a whole." That percentage is then multiplied by 365 to calculate the number of days over the course of a year it would take to pay off the entire tax burden. (The calculation counts every day of the year, not adjusting for weekends, holidays or leap years.) To determine tax revenue, the foundation adds together individual income taxes paid at every governmental level; payroll taxes, the federal levies that fund Social Security and Medicare; sales and excise taxes, which are typically collected at the state and local level; corporate income taxes; property taxes; and other miscellaneous taxes such as those for car licenses, energy or mineral production and estates. The Tax Foundation also offers state-specific Tax Freedom Days. These range from 85 for Alaska (Palin's home state) and Louisiana to 117 for higher-tax Connecticut. But the national average is 99. So if we measure Palin by how closely her figure tracks with the current Tax Freedom Day statistic, she scores well. She rounded up from 99 to 100 -- close enough in our book -- and she used the national average rather than any state figure, which is appropriate. Still, before giving Palin the Truth-O-Meter seal of approval, we need to determine whether she described the number's meaning accurately. And this requires delving into the annual debate over how useful the Tax Freedom Day concept is. The Tax Foundation's loyal antagonist in this annual battle is the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. CBPP doesn't suggest that Tax Freedom Day is a bad statistic; it acknowledges that it's a perfectly fine tool if you need to compare the level of taxation in different countries, or measure how the tax burden has changed over time. However, CBPP does cite a number of complaints. We're ignoring a bunch that aren't addressed by Palin's comment, such as concerns over how the state-by-state tax burdens are calculated. The one criticism by CBPP that we do think is relevant to Palin's comment is the argument that Tax Freedom Day ignores differences in how much Americans of different income levels pay in taxes. The Tax Foundation's number represents an average tax burden for the economy as a whole. But CBPP argues that the foundation's number is not a good measure of what a "typical" taxpayer pays. To explain the difference, CBPP offers the following example: "Suppose four families with incomes of $50,000 each pay $2,500 in taxes — 5 percent of their income — while one wealthy family with income of $300,000 pays $90,000 in taxes — 30 percent of its income. Total income among these five families is $500,000, and the total amount paid in taxes is $100,000. Thus, 20 percent of the total income of the five families goes to pay taxes. But the 20 percent figure is highly misleading as an indicator of the typical tax burden for families in this group," since four of the five families have tax rates just one-fourth of that amount. This is obviously an extreme case, and William Ahern, the Tax Foundation's director of policy and communications, countered that in the real world of taxation, the differences between taking a strict average (as the Tax Foundation does) and using a median figure (which would more closely reflect patterns of income distribution) aren't that great. CBPP cites research showing that the difference is significant. CBPP argues that there's enough income inequality in the United States, and enough progressivity in the tax code, to undermine the usefulness of Tax Freedom Day calculations. That's because a sizable majority of taxpayers must work significantly fewer days to pay off their tax bill -- and a minority must work significantly more days. So any attempt to suggest that Tax Freedom Day represents the experience of a typical American -- as opposed to one on the higher end of the income spectrum -- may be problematic. The good news for the Truth-O-Meter is that we don't have to resolve this dispute in order to rate Palin's comment -- we only need to make sure that Palin described accurately the statistic she was using. The bad news in this particular case is that Palin's phrasing is a bit elliptical, making it difficult to parse her words. Palin said, "Americans now spend 100 days out of the year working for government before we even start working for ourselves." That's pretty close to what the Tax Foundation said in its own release -- "Americans will work well over three months of the year — from Jan. 1 to April 9 — before they have earned enough money to pay this year's tax obligations at the federal, state and local levels." Both Palin and the Tax Foundation avoid saying that Tax Freedom Day represents the experience of "a typical American," which would have been a more problematic phrasing. Our graduated tax system, which is weighted more heavily on the wealthy, means that the average amount paid is skewed upward by a smaller number of wealthy people who pay a lot. In other words, there are many, many more people who would fall under the 100-day threshold mentioned by Palin than over it. We think listeners take Palin as referring to what a typical American pays in taxes, since she didn't specify otherwise. Leaving that impression in listeners' minds, we knock her statement down to Mostly True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2010-04-16T11:21:44	2010-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-02134	A 2013 state law would allow the operator of an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin to "fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/08/dan-kaufman/Dan-Kaufman-claims-wisconsins-new-mining-law-would/	Debate over the proposed Gogebic Taconite iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin has quieted since the 2013 passage of a state law relaxing environmental protections for iron mining. But it has not disappeared. Gogebic wants to build a $1.5 billion open pit iron mine in the Penokee Range in Iron and Ashland counties, and has begun what is expected to be a long permitting process with the state Department of Natural Resources. The agency is one of several, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that will weigh in on the project. Company officials and state business leaders say the mine will provide thousands of jobs in an economically depressed part of the state. Opposition comes from environmentalists, some local residents and members of the Bad River band of the Chippewa, whose reservation lies near the site. Opponents have dug in -- some literally in a North Woods encampment, and some in higher profile venues such as the pages of the Sunday New York Times. Environmental arguments against the project dominated a March 29, 2014 opinion piece in the Times by Wisconsin native Dan Kaufman, a writer and musician who now lives in Brooklyn N.Y. (Kaufman is also a fact checker who works as a freelancer for the Times.) Kaufman’s piece was titled "The Fight for Wisconsin’s soul" and detailed the size and scope of what all agree will be an immense project. (In a separate item, we rated Half True a Kaufman claim that the mine "could be extended as long as 21 miles.") Gogebic had a hand in drafting the 2013 law, which Kaufman says would give the company "astonishing latitude" when it came to building the mine -- including this startling claim: "The new law allows the company to fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste." When asked for backup, Kaufman said portions of the law, Section 295, mandate that the state approve the filling of ponds and streams, providing the company re-creates -- the legal term is mitigates -- the filled-in area in another location. "So, an applicant shall receive DNR approval if they do something to ‘mitigate or compensate’ for the destruction elsewhere," Kaufman said in an email interview. But that important point was not mentioned in his original piece. In the interview, Kaufman noted the law doesn’t say where the company would have to do the mitigation work. It could, he argued, be nowhere near the mine. Kaufman’s overall interpretation of the mining law is correct, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top official overseeing the project. For years, state law has allowed developers who build on wetlands to re-create an equivalent wetlands in another location. The mining law applied a similar standard to some bodies of water that would be affected by the Gogebic project, Lynch said. "You can do that under limited situations," he said. "If they are going to have to impact surface waters, they can propose to mitigate." The law applies to small lakes and streams -- lakes that are smaller than two acres and streams that have a watershed smaller than two square miles. The question of where Gogebic will store waste rock is an important aspect of the mine project. That’s because to get at the iron deposits, the company will have to dig out and remove tons of undesired material from two pits that are each estimated to be two miles long. The rock that’s embedded with the iron is then removed, crushed and the iron removed with giant magnets. Preliminary plans call for the waste rock to be piled on the surface of the ground, an enormous pile called a "waste facility." Lynch said the company has not told the state where on the site they propose to locate such a facility -- or said whether any bodies of water could be affected. Tentative plans call for Gogebic to use waste rock from the second pit to backfill the first pit, while the remaining rock would remain on the surface. At this point, the company has not proposed filling in any streams or ponds. "It will depend on the design submitted at that time," Lynch said. "They may lay it out so that it doesn’t have any impact on streams or lakes." Our rating The state law aimed at paving the way for the Gogebic mine relaxed environmental regulations for iron mining, and sped up the permit process, steps aimed at giving the company more certainty. Kaufman says that law also lets the company "fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste." Kaufman’s correct that the new mining law allows streams and ponds to be filled in at the mining site. But he left out an important point -- that before that takes place the company and state would have to strike a deal for comparable streams and ponds to be created elsewhere. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Dan Kaufman	None	None	None	2014-05-08T04:59:00	2014-03-29	['Wisconsin']

pomt-05456	"The total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%" between January 2009 and March 2012.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hispanic-unemployment-has-risen-u/	In a mid April Pew poll, Mitt Romney trailed President Barack Obama among Hispanic voters, who gave the president a whopping 67 percent to 27 percent margin. In an effort to bolster his standing with this key electoral group, Romney’s campaign on April 20, 2012, released a statistical graphic that takes a shot at Obama’s record on Hispanic unemployment. Among the statistics cited was this one: "The total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%." The time frame was between January 2009 and March 2012. We decided to take a closer look. We turned to unemployment data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official agency for such numbers. We found that the Hispanic unemployment rate in January 2009 was indeed 10.0 percent, and the rate in March 2012 -- the most recent month available -- was 10.3 percent. But that isn’t the whole story. Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, about two-thirds of the way through the month. One could just as easily have considered the first month on his watch to be February 2009 -- the first month during which he was president for the entire time. And if you start the clock in February 2009, just one month later, the picture is significantly different. In February 2009, the Hispanic unemployment rate was 11.1 percent. Using that as the baseline, Hispanic unemployment fell by eight-tenths of a percentage point by March 2012 -- instead of rising three-tenths of a percentage point. The fact that there is a major difference if you move the starting point by just one month is not surprising. Hispanics are heavily represented in the construction industry, a sector that was hit unusually hard in the first year of the recession. Indeed, job prospects for Hispanics were in a free fall by the time Obama took office. In the year-long span between January 2008 and January 2009 -- a period when George W. Bush was president -- Hispanic unemployment rose from 6.5 percent to 10.0 percent, far faster than it did during Obama’s tenure even if you do begin counting in January 2009. The point isn't that starting the count in February is vastly superior to starting in January. But when two plausible options offer such widely divergent results, picking the one that spins the claim in a way much more favorable to Romney is clearly cherry-picking. In the meantime, there’s also an argument -- one we’ve made before -- that it’s unfair to blame Obama for job losses very early in his term. In fact, the pattern seen when you start in February only gets stronger the further you go into Obama’s first year. If you start counting six months into his tenure, the reduction in Hispanic unemployment on his watch has been 2.2 percentage points, and if you start counting nine months into his tenure, it's been 2.7 percentage points -- a sharply different scenario than the one in Romney’s graphic. One additional factor: There’s a lot of uncertainty in the data that casts doubt on whether it can be used to support sweeping conclusions. When you slice the monthly unemployment data by ethnic groups, such as Hispanics, "the sample sizes become small enough to introduce a fair amount of sampling error into the resulting statistics," said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who served as an outside adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Davis noted that according to BLS, the approximate margin of error for the monthly unemployment rate for Hispanics is 0.34. That’s more than twice as wide as the margin of error for the measurements of men and women, and more than three times as wide as the margin of error for unemployment figures for the population as a whole. So in reality, the January 2009 figure might have been as high as 10.3 percent instead of 10 and the March 2012 figure could have been as low as 10 percent instead of 10.3. (Or it could have risen from 9.7 percent to 10.6 percent over the same period -- we just don’t know.) "It is hard to say whether the January or February 2009 data provide a more accurate indication of the likely Hispanic unemployment rate at the beginning of the Obama Administration," Davis said. "Similar points apply to the March 2012 measure." Our ruling The Romney campaign said that "the total unemployment rate for Hispanic or Latino workers has increased from 10% to 10.3%" between January 2009 and March 2012. The numbers the Romney team cites are accurate, but they may not be statistically significant, and if you use equally plausible time frames, the numbers tell a dramatically different story. These amount to missing critical facts that would have given a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-04-24T12:14:46	2012-04-20	['None']

pomt-02501	Of minimum wage workers in Rhode Island "only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/feb/14/mike-stenhouse/minimum-wage-workers-rhode-island-only-14-percent-/	Michael Stenhouse, chief executive officer of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, frequently appears on radio and in public forums to argue for lower taxes and, lately, to oppose efforts to increase Rhode Island’s minimum wage. Since July of 2009 the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour. States are free to set their own minimum wage rates, as long as they don’t go below the federal level. Last year, the General Assembly increased Rhode Island’s minimum wage to $8 an hour, effective Jan. 1, 2014, and there are proposals to increase it further. Stenhouse argues that the economic effects of raising the minimum wage are exaggerated by those who want to increase it. Most workers who support a family are already getting more than the minimum wage, he says, while those earning the minimum wage are usually young people supplementing an already above-the-minimum combined family income. On Jan. 27, in a news release, Stenhouse quantified that claim. Of Rhode Islanders who are earning minimum wage, he said, "only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family." When we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he said the source of the data was the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed, Washington, D.C.-based organization that produces research critical of state and federal minimum wages. The employment institute prepared the research for the Rhode Center for Freedom and Prosperity last spring, when the General Assembly was considering raising the minimum wage to $8.25, so that was the figure used in the study. The legislature wound up approving an $8-an-hour minimum wage. The report is posted on the Center for Freedom and Prosperity’s website, rifreedom.org, with a pie chart that illustrates its findings. Michael Saltsman, research director of the Employment Policies Institute, told us that its analysis was derived from a regular monthly survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics in which people are asked about their incomes and family status, among other things. The institute found that, of Rhode Islanders earning less than $8.25-an-hour, 8 percent were single parents and 6 percent were married and the sole family earner. Stenhouse said he added those together to get his 14 percent. He said he picked those two categories specifically, because he was focusing on families getting by on minimum wage. We weren’t able to recreate Saltsman’s results, but other groups that have used the same data have ended up with similar findings. Heidi Shierholz is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, based in Washington, D.C., that advocates increasing the minimum wage. She said the numbers Stenhouse used didn’t seem out of line, but she added he was carving a narrow demographic slice from the total population affected by minimum wage increases. But, as Stenhouse points out, he specifically limited his statement to families, not the broader category of households. Our ruling Michael Stenhouse says only 14 percent of Rhode Islanders earning minimum wage or less are the sole earners for their families. Stenhouse was citing figures from an established research group that another research group, with an opposite political philosophy, found to be credible. The study he cited was based on an $8.25 wage, rather than Rhode Island’s $8 rate. But that’s not enough to make a big difference. We rule his claim True.

pomt-14365	Says Donald Trump promised "to take care of everybody (through government-run healthcare and) the government's going to pay for it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/21/club-growth/club-growth-claim-ignores-key-points-donald-trumps/	Club For Growth is trying to make it appear that Donald Trump is in favor of more government-run health care. In a television ad attacking the billionaire Republican, the conservative Washington-based anti-tax group features a female announcer stating, "Some people think government-run, taxpayer-paid health care is a disaster, and some don't." The commercial cuts to Democrat Hillary Clinton promising "we will have quality affordable healthcare for every American," and then to CBS News anchor Scott Pelley questioning Trump by declaring, "Universal healthcare," and Trump responding, "I'm going to take care of everybody." There's a quick cut back to Pelley asking, "Who pays for it?" and Trump responding, "The government's going to pay for it." The announcer continues, "Ask Donald Trump why he sides with Hillary Clinton and why he wants more government healthcare." For this fact check, we will try to look at whether Club For Growth was accurately depicting Trump's stand. In the Republican debates, Trump has repeatedly called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Obamacare is not government-run health care. It is, however, a system of private insurance plans where the government sets minimum standards for those plans, helps people compare plans and sign up for a plan through a "marketplace," subsidizes some of the cost for low-income people, and penalizes people who don't purchase a plan. Trump has consistently characterized that system as "a disaster." So why is Club for Growth saying that Trump wants more government healthcare? First, we checked to see if the group accurately portrayed what Trump said. We located the Pelley interview and found the group had taken his points out of context. The interview aired on 60 Minutes on Sept. 27. As always, Trump attacks the act. "What's your plan for Obamacare?" Pelley asks. "Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced," says Trump. "Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up 45, 50, 55 percent." (A claim with cherry-picked data that PolitiFact later ruled to be Half True.) Pelley asks, "How do you fix it?" "There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered," says Trump. "This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, 'No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private.' But —" At this point, Pelley seems to interrupt. "Universal health care?" he asks. "I am going to take care of everybody," Trump says. "I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now." Pelley: "The uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?" Trump: "They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably —" Pelley: "Make a deal? Who pays for it?" "The government's gonna pay for it," Trump says. "But we're going to save so much money on the other side." Yet in the next breath, the candidate seems to talk about people buying their own plans, a key point Club for Growth has left out. "But for the most part, it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything," he says. We note that some of the goals Trump is talking about are very similar to the goals of Obamacare, which was an attempt to get everyone covered, let private plans provide the coverage, let the private plans compete for customers and let people have their own doctors. (That last element wasn't fulfilled for some people who found they could not, despite President Barack Obama's vow, keep their old health plan and, by extension, may have been forced to use a different physician. In addition, although he told Pelley, "Everybody's got to be covered," the healthcare plan on his website calls for eliminating the Obamacare penalty for not purchasing insurance. "No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to," it says. Trump has also expressed support for other ideas that go beyond the ACA, such as letting insurers market the same plans across state lines, letting taxpayers deduct health insurance premiums the way businesses do, expanding the use of Health Savings Accounts so any member of a family can tap into it without penalty and make them inheritable, and allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices, a change in federal law that, he says, would save about $300 billion a year. But none of these proposals constitute more government-run, government-paid healthcare, and Trump has said he opposes a single-payer system. We contacted both Club for Growth and the Trump campaign about the ad and Trump's plans, but we didn't get a response. Our ruling Club for Growth says Trump promises "to take care of everybody (through government-run healthcare and) the government's going to pay for it." It's clear from Trump's website and some of his public comments that he wants a market-based approach to healthcare, not a system run by the government, which makes the Club for Growth ad wrong. Because Trump wants a program to cover the poor — "the lower 25 percent that can't afford private" insurance — doesn't mean, as the ad contends, that "he wants more government healthcare." After all, the poor already get health coverage under Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the states and the federal government. We rate Club for Growth's claim False.

pomt-13326	Says Donald Trump "hasn’t broken his promise" to release his tax returns.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/pences-false-claim-trump-hasnt-broken-tax-return-p/	Donald Trump’s tax returns became a fiery point of contention between vice presidential nominees Tim Kaine and Mike Pence in their first and only debate. "Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014, and he said, ‘If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes,’ " Kaine charged. "He's broken his first — " "And he will," Pence interjected. "He's broken his first promise," Kaine insisted. "He hasn't broken his promise," Pence said. "Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires. The American people can review that. And he's going -- senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over." "Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit," Kaine countered accurately, before the moderator directed the discussion to Social Security. Kaine was referencing a 2014 interview Trump did with Irish TV. While he didn't use those exact words, Kaine's quote is largely accurate. That was before Trump was actually running for president. But Trump has said he would release his tax returns multiple times since annoucning his candidacy as well. "Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?" NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Trump in January 2016. "Well, we're working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely," Trump replied. A few weeks later, Trump told the Today Show in February 2016 that he’ll release his tax returns "probably over the next few months." Since those comments, Trump has repeated the promise but with conditions. Recently, he’s said he would release them once Clinton releases all of her emails. And as Pence mentioned, Trump has said repeatedly he has yet to do so because an ongoing IRS audit. (He’s also suggested he probably won't before election day.) According to his tax attorneys, Trump has been "under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002." But he’s also promised to release his tax returns without this condition and, presumably, while under audit in 2011, 2014 and 2015. As Buzzfeed reported, Trump suggested he’d "love" to release his tax returns in 2011, when he was flirting with a presidential bid and questioning Barack Obama’s birthplace. "Maybe I’m going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate," Trump said in an April 18, 2011, interview with ABC. "I may tie my tax returns, I’d love to give my tax returns, I may tie my tax returns into Obama’s birth certificate." When the White House released Obama’s birth certificate a week later, Trump told ABC he would fulfill his pledge and release his tax records "at the appropriate time." A few years later, Trump had yet to release his tax returns, prompting an Irish television host to ask him about it in a May 2014 interview. "You questioned his citizenship during his campaign, and you said afterwards if he produced that long-form birth certificate, you’d produce your tax returns. But you didn’t do it, did you?" asked TV3’s Colette Fitzpatrick. "Well I don’t know, did he do it?" Trump said. "If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that." Trump also repeatedly agreed to release his tax returns in a February 2015 interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. If he ran for president, Trump said, "I would release tax returns and I’d also explain to people that as a person that’s looking to make money — you know, I’m in the business of making money until I do this — and if I won, I would make money for our country." "How many years back?" Hewitt asked. "Three years, five years?" "The answer is I would do it. But I will tell you upfront, as a private person, and I’m very proud of this, I want to pay as little taxes as I can as a private person," Trump said. "Of course. That’s the American way. Legally," Hewitt agreed. "But how many years back would you go back? Three, five? "I don’t know. I actually have not even thought of that. But I would certainly show tax returns if necessary. Well, what have they been doing? They’ve been really doing one year other than people that never made anything. But I would certainly — I’m very proud of what I’ve done. I do pay tax, but I’m very proud of what I’ve done," Trump said. "I have no objection to showing any tax return." Nineteen months later, and five weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Trump still has not released any returns. Our ruling Pence said Trump "hasn't broken his promise" to release his tax returns. Trump said he would "absolutely" release his tax returns in January 2016 and that it'll happen "probably over the next few months" in February without the stipulation of an IRS audit. He also made the promise in 2011, 2014 and 2015 without conditions. There’s still 33 days left before Election Day, so Trump still has time to honor this pledge. But, as of Oct. 4, 2016, when Pence made his claim, Trump has yet to show the public the money.

pomt-04264	"Wisconsin still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/11/rebecca-kleefisch/Rebecca-Kleefisch-says-Wisconsin-ranks-first-among/	Wisconsin’s is unmatched nationally on a key jobs measure, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch asserted while promoting a fall summit of small-business owners and officials of Gov. Scott Walker’s administration. "You probably already know we lead the nation in making cheese, and you definitely know the Packers will always be at the top," Kleefisch said while delivering the governor’s statewide radio address Nov. 1, 2012. "But did you know that Wisconsin still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita? That’s right!" Kleefisch’s radio statement also ran as an opinion piece that was published by various new outlets. It’s well documented that Walker promised in the 2010 governor’s race that Wisconsin would add 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his first term, in January 2015. Through nearly two years of his four-year term, job gains total 31,911. It’s also pretty well known that Wisconsin has lost a big chunk of its manufacturing sector going back a decade or more. So is it possible the state is still the king of making things? There’s more than one way to skin this statistical cat, but Wisconsin scores high on several manufacturing-job measures. Manufacturing dependency: The factory sector here employs a bigger share of the state's workers than any other state except Indiana, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Oct. 7, 2012. Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists Intl. reported in March 2012 that "Indiana is 86% more concentrated in manufacturing than average and just nudges Wisconsin for the top spot in our analysis." Indiana is home to Subaru and Honda auto plants, which give the state a boost. Manufacturing vs. government jobs: Calculations by the Wisconsin Budget Project have shown that Wisconsin and Indiana are neck-and-neck for the highest ratio of manufacturing jobs to government jobs in the nation -- a ratio viewed by some as a good measure of a state’s economic health. But Kleefisch referred to a third measure: Manufacturing jobs per capita. We located U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports and crunched the numbers behind her claim. We separately enlisted Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Budget Project, an arm of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. Wisconsin -- as Kleefisch claimed -- tops Indiana and every other state when you compare factory jobs to the overall state population. Peacock took a slightly different tack, comparing those jobs to the overall pool of potential workers -- the non-institutional population age 16 and older. "Wisconsin is #1, and by a much larger margin than I anticipated," Peacock said. "What I found is that 10 percent of Wisconsin’s population age 16 and older works in manufacturing. Indiana is #2 at 9.6 percent, followed by Iowa at 9.1 percent, and Kansas at 7.5 percent. The national average is 4.9 percent." That’s good news and bad news, Peacock said. It’s a point of pride -- and manufacturing jobs are extremely important for Wisconsin. But the state economy might be stronger if it diversified and became less dependent upon a sector that will probably continue to decline as a percentage of the national workforce, Peacock said. Kleefisch, though, is on target with the numbers. Part of the explanation is that Wisconsin dropped a smaller share of its manufacturing jobs than many other big factory-reliant states in the 2000s. Those job losses in the sector began to reverse in about January 2010, both nationally and in Wisconsin. Walker took office in January 2011. Still, though, Wisconsin is 150,000 manufacturing jobs short of its January 2000 total, according to September 2012 federal figures. Our rating Kleefisch claimed that Wisconsin "still ranks first among the 50 states in manufacturing jobs per capita." Economists debate the wisdom of heavy reliance on that sector, but Kleefisch accurately describes the state’s ranking. We rate her statement True.

pomt-02687	Fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges these days can’t find jobs.	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/07/johnny-isakson/isakson-doesnt-make-grade-his-claim-about-college-/	Parents who scrimp, save and borrow to put their children through college don’t like hearing that a four-year degree may not be the door-opener they hoped. But that’s what U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, among others, is out there saying. And Isakson is pointing fingers at a specific type of school -- liberal arts colleges. "Career academies are the future," Isakson said at a Dec. 4 town hall meeting in Coweta County. "Fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts academies couldn’t find employment, but almost 89 percent who graduated from technical schools did so." Isakson repeated the claim about liberal arts school students in a visit to The Newnan Times-Herald on the same day. Those are steep unemployment statistics for college graduates of any stripe. PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some homework on the senator’s numbers. Isakson based his statement on data developed by The Associated Press in 2012 with help from researchers. Those numbers show 1.5 million adults, or 53.6 percent of bachelor’s degree-holders under age 25, were either jobless or underemployed in 2011. In both Georgia appearances, Isakson applied the worrisome AP statistics to liberal arts school graduates. But the AP report was about all graduates, not any specific degree holders. "I am certain that Sen. Isakson’s intent was to convey the general message of the AP study," said Lauren Culbertson, the senator’s deputy communications director. Isakson is hardly the first to cite the AP report, which some education researchers say overstated the difficulties that graduates were having finding employment or landing jobs that matched their skills. Just a day before he visited Coweta County, Isakson attended the Cobb County Economic Forecast breakfast, where Albert Niemi Jr., nationally acclaimed dean of the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University, gave a speech that referenced a 2012 article in The Atlantic on the AP findings. Niemi said about half of the college graduates between 2007 and 2012 were unemployed or underemployed. He used the findings to make the case that a college diploma isn’t worth what it once was and that today’s graduates need teachable "hard skills," if they hope to get hired. Isakson left the Cobb breakfast with a hard copy of Niemi’s PowerPoint presentation, Culbertson said. Anthony P. Carnevale, director and research professor at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, said the 2012 report "grossly misrepresents the truth" about college grads in general. The unemployment rate for college graduates is under 5 percent now, Carnevale said. In 2011, it was about 7 percent for new college graduates, substantially less than the unemployment rate for high school graduates, he said. It was that way throughout the Great Recession, Carnevale said. "College unemployment went up, but much less than the unemployment rates of non-college graduates," he said. "The value of college is still high." Other educators and researchers say they see nothing to reflect major struggles for liberal arts school graduates as opposed to other degree holders. The Association of American Colleges and Universities is about to release a report that suggests the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is quite low and not much higher than other graduates, said Debra Humphreys, the association's vice president for policy and public engagement. Enrollment has been "strong" at the public liberal arts colleges and universities that are part of the North Carolina-based Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges, said Bill Spellman, the consortium’s director. "Students and parents are feeling that that well-rounded education is going to be an advantage, if not initially, then midway in their careers," Spellman said. They see the importance of having "those transferable skills of critical thinking, writing and speaking and of being able to be nimble for jobs that haven’t even been created," he said. Colleges throughout Georgia offer bachelor of arts degrees. And at Georgia College in Milledgeville, the state’s only recognized public liberal arts college, 78 percent of students in the Class of 2012 reported having jobs within three months of graduation, said Brittiny Barber Johnson, the college’s manager of media relations. The results were based on responses from 241 of the 1,136 undergraduates who received their degrees in May 2012, Johnson said. Of the students who responded, 43 percent said they were working in a job "highly related" to their major, she said. But to people who listened to Isakson at a town hall meeting at the Coweta campus of West Georgia Technical College, a much different picture emerged. Isakson told the audience 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts academies weren’t finding jobs. By contrast, he said nearly 89 percent of tech school graduates had landed jobs. Mike Light, longtime spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia, said Isakson's numbers for the state’s technical schools appear spot-on. Officials at individual technical schools are seeing about 90 percent of their graduates finding jobs and, systemwide, that number is about 85 percent, Light said. "They’ve got the in-demand careers," he said. So where does that leave us? Isakson said that 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges can’t find a job. On the face of it, he incorrectly quoted an AP report, which makes no attempt to single out liberal arts graduates and their ability to find work. He also failed to mention that the 53 percent figure included not only jobless grads, but also many people who were finding jobs, albeit in lower-paying positions than one might expect. And even that report is viewed with suspicion in some quarters. Some college graduates are having trouble finding work. Isakson is correct about that. But his statement misquotes numbers in a study that itself has been questioned. We rate Isakson’s statement False.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2014-01-07T06:00:00	2013-12-04	['None']
pomt-05147	"(Assembly Democrats) wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that....They’re down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/21/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-stopped-assembly-democrat/	The way Gov. Chris Christie makes it sound, Democrats in the state Assembly are a bunch of crazed junkies looking for their next fix of raising taxes and he’s the one forcing them into withdrawal. At a June 13 town hall meeting in Atlantic County, the Republican governor pointed to his opposition to a proposed gas tax increase as an example of him fighting off the Democrats’ addiction. "Now I’ve been governor now for over 800 days and we vetoed two income tax increases. They wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that," said Christie, according to a video posted June 14 on YouTube. "Imagine now if you’re paying 20 to 25 cents more a gallon. That’s what the Assembly Democrats would have gotten for you. We’re saying no to all that stuff. "So now…you got to see what’s happening with the Assembly Democrats. They’re like people going through withdrawals. They haven’t gotten to raise a tax in over 800 days. They’re down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no." Such colorful language, and yet so misleading, PolitiFact New Jersey found. There has been a proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but despite Christie’s suggestion, it hasn’t been pushed by the Assembly Democratic leadership and stopped by the governor. In fact, the legislation has never made it to the governor’s desk for him to take any action. State Assemblyman Albert Coutinho (D-Essex) has introduced the bill twice over the last roughly two years, but has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. The full Assembly has never voted on the proposal. As Coutinho put it, "this bill is going nowhere." First introduced in May 2010, Coutinho’s bill called for annual increases of 8-cents-per-gallon in fiscal years 2011 through 2013. According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, those increases were projected to generate a total of about $2.4 billion over the three-year period to go toward the state’s Transportation Trust Fund. Coutinho said the tax hike would allow the state to stop borrowing for the fund, which supports various transportation projects. But the bill, which Coutinho reintroduced in January for the current legislative session, hasn’t moved an inch since being referred to an Assembly committee. "Leadership’s not looking to do this," Coutinho told us. "Nobody seems willing to politically have that conversation." Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, explained that Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver does not support raising the gas tax. "Hundreds if not thousands of bills are proposed each session without getting a hearing. Nothing unusual about it at all," Hester said in an e-mail. "The governor is once again misleading the public." Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak noted how other Democrats have indicated support for a gas tax increase, including state Sen. Raymond Lesniak and state Assemblyman and state Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski. As for Christie’s role in stopping such a tax hike, Drewniak added: "The Governor was emphatic many times amid this discussion by Democrats that he would not sign legislation increasing the gasoline tax and add a new tax burden on over-taxed New Jersey residents. "The unambiguous promise of a veto is often just as effective in stopping legislation in its tracks as is the actual act of a veto." Our ruling At a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Assembly Democrats "wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that." Now Democrats are "down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no," Christie added. The governor’s right about there being a Democratic proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but Assembly Democratic leaders have stopped the bill from moving forward. Since its first introduction in May 2010, the bill has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. Since Christie’s claim "ignores critical facts that would give a different impression," we rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01665	"In six years, (U.S. Rep. Gary) Peters introduced zero bills that became law."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/20/ending-spending-action-fund/conservative-group-claims-michigan-senate-candidat/	A group founded by conservative billionaire Joe Ricketts, who spent millions to help Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, is on the air in Michigan where there’s a heated race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. Ricketts’ group, Ending Spending Action Fund, launched an ad Aug. 13 that attacks the record of Rep. Gary Peters, the Michigan Democrat hoping to succeed Levin. Peters is running against Republican Terri Lynn Land, former Michigan Secretary of State. "Can you think of a single thing he’s accomplished?" a narrator asks in the 30-second spot. A clock ticks. "In six years, Peters introduced zero bills that became law." We decided to see if that’s accurate. Peters was elected in 2008. In that time, he has sponsored 49 bills. A quick search found that four of them passed the House, but none of them made it through the Senate and onto President Barack Obama’s desk. In the past we’ve found that experts are critical of such a narrow measure of legislative success, noting that it hardly captures a lawmaker’s effectiveness or track record for moving legislation. Lawmaking is a collaborative process, so sometimes many people contribute even though only one person is listed as the original sponsor. A deeper dive into Peters’ tenure finds several legislative victories that fly in the face of the ad’s claim. On June 9, Obama signed into law H.R. 724, an act "to amend the Clean Air Act to remove the requirement for dealer certification of new light-duty motor vehicles." Basically, the certificate required for these new vehicles was duplicative, since laws already required these standards to be met during production, thus creating red tape for these dealers. While the bill’s listed sponsor is Rep. Robert Latta, R-Ohio, Peters was widely recognized for his contributions to the bill. Multiple reports indicated that he co-wrote it with Latta, and Peters was listed as the lone "original co-sponsor" of the bill. Latta’s website even says that he "along with Congressman Gary Peters introduced" the legislation. In 2010, Peters sponsored a bill he called the State Small Business Credit Initiative. The bill did not pass the House as standalone legislation. But during the markup of the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010 (later called the Small Business Jobs Act) in the House Financial Services Committee on May 19, 2010, Peters offered an amendment to incorporate his bill into the larger legislation. It was approved on 39-23 vote. So essentially, when Obama signed the Small Business Jobs Act, he was also signing Peters’ bill into law. Indeed, Peters’ profile on Congressional Quarterly notes he keeps a pen from Obama’s bill signing in his office, as Peters "was the author of an amendment that created a collateral support program for small businesses struggling to get loans because the capital they owned had decreased in value during the recession." Peters also introduced the Animal Torture Prevention Act of 2010. The bill came in response to a Supreme Court ruling that said an existing law against so-called animal crush videos that show animals being abused was too broad and may violate First Amendment rights. While Peters’ bill did not pass, a similar bill did. Peters’ bill is listed as a "related bill" on Congress’ bill-tracking service because it is "a companion measure, an identical bill, a procedurally-related measure, or one with substantive similarities," according to Congress.gov. Peters has also co-sponsored 44 bills that eventually became law, and was listed as an "original co-sponsor" on five of them. Not all of those bills are significant, nor did he play a significant role in crafting all of them. But within the walls of Congress, he can at least claim partial victory. Those examples don’t include committee work where Peters took part in shaping bills that would later become law. For example, Peters served on the powerful Wall Street Reform Conference Committee that produced the final version of Dodd-Frank, the bill that emerged in the aftermath of the recession and ensuing bailouts. Our ruling The Ending Spending ad claims that Peters hasn't accomplished anything, making this statement: "In six years, Peters introduced zero bills that became law." If you search congressional databases, you won't find a bill introduced solely by Peters that became law. But we found several instances in which Peters was credited with writing the legislation that did become law, sponsoring a bill that became part of a larger package signed by Obama, offering a bill similar to one that became law, or was an original co-sponsor. There’s a shred of truth in the claim by Ending Spending, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False. Update: After we published this piece, we heard from Brian Baker, president of Ending Spending Action Fund. Baker pointed to the evidence (which is included in our fact-check) that Peters was not sole sponsor on any bill that became law and stood by the group’s claim. "First, it is great that PolitiFact acknowledges, as it must, that ‘if you search congressional databases, you won’t find a bill introduced solely by Peters that became law.’ This sentence confirms the truth of the central assertion in our advertisement," Baker said. We stand by our original analysis and keep the rating the same at Mostly False.	None	Ending Spending Action Fund	None	None	None	2014-08-20T10:54:22	2014-08-13	['United_States']

pomt-04458	Bill Nelson "leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/10/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-attacks-bill-nelson-agricultur/	In a TV ad, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson is a down-home farmer in denim overalls, wielding a pitchfork and tending to six animated cows. The point of the political attack: Nelson is using a farm facade to get out of paying his fair share of property taxes. "After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year," says the ad from American Crossroads, the conservative super PAC founded by Karl Rove. "Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million." The ad’s kicker: "Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us." This claim echoes past criticism from Nelson’s Republican challenger, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV. The attacks stem from a February 2012 Tampa Bay Times story that scrutinized Nelson’s qualifications for a "greenbelt" property assessment, a designation that spares him from paying higher property taxes on his family’s 55-acre pasture along the Indian River in Brevard County. Thanks to the "greenbelt" designation, Nelson’s land is taxed at a much lower agricultural rate. We wanted to examine the group’s claim that Nelson used six cows and a loophole to "dodge" $43,000 in his 2011 taxes. Whether he "sold the land for home development" is the subject of another check. Nelson said the Crossroads ad is very misleading. "Of course, they don’t tell you that that has been a cow pasture for 60 years," Nelson said in an interview. "That was my 4-H club project that started in the early ’50s and has been ever since." When the Times story broke, Mack’s campaign rushed to create a singalong cartoon ad called "Udder hypocrisy." Before an animated barn, a hokey Nelson figure and six cows sang, "Bill Nelson’s farm’s the place to be / Just six cows and hypocrisy / Milking taxpayers like you and me / This is typical liberal hypocrisy." ‘An agricultural tax loophole’ The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land instead of selling to developers who wanted it for highways, shopping malls and homes. "It costs a lot to farm," said Adam Basford, the Florida Farm Bureau Federation director of legislative affairs. "And a lot of times people could see a higher use in that land for development." Farmers are fond of the greenbelt law. Critics, though, say the law is too generous and too vague. The decision to tax land on the lower agricultural rate is determined by county property appraisers, who must weigh if the land is used "primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes." The lack of specifics in Florida law invites oft-documented abuse. A 2005 investigative series by the Miami Herald chronicled several instances of property owners growing modest plants or paying ranchers to keep cows on their land to garner agricultural tax breaks on land they obviously intended to develop. The classification also creates money gaps for counties that must be made up by other taxpayers or is lost. In 2011, nearly 248,886 properties were classified as agriculture on tax rolls, according to the Florida Department of Revenue. Even though the market value for those properties was $58 billion, the assessed value was just $5 billion. The total lost tax revenues for local governments was about $969 million in 2011. Nelson on the farm Nelson’s camp says his situation is different than the abuses chronicled by the Miami Herald. He gets a greenbelt designation for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to small-time cattle owners. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and leases the land free of charge, though he is required to keep up with maintenance. The land has been in Nelson’s family since 1924. It’s been a cattle pasture since 1960, including when Nelson raised and sold a herd of cattle to pay for his education at Yale University. Nelson has said he is not abusing the designation because he is preserving the land and keeping it in his family. He used to live in a home attached to the property but sold it when he moved to Tallahassee to serve as Florida’s treasurer and insurance commissioner. Still, the savings is considerable. Without the designation, he would have paid 13 times the amount of taxes that he did in 2011. In 2011, the market value of Nelson’s property was $2.76 million. Nelson got the lower agricultural value of $210,870 in 2011. Instead of paying $48,380 in property taxes, he paid nearly $3,696.66, according to tax records, a difference of more than $44,000. The Brevard County property appraiser’s office has tried to remove Nelson’s greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.) Contrary to the ad’s suggestion, Nelson is not shirking his tax responsibility, a spokesman said, nor is he covertly planning to develop or resell his land. "You are not dodging taxes when you pay all the taxes that are owned on the property," said Dan McLaughlin, his spokesman. Those who scoff at the size of the herd grazing there now should know it’s on par with most cattle businesses in Florida, McLaughlin said. About one-third of Florida farms, or 7,165, are comprised of fewer than nine cattle or calves, according to 2007 federal data. One expert told the Times that Nelson is making an effort to "maintain some aspect of what’s a heritage family site in agriculture." "I think that would be something that the state would encourage," Stan Geberer, who works for Fishkin & Associations, a Florida economic consulting firm, told the Times. Our ruling The ad’s claims and figures about Nelson’s tax bill and Brevard County property are rooted in a report from the Tampa Bay Times. It’s accurate to say that Nelson was shielded from paying about $43,000 in property taxes because of his land has a greenbelt designation. The group emphasizes that Nelson is leasing the land, though the Times story is clear he does not charge for the Melbourne farmer to graze cows there. We think American Crossroads is stretching the truth by claiming Nelson is "dodging" his taxes. That’s a derogatory phrase commonly used for someone who doesn’t pay what they owe. That’s not the case here, though people may disagree with Nelson paying the lower agricultural rate based on the presence of six cows on a vast pasture. We rate this claim Half True.

Roy Barnes, emerged unbruised. It had been a rancorous couple of weeks for the GOP. Candidate Nathan Deal accused opponent Karen Handel of running an entirely negative campaign, a claim PolitiFact Georgia ruled Mostly True in an earlier item. Handel called Deal "a corrupt relic of Washington, D.C." Supporters of Deal, who won the runoff, claimed Handel supports aborting children with Down syndrome. We ruled that Pants on Fire. Barnes, who won his party's primary without a runoff, took full advantage of the rival party's ugliness during a Channel 2 Action News interview. He called his Republican opponents "honorable people" and said that it's possible to run a campaign without calling names. "Well, you know, I think that we were proud that we ran the Democratic primary without ... one negative TV spot," he told anchor Carol Sbarge. Really? Not a single one? As the front-runner, Barnes didn't need to go negative, Emory University political science professor Merle Black said. Polls consistently indicated Barnes could win the Democratic primary without a runoff. That allowed him to stay on the sunny side of politicking, Black said. "It was not in his interest to run anything negative because he was so far ahead of everybody else," Black said. "One of his main goals is to unify his party, and you don’t do that by going negative." To make sure Barnes played a clean game, we examined his eight 30-second TV campaign spots for evidence of negative campaigning. "Providence" In this commercial, Barnes sits on a pew in a sunny church. A harp plays in the background, and Barnes gives a 'mea culpa' for the sins he committed during his term as governor. At the time, critics complained he was heavy-handed. Voters ousted him in 2002 in favor of Sonny Perdue. "As governor, my heart was in the right place, but I didn’t listen or slow down to explain why I had to make some difficult decisions. For that, I apologize," Barnes says. Barnes' only swipe was against the Georgia General Assembly, which, he says, "plays its games." "Taxes" Sitting before the front porch of a bungalow, Barnes says he has a record of lowering taxes for homeowners. Once again, Barnes' bogeymen are "the politicians under the Gold Dome" who "took away our tax cut" to give money to special interests, he says. "It’s not right. It’s not fair. And when I’m governor, it won’t stand," he finishes. "Chalkboard" This commercial starts with Barnes pointing over a hilly vista, holding what appears to be architectural drawings. "Roy Barnes will make Georgia work again," a male announcer says. The voice adds that the number of jobs in the state grew during Barnes' term as governor, a claim we ruled Half True in a previous item. He also promises to end teacher furloughs "forever" and to "scrub corruption." The commercial reserves its harshest words for the state Legislature and "big business." "Foreclosure" Barnes returns to the bungalow in "Taxes" to plug his plan to ease the suffering of homeowners by ensuring banks negotiate before foreclosing on homes. The commercial features a crying mom, a boy clutching a stuffed elephant and a law enforcement officer who helps the woman carry possessions from her home. The bad guys? Bankers and their lobbyists. "They slapped you on the back to lend you the money and slapped you in the face when you got in trouble," Barnes says. "Education" Barnes sits with ordinary people at a diner and tells them his plans on education. He promises he won't furlough teachers or "cut the school year in order to pay for special-interest tax breaks." "I will make smaller classes. I will increase teachers pay. I will make education No. 1," he says. "Pine Pellets" Sun shines through thick stands of pine trees. Birds twitter and a slide guitar sighs. An announcer pitches Barnes' plans to get Georgia into the renewable energy business and calls the state the "Saudi Arabia of pine trees," a claim we ruled Barely True in a separate item. "When I’m governor, we’ll turn our renewable forests into a job-creating industry," Barnes says. The ad says nothing negative. "State Buildings" This ad featured Roy Barnes' plan "to put people to work -- immediately," as an announcer says. Barnes tells a group of men and women wearing hard hats that he can put tradespeople in jobs retrofitting state buildings for energy independence or efficiency. The group nods in agreement. "I think a paycheck would be great," one man replies. Again, nothing negative. "Travel for Jobs" Barnes walks through an airport, meets with people in a boardroom and concludes "we can’t bring jobs to Georgia with the rest of the country laughing at us." Once again, the General Assembly is the problem, but Barnes doesn't single out any particular legislator. The commercial says the Legislature passed goofy laws about microchips in the brain and stem cell research and talked about seceding from the union, a claim we ruled Mostly True. Those actions make Georgia look too weird for businesses interested in relocating, he says. So did Barnes run an all-positive TV campaign? While Barnes took quick jabs against special interests, banks, lobbyists and the General Assembly, these were mainly brief asides in otherwise positive commercials. The ads focused on his record and campaign promises and made no attacks against specific primary rivals. Two of Barnes' key opponents in the primary agree with Barnes' contention that he kept things positive -- at least on TV -- in the Democratic primary. Russ Willard, a spokesman for state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, said Baker agrees that Barnes kept it clean in the primary. "He [Baker] agreed with that Roy did not run negative TV ads during the primary campaign," Willard said. Another Barnes opponent in the primary, state Rep. DuBose Porter, D-Dublin, said Barnes had such massive statewide name recognition that Barnes did not have to go on the attack. "I think that’s probably correct," Porter said of Barnes’ positive-campaign pronouncement. "He just kept stealing all of my ideas." Still, Barnes' commercials were no love fest. Although he did not target candidates, he bad-mouthed special interests and big business. He also threw some punches at the state Legislature. We rule Barnes' claim Mostly True.

pomt-04741	The Obama administration "even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores!"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/john-thune/barack-obama-proposed-banning-farm-kids-doing-basi/	Hey kids on farms! Set down your screwdrivers and bags of seeds! Put your feet up and relax! Fire up the Xbox! The federal officials in the big urban city of Washington D.C. have put a target on family farms and part of that includes banning chores, says Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. "The big-government bureaucrats of the Obama administration have set their sights on our way of life," Thune said during the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Aug. 29. "Instead of preserving family farms and ranches, President Obama's policies are effectively regulating them out of business. His administration even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores!" Is it true that Obama’s administration proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores? We’ve heard similar claims about a proposed U.S. Department of Labor rule change about children working on farms. Members of Congress such as U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., said the proposed rule "would threaten generations of farm tradition and culture....The language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose." Rooney was particularly concerned about regulations on power equipment. We ruled his statement Mostly False, though, in April 2012. The proposed rule didn’t specifically mention hoses or screwdrivers, and the Labor Department specifically said it had no intention of banning children from using such equipment. Thune introduced legislation in March 2012 to block the Labor Department from enacting the proposed restrictions. The Labor Department wrote that the goal was to increase safety and provide parity between rules for children working on farms and non-farm settings. The department was specifically concerned about actual cases of minors killed or maimed in incidents with equipment on farms. But the widespread criticism prompted the Labor Department to yank its proposal, which never went into effect. Parental exemption Thune mentioned "family farms," which suggests Obama’s administration wanted to ban kids from doing chores even on their own parents’ farms. By saying "chores" rather than something such as "paid work" Thune seems to also be suggesting that this is work on their own parents’ farms. For decades, though, a parental exemption has allowed children to do any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. That means if Dad puts using a screwdriver or garden hose on the list of the kids’ chores, the feds won’t raise a fuss. The summary of the proposed rules stated they "would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents." As we wrote in a fact-check of a similar claim from U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., that meant no matter the government rules, if a parent who owns a farm tells a child to crank up the milking machine, there’s nothing to prohibit it. That seems like an important and broad exception, given that the bill sponsored by Alexander and 44 others has as its title: "Preserving America's Family Farm Act." If you’re working your own parent’s farm, the proposed rules wouldn’t have applied at all. The way the department interpreted that parental exemption -- that farms had to be wholly owned by parents for kids to work -- led to an outpouring of angry letters from family farmers who didn’t quite meet that strict definition. In February, the department announced that it would rework that section by 2012 and any decision on a final rule would follow. But that still left a lot of proposed no-nos for children working somewhere other than their own parents' farms. Children under 16 would have been banned from harvesting tobacco, doing certain work with animals, and working from ladders or structures at elevations higher than 6 feet. Violators would have faced fines, and the government could have stopped shipment on crops. Our ruling Thune said that the Obama administration "even proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores." There was a proposed rule, prompted by cases of children suffering injury or death while working with agricultural equipment. But the rule did not apply to kids working on their parents' farms. We should note there was controversy because some farmers felt that the Labor Department was interpreting the exemption too strictly. In the end, the whole proposed rule was tossed in the trash by federal officials after an outpouring of complaints. But while the proposal was alive, federal officials did not propose banning children from doing basic chores on their parents’ farms. It's ridiculously false to suggest it applied to children of family farmers and even sillier to say it applied to "chores." Pants on Fire!

pomt-00530	The original compromise for the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina "was to put it on the back side of the statehouse, out of public view so it would not have any appearance of sovereignty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/21/james-clyburn/james-clyburn-says-original-confederate-flag-compr/	The Confederate flag has returned as a flashpoint in South Carolina politics. While the flags of the United States and the state itself hang at half-staff over the state capitol in honor of the nine victims at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, the Confederate battle flag on the statehouse grounds remains at full-mast. As part of a 2000 law, it remains on statehouse grounds. That law itself was the result of protests and an economic boycott aimed at getting the Confederate flag off of the capitol dome. Over 46,000 people marched in Columbia, and the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce lobbied lawmakers to remove the flag. In what was billed as a compromise, the symbol of the South’s battle against the Union ended up alongside a monument to Confederate soldiers located in front of the statehouse. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said that law and that placement effectively betrayed an earlier deal. "The compromise was to put that flag in front of the Wade Hampton office building next to the Wade Hampton statue," Clyburn said on NBC’s Meet the Press on June 21, 2015. "What happened was when some people rejected the compromise, the Legislature, out of defiance, put that flag where it is today in front of the statehouse. That is not what the compromise was. The compromise was to put it on the back side of the statehouse, out of public view so it would not have any appearance of sovereignty." We decided to see if the bill that passed in 2000 undermined a package that had emerged from previous negotiations. To get started, it helps to get a feel for where things are on the statehouse grounds in Columbia. Here’s a map of the statehouse area. From this, Clyburn’s characterization of his preferred location seems pretty accurate. The next question is, did that spot represent a consensus plan? Several ideas in play We reached out to Clyburn’s office and did not hear back by the time we published. However, we did talk to Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the South Carolina House Democratic minority leader in 2000. Cobb-Hunter remembers the plan Clyburn had in mind, but she also remembers that there were several ideas on the table. "There were a number of conversations back in 2000 held by a number of different people," Cobb-Hunter said. "It would not be accurate to say that there was one plan that had reached a consensus." Cobb-Hunter and a top House Republican lawmaker had co-sponsored a proposal for a new installation on the statehouse grounds that they called the Circle of Flags, in which the Confederate flag would have been one of several from South Carolina’s history. Another approach suggested the flag move to the state’s Confederate Relic and Military History Museum. The plan to place it by the Wade Hampton statue (Hampton was a Confederate Civil War general who served as governor and U.S. senator in the 1870s and 1880s) did have significant support. In February 2000, then-governor Democrat Jim Hodges got behind the move, and at the time, Cobb-Hunter said it was a viable option. But it never caught on, not with House Republicans, nor with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Angela Ledford co-authored a study on the flag controversy while getting her doctorate at the University of South Carolina. Now a political scientist at the College of St. Rose, Ledford remembers that plan as "an informal agreement with some of the legislative leadership." The compromise that emerged -- first in the state Senate and then affirmed in the House -- sent the flag to its present location by the monument to the Confederate Soldier. In a bit of legislative log-rolling, the Senate passed the bill after the House approved making Martin Luther King, Jr. Day a state holiday. South Carolina was the last state in the country to officially recognize MLK Day. The majority of African-American House members voted against the bill, and the NAACP opposed it as well. Our ruling Clyburn said that there was a compromise measure to place the Confederate flag in a more discreet location on the South Carolina state house grounds. Such a proposal did exist and had the backing of the governor and black lawmakers. But it was not the only compromise plan in play and it failed along with other proposals backed by black lawmakers. Clyburn’s claim leaves out that context. We rate it Mostly True.	None	James Clyburn	None	None	None	2015-06-21T17:37:29	2015-06-21	['South_Carolina', 'Confederate_States_of_America']
pomt-05377	Says that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says troops are leaving Iraq "too fast."	true	/florida/statements/2012/may/08/wrongwayrubiocom/anti-rubio-group-says-rubio-thinks-troops-are-comi/	A website created by Florida progressives is attacking Sen. Marco Rubio's positions on women's rights, government spending, immigration, Social Security reform and more, pointing out apparent contradictions and allegedly unethical behavior. WrongWayRubio.com, a joint project by Progress Florida and Florida Watch, also takes issue with his foreign policy, a particularly important focus for a potential Republican vice presidential nominee. The site provides terse commentary on several issues, allowing readers to tweet the statements -- and the website's source material for the claim -- through their own Twitter accounts. One of these tweetable missives reads, "Rubio says troops are leaving decade-old war 'too fast'." It refers to Rubio's reaction to President Obama's military exit from Iraq last year. Among many negative claims about the senator, that one caught our attention: What was Rubio's position on the end of the Iraq War? WrongWayRubio.com provides links for each of its tweets, so the first thing we did is click the link. It sends readers to a clip of Rubio on Fox News' Studio B, discussing Obama's drawdown of armed forces from Iraq on Oct. 21, 2011. Obama announced that day U.S. forces would leave the country by the end of the year, which they did on Dec. 15. Right away, there is a difference between what Rubio said and what WrongWayRubio.com implied. What we found didn’t seem to support the tweet’s claim. "Here's my fear," Rubio told acting host Trace Gallagher, "my fear is that if the pull out happens too fast, Iran and their surrogates are going to come in there and take over and start exerting influence and creating havoc for us." Rubio was speaking there in hypothetical and not declarative terms. That means we had to dig deeper to see where the senator really stood on the withdrawal. Rubio has made foreign policy a major focus of his time in the Senate, and he’s been making major speeches on America's role in the world since last year. He has focused primarily on United States policy in Latin America, Europe, and Central and East Asia. But he has used Iraq and the Middle East as examples of a region requiring stronger American involvement. "It has been suggested that the advice of military commanders in Iraq be completely ignored in favor of a dramatic troop drawdown that even Iraqis say is too drastic," Rubio said in a speech in Wingate, N.C., on Sept. 13, 2011. He chided some of his contemporaries as doing only what is "politically self-serving," and not in the best interests of the country. "America, and the entire world for that matter, needs resolute leadership in this era of historic but volatile transformation, particularly in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq." Military involvement in foreign affairs has been a recurring theme in his speeches -- he mentioned the necessity of intervention in Egypt, Libya and Afghanistan, saying about the latter, "even the slightest impression that the U.S. is looking to get out is devastating." We also found a more specific statement Rubio about Iraq. On Oct. 21, 2011 -- the same day as Rubio's Studio B appearance -- Rubio issued an official statement expressing disappointment in the drawdown Obama had just announced. "I am disappointed that U.S. and Iraqi governments could not agree on a framework that would have allowed several thousand U.S. troops to stay in Iraq to combat Al Qaeda in Iraq and continue the training mission that is vital to Iraq’s future," he said in the statement. "I urge the Administration not to allow today’s announcement to become an obstacle to further negotiations on an enduring security relationship with Iraq. We should remain open to renewing discussions to bring back a robust U.S. force at the Iraqi government’s request that can do counterterrorism and support the Iraqi Security Forces." That seems to be drawn-out politispeak saying, in essence, U.S. forces are leaving too soon. Our ruling The statement from WrongWayRubio.com reads, "Rubio says troops are leaving decade-old war 'too fast'." But the message offered a news story as evidence that doesn’t prove the point. Still, when we looked more broadly at Rubio’s public statements on Iraq, we found the tweeted message did accurately summarize the views he had in September 2011. During a recent foreign policy speech, Rubio didn’t mention Iraq, but we found nothing to indicate Rubio has changed his mind. Given Rubio's stated views -- that U.S. forces should remain in Iraq to provide stability -- we rate the statement True.

pomt-01643	New Glarus Brewing Co.’s Spotted Cow is available only in Wisconsin.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/25/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-spotted-cow-beer-available-only-wi/	During a "getting to know you" Q&A with ABC News, Democrat Mary Burke fielded a question that hardly will change the course of Wisconsin’s future. But it did present a dilemma for the would-be governor of the state of beer and brats. The question: Spotted Cow or Summer Shandy? The question forced Burke to choose between two well-known Wisconsin beer makers: New Glarus Brewing Co. and Chippewa Falls-based Leinenkugel’s. She had to choose between a regional craft brewery and a much larger company. And between a slightly cloudy "farmhouse ale" and a wheat beer mixed with lemonade. Burke didn’t equivocate in her reply. "Spotted Cow," she said. "New Glarus is a great brewery and Spotted Cow, you can only get it in Wisconsin and (it's) one of my favorites." Wait, what? We didn’t realize Spotted Cow was so exclusive. And when we asked some beer drinkers — journalists know a few — several seemed surprised that the brew wouldn’t be available beyond the border. "People love when politics and beer collide," noted Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl. So we decided to set aside policy debates (it is late August, after all, and we are planning that Labor Day cookout...) and tap this claim. Is Spotted Cow available only in the Badger State? Breweries and their brews Spotted Cow is the most popular beer produced by New Glarus, the brewery founded in 1993 by Deb and Dan Carey in the village of the same name in south central Wisconsin. New Glarus has enjoyed rapid growth, including a $21 million expansion, and then another $11 million addition. But compared to the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., New Glarus is tiny. Last year, New Glarus sold 146,000 barrels, making it the 17th largest craft brewery in the nation, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication. Leinenkugel sold almost seven times as much, 975,000 barrels. Also, Leinenkugel is a subsidiary of Chicago-based MillerCoors ,which has breweries in Milwaukee and other locations around the country. New Glarus is privately owned with 27 investors. More important, for Burke’s claim, is where the suds are sold. New Glarus sold beer in Illinois for about six years before making a business decision to pull out in 2003. At the time, the Careys said they were unable to keep up with the demand and wanted to focus only on Wisconsin. In 2010, Deb Carey gave a little more colorful elaboration to the Madison Beer Review, a beer-oriented website. "Brewers call Chicago a whores' market," she said. Carey said New Glarus pulled out because "it didn't want to participate in illegal business practices such as giving away beer to get bars to carry its products." "Everyone has a hand out and everyone wants some cash, (free) beer or a discount," she said in the story. "As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the graft and hassle." She added: "Small brewers can't afford to pay to play. I really blame the big domestic brewers for creating this mess." In an interview, Carey said that even though the brewery has ramped up production and could reach 250,000 barrels a year, the sales strategy won't change. "I'd be happy to die and not sell beer out of state," she said. "We're going to really drill down and focus on our No. 1 asset, which is (brewmaster) Dan, and make world class beer for our friends in Wisconsin." New Glarus' website highlights the Wisconsin-only status with the prominent message: "Only in Wisconsin." Labels say: "Drink Indigenous" Shepard says New Glarus’ strategy is unique among small brewers. "New Glarus is by far the biggest craft brewer available in a single state," he said in an email. Shandy also a hit Introduced in 2007, Summer Shandy became a huge hit for Leinenkugel. Like Spotted Cow, it’s the company’s top seller. But it’s a lot easier to find a bottle of Shandy. Leinie’s brews are advertised nationally, including during the NCAA men’s basketball tourney. They’re found in all 50 states. New Glarus does virtually no advertising. Of course, you can find Spotted Cow in fridges around the country, thanks to visitors who snare a case on their way home from Wisconsin, or who use the online gift shop. So let’s drain this one. Our rating Burke chose Spotted Cow as her beer of choice, saying she liked the beer and the fact it was available only in Wisconsin. The brewery made a business decision and stopped out-of-state sales about 11 years ago. And that’s become an important, if not entirely well known, selling point for the brewery ever since. We rate her statement True. Correction: This item originally stated that Summer Shandy was introduced in 2011. The correct year is 2007.

pomt-03927	"What concerns me is there is only two sentences that have been written about minority business."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/22/vincent-fort/statement-stadium-minority-businesses-short-info/	The Atlanta Falcons may not have made it to the Super Bowl this year. But their future is potentially brighter than ever. Team owner Arthur Blank* is pushing for a new $1 billion retractable-roof stadium to be built in downtown Atlanta in time for the 2017 NFL season. The Georgia World Congress Center Authority -- which owns the Georgia Dome, where the Falcons currently play, and would own the new stadium -- agreed to a framework for a deal in a nonbinding term sheet. That term sheet will provide the foundation for more negotiations later on any binding agreement between the GWCCA and the Falcons. Left to be decided is who pays for the project. The latest funding plan has the Falcons contributing most of the money for construction, along with an upfront public contribution of $200 million paid through bonds issued by Atlanta’s economic development agency. The bonds would be backed with hotel-motel tax money. While those negotiations continue, state Sen. Vincent Fort , D-Atlanta, questioned another part of the project: minority business participation. "What concerns me is there is only two sentences (in the term sheet) that have been written about minority business," Fort said in a Twitter post earlier this month. We wondered whether Fort’s comments about the 24-page document were correct and what this meant for the project. The term sheet for the stadium project is available on the Georgia World Congress Center website. On page five of the term sheet under a category titled "Additional Considerations," the first of four bulleted items addresses minority businesses. "The Falcons and GWCCA will adopt a M/WBE participation program to be included in design and construction contract requirements pursuant to all applicable and/or customary governmental M/WBE requirements or guidelines." The one-sentence item is three lines long, so Fort is mostly correct on the simple logistics of the statement. But he appears to have a larger concern. The federal government requires state and local governments to implement the federal disadvantaged business enterprise program if they receive federal money for transportation projects. The program is meant to level the playing field for businesses that are disadvantaged because of income or other factors when competing for federal dollars. Many state and local governments also establish their own programs for disadvantaged or minority and women-owned businesses in sectors outside transportation, and they set goals for contracts awarded to those businesses. PolitiFact Georgia submitted questions to the GWCCA about disadvantaged business participation in the stadium project. In a detailed response, the authority’s chief operating officer said that records on that information did not exist. But the details are almost sure to be outlined in the final contract before any work is done, said Lloyd Atkins, a consultant in the minority business development office of the University of Georgia’s Small Business Development Center. "These minority and disadvantaged business participation goals are usually established early on because if not framed in the legal parameters of a contract there is no incentive to reach the goals," Atkins said. With the proposed stadium’s probable public-private partnership, a lot of the push for minority participation will be "political will," Atkins said, with adherence to any goals set possibly monitored by the city of Atlanta’s contract compliance office. (PolitiFact Georgia asked that office about any involvement in the project but received no response.) Since Fort’s tweet and subsequent comments to PolitiFact Georgia, some members of the Atlanta City Council this week have lobbied for about 30 percent of the stadium work to be completed by minority contractors. Falcons executives said there will be an "equal opportunity employment commitment" at every stage of the project. The GWCCA’s administrative policies and procedures for procurement of supplies, equipment, goods and contractuals services states: "It is the Authority’s policy to affirmatively encourage and solicit participation with respect to purchases of goods and services by qualified business enterprises to include disadvantage business enterprise (W/MBE) Women and Minority Business Enterprise." Although the Falcons stadium term sheet is one very early step in the process, Fort said the brevity of the statement did not bode well for the participation of minority businesses in the project. "In a state with such a sorry history of using African-American vendors, I was not comfortable with ‘a wink-and-a-nod, trust me approach,’ " Fort said. Fort pointed to last year’s audit of the Georgia Department of Transportation’s disadvantaged business enterprise program. That audit -- publicized during the campaign for a regional transportation sales tax -- found that the state agency had fallen below its targets for awarding contracts to minority and/or women-owned businesses that met the federal definition of disadvantaged. Between 2009 and June 2011, the Transportation Department awarded eligible firms owned by African-Americans just 2.4 percent of its contracts even though those firms make up 14.1 percent of all companies available to perform construction and engineering work. Women owned-businesses received 8.4 percent of the work, and Hispanic-owned firms received 1.1 percent. After the audit, the Georgia Department of Transportation increased its existing targets for awarding contracts to minority and women-owned disadvantaged firms. And Fort used the numbers as part of his campaign against the regional transportation sales tax. When the Georgia Dome was built in the early 1990s and opened in 1992, disadvantaged businesses accounted for 20.7 percent of the contracts, valued at $36.8 million. The total value of construction related contracts on the Dome was $177.8 million, according to information provided by the GWCCA. Removing two sole-source contracts from the available construction work increased the disadvantaged business participation to 23.6 percent. Under the federal definition, white, male-owned businesses can qualify as disadvantaged if they meet certain criteria including personal net worth of the business owner. Fort said the current term sheet that lays out nonbinding terms approved for the new stadium contains only two lines dealing with minority business participation. He uses this brief mention as a reason to be leery of the state’s promise to carry out minority participation promises. A simple look at the term sheet shows that Fort’s statement is correct. But the explanation doesn’t stop there. Already City Council members are pushing for specific minority business participation goals, and whatever goals are set are likely to be included in the final contract before any construction work has begun. Because the details are not yet complete, it is impossible to make inferences on what the goals would be. Fort’s statement is partially accurate but needs a lot additional information.

pomt-10296	Obama plans "a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/12/john-mccain/obamas-tax-plan-hits-200000-and-up/	A snarky Web ad from Sen. John McCain calls Sen. Barack Obama "The One" and shows his supporters saying things like "Hot chicks dig Obama." "We know he doesn't have much experience and isn't ready to lead, but that doesn't mean he isn't dreamy," jibes an off-screen narrator. Of most interest to us, though, was the ad's claim of what Obama supporters — his "fan club" — will get. "The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year," the narrator says, as a 1040 form from the Internal Revenue Service slides across the screen. Text flashes by briefly, then spins around 360 degrees as it fades away, saying, "Obama voted to raise taxes on everyone making more than $42,000." McCain has made similar statements before, saying Obama voted to raise taxes on people making more than $42,000 a year. We rated that statement Barely True . The McCain campaign's evidence for its charges are Obama's votes on budget resolutions. A kind of blueprint for the federal budget, a budget resolution sets targets for committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The resolution envisions tax cuts rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher. But voting for a budget resolution is quite different from voting for a tax increase. Budget resolutions are nonbinding, don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending. They're different from legislation that raises or lowers tax rates. In the case of the McCain ad, we're more concerned with the voiceover that says, "The perks are amazing, like a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year." That seems designed to make the average viewer think that Obama wants to raise taxes on people making that amount, which isn't true. Obama wants to increase taxes by rolling back the Bush tax cuts on people making more than $200,000 if single or $250,000 if married filing jointly. What the ad implies is a major distortion that seems intent on confusing people about what Obama's policies are. When McCain's ads talked about tax-related votes, we found the statement Barely True . In another instance, he made claims about Democrats raising taxes by $500-million through a budget resolution, a claim we found False . But the new Web ad pushes the envelope too far when the narrator says "a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year." It's a gross distortion of Obama's proposals to say they would raise taxes on "everyone" who earns that much, and we rate McCain's claim False.

pomt-05312	Says Josh Mandel opposed federal loans to the auto industry.	false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/18/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-says-josh-mandel-opposes-au/	For all the heat Josh Mandel has taken in this space for things he has said, the Republican state treasurer and U.S. Senate hopeful earns an equal amount of grief for what he won’t say. Mandel often refuses to offer clear opinions on key issues before Congress, be it the Violence Against Women Act or a bill to keep interest rates from doubling on student loans. He says he won’t "cast imaginary votes." His opponents, namely those supporting Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, say he doesn’t want to be pinned down on topics important to voters. So PolitiFact Ohio was surprised recently when Brown’s campaign began asserting that Mandel would have voted against the federal loans to rescue automakers Chrysler and General Motors. Brown dialed up the criticism Monday prior to a Mandel event near a GM plant in Lordstown. A headline on a news release labeled Mandel as "anti-auto rescue." In the release, Friends of Sherrod Brown spokeswoman Sadie Weiner said Mandel "would have voted ‘no’ on the auto rescue despite the fact that it saved Ohio jobs and put middle-class families back to work." The claim caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given Mandel’s trademark stealth. Had we missed a policy stand? After considerable research and many discussions with both campaigns, we are not convinced. Brown has been painting his opponent as anti-auto bailout since at least March, when Mandel told The Vindicator, Youngstown’s daily newspaper, that he was developing a plan "to rescue the auto industry." To those who thought the industry already had been rescued by the government loans to Chrysler and GM, Mandel’s statement was a head-scratcher. "I’m not saying the bailout didn’t work," Mandel told the paper. But he also said he "respectfully disagreed" that it saved the U.S. auto industry. Nowhere in the story is he quoted as saying he would have voted against the loans as a senator. Nevertheless, Mandel’s opponents pounced. Citing The Vindicator story in late March, the Ohio Democratic Party bashed Mandel in a news release that, among other gripes, stated he "would have voted to let the auto industry die." The state party works closely with Brown’s campaign -- so closely that Justin Barasky, the Brown campaign’s communications director and a former party spokesman responded to our questions about the statement at the time. Barasky referred PolitiFact Ohio to a Toledo Free Press article from March 14 that appeared under the headline "County Democrats criticize Mandel for opposing auto bailout." Barasky also pointed us to a statement from U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, a South Carolina conservative who cited Mandel’s support of a "ban on government bailouts" when endorsing him in June 2011. But in the weeks that followed our initial questions, we found no evidence that Mandel himself had ever confirmed he would have voted against the auto bailout. Meanwhile, both the Brown campaign and the Ohio Democratic Party continued with this line of attack. Mandel could have made it easy on us by simply taking a position -- yea or nay. But true to form, he declined. Furthermore, his campaign communications director, Travis Considine, was adamant that our research was accurate: Mandel had not taken a public stance on the loans. We followed up with both campaigns last week and again this week as Mandel traveled to the heart of Ohio’s car-manufacturing belt. Barasky emailed us a clip of video footage he said comes from a February meeting with the Tea Party Express near Cincinnati. "Your United States senator, Sherrod Brown, voted for the Wall Street bank bailout, the largest bailout of Wall Street banks in the history of the United States of America," Mandel says from behind a podium in the video. "If I were there, I would have voted against it." Here’s where it gets tricky. The Wall Street bailout is encapsulated by the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, a measure Congress passed in October 2008. After the Senate failed to reach a deal on a separate bailout for automakers, President George W. Bush, nearing the end of his administration, allocated TARP funds to Chrysler and GM. President Barack Obama allocated additional TARP funds to the two companies in 2009. It is important to note, though, that the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, never held an up-or-down vote on a standalone auto bailout. Brown’s official support for the rescue plan came when he cast a procedural vote to quickly move on a bill that would have given the automakers emergency loans. The motion failed. Brown also voted for TARP, but at the time no TARP money had been reserved for Chrysler or GM. Barasky argues that Mandel has the benefit of hindsight, and that by declaring he would have voted against the bank bailout, he also is declaring he would have voted against the auto bailout. When Mandel was in Lordstown this week, a reporter for the Youngstown Business Journal asked about this very conflict. Did Mandel oppose the allocation of TARP funds to the automakers? Mandel did not answer the question directly. "When I talk to Democrats, Republicans and independents throughout the Mahoning Valley, I have not come across anyone who supports bailing out Wall Street banks," he said. "I agree with Democrats, Republicans and independents in the Mahoning Valley that it’s dead wrong to bail out the Wall Street banks with our tax dollars." So where does all of this put the Brown campaign’s statement on the Truth-O-Meter? The senator’s re-election team said Mandel "would have voted ‘no’ on the auto rescue." Mandel doesn’t help himself by refusing to take a clear position. A voter who read his comments in The Vindicator would be hard-pressed to determine where he stands on the auto bailout. He indicated he did not think the measure was perfect, but he stopped short of speaking against it. But PolitiFact Ohio puts the burden of proof on the speaker. And the Brown campaign was unable to show us anything in which Mandel definitively stated he would have voted against rescuing the auto industry. By virtue of voting against TARP, a position Mandel confirms he would have taken, he would have voted against a bill that eventually benefited the auto industry. Of course in these hypotheticals, Mandel wouldn’t have known that at the time, so it is intellectually dishonest to write him off as anti-auto rescue. Maybe Mandel will enlighten voters one day with his thoughts on the loans to Chrysler and GM. But for the moment, Brown’s campaign is putting words in Mandel’s mouth and pushing a deceiving line of attack. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.

pomt-03651	The Milwaukee County Board approved a reform package by a 15-3 vote, "meaning Board Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent" and "the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/01/marina-dimitrijevic/dimitrijevic-said-board-vote-pay-budget-accomplish/	Trying to sidetrack state legislation that seeks deep cuts in their pay and budget, Milwaukee County Board supervisors took matters into their own hands. The board voted to approve a multi-pronged reform package, "meaning Board Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent, staff will be cut by 50 percent and the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent," said an April 25, 2013 County Board news release that extensively quoted Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic. So, since the measure passed on a 15-3 vote, that means salaries and the budget will be cut, right? Maybe not. While Dimitrijevic said the board had "accomplished meaningful reform," Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele -- who backs a fast-moving state Assembly bill that would clip the County Board’s wings -- raised doubts about the significance of the vote. As Abele mulls whether to veto the County Board action, we decided to take a closer look. Some background The state bill, backed by key Milwaukee civic and business leaders, seeks to limit the authority, role and budget of the board. Critics say the board has blocked or slowed changes to county operations that were strained by the 2002 pension scandal and other problems. Fourteen of 18 County Board members oppose the state bill, and have decried the state legislation as meddling into local affairs that would harm checks and balances. The state bill would trump the County Board’s action on spending. It is set for votes in the Assembly on May 8, 2013 and Senate on May 14, 2013. It was authored by state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-West Allis, a former member of the Milwaukee County Board. Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive, has expressed support for the measure. The state bill would reduce supervisors’ pay by about 50 percent, to $24,000, and drop the board’s budget by two-thirds. It also seeks to make clear that Abele and future county executives have more control over operations. The pay cut, however, needs voter approval in a referendum that would be held in 2014. Supervisor pay was last raised in 2001, shortly before the pension scandal that rocked county government. Pay had peaked at $52,227, but supervisors and Walker agreed to reduce it to $50,679 in 2004, where it still stands. The board resolution The text of the county resolution that was approved by the board states that it seeks to "reduce County Board Supervisor salaries by 20 percent, from approximately $50,679 to $40,543, and the Chairperson’s from $71,412 to $57,130, beginning with the term commencing April 18, 2016." Any future pay increases would require a two-thirds vote of the board and be limited to the rate of inflation. Additionally, supervisors’ salaries could not exceed those of state legislators. The resolution also says the County Board will submit a 2014 budget request that cuts spending 50 percent, including cutting the number of staff positions in half. Future budget increases would require a two-thirds vote. So, the chairwoman has the numbers right in the County Board news release she shepherded. But this is not a done deal, as the blunt language in the news release states. To take effect, changes in compensation policy and County Board procedures must be enshrined in county ordinances. So, to make good on its resolution, the board would have to approve the ordinances at some future point. The text of the resolution makes it clear that more steps remain, stating the board "hereby pledges" to reduce the salaries and "will submit" a 50 percent budget reduction. The resolution directs County Board staff to draft the necessary ordinance changes "as soon as practicable." Bottom line, the board promised reform, in writing, putting it on the record in a way that would be difficult politically to back away from. But the measure itself did not accomplish the changes. We asked Dimitrijevic why a resolution, not an ordinance, was put up for a vote. She said the board wanted to make sure the changes are done correctly. That might only take a week or so, she said. If Abele signs the resolution approved by the board, or the board overrides an Abele veto of the resolution, "we’ll be ready to roll on it," she said. Dimitrijevic said the board intends to approve the cuts even if the state law is unexpectedly derailed or slowed. "We’re going ahead with this plan no matter what," Dimitrijevic said. It’s worth noting that even an ordinance change is not set in stone. The board could repeal an ordinance change, just as it could decline to adopt an ordinance changing its pay even though it has pledged to do so in a resolution. Sanfelippo cites that reality, and the board’s failure to vote on formal ordinance changes, as arguments for using state law to try to cut the pay and budget. A state law would prevent the board from changing its mind down the road, he said. He noted that drafts of his bill (AB-85) have been circulating since January 2013. "They had time," Sanfelippo said. Our rating A news release overseen by Dimitrijevic after 15 of 18 supervisors adopted reforms she championed said the "meaning" of the action was that "Supervisors’ salaries will be cut by 20 percent" and "the Board’s budget will be cut by 50 percent." The claim accurately conveys the intent of the resolution, but goes too far in leaving the impression the cuts were actually adopted by the board. It leaves out the key fact that the resolutions have no binding effect on their own. On their own they don’t "accomplish" the cuts. We rate this Half True.

pomt-12965	"Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students just as our public schools don’t."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/dec/28/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-federal-law-universities-dont-c/	A Democrat said Texas universities rightly don’t check on whether students are living in the country with legal authorization--in accord with federal law. U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, whose district stretches south into San Antonio, was asked in a December 2016 interview with Austin's CBS Austin to talk about whether certain college students should be worried amid threats to take away federal funding from so-called "sanctuary campuses," presumably a reference to colleges and universities whose leaders indicate no desire to help immigration authorities pursue students who lack legal U.S. residency. Doggett replied by initially calling "sanctuary campuses" a misnomer. The former Texas Supreme Court justice went on: "Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students, just as our public schools don’t. And that’s the right thing to do. There is a Supreme Court decision about the right to public education." Doggett added that if there’s a dangerous person on campus, law enforcement should honor any arrest warrant from immigration authorities to assure safety. A 1982 Supreme Court ruling held U.S. children to be entitled to kindergarten through grade 12 public schooling regardless of legal residency status. Yet that decision wasn't reflecting on university access. So Doggett’s statement made us wonder how federal law keeps state universities from checking the immigration status of students. There isn’t such a law, it appears. And when we asked which law Doggett was thinking of, Doggett’s House chief of staff, Michael Mucchetti, said by email: "His point is that current federal law doesn’t even require universities to check." Mucchetti earlier noted that on Dec. 7, 2016, Denise Trauth, president of Texas State University, told faculty, staff and students in a Twitter post: "The university, following current law, does not and will not report undocumented immigrants to authorities." We didn't read Trauth's statement as her saying the university doesn’t check the immigration statuses of students. Beyond that, our requests that a university spokesman, Matt Flores, specify the law Trauth was talking about didn’t immediately draw a reply. Board that oversees Texas colleges, universities Next, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, about whether Texas universities check the citizenship status of students. In reply, Kelly Carper Polden emailed us a November 2016 agency overview of state laws that enable Texas residents lacking legal U.S. residency--either through citizenship or permanent resident/"green card" status--to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates rather than more costly nonresident rates, provided the students have lived in Texas with a parent, guardian or conservator for 36 months up to high school graduation. ‘Affidavit’ students in Texas The overview gives the impression that Texas universities routinely tally students who lack legal U.S. residency. That is, the publication says that each benefiting student must complete an affidavit stating his or her intent to apply for permanent resident status in the U.S. as soon as he/she meets federal eligibility requirements. Also, the publication states, each "public institution of higher education is responsible for acquiring and maintaining, indefinitely or until the student becomes a Permanent Resident of the U.S., signed affidavits completed by non-U.S. citizens seeking Texas resident status for in-state tuition purposes. "In addition, Coordinating Board rules require institutions to remind affidavit students each year of their obligation to apply for Permanent Resident status as soon as they are eligible to do so," the overview states. "The same rules require the institutions to refer students to the appropriate federal agency for instructions on how to achieve Permanent Resident status," the overview says. We’ve reported several times before on Texas "affidavit" students. Then-Gov. Rick Perry’s approval of the 2001 legislation authorizing such college admissions drew fire when he ran for president in 2012. The 2016 overview states that in fiscal 2015, through August 2015, the state’s 24,982 "affidavit students" included 17,384 students in public community, technical and state colleges; 7,580 students in public universities; and 18 students in public health-related institutions, costing an estimated $23.42 million in state appropriations while the affidavit students paid $58.3 million in tuition and fees, the overview states. Subsequently, web searches led us to a sample universal application for students seeking to enroll at Texas A&M University in fall 2017 that asks if the applicant is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or if the applicant fulfills state residency requirements related to fulfilling "affidavit" status. Also, to our inquiry, Polder pointed us to the state’s Core Residency Questions form last updated by the coordinating board in 2011; the form asks an applicant to attest to her or his U.S. citizenship or other residency status and includes this provision: "I authorize the college/university to verify the information I have provided." National perspective Nationally in November 2016, more than 500 college and university presidents called for preserving and even expanding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a 2012 initiative by President Barack Obama that enabled young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to go to college and seek work despite lacking legal authorization to live in the country. After spotting that call on the Pomona College website, we asked the college’s dean of students, Miriam Feldblum, who’s also an immigration scholar, if Doggett was right about federal law and universities not checking the immigration status of students. By phone, Feldblum said that’s certainly not so for international students, who must have visas to live and study in the U.S., and, she said, no federal law prohibits institutions from checking the immigration status of students. Regardless, she said, public colleges and universities focus for tuition purposes on whether applicants are state residents. Feldblum also stressed that federal privacy laws bar colleges and universities from unilaterally sharing the immigration status of a student absent the student’s consent or a compelling factor such as a subpoena. "Right now, campuses are not sharing this information with anybody," Feldblum said. "We have no obligation to do so." Doggett aide: Claim mischaracterized We filled in Mucchetti on our finding no federal law forbidding universities from checking a student’s residency status. We also shared the state-published overview for Texas "affidavit" students. By email, Mucchetti suggested we were mischaracterizing the congressman’s statement. Doggett "did not say that any federal law prohibits or bars universities from checking status. He was saying that educational institutions are not required by federal law to check status—that like our public schools, public universities, in accord with federal law, do not check," Mucchetti wrote. Our ruling Doggett said: "Our university campuses by federal law do not check the immigration status of their students." We see an element of truth here in that colleges and universities, like public schools, don’t act as immigration enforcement agents. But we didn't spot nor did Doggett identify a federal law that bars or excuses universities from checking the immigration statuses of students. Meantime, a state law leads public Texas institutions to tally "affidavit" students, each of whom has declared a lack of legal U.S. residency. Also, each student-applicant to those colleges and universities must answer questions about citizenship and legal residency and agree to have information verified. All told, we rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-15273	"The economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-tells-jon-stewart-economy-every-metri/	During his farewell visit to Jon Stewart’s Daily Show, President Barack Obama took a bit of a victory lap. At one point in the extended interview posted online, Obama said, "Here's the thing I can say, Jon. I can say this unequivocally: The VA is better now than when I came into office; government works better than when I came into office; the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office." It was the last of those claims -- that "the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office" -- that caught our attention. That’s a pretty strong statement. Is it correct? Statistics that support Obama’s claim Three common economic statistics that are widely considered important are gross domestic product, unemployment rate and employment level. And looking just at these three measurements, Obama has a strong record in office. • Gross domestic product per capita. Inflation adjusted GDP per capita -- that is, all economic activity in the United States divided by the number of U.S. residents -- has increased from $47,002 in 2009 to $54,630 in 2014, an increase of 16 percent since Obama took office. • Unemployment rate. In January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the rate fell to 5.3 percent by June 2015. That’s a drop in unemployment of almost one-third since Obama’s inauguration, and it’s been mirrored in drops among African-Americans and Latinos. • Employment level. In January 2009, total nonfarm employment in the United States stood just shy of 134 million. By February 2010, employment had fallen to 129.6 million, but by June 2015 it had rebounded to 141.8 million. That’s an increase in jobs of almost 6 percent from the start of Obama’s term. Where things haven’t gone so well for Obama While Obama has some statistics to point to, it is wrong to say that "the economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office." We found several important measurements that went in the wrong direction during Obama’s tenure. • Real median weekly earnings. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2015, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers fell from $348 to $344, a decline of about 1 percent. Comparing the second quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2015, weekly earnings fell from $342 to $337, a decline of about 1.4 percent. • Median income. Inflation-adjusted median household income, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, fell from $54,059 in 2009 to $51,939 in 2013 -- a decline of about 4 percent. (Depending on how you adjust these raw numbers for taxes and in-kind income, inflation-adjusted income per person may have gone up a bit rather than shrinking.) • Percent of people in poverty. The data show that 13.2 percent of Americans were living in poverty in March 2009. By March 2014, that percentage had risen to 14.5 percent. That was down slightly from what it was in the previous three years, but not enough to match the 2009 level. • Median weeks unemployed. In January 2009, the median number of weeks an unemployed person was unemployed was 10.7. By June 2015, that number had risen to 11.3 weeks. (The peak of 25.2 weeks came in June 2010.) • Civilian labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of people either working or looking for work, divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. In January 2009, this stood at 65.7 percent, but by June 2015, it had fallen to 62.6 percent. The caution here is that this statistic has been affected by the increasing rate of retirements due to the aging of the Baby Boomers. However, most economists say that the weak recovery has played at least some role in this decline. • Number of people on food stamps. The number of recipients has risen from 33.5 million in 2009 to 46.5 million in 2014, an increase of 39 percent. What is hard to say is how much comes from expanded accessibility rules and how much comes from rising economic need. The White House argues that Obama deserves credit for achieving an economic recovery "sustainably." "We’ve had growth surge while also shedding debt and building a more sustainable foundation," said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. "We’re growing faster and safer." Our ruling Obama said, "The economy, by every metric, is better than when I came into office." That claim is too sweeping. Certain measures of wages and income, the poverty rate and the duration of unemployment are all worse now than they were when Obama "came into office." The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: "Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services." Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our extended analysis to find out why. But one of the claims is actually true: "All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange." To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat. People who don't get insurance through work or other groups will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service. "This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits," said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides point-by-point analyses of the plans on its Web site. The exchange is meant to ensure that people are "actually getting coverage and not a junk policy," Tolbert added. We should note that the e-mail says this rule is listed on page 72 of the health care bill. We found that the requirement that insurance companies must conform is also presented much earlier in the bill. We spotted an earlier reference on page 15, Section 101. That doesn't change the fact that the assertion is correct. We've ruled that many of the e-mail's other claims are wrong, but not this one. The e-mail said, "All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange." We rule that True.

pomt-01129	"The President has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/29/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-obama-has-flip-flopped-his-power-or/	U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says President Barack Obama exceeded his authority last month when he bypassed Congress and unilaterally extended legal status to millions of immigrants. The evidence lies in the words of the president himself, Goodlatte said. "It’s both perplexing and alarming that the president has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take," Goodlatte, R-6th, said in a news release. Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he will delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have greencards. If applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they can qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which will be open for applications this spring. Obama also expanded a program he began by executive action in June 2012 to halt the deportation of students -- known as "dreamers" who were brought to the U.S. as children when their parents entered the country illegally. Obama’s action came after the House of Representatives failed to approve a comprehensive immigration reform bill that had cleared the Senate. We asked Goodlatte’s office to back his claim that Obama had repeatedly said he lacked the power to order sweeping immigration reform. Beth Breeding, Goodlatte’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a Nov. 19 news release by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, citing 22 instances of Obama saying he couldn’t act unilaterally on immigration. Some of the items on the list don’t affect immigration at all, but are general statements that Obama made as a candidate about cutting down on executive orders. But there are some comments on the speaker’s list get to the heart of Goodlatte’s statement. Let’s take a look: March 28, 2011 During a town hall meeting at the Bell Multicultural High School in Washington, Obama was asked if he could issue an executive order to stop deportation of undocumented high school students. The president dismissed the idea. Obama said, "With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive orders, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed -- and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard so you know that we’ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. "There are enough laws on the books that are very clear in terms of how we enforce our immigration system that for me to, simply through executive order, ignore these constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. That does not mean, though, that we can’t make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity." Jan. 30. 2013 During an interview with Univision, a Spanish-language television network, Obama was asked if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal immigrants. The president said, "Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law. And that’s what we’ve done. But what I’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we’re applying the law in a way that takes into account people’s humanity. That’s the reason that we’ve moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here, for example." Feb. 14, 2013 Obama was asked During a Google+ Hangout, by a woman named Jackie, if he would be willing to take executive action on immigration to ensure "families are not split apart." Obama said, "Well look Jackie, this is something I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed and Congress, right now, has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system and what that means is we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think in many cases the results may be tragic. "And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we are focusing our enforcement resources on criminals as opposed to someone who is just here and trying to work and look after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated, and what we’ve done is obviously passed a deferred action which made sure the dreamers -- young people who were brought here and think of themselves as American -- are American except for their papers, that they are not deported. Having said all that, we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can. That’s why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important." Sept. 17, 2013 Obama was interviewed by Jose Diaz-Balart, anchor for Noticias Telemundo. The broadcaster asked the president if he would "consider unilaterally freezing deportations for the parents of deferred action kids." Obama said, "Here’s the problem that I have, Jose, and I’ve said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said here’s the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement, and what I have been able to do is make to a legal argument, that I think is absolutely right, that given the resources that we have, we can’t do everything that Congress has asked us to do. "What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans,that we should welcome. We not going to have them grow up under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I feel would be very difficult to defend legally." Obama’s order does not specifically protect parents of dreamers from deportation. But many of them, if they can pass background checks and pay a fee, will still be able to delay their deportation under general provisions of the executive action. Still, in this interview, Obama casts doubt that his executive powers to shield people from deportation extends beyond the dreamers. In a Nov. 18 press conference, White House spokesman Josh Earnest was asked about the president’s 2013 comments that broadening protections beyond the dreamers "would be very difficult to defend legally." "Since this interview aired, the president did direct the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review of the law to determine what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address," Earnest said. In announcing his executive actions, Obama said he was well within his legal authority to take them. Twenty-five states -- but not Virginia -- have joined a suit challenging the president’s power to issue the immigration order. Our ruling Goodlatte said, "The President has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take." The record supports Goodlatte. We rate his statement True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2014-12-29T11:47:04	2014-11-21	['None']

pomt-01705	Top U.S. intelligence officials have told "every member of Congress, including the president, we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/10/lindsey-graham/graham-us-intelligence-leaders-predicting-isis-att/	President Barack Obama’s decision to launch limited, open-ended air strikes against Islamic militant positions in Iraq has drawn criticism that the situation demands a more muscular military response. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Armed Services Committee, described the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, the force that has quickly occupied a large section of Iraq, as "an existential threat" to the United States. "Do you really want to let America be attacked?" Graham asked on Fox News Sunday. "What is going on in Washington when the FBI director, when the head of national intelligence, the CIA, the Homeland Security secretary, tells every member of Congress, including the president, we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq? "If he does not go on the offensive against ISIS, ISIL, whatever you want to call these guys, they are coming here. This is not just about Baghdad. This is not just about Syria. It is about our homeland," Graham said. In this fact-check, we examine whether each of those high ranking officials have said "we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq." Graham’s office sent us several quotations from three of the officials the senator listed. FBI director James Comey On Jan. 9, 2014, FBI Director James Comey said: "My concern is that people can go to Syria, develop new relationships, learn new techniques and become far more dangerous, and then flow back." This quotation appears in an ABC News report. We found three news reports of Comey answering journalists’ questions about the threat posed by Americans who joined the fight against Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and have returned to the United States. The New York Times reported on the high priority the FBI has put on tracking people returning from Syria. "It’s something we are intensely focused on," Comey said. In an article later in January, the Los Angeles Times repeated that Comey said the FBI was putting a "tremendous amount of time and effort into identifying those who go to Syria." The article summarized Comey’s assessment this way: "The threat ‘keeps me up at night.’ He (Comey) sees the region as a ‘launching ground’ for potential Sept. 11-style mass-casualty attacks in this country." These stories emerged almost exactly at the time that ISIS began its assault in Iraq and had yet to show how effective it could be. Comey saw a threat from returning combatants, but a larger-scale attack was more a future risk than an immediate danger. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson Graham’s office pointed to comments from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson from Feb. 7, 2014. "We are very focused on foreign fighters heading to Syria," Johnson said. "Based on our work and the work of our international partners, we know individuals from the U.S., Canada and Europe are traveling to Syria to fight in the conflict. At the same time, extremists are actively trying to recruit Westerners, indoctrinate them, and see them return to their home countries with an extremist mission. … Syria has become a matter of homeland security." Johnson made these comments during a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. Johnson spoke of the evolving terrorist threat and, like Comey, specifically mentioned the citizens who come back from fighting in Syria. But Johnson went further and talked about the people who "self-radicalize" and never train with foreign fighters. "In many respects, this is the terrorist threat to the homeland, illustrated last year by the Boston Marathon bombing, that I worry about the most," Johnson said. "It may be the hardest to detect; involves independent actors living within our midst, with easy access to things that, in the wrong hands, become tools of mass violence." Johnson was describing less an imminent threat from ISIS and more a chronic risk posed by radical Islam. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper Graham’s office pointed to comments from James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, on Jan. 29, 2104. He spoke of "the sectarian war in Syria, its attraction as a growing center of radical extremism and the potential threat this poses to the homeland." On Feb. 11, 2014, Clapper talked about forces in Syria: "The three most effective are the Al-Nusrah Front, Aura al Sham and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, as it’s known, whose numbers total more than 20,000. Complicating this further are the 7,500-plus foreign fighters from some 50 countries who have gravitated to Syria. Among them are a small group of AfPak (Afghanistan-Pakistan) al-Qaida veterans who have aspirations for external attack in Europe, if not the homeland itself." The first quote comes from a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing where Clapper, like Comey and Johnson, was talking mainly about the conflict in Syria serving as a breeding ground for trained militants, some of whom might return to the United States. Clapper said, "We should be very concerned about this." In February, Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan testified before the House Select Intelligence Committee. Clapper, as the quotation from Graham’s office said, talked about Syria as a magnet for radical fighters. Clapper did not necessarily tie ISIS to attacks on America itself, but for a subgroup of al-Qaida veterans, he spoke of their "aspirations" to launch an operation "in Europe, if not the homeland itself." When Brennan was asked whether training camps in the region presented a real threat to America, he said they did. When asked if groups like ISIS might need to "prove themselves" with an operation outside of Syria, Brennan said, "It's a near-term concern, as well as a long-term concern." Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington, said Graham has a point that ISIS should be taken seriously, but O’Hanlon offers a caveat. "The ISIS threat is very grave, but attacks are not — and in fact, virtually never are — inevitable," O’Hanlon said. "We have a host of defense mechanisms and shouldn't be fatalistic about protecting ourselves." Our ruling Graham said that four top administration officials have said "we’re about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq." Graham’s office sent quotations from three of the four. While each of them voiced strong concern about attacks on American soil, the role of ISIS was more indirect and less immediate than Graham would have us believe. The government officials spoke of the conflict in Syria as a training ground. Johnson, the Homeland Security director, also cast the Syrian civil war as a cause that could inspire "lone wolf" terrorists in the mode of the Boston Marathon bombers. The government officials talked about the "aspirations" of some al-Qaida veterans and the steps they were taking to track the people who posed the greatest risk. They spoke of taking the threat seriously, but their words fell well short of Grahams’ phrase that,"we’re about to be attacked in a serious way." We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-06439	The stimulus created "zero jobs."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/21/national-republican-senatorial-committee/national-republican-senatorial-committee-ad-says-s/	As President Barack Obama toured Virginia last week touting his jobs plan, Republicans countered that his previous effort -- the stimulus -- did not create a single job. The National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a web ad inking Obama and former Gov. Tim Kaine, who served as the president’s hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 until early this year. Kaine resigned the post when he announced he would run for the U.S. Senate next year. The 31-second NRSC ad has footage of Kaine strongly endorsing the president and predicting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 "will save or create 2.4 million jobs." Three people appear in quick order on the screen, saying, "Zero jobs, zero jobs, zero jobs were created." Zilch? We thought we’d look into this familiar claim once again, noting that Republican George Allen, Kaine’s likely opponent in next year’s U.S. Senate race, is featuring the ad on his campaign web site and sent out a tweet heralding it. Chris Bond, press secretary for the NRSC, told us the zero-jobs claim is not about the stimulus. "The part of the ad you’re referring to clearly shows news clips about unemployment reports" by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he said in an email. But we think anyone seeing the ad would conclude the zero-jobs claim is tied to the stimulus. The commercial makes no apparent reference to unemployment reports. It clearly mentions the stimulus, however. PolitiFact is no stranger to claims that the Recovery Act was a complete dud. In June, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, received a False rating on his claim that the stimulus "failed to get people back to work." His office argued it was a broad statement that the Recovery Act failed to improve the economy, not a claim that no one benefited from it. Echoing Cantor, the NRSC later in June put out a news release saying the stimulus "failed to create jobs," and that also received a False rating from PolitiFact. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said during a Republican presidential debate Sept. 12, 2011, that the stimulus "created zero jobs." He earned a Pants on Fire from our national PolitiFact colleagues. There was also smoke in the air after U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., said in February 2010 that the stimulus "didn’t create one new job," and after Florida Republican Rick Scott claimed in September 2010 while successfully campaigning for governor that the stimulus "has not created one private sector job." The zero-job claim is not credible for a simple reason: The stimulus did put people to work. Virginia’s public schools and higher education institutions have reported the Recovery Act allowed them to create 996 jobs through the end of June 2011 and save 6,042 positions, according to Charles Pyle, communications director for the state Department of Education. The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. For the quarter that ended June 30, the nation had reported 545,262 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the Recovery Act -- including 11,604 in Virginia.. The president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a report released in March, estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010. Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: • CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. • IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created. • Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created. • Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created. Our ruling: The stimulus may not have been the success everyone hoped for, but there’s an abundance of evidence it did create jobs and saved many more. Just look at the figures from the Virginia Department of Education. The NRSC added its name to a list of Republican candidates who claim the the stimulus created "zero jobs." When we asked for proof, the campaign organization provided none. Instead, a spokesman said the ad "clearly" referred to federal unemployment reports -- not the Recovery Act. We don't buy that explanation; the commercial is undoubtedly focused on the stimulus. Not one job anywhere? It’s a ridiculous claim and we rate it, once again, Pants on Fire.

pomt-06727	"We've had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/30/xavier-becerra/11000-attempts-amend-us-constitution-only-27-amend/	At a press briefing about the debt limit negotiations, Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., criticized a Republican push for a balanced budget amendment. He said Congress should not be hasty about amending the Constitution and noted that only a tiny number of amendments ultimately pass. "We’ve had 11,000 attempts to amend the Constitution since 1789. Twenty-seven amendments have been passed, 10 of them in one shot with the Bill of Rights. And so, we’re now hearing that Republicans may want two, three days before they plunge us into the economic abyss, propose the eleven-thousand and first constitutional amendment so that in less than three days we pass that when it’s taken over 230 years to pass 27 out of the 11,000 that were proposed," Rep. Becerra said, adding, "That’s the height of ridicule." Becerra was later named to the "super committee" that is developing a plan to comply with the budget cuts required by the debt ceiling vote. Before we get to the numbers, it’s worth reviewing the process for amending the U.S. Constitution. Amendments can be proposed two ways: in Congress or by a national convention assembled at the request of the two-thirds of the states legislatures. The national convention approach has been attempted twice but has never been successful. So the successful amendments have all originated in Congress. And according to a congressional tally, Becerra is just about right on target: Congress has considered "approximately 11,372 amendments" from 1789 through December 31, 2008, the most recent tally available, according to the Statistics and Lists section of the United States Senate website. Why is it "approximately" 11,372? The site says that's because of a number of factors, including inadequate indexing of legislation in the early years of Congress. Of those 11,372 proposed amendments, only 27 have been approved by Congress and ratified by the states. Why such a low success rate? Senate Historian Donald Ritchie told us that amending the Constitution is "an extremely complicated process" and an amendment "essentially only gets adopted when there’s a broad national consensus on the issue." University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt agreed, noting that "the founders wanted the bar set high because they believed that most issues should be left to the ordinary political process. A constitutional amendment takes an issue away from the normal process of democratic politics, quite likely forever. So it makes sense to require an extraordinary consensus to resolve it permanently." Most proposals aren’t inspired by a broad national consensus, however. The motivation for introducing a constitutional amendment is often political. "Every time the Supreme Court makes a ruling some member of Congress doesn’t like, someone pushes for a constitutional amendment on the matter," Ritchie told us. For example, the day after the Supreme Court ruled flag burning to be protected speech in 1989, U.S. Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., introduced an amendment outlawing desecration of the flag. Amendments to ban flag burning have been introduced in every session of Congress since, spanning more than two decades. Many amendments are introduced many times. An amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman has been introduced numerous times in the last decade, including four times in a single session of Congress. Some are introduced many times but with variations. Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, members of Congress introduced amendments that would provide for the continuity of Congress in the event of a sudden mass vacancy in the Capitol. The amendments varied on what constituted that "mass vacancy" and how replacement lawmakers would be chosen. None of the amendments passed. Back to Becerra. He was correct that only a tiny percentage of amendments ultimately pass and are ratified. He said 11,000; the official count puts the number at approximately 11,372. That's close enough to earn a True.	None	Xavier Becerra	None	None	None	2011-08-30T11:38:21	2011-07-29	['None']

pomt-11598	The immigration visa lottery "randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-leaves-out-facts-claim-about-visa-lot/	President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address outlined changes he’s seeking to immigration laws, including the end to the diversity visa lottery program. Trump said his administration presented a four-pillar proposal "that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise." "The third pillar ends the visa lottery — a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people," Trump said Jan. 30. Trump mischaracterized the program. He failed to note that individuals who come to the United States through the lottery program must be vetted by the United States and also must meet certain education and work criteria. The White House did not respond to our request for comment on the record. Here are the facts. Applicants must meet education or work experience criteria The visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States’ immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year. It’s worth noting that entries chosen in the lottery do not automatically get a visa, they only become eligible to apply for it. Applicants must meet education or work experience requirements, according to the U.S. State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: • At least a high school education or its equivalent, defined as successful completion of a 12-year course of formal elementary and secondary education; or • Two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform. Potential immigrants must undergo vetting by U.S. government Visa lottery applicants can include a spouse and children in their application. While only the applicant has to meet the education and work requirement, all potential travelers must be thoroughly vetted by the United States. Applicants who pass a vetting process are awarded the diversity visa. Information reviewed in the vetting process includes passport, police and medical records, photographs, English translations of documents, and education or work experience credentials. "No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies," a State Department official previously told us. "National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications," the agency added. Our ruling Trump said the visa lottery program "randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people." While lottery applicants are randomly selected, they must meet education and work experience requirements. They must also be vetted by the United States government before being allowed to come to the United States. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-02858	There were "$2 billion in earmarks in fiscal year 2012."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/15/karl-king/were-there-2-billion-earmarks-fiscal-year-2012-pol/	Political controversies come and go faster than fashion trends. While government shutdowns, sequestration and the debt ceiling are hogging the political catwalk right now, it seems like only yesterday that battles over budgetary earmarks were all the rage. You remember earmarks: provisions in spending bills that let individual members of Congress direct money to specific projects or entities in their districts. The zenith of attention for earmarks came in 2010. That’s when Republican opposition to the practice helped the GOP retake control of the House of Representatives. Leaders quickly won approval of a moratorium on earmarks. Not to be outdone, Senate Democrats approved a moratorium in that chamber, too. Then, like wide ties, earmarks faded from public view. So it caught our attention recently when Karl King, who is mounting an independent bid to unseat Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, homed in on earmarks on the "issues" page of his website. King, a licensed massage therapist from Redmond, singled out two issues he wants to focus on. The first involves individual privacy rights. The second addresses the federal budget, which he said should be cut. Among the areas that should be sheared, King said, are "the 2 billion dollars in earmarks in fiscal year 2012." Did that year’s federal budget, despite moratoriums approved by both chambers of Congress really contain $2 billion in earmarks? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed King and asked where he got the $2 billion figure. He responded quickly, saying a review of his notes didn’t include any source for the number. He then said in a followup email he would change the figure on his website to $3.3 billion, a number he got from the Pig Book, a publication put out since 1991 by Citizens Against Government Waste, a private, nonpartisan Washington, D.C., budget watchdog group. We called Leslie Paige, Citizens Against Government Waste’s vice president for policy and communications. She defended the $3.3 billion figure but said no Pig Book charting annual pork-barrel spending has been issued since 2012 because the moratoriums have made it so difficult to trace what went where. "The process is now very opaque and the money going through the system is almost impossible to track," Paige said. "Simply put, we lack the manpower to check it all out." Paige’s group arrived at the $3.3 billion figure by matching appropriations in "earmark-free" bills to spending clearly identified as earmarks in bills passed before the ban. A $50 million earmark for the National Guard Counterdrug Program in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012, she said, corresponds to nine earmarks totaling $22.9 million in the same act approved two years before. She acknowledged that "the vast majority of earmarks have dried up" since Congress banned the practice but added that, according to her group’s definition, some earmarks continue. So what qualifies as an earmark? Anything satisfying at least two of the follow criteria, she said: Requested by only one chamber of Congress; not specifically authorized; not competitively awarded; not requested by the president; greatly exceeds the president’s budget request; not subject to congressional hearings; and serves only a local or special interest. The bottom line, Paige said, is that Congress has figured out ways to stuff earmarks into spending by calling them different names. "We ended up creating our own proprietary definition," she said. "We got sick and tired of the idea that one man’s pork is another’s constituent services." The federal Office of Management and Budget, meanwhile, defines earmarks as "funds provided by Congress for projects or programs where the congressional direction (in bill or report language) circumvents Executive Branch merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the Executive Branch to manage critical aspects of the funds allocation process." OMB’s website lists all appropriation earmarks up to 2010. It stops there with a note that the earmark ban effectively halted the practice. But the benchmark is the definition used by the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ public policy research arm. Its definition is the most widely used and acknowledged, according to Oregon congressional representatives of both parties contacted by PolitiFact Oregon. According to the agency’s website, earmarks are "Provisions associated with legislation (appropriations or general legislation) that specify certain congressional spending priorities or in revenue bills that apply to a very limited number of individuals or entities. Earmarks may appear in either the legislative text or report language (committee reports accompanying reported bills and joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report)." That matches parts of Paige’s group’s definition, but doesn’t mesh with others. It says nothing about "greatly exceeding the president’s budget request," "not being requested by the president," or requests "by only one chamber of Congress." Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, another D.C.-based watchdog group, agreed that different groups have varying definitions for what constitutes an earmark. "But on balance," he said, "there is a moratorium. That’s not a false statement." All agree that the moratorium is having an effect. Before the ban, Washington County could count on getting about $2 million in federal money every two years for targeted projects, said Dennis Mulvihill, who recently retired after a long stint as the county’s government relations manager. "But since those bans were put in place, it’s been pretty dry," he said. "Maybe other states are squeezing something out, but nothing’s coming to Oregon." So what about King’s claim that Congress chalked up $2 billion in earmarks in 2012? Andrew Malcolm, a spokesman for Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, said it didn’t happen. "After winning the majority in 2010, House Republicans kept their promise and adopted a ban on all earmarks," he said in an emailed statement. "That earmark ban remains in place today." Of course, as a member of the party that pressed for the earmark moratorium in the House, Walden has a vested interest in saying earmarks are no longer used. But he gets support in his statement from Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon. DeFazio, who said earmarks can be a useful way for Congress to give direction in how federal money is spent, said in an emailed statement, "The so-called earmarks ban has shifted a tremendous amount of discretion to the executive branch and its political appointees." He notes a shift in spending authority, in other words, but acknowledges the earmark ban is in effect and working. News outlets have tackled the question of earmarks and whether, in varying forms, they continue to exist even after the congressional ban. If a large appropriations bill ultimately directs millions to a dam and locks project in Kentucky, for instance, is that an earmark? It may not fit the definitions of the Office of Management and Budget or the Congressional Research Service, but groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste might say yes. Because of that, if we were strictly rating the figure in the Pig Book, we might find an element of truth. But because King cited "2 billion dollars in earmarks in fiscal year 2012" -- not the $3.3 billion -- and because he offered with no sourcing for his figure, we find his statement False.

pomt-02183	"I am the only senator who turned down the state pension plan for part-time legislators."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/28/don-balfour/balfour-declined-legislative-pension/	State Sen. Don Balfour, R-Snellville stood trial and was found not guilty late last year on allegations that he swindled taxpayers by submitting erroneous state expense reports. Now this year, the entire General Assembly is up for re-election, and Balfour has three challengers, including two in the fast-approaching May 20 Republican primary. Balfour recently sent out a campaign flier to voters talking about the trial, his acquittal and a judge ‘s ruling that he be reimbursed by the state for his $156,000 defense. The flier also says he rejected the chance to lawfully collect tens of thousands of dollars from the state, and hence, taxpayers. "I am the only senator who turned down the state pension plan for part-time legislators," Balfour states in the flier. He goes on to say "this saved taxpayers over $160,000 I could have claimed." This is red meat for the scribes at PolitiFact Georgia. Fact check here we come. We reached out to officials at the state Employee Retirement System. They confirmed that they had supplied Balfour’s office with information that he was the only one of Georgia’s 56 senators who had declined membership in the Legislative Retirement System. Georgia’s part-time lawmakers currently earn $17,341 a year and are eligible for a daily per diem of $173 to cover travel costs when they are on legislative business, which includes committee meetings and the 40-day annual General Assembly session. They also are eligible to receive a lifetime benefit of $792 a month at age 62 if they have been making contributions to the legislative pension plan for at least 22 years, according to the ERS. That adds up to $9,504 a year, or about $160,000 after 16.8 years by ERS calculations. Balfour, who was first elected to the state Senate in 1992, says in the flier that, on principle, he never signed up for the pension plan. "Nobody in the private sector gets a guaranteed retirement plan for a part-time job and neither should a state legislator," he states. Others under the Gold Dome clearly don’t share that philosophy. Of 236 state legislators -- 56 senators and 180 House members -- 223 were active in the Legislative Retirement System as of June 30, 2013, said Jim Potvin, the ERS’ executive director. One other senator isn’t taking the pension, though that wasn’t discovered until Balfour’s office had been told he was the only one, ERS staff said. As of June, 259 retired legislators and beneficiaries were collectively receiving $1.8 million a year, or about $587 month each, Potvin said. Benefits are calculated based on a legislator’s age, years of service and a benefit formula factor, $36 a year. It’s not all free money. Legislators contribute 3.75 percent of their monthly salary, and the state provides a 4.75 percent match, Potvin said. Legislators are vested after eight years of service, he said. Balfour, a Waffle House executive, has three challengers in this year’s elections. In his own party, he faces former Gwinnett County Commissioner Mike Beaudreau and former Lawrenceville City Councilman P.K. Martin. If he survives the primary, he’ll go up against Democrat Timothy Andrew Swiney, a real estate broker from Lawrenceville, in the November general election. In summary: The state Employee Retirement System told Balfour’s office that he was the only one of Georgia’s 56 state senators who has refused a state pension. He repeated that statement in a flier that he sent out to constitutes. When we contacted ERS officials last week, they told us they had "since discovered there is another senator who is not a member of LRS." Our ruling: Balfour’s campaign flier says he is the only senator who has not signed up for a legislative pension. He made the claim based on information his office had been given by the state Employee Retirement System. We rate Balfour’s statement as True.

pomt-07490	Says the federal government borrows "almost $60 billion per week."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/13/paul-broun/us-rep-broun-said-weekly-debt-grows-60-billion/	The political carnival otherwise known as the federal budget debate was chock-full of partisan fun and games. For instance, congressional leaders played chicken for weeks over the amount of cuts. Republicans wanted about $61 billion, while Democrats hoped for $33 billion. They reached a deal for roughly $39 billion in cuts late Friday night, about an hour before a federal shutdown. They also played the blame game. Democrats and Republicans spent the days before the shutdown trying to convince the public that whatever happened, it was the other party’s fault. In an April 1 speech before Congress, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun played pin the blame on the donkey. "It’s pitiful that the Democrats have wasted so much time stalling over these minimal cuts in their own self-interest while our country is financially bleeding to death," the Athens Republican said. "We should be focused on trying to revive our economy rather than bickering about $61 billion dollars when we already borrow almost $60 billion per week." The federal government borrows $60 billion per week? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look. Broun was one of four members of the 13-member Georgia congressional delegation who rejected Friday’s budget compromise. Republican Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger and Democratic Reps. John Lewis of Atlanta and Hank Johnson of Lithonia joined him. Republican dissenters thought the cuts didn’t go far enough. Democrats thought they were too deep. Neither camp had much impact. The House voted 348-70 to accept the deal. More information about Broun’s spending figures were close at hand. A pair of deficit hawks, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., barnstormed Atlanta on Monday to explain why Congress needs to cut the deficit soon. PolitiFact Georgia marked the occasion by fact checking an op-ed they co-wrote that claimed "An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt" every day. We rated the claim Mostly True. This is what we determined: There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion of the $14.25 trillion debt is held by the public. The rest is money the government loans to itself. Both measures of the federal debt are valid. Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt had risen by an average of slightly more than $4 billion a day. This year, the debt has risen by about $2.6 billion a day. The total debt’s average daily increase for that same time period was about $4.3 billion. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day. These figures show Broun’s claim that the government borrows "$60 billion" each week misses the mark. The debt held by the public grew on average about $28 billion per week between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011. The total debt grew by about $30.1 billion. This year, the weekly growth has declined to $17.15 billion or $21 billion, depending on which debt measure you use. Neither comes close to $60 billion. We asked Broun’s office about the discrepancy. Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti said he must have misspoke. Broun meant to say that the federal government borrows nearly $60 billion every two weeks. Since Broun got his numbers wrong, we rate his claim False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-04-13T06:00:00	2011-04-01	['None']

pomt-01380	Says Jeb Bush -- not Charlie Crist -- signed legislation that let Duke Energy collect money for nuclear projects.	true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/15/charlie-crist/crist-says-jeb-bush-signed-law-letting-duke-energy/	While Fangate was the talk of Wednesday’s gubernatorial debate, there were other moments, too -- like when Charlie Crist slammed the door on Gov. Rick Scott’s accusations that Crist was the one who let utility companies charge customers for unbuilt power plants. "Charlie signed legislation that allowed companies like Duke (Energy) to pass on costs for power plants that were never built," Scott said during a discussion of energy policy. Crist cut his Republican opponent off immediately. "That’s not true. That was Jeb Bush," he said to applause from the crowd in Davie. This claim has come up before, when the Republican Party of Florida ran a campaign commercial that said Crist "made it easier for Duke to take your money." We rated that False. What Crist said at the debate is accurate. History lesson This attack centers on the Crystal River nuclear plant and a planned nuclear plant in Levy County that was never built. Duke Energy (which merged with Progress Energy in 2012) fumbled 2009 repairs to the existing Crystal River facility and planned to break ground on the Levy project, but never did. Because of a 2006 energy bill, SB 888, both Duke and Progress were allowed to charge Florida’s 1.7 million Duke customers an "advance fee" to pay for those plants before any work got under way. In 2013, Duke decided to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fixing it, leaving a bill of about $1.7 billion from repair work and other expenses. The company also spent about $1.5 billion on the Levy County project, then canceled it, demanding more and more advance fee money. The Florida Public Service Commission ruled in an October 2013 settlement that customers would be on the hook for $3.2 billion in expenses, while insurers would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest. A year later, under pressure from consumers and environmentalists, the PSC ordered Duke Energy Florida to credit $54 million back to ratepayers. Now that we know how the story ended, let’s return to SB 888, which is the legislation that allowed companies to charge advance fees to begin with. The bill passed the Legislature overwhelmingly and was signed on June 19, 2006, by then-Gov. Jeb Bush. That was well before Crist -- who was attorney general at the time -- was serving in the governor’s office. He ran and won that fall, taking office in January 2007. Scott said at the debate that people should go to one of his websites, FactsForFlorida.com, to see the bill Crist signed, so we looked. But just as the state GOP cited in its commercial, the bill on that site was HB 7135, a 2008 amendment to the original law allowing the advance fee. The site Scott mentioned read, "2008: Charlie Crist signed a law expanding the Nuclear Cost Recovery Act, allowing utilities to pass on the costs of transmission lines and other construction to consumers." However, Duke Energy never received any advance fee money as a result of this particular amendment, since there were no transmission lines or construction costs involved for either project. Crystal River was an existing plant, and the Levy project never got out of the planning stages. "The problem with that argument is that, to the best of our knowledge, Duke never recovered any money related to transmission lines," said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy. "Even though Gov. Crist signed the omnibus energy bill, the provision Scott refers to never played a role in the costs now being borne by Duke Energy customers." There’s a different company that stands to benefit from the amendment Crist signed, however: Juno Beach-based Florida Power & Light Co., with 4.4 million customers in Florida. That’s because in May, Scott and his Cabinet approved FPL plans to erect 88 miles of giant transmission lines for two new reactors in Miami-Dade’s Turkey Point facility, over the protests of residents and local officials. Our ruling Crist said former Gov. Bush signed legislation allowing utility companies to charge customers for power plants that were never built. Scott and Republicans point to a 2008 amendment that Crist signed into law, but this amendment never led to any charging of customers for either facility at issue -- the Crystal River plant or the uncompleted Levy County plant. Instead, the operative law was signed in 2006, when Bush -- Crist’s Republican predecessor -- was governor. And ironically, it’s Scott whose decision has allowed a utility company to potentially benefit from the measure Crist signed. We rate Crist’s statement True.

pomt-00539	"Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-our-nuclear-arsenal-doesnt-work/	Donald Trump’s presidential announcement speech touched on topics ranging from the economy and trade to foreign policy and the military. One of the criticisms Trump aimed at the Obama White House during his speech was for its handling of the nation’s nuclear arsenal. "Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker," Trump said on June 16, 2015. "Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. … Boy, does that send signals to (Russian president Vladimir) Putin" that "they don't know what they're doing." We wondered how much truth there was to his claim, so we took a closer look. We found two distinct problems with what he said. (Trump's campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article.) Trump conflates two separate issues -- personnel and equipment In recent years, there has been significant attention given to a series of problems within the military command structure charged with handling nuclear material. In August 2007, a B-52 bomber was carrying 12 soon-to-be-retired cruise missiles. They were all supposed to be fitted with dummy warheads, but six of the missiles were discovered to be carrying actual warheads -- something that could have proven disastrous. Then, in 2013 and 2014, the Air Force gave low inspection scores to intercontinental ballistic missile crews at Minot Air Force Base and Malmstrom Air Force Base. Also in 2013, two high-ranking officials with key positions in the nuclear chain of command -- Vice Adm. Timothy Giardina and Maj. Gen. Michael Carey -- were disciplined. Giardina was suspended after an investigation into the use of counterfeit gambling chips, while Carey was reassigned after an investigation into "personal misbehavior." Finally, in 2014, officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base were implicated in a drug investigation, which in turn led to the discovery that 34 officers may have cheated on proficiency exams. These were widely considered to be serious issues, and they have spawned a number of official oversight actions. But the lapses do not involve "equipment" malfunctions, as Trump put it. Rather, they are problems in command and control -- and while significant, they don’t suggest that the nation’s entire arsenal "doesn't work," experts say. "The Air Force nuclear enterprise has been bedeviled recently by troubling lapses and poor morale, which led to two major reviews of the Pentagon nuclear mission," said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association. "But this is a far cry from saying, ‘Our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.’ " A well-funded modernization program is under way Some aspects of the nuclear program are indeed old. The youngest nuclear-armed B-52 bombers, for instance, are roughly 50 years old. While much of this aging equipment is perfectly operational, some nuclear-weapons components, such as warheads, do deteriorate with age. Still, that doesn’t mean the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile "doesn’t work," experts said. For starters, the Pentagon and the Energy Department -- which share different responsibilities for nuclear weapons -- are required by law to certify the safety, security, and effectiveness of the arsenal on an annual basis. "Over and over, the nuclear weapons laboratories, the Air Force, the Navy, and the Secretary of Defense have certified that the nuclear arsenal does work," said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. These reviews, Reif said, are sufficiently thorough to give comfort to policymakers. "No U.S. military commander would trade the U.S. nuclear arsenal for Russia’s," he said. In addition, the United States is engaged in a multi-year program to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the rebuilding of the Minuteman III system, which launches intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Trident II submarine-launched missile systems, as well as the refurbishment of nuclear warheads and construction of new and upgraded facilities, such as a uranium processing facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. "While we haven’t deployed major new strategic systems in some time, we’ve been modernizing the ones we’ve got more or less continuously," Bunn said. This modernization effort will cost roughly $35 billion a year during the next decade, or 5 percent to 6 percent of planned national-defense spending, according to Congressional Budget Office reports released in December 2013 and January 2015. Cumulatively, the bill could reach $1 trillion over the next 30 years. "This is a planned investment unrivaled by any other nuclear power," Reif said. Ultimately, Bunn said, it’s reasonable to have concerns about certain issues, "from fixing up aging crew silos in the ICBM force, to recruiting, retaining, and motivating the right people to operate U.S. nuclear forces, to the enormous cost of replacing the aging U.S. nuclear force." But he added that Trump is "totally wrong -- and irresponsible, if our adversaries believed him -- in saying ‘our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.’ " Our ruling Trump said that "even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked." There have been a number of high-profile lapses in the management of the country’s nuclear stockpile in recent years, but those problems have to do with personnel and training. They’re not an indication that the weapons themselves "don’t work" -- which, if it were true, would be a significant problem for the nation’s strategic military position in the world. In reality, the United States has been spending $35 billion a year to upgrade its nuclear stockpile, and officials tasked with certifying the safety and reliability of the current arsenal have consistently given their seal of approval.

pomt-14258	"For the votes that we got, I think we spent, on average, two bucks a pop. Compared to 42 bucks" for incumbent Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/11/chris-larson/chris-larson-says-chris-abele-spent-42-vote-spring/	As the results became clear in the race for Milwaukee County Executive, unsuccessful challenger Chris Larson took the stage and thanked his supporters. Larson, a Democratic state senator from Milwaukee, lost April 5, 2016 to incumbent Chris Abele by a 55 to 44 percent margin. In his concession speech, Larson said his campaign was a success, in part, because it made Abele more responsive and willing to listen to concerns of residents. He then mentioned a key element in the race: money. Abele largely paid for his own campaign, taking in only a handful of contributions. And records showed he spent an estimated $3.5 million on the campaign between July of 2015 and two weeks before Election Day. At that point, he also had $642,618 in cash on hand. "Big money may have won the battle, but they haven't won the war," said Larson. He then offered a calculation to illustrate the spending disparity. "For the votes that we got, I think we spent, on average, two bucks a pop. Compared to 42 bucks from the other guy," Larson said in remarks carried on live television. That’s quite a gap. During the campaign, Larson regularly told audiences that he was being outspent by Abele by 20 to one. But in his concession speech, Larson put an even bigger figure on the gap. Was he right? Doing the math Let’s work some numbers, based on the vote totals and campaign finance reports on file with the Milwaukee County Elections Commission. Abele: Reports show that between July 2015 and March 21, 2016, his campaign spent just over $3.5 million. Unofficial returns from the general election show Abele received 156,524 votes. That comes to $22.36 per vote. (A footnote: Abele’s reports show about $5.6 million in personal loans to his campaign, but some of those loans go back as far as 2010 and his first run for the office. That figure would amount to $35.77 per vote, but we are using the narrower time frame to focus on this election.) Larson: Reports show that in the same pre-election time frame, Larson spent $216,243. Virtually all of that came from individual contributors, although Larson loaned his campaign $10,000 on March 21, 2016. He received 125,292 votes, so he spent about $1.72 per vote. So, it’s clear Larson was outspent by a major amount -- just not the amount he cited. "Our number-crunching showed that Abele spent $24-25 a vote," Larson campaign manager Josh Kilroy said in an email. "In the dim lighting and fraught emotions, I suspect Larson inverted the numbers." Last-minute spending The final reports showing last-minute spending do not have to be filed until July of 2016. So, the final dollar-per-vote number -- on both sides -- will be higher. Would that spending make a difference? A key indication of the final weeks’ spending -- television advertising buys -- can be found in reports filed by local TV stations with the Federal Communications Commission. The Abele campaign spent or planned to spend about $195,000 on 482 television spots in the window from March 21 to the election, according to the reports, which are prepared before the ads aired and subject to revision. If you take the known spending by Abele -- the money already spent plus the final batch of TV ads -- it comes to $3,695,000, or $23.60 per vote. In addition to the TV ads, Abele sent out numerous direct mail fliers. Also, many other payments to staff and consultants, bonuses and bills from vendors come in after the election. The tally would rise to about $26 per vote if Abele spent the full $642,618 in cash on hand -- and didn’t pour any more of money into the race. But there are no indications the spending would end up at $40 per vote, as Larson claimed. And, in any case, just as Larson could only rely on known information in making his claim, we must base our rating on information available at the time. Our rating In conceding defeat, Larson claimed he spent about $2 per vote received while Abele spent $42. Our calculation shows the gap, based on current reports, is more like $26 to $1.70 -- but it will grow somewhat by the time final reports are filed in July. Larson’s broader point about being vastly outspent was correct. Although he was right on the concept, he was far off on the numbers. We rate his claim False.

pomt-09947	Sotomayor "ruled against the white firefighter — Ricci and other white firefighters — just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past. The law was totally disregarded."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-sotomayor-disregarded-law-rule-/	While many Republican leaders have been publicly cautious with their opinions about President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been crystal clear about his opposition. "Do I want her to fail to get on the court? Yes," Limbaugh said on his show on May 26, 2009. "She'd be a disaster on the court." In making his case, Limbaugh cited a Sotomayor ruling that has drawn scrutiny from critics this week. "She ruled against the white firefighter — Ricci and other white firefighters — just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past," Limbaugh said. "The law was totally disregarded." Limbaugh is referring to Ricci vs. DeStefano , a case involving firefighters in New Haven, Conn. A group of mostly white firefighters claimed reverse discrimination after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because white firefighters fared significantly better than black firefighters. Here's what happened. In late 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took written and oral exams for promotion to the ranks of captain and lieutenant. Among the 41 who took the captain exam (eight of them black), no blacks and at most two Hispanics would have been eligible for promotion to captain. And of the 77 who took the lieutenant exam (19 of them black, 15 Hispanic), the results indicated that no blacks or Hispanics would be promoted to the rank of lieutenant. The New Haven Civil Service Board worried the test may have violated "anti-disparate-impact requirements" of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the city would face an employment discrimination lawsuit from nonwhite applicants who were not promoted. So the board decided not to certify the exam results, and no one was promoted. The white firefighters, naturally, were ticked off. One of them, John Ricci, is dyslexic, and studied hard to score highly on one of the exams, only to have it invalidated. Eighteen firefighters, 17 whites and one Hispanic, filed a lawsuit against the city claiming the decision not to certify the exam results "amounted to intentional discrimination" against the white firefighters in favor of black firefighters due to their race and political support for the mayor, John DeStefano. The federal district court judge who heard the case ruled in favor of the city. The firefighters appealed to the 2nd Circuit, the court on which Sotomayor sits. A three-judge panel that included Sotomayor upheld the district court ruling with a one paragraph explanation: "We affirm, substantially for the reasons stated in the thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned opinion of the court below. In this case, the Civil Service Board found itself in the unfortunate position of having no good alternatives. We are not unsympathetic to the plaintiffs' expression of frustration. Mr. Ricci, for example, who is dyslexic, made intensive efforts that appear to have resulted in his scoring highly on one of the exams, only to have it invalidated. But it simply does not follow that he has a viable Title VII claim. To the contrary, because the Board, in refusing to validate the exams, was simply trying to fulfill its obligations under Title VII when confronted with test results that had a disproportionate racial impact, its actions were protected." The brevity of that response, and its lack of analysis, rankled one dissenting appeals court judge, Jose Cabranes. "The opinion contains no reference whatsoever to the constitutional claims at the core of this case, and a casual reader of the opinion could be excused for wondering whether a learning disability played at least as much a role in this case as the alleged racial discrimination," Cabranes wrote. "This perfunctory disposition rests uneasily with the weighty issues presented by this appeal." Subsequently, the Supreme Court decided to take up the case, and heard arguments in April. But back to Limbaugh's claim. That Sotomayor ruled against "white firefighter Ricci and other white firefighters" is undisputed. But this is a very complex legal case and Limbaugh misleads when he boils down the ruling by Sotomayor (and two other appeals court judges), saying it was made "just on the basis that she thought women and minorities should be given a preference because of their skin color and because of the history of discrimination in the past. The law was totally disregarded." The ruling by the three-judge panel makes no mention of giving preferential treatment to women or minorities, as Limbaugh suggested. Rather, it upholds a district court decision that the city had the right to throw out a test it felt led to racially disparate results. The first sentence of the panel's statement is also significant. The judges begin by saying they agree with the district court ruling "substantially for the reasons stated in the thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned opinion of the (district court)." In other words, without laying out all those opinions, they were essentially incorporating what the district court said. So we took a look at the opinions delivered by District Judge Janet Arterton on Sept. 28, 2006. The first thing we note is that the opinion cites numerous other cases to back up various points. That alone weakens Limbaugh's claim that "the law was totally disregarded." Moreover, Judge Arterton lays out very specific legal reasons for her decision. "Nothing in the record in this case suggests that the City defendants or CSB (Civil Service Board) acted 'because of' discriminatory animus toward plaintiffs or other non-minority applicants for promotion," Arterton wrote. "Rather, they acted based on the following concerns: that the test had a statistically adverse impact on African-American and Hispanic examinees; that promoting off of this list would undermine their goal of diversity in the Fire Department and would fail to develop managerial role models for aspiring firefighters; that it would subject the City to public criticism; and that it would likely subject the City to Title VII lawsuits from minority applicants that, for political reasons, the City did not want to defend." The judge cites several cases which, she wrote, "clearly establish" that a public employer faced with the threat of a lawsuit over a test with racially disparate results does not violate civil rights laws by taking "neutral, albeit race-conscious, actions to avoid such liability." The judge argued the white firefighters could not claim to have been discriminated against because "here, all applicants took the same test, and the result was the same for all because the test results were discarded and nobody was promoted." In siding with the city, the judge wrote that the city's "motivation to avoid making promotions based on a test with a racially disparate impact, even in a political context, does not, as a matter of law, constitute discriminatory intent, and therefore such evidence is insufficient for plaintiffs to prevail on their Title VII claim." We cite some of this not just to make your head hurt, or to make the case that the ruling was correct — that will ultimately be up to the Supreme Court — but to show the complicated legal issues involved, as well as the fact that the district court did, in fact, make reasoned legal arguments and cited numerous legal cases to underpin its decision. In other words, you may not agree with the conclusions, but it's wrong to suggest the judges "totally disregarded" the law. Nor did Sotomayor's panel or the district court ever suggest that the city ought to give preferential treatment to women and minorities. And so we rule Limbaugh's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04088	In 2011, more people were murdered with knives, "hands or feet" or "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-more-people-were-murdered-knive/	Gun-rights advocates have mounted an aggressive social-media campaign to blunt the popularity of the White House’s efforts to advance new restrictions on guns. One reader forwarded us a statistics-heavy Facebook post that echoes others we’ve received. It says, "Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?" We should first note that there is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered "an assault weapon." For instance, even though the Facebook post references Obama’s intention to "ban semi-automatic rifles," California law already includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of "assault weapon." That said, we’ll take a look at the number of deaths caused by rifles. To check the post, we looked at the 2011 edition of the FBI’s annual "Crime in the United States" report. The report breaks down the types of weapons used in murder. These are the statistics for 2011, the most recent year available: Handguns 6,220 Rifles 323 Shotguns 356 Other guns 97 Firearms, type not stated 1,587 Knives or cutting instruments 1,694 Blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.) 496 Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.) 728 The Facebook post and the FBI stats are closely in tune. Except for a minor typo in the Facebook post’s number for deaths by hands, fists or feet, the numbers are accurate. The number cited for rifles was somewhat less precise. While it’s true that the FBI counted 323 murders by rifles, the agency also counted 1,587 murders by an undetermined type of firearm and 97 by "other guns." If gun usage in these two categories followed the same pattern as other gun homicides, that would add another 75 or so murders by rifle, making an estimate for the number of rifle murders about 400, rather than 323. Still, the larger point holds: Murders by knives, blunt objects and body parts each individually outweighed those committed using a rifle. We should note that while the Facebook post’s comparison is accurate as far as it goes, it does ignore the single biggest category of weapons used in murders -- handguns. Handguns were used in 6,220 cases, or 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year. This caveat illustrates how the selection and framing of statistics can be used to bolster one side or the other in the gun debate. Our ruling The post uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. But the statistics it mentions are solid. FBI data backs up the Facebook post’s claim that in 2011, more people were murdered with knives, "hands or feet" or "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12209	"We have been able to cut New York’s uninsured rate in half since 2013 from 10 percent to 5 percent of our population."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jul/24/eric-schneiderman/how-has-obamacare-lowered-new-yorks-uninsured-rate/	With Republicans lacking the votes to "repeal and replace" Obamacare, or to even undo major parts of the law without replacing them, Democrats tout President Barack Obama’s signature legislation a success story in New York state. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asserted the number of people without health insurance fell by half over the past four years. "Since 2013 we have cut our uninsured in half from 10 percent up to 5 percent of our population," Schneiderman said. The state’s health insurance exchange, NY State of Health, started accepting customers in 2013. States were mandated to either create their own exchanges or participate in one from the federal government. More than 3.6 million people in New York state have enrolled in a health plan through the state exchange since it began, according to the state Department of Health. But is Schneiderman right that the uninsured rate in New York has been cut in half since the exchange began? Data on uninsured New Yorkers According to Centers for Disease Control data, 10.6 percent of New York state’s population did not have health insurance in 2012, the year before the state health exchange was established. By 2015, the uninsured rate was 4.9 percent, but it increased to 5.4 percent in 2016 - still about half the rate before the law. Explaining the decrease Does Obama's Affordable Care Act deserve the credit? Experts we spoke to said the rate dropped because the state health exchange gave people an easier way to compare health plans online, and premiums dropped 53 percent the first year of the exchange. Average premiums have since increased. "It’s really just been an incredible boom for New York state, the Affordable Care Act," said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Serve Society of New York. New York state also opted into an option in Obamacare that provides low-cost health insurance to people who make too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy insurance. More than 665,000 state residents have enrolled in the plan since it first became available in 2015, Benjamin said. New York and Minnesota are the only two states with this option. The state also expanded the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility. That allowed some people to get coverage through Medicaid. Our ruling Schneiderman said "we have been able to cut New York’s uninsured rate in half since 2013 from 10 percent to 5 percent." He’s right on the numbers. The uninsured rate in 2013 was 9.6 percent. The latest data shows it at 5.4 percent in 2016. We rate his claim as True.

pomt-00791	Lawmakers were paid for their off-season efforts to, for the first time, take the lead in drawing borders for two would-be cities.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/07/mary-margaret-oliver/taxpayers-bore-cost-drawing-proposed-cities-border/	A border battle between two would-be cities in north-central DeKalb County took center stage in a lengthy House debate on Day 39 of the 40-day legislative session. Boundary disputes between the proposed cities of Lakeside and Tucker killed cityhood efforts last year. A House subcommittee brokered a compromise in December between Tucker and what was renamed LaVista Hills after the two sides again failed to agree on borders. The subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Buzz Brockway, R-Lawrenceville, said at the time that the boundaries were "set in stone." But the Senate voted to move about 2,000 people and some commercial property out of Tucker and into LaVista Hills, setting up the tense House debate that saw subcommittee members successfully beat back the altered map. The two chambers eventually struck a deal to split the disputed territory between the two proposed cities. But in that House vote, speaking in the parlance of a floor debate, Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, repeated commitments from the subcommittee. "Isn’t it true that we were paid a per diem in December to resolve this dispute, to set this border in stone?" Oliver asked. Traditional response dictates the response: If the lady so states. But what about her underlying point: Taxpayers funded a subcommittee’s work to hammer out borders of proposed cities when advocates couldn’t agree, only to see that public commitment nearly unravel in the waning days of the session. PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out. First, it’s important to understand how state legislators are compensated. The 180 members of the House and 56 members of the Senate earn $17,342 in annual salary for their service. They can also earn $173 a day for expenses such as lodging and meals, or up $6,920 for the annual legislative session. Despite being part-time lawmakers, their obligations don’t end when the gavel bangs to end the session. That’s why members also qualify for that $173 per diem any time in the "off-season" that they must take time off from work and travel for constituent services, to participate in regular committees, such as the busy Transportation Committee, and when serving on a special committee tasked with studying a particular policy area. Oliver was one of five members of the special House subcommittee charged with helping draw borders for the proposed DeKalb cities. The unusual thing about the subcommittee: It was the first time the full House set up such a group to help draw borders for new cities. And the full House agreed to abide by the subcommittee’s decision, as long as both cityhood groups did, too. Records show the subcommittee met Dec. 3 and Dec. 19 before voting during its second session to draw the borders. The deal also allowed the cityhood bills to advance in one year instead of the customary two years. "Our agreement to allow a shortened process means this line is frozen," Brockway told WABE-FM (90.1) about the borders at the time. Representatives from both cityhood efforts agreed at the time to the deal. So, too, did House members. And records with the General Assembly Fiscal Office show the House members of the subcommitee did file for and earn per diems by registering their attendance with Brockway. Brockway and Oliver earned $173 each for the Dec. 3 session, as did state Reps. Barry Fleming, R-Harlem; Mark Hamilton. R-Cumming; and Howard Mosby, D-Atlanta. Per diem was paid again for the attendees of the Dec. 19 meeting: Brockway, Hamilton, Mosby and Oliver. The total per diems paid out for the two meetings, not including any mileage filed at 56 cents per mile, totaled $1,557. "Our work was done in the public, as official work, and I don’t think it’s right to agree to change an act of a full subcommittee being paid to work," Oliver told PolitiFact Georgia after the House vote (but before the final deal). As the last-day deal shows, the two chambers were able to come to an agreement that divvied up the disputed area near Spaghetti Junction. Once the governor signs the bills, about 100,000 people will decide this fall on whether to form one or both cities. The debate about those boundaries nearly killed those votes for the second year in a row. Oliver said that taxpayers paid for lawmakers to work out a deal for both sides. State records back up that claim. We rate Oliver’s statement True.	None	Mary Margaret Oliver	None	None	None	2015-04-07T00:00:00	2015-03-31	['None']
pomt-06630	Says that three of these five Republicans -- Ben Westlund, Rob Patridge, Max Williams, Lane Shetterly, Lynn Lundquist -- later became Democrats.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/sep/17/ted-piccolo/max-williams-rob-patridge-ben-westlund-lynn-lundqu/	The Oregon Republican Party recently voted to strip anti-gay language from its party platform, prompting one popular online blogger to muse that platforms aren’t super relevant. In a follow-up comment, Ted Piccolo, who posts as "I am Coyote," wrote: "You had folks like Ben Westlund, Rob Patridge, Max Williams, Lane Shetterly, Lynn Lundquist all get elected. All of them were opposed to the (social-conservative) portion of the ‘platform.' And guess what? They ended up folding like a lawn chair on the fiscal battles as well. Heck three of them ended up becoming Democrats later." PolitiFact Oregon knows Salem well enough to identify the late Ben Westlund as a former Republican turned independent turned Democrat. But the other four? We were pretty sure they were still firmly in the Republican camp -- and would rather be lawn chairs than give up their GOP affiliation. (OK, we’re not positive on that last part.) Lundquist was Republican Speaker of the Oregon House in 1997. He ran a cattle and mint ranch outside of Powell Butte in Central Oregon. And as of Sept. 15, he was still registered Republican in Crook County. The same goes for Patridge, who serves on the staff of Oregon’s only Republican U.S. representative and is running for district attorney in Jackson County; Williams, who oversees the state Department of Corrections; and Shetterly, a former director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development who now practices law. All three served in the Oregon House, as Republicans. So, what gives? Piccolo owned up to using "a little blog short hand." (PolitiFact Oregon can’t resist pointing this out as a lesson in always checking what you read, especially on the Internet.) He said he is much more careful about language in official blog posts than comments -- but he stands by his assertion that Westlund, Williams and Shetterly are really Democrats. "... Westlund left the party entirely to run as a Democrat, Williams and Shetterly caved so much that they were appointed by and went to work for a Democratic administration. Whether those two changed parties entirely I'm not sure. But the policies they began supporting after they moved on to their appointments in the State government were pretty much anathema to those of the party." Williams said through a spokeswoman that he has been a Republican for as long as he’s been registered to vote. Shetterly said he, too, has stayed one. In any case, Piccolo is not alone in complaining about the GOP credibility of Shetterly, Williams and Patridge. In 2003, the trio defied House GOP leadership to push a revenue raising plan so hairy that legislators were lobbied day and night over the vote and threatened with tough primaries. Williams and Shetterly left to take state jobs offered by then Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a Democrat. Patridge decided against running for re-election. (Lundquist went on to head the Oregon Business Association, which has been slammed by some conservatives for pushing more government spending.) Piccolo was gracious enough to talk to us about a throwaway comment posted online. He acknowledged he could have explained what he meant more fully. Generally, we think people should be able to criticize elected officials and opine freely without worrying about the raters at PolitiFact. But we have to call this one out, if only to set the party record straight. Shetterly and Williams may not be Republicans in Coyote’s eyes, but according to registration records, they remain Republican voters. He could have called them RINOs, Republican in name only, but he chose to call them Democrats -- for him a more derogatory term. We rate the claim False, knowing full well that others would rate this anywhere from True to a Pants on Fire, depending on their political views.

pomt-14972	In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/19/edward-flynn/juvenile-car-theft-suspects-milwaukee-county-get-s/	Is it true that when juveniles get arrested for car theft in Milwaukee County, they just get sent home until their case comes up in court? That’s a claim from Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, whose department is arresting an increasing number of juveniles for auto thefts. Appearing at a public forum at the Marquette University Law School on Aug. 27, 2015, Flynn talked about auto theft in Milwaukee, where his department has jurisdiction. He also alluded to Milwaukee County, since juveniles arrested for crimes are prosecuted in the county Children’s Court. "If they're a juvenile, they get sent immediately home," Flynn stated, "because under the point system in juvenile court, as to whether or not you're going to be held for any period of time, a stolen car counts as zero points." As we’ll see, it’s possible for a juveniles suspected of car theft to be sent home after their arrest, but it’s not at all automatic. Scope of the problem Juveniles are a significant part of the problem in the city. According to statistics provided to us by Milwaukee police: Juveniles made up 39 percent of the suspects arrested for auto theft and auto theft-related crimes in 2014. The 363 juvenile arrests in those cases was twice as many as in 2013. Through the first nine months of 2015, there were 301 juvenile arrests in auto theft and auto-theft related cases, a slightly higher per-month clip than in 2014 Flynn’s evidence Flynn told us he didn’t have direct evidence to back his statement. In an email, his spokesman, Capt. Mark Stanmeyer, wrote: "Chief Flynn's statement is based on information he has heard over the years from a variety of sources, both internal and external to the department, as he works to encourage the stakeholders in the juvenile prosecution, adjudication, and corrections ‘systems’ to take the issue of juvenile auto theft and general offender reform more seriously." Per Milwaukee police policy, officers take all juveniles arrested for auto theft or operating a vehicle without the owner’s consent to the county Juvenile Justice Center, in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa. That’s because both offenses are felonies. The first decision -- the one Flynn is referring to -- is where the juvenile should stay until making the first appearance in court. Point system In auto theft cases, the arrested juvenile is ordered to appear in Children’s Court on the next court day, said Tom Wanta, administrator of the Milwaukee County Delinquency & Court Services Division. That could be the day after the arrest, or it could be later, depending on weekends and holidays. Staff evaluate the juvenile in order to choose from among three options on where the juvenile should be prior to the court appearance: released to go home; held in secure detention at the center; or sent to to an alternative setting, such as a temporary shelter, To make that decision, staff use something called the Detention Risk Assessment Instrument. The DRAI uses a point system, which is what Flynn referred to in making his claim. Points are determined based on the arrest for the auto theft, but also on what are known as aggravating and mitigating factors, if there are any. Aggravating factors -- which can lead to secure detention -- include whether the facts of the auto theft are more serious than a typical case; whether the juvenile has any prior or pending criminal cases; and whether the juvenile has a documented history of violence. Mitigating factors -- which can reduce the point total and lead to release -- include whether the juvenile is stable in school, and whether a responsible adult is available to supervise the juvenile. Staff has some discretion in assigning points. Here’s a summary of how the total points are scored: Score Where juvenile suspect should be before appearing in court 0 to 9 Released home 10 to 16 Alternative location, such as a temporary shelter 17 and up Secure detention at juvenile center Auto theft is worth 10 points -- not zero, as Flynn claimed -- which initially puts a juvenile in the middle range of the scoring system. But it’s possible staff could decide to release the juvenile, with an order to appear in Children’s Court on the next court day, if mitigating factors reduce the score to 9 or lower. If there are aggravating factors that raise the score to 17 or higher, staff could decide to hold the juvenile in secure detention until the first court appearance. At the court appearance, the staff makes a recommendation to the judge on where the juvenile should be while the case is prosecuted, assuming that the district attorney’s office decides to file charges. Then the judge decides. Our rating Flynn said that in Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft "get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court" on holding suspects, "a stolen car gets zero points." It’s possible for a juvenile arrested on an auto theft-related charge to be released home until appearing in court, usually the next day. It depends on the facts of the case and factors such as whether the juvenile can be supervised by a responsible adult. But under the point system, auto theft is worth 10 points, not zero, which typically would result in the juvenile being held in secure detention or at an alternative facility until appearing in court, depending on factors such as the juvenile having a prior record. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Edward Flynn	None	None	None	2015-10-19T05:00:00	2015-08-27	['None']

pomt-03677	Says he has "yet to get a response" from Barack Obama to his August 2010 letter making border security requests.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/apr/25/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-awaits-answer-barack-obama-augu/	Gov. Rick Perry says his 2010 plea to President Barack Obama for border security help remains unanswered. Perry made the appeal to Obama in August 2010 when they met on the airport tarmac in Austin, where Obama was visiting for the day. The governor mentioned the airport meeting when he appeared on CNN’s "The Situation Room" on April 5, 2013. Perry said "the president hadn't called up the governor of one of the largest states who has the longest border with Mexico and said, ‘Governor, what do you think we need to do about the issue of immigration?’ I would be open to that conversation any day." CNN’s Wolf Blitzer replied: "So if he calls you, are you ready to go to the White House and sit down with the president and try to come up with some sensible solutions to comprehensive immigration reform?" "Absolutely," Perry said. "As a matter of fact, I handed him a letter some two or three years ago on the tarmac at the Austin airport about that issue, about border security. And yet to get a response." At the Aug. 9, 2010, airport encounter, caught on TV cameras, Perry and Obama chatted for less than a minute, according to news stories. Perry ultimately handed his letter on border security to a White House aide, Valerie Jarrett. In the letter, Perry said he was renewing his invitation for the president and federal officials to meet with Texas officials on security issues. In addition, the letter urged federal drones to be flown along the border and mentioned Perry’s unfulfilled "standing request" for 1,000 National Guard troops to work with Texas law enforcement on security operations. Noting the Obama administration’s recently announced plans to send 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, Perry’s letter said the "deployment of just 286 National Guard personnel along the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border is clearly insufficient." We asked Perry’s office about the governor not hearing back from Obama. By email, spokesman Josh Havens said: "We are still waiting on a response from President Obama." Then again, Perry fielded a White House response at the time. Havens simultaneously emailed us a copy of an Aug. 27, 2010, letter to Perry signed by John O. Brennan, then assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. In May 2013, Brennan was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Brennan’s letter, on White House letterhead, opened: "Thank you for your August 9, 2010, letter to President Obama regarding security concerns on our Southwest border. On behalf of President Obama, I wish to assure you that we understand your concerns and appreciate your outreach." Brennan’s letter further said that securing the border had been an Obama priority. The letter did not embrace any of Perry’s requests, but noted that a few days after his Austin stop, Obama signed the Southwest Border Security Act into law, enabling the "addition of substantial and varied law enforcement resources to enhance security on our southern border." As an example, the letter said, additional National Guard troops and "other security resources" would serve. "It is anticipated that Texas will have over 20 National Guardsmen serving as criminal investigative analysts in fusion centers and over 225 Guardsmen conducting ground surveillance," in National Entry Identification Teams the letter said. The letter closed: "We are united in our common interest and focused efforts to secure the Southwest border. Your continued engagement and partnership on this national security imperative is much appreciated." We emailed the White House and Department of Homeland Security on this topic and did not hear back. We also asked Havens if the governor responded to Brennan’s letter, and we filed an open-records’ request asking the governor’s office for border-related communications between the state and White House since Perry and Obama visited on the tarmac. No materials came our way in the first few days after we submitted the request. Our ruling Perry said he had "yet to get a response" to his 2010 letter to Obama requesting border security steps. That’s not so. Perry fielded a reply to his letter from a White House deputy about three weeks after the airport howdy. We grant that it might not have contained the answers Perry sought, but saying Perry has yet to get any response strikes us as both inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-15292	The federal deficit would pay for 40 gallons of "New Hampshire maple syrup" for everyone in the United States.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jul/22/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-says-deficit-could-pay-40-gallons-new-hamps/	During a town hall on July 1, 2015, in Colebrook, N.H., U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte used a regional example to explain the size of the federal deficit. She said the deficit -- some $483 billion last year -- would buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every man, woman and child in the United States. Ayotte has used that example before, including a January town meeting in Goffstown. And she has used other colorful examples to illustrate the size of our nation’s deficit, telling voters in 2013 that it could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years." (That was True, by the way.) But what about the maple syrup comparison? Would $483 billion cover that 40 gallons for every U.S. resident? PolitiFact decided to check the math. This is a story of three numbers. The first is the U.S. budget deficit, which can easily be found in information from the official Congressional Budget Office. The deficit is the amount that the country runs short each year -- the difference between its income and expenses -- and shouldn’t be confused with the national debt, which is much larger because it’s the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus surpluses. The office’s report from January puts the 2014 deficit at $483 billion. The second number is the population of the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, which keeps close track of such things, the nation had 320 million people by the end of 2014. (It’s added 1.3 million since then.) Dividing those two numbers, then, means that each person in the country has $1,509.40 of our nation’s deficit. That then leads to our third number: the price of maple syrup. How much of the flapjack topping could $1,509.40 buy? Fortunately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture tracks maple syrup prices, through its National Agriculture Statistics Service. It issued a bunch of numbers last month that can help us out. According those numbers, the average price of a gallon of maple syrup in New Hampshire in 2014 -- the same year as our $483 billion deficit and our 320 million population -- was $57.80. That generally tracks with local farm prices. When we checked, Corlis Farm in Northfield was charging $55 a gallon. Maple Ridge Sugar House in Loudon was charging $58 per gallon. And last year, Sunnyside Maples in Gilmanton was charging $55 for a gallon. The USDA figure was backed up by the New Hampshire Maple Producers Association. According to association publicist Robyn Pearl, it’s not going to go down anytime soon. "The price has been on a slow yet steady increase over the years, which reflects the same increase in production costs," Pearl said. If we use that $57.80 average, Ayotte’s claim gets, well, a little sticky. That $1,509.40 per U.S. resident would only buy a bit more than 26 gallons of syrup, not 40. We checked with Ayotte’s office to see what figures they were using. They referred us to the same set of statistics on maple prices -- from a year earlier -- but pointed to different numbers. They used the U.S. average price per gallon, which was $37.40 for 2013, and the New Hampshire wholesale price for syrup, which was $37.90 per gallon in 2012 and $46.10 per gallon in 2013. Using that national average price per gallon indeed yields 40 gallons of syrup per person, but Ayotte’s office confirmed she was talking about New Hampshire made maple syrup. Looking just at the New Hampshire numbers, the 2012 wholesale price for a gallon of syrup comes close, although the 2013 wholesale price yields only 32.8 gallons per person. (The 2014 wholesale price, which wasn’t cited by Ayotte’s staff, is $42.40 per gallon, which would given each person 35.6 gallons.) But those at Ayotte’s town hall meeting know they're not paying wholesale prices at their local sugar house, where gallons of syrup are going for well over $50. There’s a broader point here, of course. The senator’s statement was meant to give residents a handle on an otherwise incomprehensible figure -- the size of the U.S. budget deficit. That’s what Ayotte’s staff said she hoped to do. Just for fun, we decided to calculate how long 40 gallons of syrup would last the average American. While some of us in the Northeast might consume a gallon or more a year (don’t tell the dentist), the national average is between 2.5 to 4 ounces per person, according to the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center and Center for Northern Woodlands Education. In other words, 40 gallons of syrup should last the average American more than 160 years. And never mind the fact that giving that much syrup to everyone in the United States would be a sticky situation. New Hampshire only made 112,000 gallons of syrup in 2014, and there were only 3.2 million gallons produced in the United States that year; enough to give one gallon to every 100 people. In the words of Warner syrup producer Barbara Lassonde, "We don't make that much, and if we tapped every maple tree in the Northeastern quadrant of the country, I still don't believe we'd make enough." Our ruling U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said the federal budget deficit is big enough to be able to buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every resident of the United States. Ayotte’s office said she was calculating it based on generic U.S.-made syrup, but that’s considerably less expensive than New Hampshire-made syrup. If we were buying New Hampshire syrup wholesale using 2014 prices, the amount would come closer, but still not hit a full 40 gallons. And if we use retail costs in New Hampshire, it works out to 26 gallons, not 40. So her numbers are open to question, but her general point is valid: Either figure represents more than a lifetime supply for the average maple muncher in America. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09836	The health bill's plan for comparative effectiveness research "would be used by the government to ration care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/john-boehner/boehner-says-study-effectiveness-medical-treatment/	Many opponents of health care plans being considered by Congress have warned they would lead to government rationing of health care services. To which we say, yes they would. Health care is already rationed. Public and private plans have limited resources, and you can't just get any medical service you want anywhere at any time. That's rationing. It's a reality of health care today and would be under any of the plans being considered in Congress. And so we gave a False to former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean when he said the plans include no rationing. But that's not to say many of the claims of rationing by the Republican opponents are right. In fact, many of them are very misleading, or outright wrong. We've weighed in previously on former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's claim the bill would create "death panels" that will decide whether Grandma will get health care. It wouldn't. Here, we'll deal with another popular claim from Republican opponents of the plan: that government-sponsored research into medical care would be used to ration services. Most recently, the claim was made in a press release on the Web site for House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Aug. 18, 2009. It states: "The bill would establish a new tax on every health insurance policy to fund a government board that would be tasked with deciding which treatments are more cost-effective," the release states. "The research findings would be used by the government to ration care." The press release cites the part of the House bill that deals with establishing a Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research within the Agency for Healthcare Research. That's a bureaucratic way of saying the government would do studies to find out which medical treatments and medications work better than others, and which are most cost-effective. The idea is that this would help doctors and patients make better-informed decisions about the most effective treatment strategies. It's also expected to save money over time. A case for it was made on June 12, 2007, by Peter R. Orszag, then director of the Congressional Budget Office but now a member of the Obama administration, in an address to Congress: "Hard evidence is often unavailable about which treatments work best for which patients or whether the added benefits of more-effective but more-expensive services are sufficient to warrant their added costs." The findings, he said, suggest that better information about the costs and benefits of various treatments could substantially lower health care spending as well as "yield better health outcomes from the resources devoted to health care." Some opponents such as Boehner have argued that such research will lead to the government telling doctors what kinds of services or medications they can and cannot provide — rationing. Our ruling here may seem something of a paradox because, as we note above, Boehner would be right if he said there is rationing now and will be rationing in the future. But in this case, there actually are provisions in the bill about comparative research to make sure it is not used for rationing. Language in the House version of the health bill specifically states: "Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer." And let's be clear, comparative effectiveness research has been done by the government for years and years. The Obama administration wants to greatly expand the amount of research. The economic stimulus package also included more funding for comparative effectiveness research. And the bill included a similar disclaimer that it would not mandate insurers to cover or reimburse one treatment or medication over another. "We definitely need more information about how cost-effective certain things are," said Katherine Baicker, a health economics professor at Harvard University. People are understandably nervous that these studies could lead to rationing of certain services, she said, but as a researcher, "It's hard for me to see how we can make better decisions without better information." AARP, the leading advocate for seniors, has long been a strong supporter of such research. "It boggles the mind" said AARP spokesman Jim Dau, how comparative effectiveness research has been portrayed by opponents of the health care plan as government rationing of care. "It's just good common sense," Dau said of the research. "It's giving individuals and doctors better evidence-based research so that they can make better decisions." Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, is another big advocate of comparative effectiveness research. She views it as lobby-free information that can be used to empower patients. Wilensky envisions tiered co-payments based on the clinical appropriateness of various medical treatments. That's not rationing, she said. "As we get more advanced, we'll be able to move toward more precision medicine, where we can authorize even very expensive treatments if we know they are going to work," she said. So, for example, she said, if someone with cancer has a biomarkers that indicates they would be likely to respond to the treatment, there would be a lower co-pay. "We ought to be doing things better," Wilensky said. "We need to spend smarter and treat more effectively," We think it's reasonable to conclude that some insurers may decide to use the government's research findings to determine what kinds of medical services it will cover, or at least which ones it will cover first. But we think it's a stretch to call giving patients better information about which treatments and drugs are most effective "rationing." In fact, given specific language in the bill to the contrary, we think it's outright wrong for Boehner to claim the research findings would be used by the government to ration care. Our friends at FactCheck.org came to the same conclusion in an item that walks through the evolution of comparative effectiveness research. So we find Boehner 's claim that comparative effectiveness research findings "would be used by the government to ration care" to be False.

pomt-03392	"Currently, it takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally" but the Senate bill "would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/07/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-it-takes-25-years-obtai/	Don’t count U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin among Republicans supporting the kind of immigration reform endorsed with bipartisan backing by two-thirds of the U.S. Senate on June 27, 2013. The Senate’s approach, Sensenbrenner argues, would crowd out legal immigration by boosting incentives to enter America illegally through a head start on citizenship. How? "Currently, it takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally," Sensenbrenner wrote in The Washington Times on July 1, 2013. "The Senate proposal, however, would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years." His conclusion: "That’s a 12-year head start granted as a reward for illegally entering the country." We’ve heard senators state repeatedly that illegal immigrants would have to "get in the back of the line" to obtain legal status on the road to citizenship. So let’s examine Sensenbrenner’s claim as the spotlight moves to the Republican-held House, where the GOP may take a more piecemeal reform strategy featuring tougher enforcement on the Mexico-U.S. border. The current system To obtain citizenship, an immigrant needs to first obtain a green card and then wait either 3 or 5 years before applying for citizenship, said Madeleine Sumption of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. The length of the "pathway to citizenship" is the sum of the waiting time for whatever type of green card the person is eligible for, plus 3 to 5 years, she explained. The current immigration process is first-come, first-served and limits the total number of people admitted each year on family or employment visas granting permanent residency, noted another Migration Policy Institute researcher, Claire Bergeron. Long waiting lists have resulted. Overall, demand has exceeded supply since 1965, especially from Mexico, whose 1.3 million applicants on the waiting list made up 30 percent of the list as of November 2012. All told, more than 4.4 million people are "in line" for immigrant visas, though an unknown number of those people may already be here without authorization. There are also per-country caps in place. That has meant especially long waiting times not only in Mexico, but in China, India and the Philippines. Sensenbrenner’s claim It is the case, for some categories of aspiring Americans from a few countries where hundreds of thousands want to settle here, that wait times just to get in are 20 years or more. Then it’s another 3 to 5 years to obtain citizenship. Mexican nationals who are the adult children of U.S. citizens experience waits of 20 years before they can file for permanent-residence visas commonly known as green cards, Bergeron wrote in a March 2013 immigration primer for the institute. The same waits apply to Mexicans who are the adult unmarried children of lawful permanent residents of the United States. "The longest backlog -- for siblings of U.S. citizens coming from the Philippines -- is currently about 24 years," Sumption told us. "That means that people currently getting these green cards have waited 24 years for them." So for a large number of people from countries where interest in living in the United States is high, Sensenbrenner is right that waits of "up to" 25 years are a reality. When we asked Sensenbrenner’s office for backup, spokesman Ben Miller said Sensenbrenner had Mexican immigrants in mind when citing the 25-year figure, because they are the focus of much of the current debate. But backlogs for many other immigrants -- and some from Mexico -- are much shorter, the Migration Policy Institute study noted. Spouses of U.S. citizens, for example, get their green cards within about a year after applying, Sumption told us. And the spouses and children of lawful permanent residents from all countries typically wait 2 years before they can file for a green card. In countries other than Mexico and the Philippines, applicants for family-based immigrant visas typically wait 2 to 12 years before they can get a green-card application started. "Wait times vary dramatically depending on the applicant’s visa category and country of nationality," the MPI study found. In another part of the system -- employer-based immigration -- applicants with no more than a bachelor’s degree commonly see waiting times of 4 years or more for green cards. "When you add to that the fact that many have been in the country for 6 years on a temporary work visa before applying for green cards, plus a 5-year wait for citizenship, the total waiting time for these people before obtaining citizenship can be around 15 years," Sumption said in an email. Looking at the comparison Sensenbrenner says the Senate bill would allow the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States to obtain citizenship in 13 years. That’s accurate, based on multiple news accounts of the bill. Finally, Sensenbrenner does the math. He concludes that 25 minus 13 means a "12-year head start granted as a reward for illegally entering the country." In doing so, he takes the high end of the range, leaving out his previous qualifier that citizenship takes "up to" 25 years. Overall his math is on target for many applicants from Mexico and the Philippines, countries that make up 40 percent of the waiting list. But it misfires for many others. Notably, in addition, Sensenbrenner leaves out the fact that the Senate bill aims to bring down the waiting times. That is, he uses the bill’s 13-year citizenship path for illegal immigrants as part of his equation, but does not take into account the bill’s intent to drive down the long waits. The bill, Sumption said, provides a backlog clearance program that would issue visas to people currently waiting in line over a 7 to 9 year period. (It should be noted that one way the bill would prevent new backlogs from developing is to end future immigration visas for siblings of U.S. citizens.) So Sensenbrenner’s 25-year figure is weakened by his omission, at least in part. But, there is still a group of people who already have waited decades to get here who would see that undocumented residents are on a 13-year path, albeit one that has many hurdles. Our rating Sensenbrenner said it currently takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally, but the Senate bill "would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years." He’s right for a large group of would-be Americans who wait for 20 or more years to get in and then become citizens. But many others experience much shorter waits, and Sensenbrenner muddies the comparison by omitting the fact that, going forward if the Senate bill became law, wait times are expected to drop. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Jim Sensenbrenner	None	None	None	2013-07-07T06:00:00	2013-07-01	['United_States']
pomt-03811	The Air Force wants taxpayers to fund a fantasy football league.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/22/blog-posting/bloggers-say-air-force-wants-taxpayers-fund-fantas/	Is the Air Force preparing to spend precious taxpayer funds as it faces sequester-driven budget cuts on a fantasy football league ? On blogs and on Twitter on March 20, 2013, people buzzed that it was the case, with a link to back it up. "What sequester? Air Force wants taxpayers to fund fantasy football league," read a headline at WashingtonExaminer.com. "Spared by the Sequester, So Far: Air Force Fantasy Football Program," said another at NationalReview.com. "Forget Budget Cuts," said Wired.com. " Air Force Is Ready for Some (Fantasy) Football." Some stories credited tips from a co-founder of conservative site RedState.com or a writer there. Does the Air Force want "taxpayers" to fund a fantasy sports league? Not so fast. Not your money Bloggers had noticed a March 19 "request for information" from an Air Force contracting office "seeking sources for providing the Air Force installations a Fantasy Football Program." The Air Force’s original request for information included some clues that taxpayers might not be involved. It mentioned the personnel center services division, and the Air Force’s "nonappropriated" purchasing office. The personnel center services division runs recreation and leisure programs for Air Force members and their families around the world, including clubs, bowling, golf, fitness, arts and crafts, and recreational shooting. It also manages the Air Force’s "nonappropriated funds" — money that comes from fees and other cash collected from airmen and their families who take part. That is to say: Money that doesn’t come from Congress. It’s not taxpayer money, and it’s not subject to budget cuts under the sequester. But it’s not a small amount of money, with tens of millions of dollars from overseas on-base slot machines alone. It even supports a different type of federal employee, not considered federal civil servants because they’re not funded through normal congressional appropriations. Those employees run the activities and programs that also include things like restaurants, youth centers, and auto and wood shops. The goal of all these programs, sometimes called "MWR" for morale, welfare and recreation, is just what it sounds like: to boost troop morale. And, for 17 years, they’ve included an annual program called the "Football Frenzy," said Air Force spokesperson Laurel Tingley. In 2011, for example, airmen who joined the Air Force Services Clubs could win a trip to the Super Bowl. This year, the personnel center services division wanted to find out what it would take to add fantasy football to the Frenzy. Thus, the request for "information and pricing on providing product branding, hosting, managing, and delivering all programs and materials related to running a Fantasy Football League," that would serve airmen, civilians and family members at "over 100 installations worldwide." "What we're looking at doing is enhancing a program that airmen have enjoyed for 17 years," Tingley said. "And the entire program is funded through (nonappropriated funds)." Tingley didn’t have details about exactly what the Air Force sought to create, but a fantasy football league wouldn’t have been unplowed ground in the world of military morale — the Navy organized a fantasy football contest with commercial sponsors in 2010 that offered a grand prize of $100,000. On March 21, 2013, the Air Force updated its request to say: "This RFI is issued by the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO). All requirements, solicitations and subsequent contracts, if any, awarded through AFNAFPO are funded wholly with Nonappropriated funds. These funds are generated through user fees and charges at Air Force morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) programs worldwide. THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATIONS FROM CONGRESS OR 'TAXPAYER' DOLLARS." By noon on March 22, 2013, it had canceled the request. Our ruling Headlines across the blogosphere and shared via social media suggested the Air Force wanted taxpayers to a fund fantasy football league — a charged claim as defense budgets face mandatory cuts. But the evidence was a "request for information," not a final decision to fund anything. Meanwhile, any money at stake wouldn’t have come from taxpayers, but "nonappropriated funds" generated by Air Force clubs and other activities designed to boost morale. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04416	Says Adam Hasner "gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/15/lois-frankel/lois-frankel-says-adam-hasner-gives-rich-hefty-tax/	The battle between two South Florida congressional candidates -- Republican Adam Hasner and Democrat Lois Frankel -- is largely about who is on the side of the middle class. Frankel tries to speak directly to middle-class taxpayers boasting in one ad: "I always take your side" and promises to strengthen Social Security and defend Medicare. She tries to portray Hasner as the pal of the rich and says in her ads that he "is never on our side." That message is counter to the image he has emphasized of understanding the struggles of the middle class. He says his public school teacher parents in Brooklyn only had $31 to their name when Hasner was born, and he vows to help small businesses and told the Miami Herald’s editorial board that his own home is "severely under water." Here, we will look at a claim from a Frankel ad called "Real": "Hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000." We wanted to check to see if Frankel accurately characterized Hasner’s record on federal taxes. The Ryan and Romney tax plans When we asked the Frankel campaign for evidence of its claim, they pointed us to Hasner’s stated support for a budget plan written by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis,. who later became Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate. Ryan’s plan doesn’t explicitly call for tax increases. Instead, it says that overall tax rates should be lowered -- Ryan suggests two new tax brackets 10 and 25 percent -- while eliminating loopholes, deductions and exemptions. Romney’s tax plan is similar, in that it too recommends across-the-board rates cuts in exchange for eliminating loopholes, deductions and exemptions. The idea behind both plans is to simplify the tax code while bringing in about the same amount of revenue, so as not to drive up the deficit. But at least two studies have suggested that the middle class would see tax increases if the most common tax breaks were eliminated, even if their overall tax rates drop. Frankel’s ad cited an ABC News report about one such report by staff for Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., which examined Ryan’s plan. The Casey report concluded that for those earning more than $200,000 a year "their net taxes fall significantly," while it is likely that those earning less than $200,000 would face an increase. A study by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that analyzes tax plans, estimated that those earning at least a million dollars would receive an average tax cut of $265,000 under the Ryan plan. But the Tax Policy Center report also showed that Ryan’s plan would mean a net tax cut for every income group over $30,000 a year -- not a tax hike for the middle class, as Frankel claims. The discrepancy stems from a huge difference in methodology between the Casey report and the Tax Policy Center analysis of Ryan’s plan. The Casey report assumes -- without really knowing -- that Ryan and fellow Republicans would eliminate current deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, remove the employer‐provided health insurance exclusion, and tax 401(k) contributions. But that approach amounts to taking the worst-case approach to make the point. The Tax Policy Center, on the other hand, attributed no elimination of deductions to Ryan’s plan, noting that his plan doesn’t specify what Republicans would do. (Ryan’s plan does strongly suggest that some tax breaks would go and others would remain, but specifics are lacking). Democrats have made similar claims that Romney’s tax plan would give millionaires a tax break while raising them for the middle class. Romney’s plan has also lacked details making it difficult to analyze. What Hasner says So has Hasner explicitly supported the Ryan or the Romney plans? We should note that Hasner served in the Florida Legislature, not in Congress. So he’s never taken a vote on the Ryan plan. But in the past, Hasner clearly said he supported the Ryan plan. When he was running for the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, he repeatedly voiced his support for it. In 2011, the Washington Post The Fix blog-- one of the citations in Frankel’s ad -- said that Hasner "fully embraced" Ryan’s budget "a rare Senate candidate willing to take such a step." Hasner said he would vote for the plan "without hesitation" and suggested the plan "does not go far enough." And he chastized Republicans who were backing away from it: "A lot of Republicans are starting to waffle on this question. Some are backing away, some are hedging their bets, some are sticking their finger in to test the political winds. I want you to know that I fully support the Paul Ryan plan." But trailing behind in the Senate primary, Hasner switched to the congressional race in February 2012. Now as a candidate running in a left-leaning district where he needs the independent vote, Hasner often talks about his support for the "bipartisan Wyden/Ryan" plan. Is Ryan -- the GOP vice presidential candidate and hero of conservatives -- actually the author some sort of bipartisan plan? Well, sort of -- on paper. But that was a white paper about reforming Medicare -- not a detailed tax plan. Hasner told us in an interview that he supports extending expiring tax cuts, sometimes called the Bush tax cuts, for all incomes. "I support extending the current tax rates just like President Obama supported extending them back in 2010," he said. (That’s different than Frankel, who has repeatedly said like Obama she wants to get rid of tax cuts for those earning above $250,000.) Hasner said he supports the general principle of eliminating exemptions and cutting tax rates, but he declined to endorse the specific targets set forth in the Romney and Ryan plans. Hasner also said: "I will never support any tax increase on middle-income earners ever. ... If you're not going to eliminate loopholes and exemptions, then I wouldn't support lowering rates." Hasner said he was "not afraid" of more revenues coming into the government because revenues as a percentage of GDP are below historical levels. He says he supports "a responsible approach." The claim is the ad is "misleading and false," he said. Would Romney's plan result in tax increases on the middle class? "Not only do I believe the Romney plan doesn't do that, but I would never do that." Hasner wrote on his campaign website: "Reducing marginal rates while broadening the tax base through the elimination of loopholes and exemptions will produce enough revenue to ‘pay’ for cutting everyone’s tax rates and would not require any middle class tax increase, nor would it produce a net windfall for high income taxpayers." Hasner told us in an interview he supports maintaining exemptions for mortgage and child tax credits. He would support eliminating an exemption for employer-sponsored health care and putting in place a new health care tax credit. "I want to level the playing field for people who want to purchase health insurance as individuals and that means eliminating the exemption for employer-sponsored health care," he said. Our ruling Frankel’s ad says "Hasner gives the wealthy tax breaks worth $250,000 a year but hikes middle class taxes $2,000." The ad bases its claim on a proposal put before Congress by Paul Ryan, now the vice presidential nominee, which Hasner has praised in the past. The plan addressed many aspects of the federal government, including simplifing the tax code by repealing exemptions and cutting tax rates. But the impact of Ryan’s plan for the middle class is muddled. It’s not clear that it would result in a tax hike for the middle class, though some say it will. The tax plan lacked specifics, which makes it difficult to evaluate. Hasner says he won’t vote for a tax plan that includes middle-income tax increases. Meanwhile, the ad doesn’t mention the Ryan plan as the source of its claims and states without qualification that Hasner supports tax increases. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07920	"The economy we preside over today is better than the one we inherited."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/31/hank-johnson/johnson-says-economy-better-obama-became-president/	Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson used President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last week to give his own state of the American economy. "There is no doubt that the economy we preside over today is better than the one we inherited," the representative said in a one-paragraph statement on his website. "But we know," added Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, who was one of Obama’s earliest supporters when he campaigned for the presidency in 2008, "we must do more to ensure that America and its workers can compete and win in the 21st century." His statement raised an interesting question: Is the economy better now than when Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009? Officially, the nation’s economic recession ended in June 2009, but many Americans are still without jobs and most experts said the recovery is slow. Forty-four states are projecting budget shortfalls this year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Principles. So how do you measure the economy? As Georgia State University economics expert Rajeev Dhawan noted to us, the economy is like a diamond. There are many facets to it. Johnson’s spokesman Andy Phelan said the main areas to consider when measuring the economy are the stock market, industrial production, consumer spending and exports. They were comparing the last two full years of George W. Bush’s presidency, 2006 to 2008, to the following two years. (Bush’s presidency ended on Jan. 20, 2009.) "I think jobs is the most important stat -- as you would probably agree - and we’ve seen 12 straight months of job growth in the private sector," Phelan told us in an e-mail. "In 2010, the private sector gained 1.3 million jobs -- the strongest job growth since 2006." Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently told a congressional committee that the economy has shown "hopeful" signs of growth -- citing increases in consumer spending and private-sector investment in new equipment and software. But Bernanke also said he was troubled by issues such as long-term unemployment and mortgage foreclosures. Bernanke said that the housing sector "remains depressed." RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, last week reported that foreclosure activity jumped in 149 of the nation’s 206 largest metropolitan areas in 2010. Atlanta ranked third, behind Houston and Seattle. New home construction, though, has slightly increased since the end of 2008, The Associated Press reported,using data from the U.S. Commerce Department. In 2008, builders broke ground on 549,000 homes. Last year, construction began on 587,600 homes. Some frequently considered economic indicators, like the gross domestic product, which measures the nation’s output and its consumption of goods and services, have remained steady since 2006. Another popular economic measure, the Dow Jones industrial average, is hovering around 12,000, about a 50 percent increase from 7,949 on Jan. 20, 2009. The Dow decreased by about 50 percent between the beginning of 2007 and the beginning of 2009. Some may argue the drop between 2007 and 2009 was the result of a few extraordinary days on Wall Street. The Dow dropped 504 points on Sept. 15, 2008, the worst one-day decline since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Dow dropped by about 1,400 points during a five-day stretch in October 2008. On trade, there is some support for Johnson’s case,but clearly room for growth. The federal trade deficit was $38.3 billion in November 2010, according to the most recent figures available from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The $38.3 billion deficit was about 25 percent less than the largest deficit of the Obama presidency, $50.1 billion in June 2010. The deficit was $43.8 billion in November 2008, a 50 percent decline from the high of $66.4 billion in July 2008. Exports increased from the November 2008 total of $141 billion to the November 2010 figure of $159.6 billion. Unemployment is another trouble point for the congressman’s argument. The nation’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in December 2008. A year later, it was 9.9 percent. In December 2010, the rate was 9.4 percent; lower than at the end of 2009, but still higher than at the same point in 2008. Monthly job losses, which were brutal between July 2008 and June 2009, have stopped, and the data shows there is growth in that area. However, the number of discouraged workers -- people who’ve stopped looking for a job -- has doubled since the end of 2008, from about 642,000 that December to the December 2010 total of 1.3 million. Michael Pento, senior economist for Euro Pacific Capital, a Connecticut-based brokerage firm, said the economy has improved in the GDP, initial jobless claims and regional manufacturing. But he said it has worsened in the critical areas of housing, unemployment and -- in his greatest concern -- debt. The gross federal debt -- the amount of money the government owes itself -- has risen since the end of 2008 from slightly more than $10 trillion to its current total of about $14 trillion. Some economists prefer to use another measurement of debt when measuring the nation’s economic health. They focus on the public debt rather than gross federal debt, because the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, which in turn would have a faster ripple effect in the private sector.The public debt -- which is held by individuals, companies, foreign governments and others -- is higher now than it was at the beginning of 2009. However, it is now a smaller percentage of the nation’s GDP than it was in January 2009. Some analysts like Pento worry the debt will drive the nation’s economy toward a cliff, without an air safety bag. "The economy can’t be deemed better now than when George W. Bush left office because the factors that led to the credit crisis exist today, only they have been vastly intensified," Pento told us. "How can anybody claim the economy is getting better?" Johnson’s office agreed that debt is a serious concern, but argued that job growth, manufacturing growth and improved consumer confidence are more important immediate factors in the economic recovery. So where does all of this leave us? Matthew Dowd, who worked as a strategist for Bush, argued in December that the economy has "worsened" since Obama took office. Our national PolitiFact site rated his statement Half-True. In many areas, the numbers show the economy has grown. However, there are analysts and members of Congress like Wisconsin’s Paul Ryan, a Republican, who worry the debt problem has grown during the Obama presidency and fear it will be a painful problem in the near future. The worst of the nation’s recent economic troubles began in mid-2008 and continued through much of 2009. "The growth is very strong," says Georgia State’s Dhawan, director of the university’s Economic Forecasting Center,who argues the economy has improved. In some areas, the economy has improved over the past two years in measurable areas like trade and the Dow. Congressman Johnson is correct about that. But major components like housing and unemployment are still in the dumps. Until those key areas turn around, it’s hard to argue that the overall economy has improved. Johnson’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give readers a different impression. Under our guidelines, the congressman’s statement rates as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03818	"We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/21/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-federal-government-thinks-it-has/	Toilet seats just got political. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a constitutional lawyer recently elected to Congress, says they’re an intimate example of federal overreach. He name-dropped the familiar fixtures in his March 16, 2013, speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC. "We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats," he said. Does the long arm of the law extend into your bathroom? Yes. But some constitutional scholars say that’s too far. Plumbing the Constitution Cruz, a Republican, is no stranger to the nation’s founding documents. He argued before the U.S. Supreme Court as the solicitor general of Texas and has written more than 80 briefs for the nation’s highest court. He might like to flush some of its decisions. Here’s what he told his CPAC audience: "There's the 10th Amendment, something our omnipotent federal government seems to have forgotten all about. The 10th Amendment provides that the powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people. "How did we get a $16.5 trillion national debt? We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats and our light bulbs. We need to get back to the Constitution." We’ve written plenty about light bulbs (which, yes, are regulated) but hadn’t taken up the question of toilet seats. Here’s the thing about toilet seats and the Constitution. The 10th Amendment reserves powers for the states and the people — except those given to the federal government. And under current interpretations of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause and 14th Amendment, there’s power to federally regulate toilet seats. (Take that, commode!) How? Well, the federal government can regulate consumer products, access to public facilities for people with disabilities and workplace health and safety. Thus: • The Mine Safety & Health Administration says, "sanitary toilets shall have an attached toilet seat with a hinged lid and a toilet paper holder together with an adequate supply of toilet tissue." • The Occupational Safety & Health Administration says construction sites with 20 employees or more shall provide "1 toilet seat and 1 urinal per 40 workers." • The U.S. Access Board requires most restrooms to have at least one "accessible" toilet in buildings covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, which means, in part, a toilet seat at a height of 17 inches to 19 inches. Springs to return seats to a lifted position aren’t allowed. Those MSHA and OSHA rules? Cruz’s office says the federal government "has no business regulating such minutia." It could be — and has been — worse. Take the Great Horseshoe Seat Scandal of the 1970s. The brand-new Occupational Safety & Health Administration — which draws constitutional authority mainly from the Commerce Clause — had decided to implement a variety of voluntary industry standards as law. And it turned out that plumbers had for decades agreed that public toilets should have open-front, elongated seats rather than the closed rings of home bathroom seats. (Why? Oh, it’s a matter of speculation that’s made us the laughing-stock of Europe, where experts make jokes that the chief of one American lab was too polite to repeat. But it might have something to do with, um, hygiene.) So businesses suddenly faced a federal mandate on seat shape. The "resultant outcries about picayune government regulations," as one newspaper columnist put it, helped land hundreds of OSHA regulations on a to-delete list. The shape of your public toilet seat was no longer federally regulated by the ‘80s. Plumbing fixtures now generally don’t face federal regulation. Instead, manufacturers follow voluntary industry standards, which often get the force of law from state and local governments. But they could. Commodes and the Commerce Clause Meanwhile, the regulations that yet exist — about workplace seat availability and public restroom seat height — strike Cruz as "regulating down to the minutia" on issues best left to states and local governments, said his press secretary, Catherine Frazier. He’s right that the federal government "thinks" it has that authority, according to constitutional scholars we consulted. Cruz’s former constitutional law professor at Harvard, Laurence Tribe, offered some examples where toilet seats are "obviously subject to federal regulation" under settled law: • The commercial sale of toilet seats, like other commodities, in transactions involving an interstate market are subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause. • The provision of adequate toilet facilities to workers in businesses affecting interstate commerce is subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. • Ensuring that toilet facilities, like others, are made available without regard to race or disability is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause and equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. The question of whether the Constitution should be interpreted to grant such power to the federal government exposes a deep rift among experts. Randy Barnett, who represented opponents of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, argues for a narrower Commerce Clause, as do libertarian scholars such as Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute. A few decisions since the 1990s have gone their way, including the recent ruling that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate wasn’t justified by the Commerce Clause. The framers "gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it," justices ruled. (The mandate was upheld under the government’s taxing power, instead.) But settled law still says toilet seats are fair game. "Basically, Cruz is taking an example that sounds silly — toilet seats! — but if you look at the legal basis for the regulatory authority, it's pretty well-established and not all that silly," said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "This is just political posturing, and Cruz, as a Harvard law grad, presumably knows it." Our ruling Cruz, railing against modern interpretations of the Commerce Clause and the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, said, "We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats." While federal attention to toilet seats has dropped since its brief foray into seat shape in the ‘70s, and now mainly addresses toilet access for workers and height for wheelchair users, Cruz is firmly right that the courts, Congress, and executive agencies claim federal power to regulate them. His toilet trivia is True. Editor's note: We updated this item on March 26, 2013, to clarify that the U.S. Access Board requires most restrooms in ADA-covered buildings to have at least one accessible toilet.

Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, fed into that theme during an interview on Fox Business with host Maria Bartiromo on March 24, 2016.

Letting them know ‘wink, wink, nudge, nudge’ that you didn’t just give to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, appreciates what you’ve done." We wondered if Norquist's allegation was correct. When President-elect Barack Obama considered making Hillary Clinton his secretary of state, the immediate concern was that foreign interests might curry favor at the State Department by supporting her husband’s efforts at the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, also called CGI. To clear the way for Clinton’s nomination, those organizations agreed to a number of measures to avoid real and apparent conflicts. Among the changes, the foundation would publish the names of its donors and separate itself from the Clinton Global Initiative. Bill Clinton would not raise funds for CGI, and CGI itself would no longer accept donations from foreign governments or hold events outside the United States. After all that, did Clinton's State Department really cross the line by sending officials thanks to the foundation's donors? We asked Norquist’s spokesman John Kartch for the source behind the statement that State Department officials were sending thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation. Kartch sent us a link to a page on the website of Judicial Watch, which describes itself as a conservative educational group. Judicial Watch posted a number of documents it received through a Freedom of Information Act request to the State Department. The first few pages in the collection were an exchange of emails between Clinton’s chief of staff Cheryl Mills and other top aides at the State Department, and Amitabh Desai, director of foreign policy at the Clinton Foundation. (Before joining the foundation, Desai was a legislative aide to then-Sen. Hillary Clinton.) Desai wanted Secretary Clinton to speak at the closing session of the Clinton Global Initiative meeting on Sept. 25, 2009. The conversation begins on Aug. 22, 2009, with this letter from Desai to Mills and Huma Abedin, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, at the State Department: To decode the lingo of CGI, "HRC" is Hillary Rodham Clinton, "WJC" is William Jefferson Clinton and "commitments" are agreements among aid groups, governments and often corporations to work on a particular project. Desai’s list of three commitments included: Launching a media campaign to reduce sexual violence against girls. It involved the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several United Nations agencies, a large Brazilian ad agency and a foundation set up by a former hedge fund owner. Promoting the use of vitamin and mineral fortified food among poorer Indian households. It involved a major Indian food corporation. Expanding a micro-insurance fund. It involved an investment fund that had raised $44 million to provide small insurance policies in poor communities. Mills at the State Department answered, "I think this if fine but here's my question - how does this work - are these announced before or after she speaks and what relationship are they supposed to bear to what she says?" Desai said commitments are announced throughout the conference. "We could give you a list of all announcements as they get scheduled as we get closer to the meeting, and anything else that would be helpful." Mills replied, "It would be helpful to have list of commitments during whole session so she can reference more than those just around her speech." The final words in this email chain come from Caitlin Klevorick, a former consultant to the foundation who became a special assistant in the Secretary of State’s office. "One question is if we want to see if there is a decent mass of fs (food security) related commitments to announce together at closing as a ‘mega’ commitment," Klevorick wrote. That is the sum total of the interactions between State Department and Clinton Foundation staff, according to the emails obtained by Judicial Watch. We asked Kartch at Americans for Tax Reform if we had missed anything and did not hear back. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said he sees clear collaboration between the two entities. "State Department and Clinton Foundation staff worked together on how Mrs. Clinton could thank Foundation supporters for their commitments during a speech, which Mrs. Clinton did," Fitton said. "Mrs. Clinton, as the result of work by her aides and a Clinton Foundation representative, provided an official thank you during her speech." This is different from Norquist’s claim. Norquist said State Department officials were sending official thank-yous. The emails don’t describe that. Further, in her actual speech, Clinton didn’t thank anyone for contributing money. Early on, she did express her appreciation, but that was aimed at governments, not donors. "As secretary of state, I really, in terms of protocol, should be acknowledging all of the heads of state and heads of government who are here, but there are far too many," Clinton said. "So let me just express my deep appreciation for your involvement and for your presence here. We look forward to working with you and your governments as we move forward on the new agenda of the Obama administration." A moment later, she praises the entire audience. "This is an exceptional gathering of people, who have made exceptional commitments to bettering our world. We see it in everything you do. It seems a good opportunity, given the talent, the energy and the passion in this room, to talk about an exceptional global challenge, chronic hunger and what we all can do about it." Clinton spent the bulk of her speech talking about the White House policy to combat hunger. At the end, she told the audience, "We need your ideas and your feedback, and we need your active support in any and every capacity." Kathleen Clark, who specializes in public sector ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, told told us she didn’t see any smoking gun in the emails Norquist offered as evidence. Our ruling Norquist said that State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to donors to the Clinton Foundation. We looked at the source documents he relied on and found nothing that supported his version of events. State Department staff did ask for lists of projects and partners in preparation for a speech Clinton was to give at a Clinton Global Initiative meeting. However, there is no hint that any staff member expressed official appreciation to any donor. There is no indication that money for those projects flowed through CGI. Finally, Clinton thanked governments for showing up, but didn’t thank donors. She praised the audience in general, but that would include many who were on the receiving end of CGI’s efforts. The documents do not say what Norquist suggested they said. We rate this claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this story said the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation separated in 2009. Actually, the groups separated in 2010.

pomt-08625	"I've been outspent by my opponents every time I've run for U.S. Senate."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/20/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-hes-been-outspent-opponents-eve/	Russ Feingold has spent 18 years in the U.S. Senate, 28 years in elective office. The Democrat has never lost an election. Yet, in his bid for a fourth Senate term, against first-time candidate Republican Ron Johnson, Feingold is positioning himself as the underdog. To be sure, the latest Federal Election Commission reports -- for spending from Jan. 1 through Aug. 25 -- show Johnson outspent Feingold $4.55 million to $4.28 million. Feingold says Johnson, a multi-millionaire Oshkosh businessman, may wind up running the most expensive campaign in state history. We won’t be able to tally that up until after the election. But what about this claim by Feingold: "I've been outspent by my opponents every time I've run for U.S. Senate." Feingold has made the statement, or a variation of it, many times: In TV interviews on the night of the Sept. 14 primary, in a magazine interview, in an e-mail solicitation to supporters, in a blog post on his campaign website and on "The Ed Show" on MSNBC. So, is it true? The claim seems pretty straightforward, one candidate versus another candidate in each of Feingold’s three previous Senate campaigns. Indeed, when we asked the campaign to support Feingold’s statement, senior adviser John Kraus pointed to spending by Feingold and his various opponents -- not spending by outside groups, which would complicate matters. But here is the twist: Kraus said Feingold compares his campaign spending to the spending by all of the candidates in an election -- the Republican he faced head-to-head in each November contest, as well as major party candidates eliminated in the primary. Call it me-against-them math. For instance, in Feingold’s last election, he outspent GOP nominee Tim Michels by nearly $3.7 million in the two-year period before the general election, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. But Feingold tosses in what was spent by unsuccessful GOP primary candidates Russ Darrow and Robert Welch. By that measure, all of the GOP candidates spent $11.6 million -- more than the $9.24 million spent by Feingold alone. It’s a convenient argument, especially when you are using the "outspent every time" line in fund-raising appeals. But it also confounds logic. Michels, Darrow and Welch all sought the Republican nomination in 2004 -- just as Feingold was part of a three-way battle when he won the seat in 1992. In the 1992 race, FEC records show Feingold spent $1,979,488 -- the least among the other major candidates. In the Democratic primary, Feingold defeated Jim Moody who spent $2,828,211 and Joseph Checota, who spent $4,022,344. Feingold then defeated Bob Kasten, the Republican incumbent, who spent $5,427,163. Using Feingold’s me-vs-them math, everyone could say they were outspent. So is it possible that everyone spent the least and no one spent the most? Of course not. Mike McCabe, head of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign spending and lobbies for public funding of campaigns, said the average voter would think of the opponent as the head-to-head matchup. So let’s line the general election candidates that way, with their spending in the two-year period before the election. 1992: Kasten: $5,427,163 Feingold: $1,979,488 1998: Republican nominee Mark Neumann: $4,373,953 Feingold: $3,846,089 2004: Feingold: $9,239,908 Michels: $5,542,087 So Feingold was outspent twice, and in the third race spent nearly $3.7 million -- or about 67 percent -- more than his opponent. That’s not close by anyone’s math. (A footnote: While Johnson can tap his own wallet during the fall campaign, Feingold isn’t cash-poor. The latest FEC reports show Feingold had $4.3 million on hand, more than four times the $940,642 listed for Johnson.) So where does that leave us? In positioning himself as an underdog, and seeking campaign money from donors, Feingold says he has always been outspent by his opponents. Though that is true in two races, he uses some twisted logic -- and math -- to get there on the third, tallying up spending by Republican primary candidates he never faced to obscure that he vastly outspent the one he did. On Election Day, one Democrat faces one Republican. That’s the choice for voters. And that’s the approach we use. Tossing in the kitchen sink leads us to throw in a match.

pomt-00096	"Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions" under the Republican health care bill.	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/30/linda-coleman/linda-colemans-comments-seniors-and-health-care-ex/	As the midterm elections draw closer, Democrats across the country are narrowing their focus on a single key issue: health care. In North Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnston, Wake, Nash and Harnett counties, Democrat Linda Coleman has taken frequent aim at incumbent George Holding for his repeated attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. During a town hall in Wake County Friday, Coleman listed the many changes that would have taken effect had the GOP’s American Health Care Act of 2017, which passed the House before failing in the Senate, actually become law. One change she mentioned made our ears perk up. "Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions," Coleman said. The Coleman campaign pointed to an article from the AARP to support her claim. "George Holding voted for the American Health Care Act which, had it passed, would have made it so that seniors could be charged 5-to-1 for their premiums," campaign manager Mimi Wilson said in an email. Coleman, a former state representative, is not the first Democratic candidate to make this claim. In September, U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said she had voted against such a provision when she said no to the AHCA — a claim PolitiFact rated Half True. Before that, PolitiFact awarded another Half True to a health care advocacy group for claiming several Republican representatives had voted to let insurers "charge five times more for people over 50." As PolitiFact noted then, the AHCA did include a provision that would have permitted insurance companies to charge older adults five times more than younger people, as Coleman said. But Coleman’s statement omitted several caveats that would give a slightly different impression. And while the related statements PolitiFact previously checked focused specifically on people older than 50, Coleman’s claim mentioned "seniors" more generally, making it more sweeping. There is no precise age of a senior, but Merriam-Webster defines it as an elderly person. Before the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, older adults paid about four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults for the same coverage, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care. The Affordable Care Act changed the game by putting a cap on the amount that insurance companies could spike premiums for older adults. Under the new rules, insurers could charge older adults no more than three times the amount paid by younger adults. But Section 135 of the AHCA would have increased the cap so insurance companies could have charged some people older than 50 up to five times what younger adults had to pay. The same provision would have also allowed states to set their own standards. So Coleman has a point that Republicans tried to let insurance companies charge older Americans five times what they charged younger people. What she did not say, however, is that the Affordable Care Act already allows insurance companies to charge older people three times as much. By omitting this caveat, she may have led listeners to believe that the 5-to-1 ratio was a more drastic change than it really was. It’s also worth noting that the GOP proposal would have only affected older adults who had purchased insurance on the Affordable Care Act’s individual exchange market — another fact Coleman did not mention. Coleman also goes too far by saying "seniors" would be the ones impacted by the change. In fact, the 5-to-1 ratio would not have applied to the majority of seniors who get coverage from Medicare or to older people who get coverage through their employer. That said, the Republicans’ AHCA would have increased health care costs for older adults in another way, by replacing income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. The proposed tax credits for adults over 60 were only twice the amount adults under 30 would have received. This would have meant smaller credits for elderly people than under the status quo. According to AARP calculations, older adults making $25,000 per year would have earned tax credits that were 50 to 80 percent smaller, on average, than under current law. Our ruling Coleman said that under the GOP repeal bill, "Seniors can be charged five times what anybody else is charged for health care for pre-existing conditions." She has a point that the AHCA would have allowed insurance companies to charge adults between the ages of 50 and 64 up to five times what they charged others for the same coverage. But Coleman’s use of the word "seniors" is too broad and potentially misleading, and her statement omitted at least three key points: Under the status quo, insurance companies can already charge older adults three times what they charge younger adults. The bill’s provision would not have applied to seniors receiving their insurance from Medicare or older adults with employer-provided coverage, which is how most older people get their coverage. The bill’s provision would have let states implement their own ratios separate from the 5-to-1 default. Overall, Coleman’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-00326	"Special education categorical aid" from the state "hasn’t been raised in over a decade."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/20/tony-evers/evers-special-education-funding-claim-passes-test/	State schools superintendent Tony Evers, the Democratic challenger facing Gov. Scott Walker, has pledged to seek $606.1 million increase in funding for special education programs, which would bring funding for such services to $900 million by 2021. "School districts have a legal obligation to kids with disabilities, and they are required to provide those services," Evers said when he made the announcement. "That, in turn, puts pressure on the rest of the school budget. It’s time to change that momentum." States use different methods to allocate special education funds. Wisconsin is one of five that reimburse schools for the costs incurred for educating special-needs students. It is considered "categorical aid" -- that is, based on a category outside of the regular funding formula. According to a report from the state Department of Public Instruction: "This categorical aid is the state’s primary direct fund source to recognize the additional costs of educating pupils with disabilities. This critical aid program has widespread statewide impact providing funding for all pupils with disabilities, approximately 14 percent of Wisconsin pupils, providing equal benefit across all school districts." Evers’ request would more than double the state reimbursement rate for school districts’ special education costs, from 27 percent to 60 percent by 2019. "We’re going to add $600 million to special education categorical aid; it hasn’t been raised in over a decade," Evers said at a primary election forum broadcast Aug. 16, 2018, by WRRD Resistance Radio "Devil’s Advocates." Is Evers right? The evidence When asked about special education funding, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan entity considered the gold standard on state budget matters. According to the fiscal bureau, in the 2006-2007 budget, the number was just over $350 million. In every year since then, the total has been just under $369 million -- $368,939,100, to be exact. Abdur Chowdhury, Marquette University Department of Economics Professor Emeritus, said inflation in the U.S. from 2007-’18 averaged between 1 percent and 2 percent. Thus, he said, "in later years, you need to provide more nominal aid in order to be equal to real aid in the early years." So, to keep up with inflation, the $368,939,100 in fiscal year 2007 aid would have to have amounted to this much in subsequent years: 2008-’09 -- $381,741,700 2009-’10 -- $388,003,320 2010-’11-- $400,250,755 2011-’12 -- $408,533,744 2012-’13 -- $414,517,781 2013-’14 -- $421,242,038 2014-’15 -- $421,742,043 2015-’16 -- $427,062,373 2016-’17 -- $436,160,315 At the same time, the report notes that while costs have increased, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in special education enrollment since fiscal year 2007: 2007-2008 -- 124,520 2008-2009 -- 123,734 2009-2010 -- 123,412 2010-2011 -- 122,763 2011-2012 -- 121,881 2012-2013 -- 121,378 2013-2014 -- 120,698 2014-2015 -- 118,601 2015-2016 -- 118,923 2016 -2017 -- 118,209 That represents an enrollment drop of 5.07 percent from 2007-’08 to 2016-’17. The enrollment counts for 2018-’19 are not final, but they are expected to again decrease. So, all this raises a question about what has happened with the per-student average -- and whether that has kept up with inflation. According to the Department of Public Instruction, special education costs per pupil in 2008-’09 was $10,388, with the state on average paying $2,981, or nearly 29 percent per pupil. In 2018, the estimated cost per pupil is at $12,084, with the state on average paying $3,140, or nearly 26 percent per pupil. So, had the per-pupil amount being paid by the state kept pace with inflation, it would be an estimated $3,489.18 in 2018, not the projected $3,140. A DPI spokesman pointed out that the per pupil figures are just special education costs, and "those ride on top of regular education costs." The Walker team When asked about Evers’ claim, Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Walker education initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants and other avenues for special education students: In the last budget, the governor approved DPI’s request for Special Education Transitions Incentive Grants ($6.1 million). This program provides payment to school districts based on postsecondary education and employment for pupils with disability. The definition of postsecondary is a reference to any education beyond high school. Project SEARCH, a business-led collaboration that helps young people with disabilities gain and maintain employment through hands-on training and in-field career exploration. Project SEARCH is a national program developed in Cincinnati in 1996 and has grown to include programs in 42 states. In 2014, Walker signed legislation for a $35.4 million expansion to the Wisconsin Fast Forward worker training program, which included $850,000 to expand Project SEARCH sites in the state from seven to 27 over three years. Walker approved Special Education Transitions Readiness Investment Grants ($1.5 million). These grants fund transportation for special needs students to internships or work, training for school staff, and additional staff to support coordinating work experiences for special needs students with local businesses and organizations. Walker proclaimed 2014 as a Year of a Better Bottom Line to promote the employment of people with disabilities. Altenburg did not say whether he was arguing these programs more than make up for the lack of increase in the main aid program. In any case, Evers was talking about the main categorical state aid for education, and that is what we are focusing on here. Our rating Evers said "special education categorical aid" from the state "hasn’t been raised in over a decade." The Walker administration has launched several initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants for special education students, but the special education categorical aid continues to be set at nearly $369 million. Data shows a per-pupil increase in raw dollars paid by the state, from $2,981, or 28.6 percent, per pupil in 2008 to an estimated $3,140, or 25.98 percent, paid per pupil in 2018. But that increase is more than eaten away by inflation. And the state is paying a lower share of the cost per pupil. We rate Evers’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-05700	Says he "cut taxes by more than $600 million" when he was governor.	true	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/09/george-allen/george-allen-says-he-cut-600-million-taxes-governo/	Republican senate candidate George Allen says he has the will and experience to bring tax relief to Virginia families. "When I was elected Governor, we had an audacious agenda that naysayers said couldn’t be enacted with a Democrat majority in the state legislature," Allen said in a Feb. 23 guest column for InsideNova.com. "However, we worked across party lines and enacted historic reforms. Working together, we cut taxes by more than $600 million..." We’ll stipulate that Allen, who was governor from 1994 to 1998, did convince a Democrat-controlled legislature to pass major reforms to welfare, criminal sentencing and juvenile justice. But his claim of cutting taxes by $600 million, which Allen first made in his farewell address to the General Assembly at the end of his term, has gone largely unexamined. Until now. We asked Dan Allen, a spokesman for the Allen campaign, for proof. He sent us a list of more than a dozen bills and budget changes that occurred on George Allen’s watch as governor. We scoured economic impact statements for those pieces of legislation and searched newspaper archives to find monetary values for each item. Three of the biggest tax cuts were approved in 1994. *A Social Security income tax deduction for self-employed Virginians valued at $162.1 million over six years, according to a 1997 estimate of the Finance Department. The measure was introduced by previous Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, in his farewell budget. *A tax cut for senior citizens that the Finance Department valued at $215.7 million over six years. The action was tied to a settlement after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Virginia policy of taxing the pensions of federal retirees but not of state government retirees. The high court ruled the groups had to be treated equally. *A tax cut on the tangible assets of corporations worth $104.3 million over four years. The program was originally passed under Gov. Gerald L. Baliles in 1988 and slated to last for eight years. It was suspended for two years in 1992 under Wilder, who was battling a poor economy. Wilder, in his 1994 farewell budget, urged resuming the tax cut for the final four years and Allen, who came to office that January, agreed. Those three cuts add up to $482.1 million. In 1997, Allen signed a bill giving self-employed Virginians a break on unemployment insurance taxes that was worth $137 million over four years, according to the Finance Department document. The campaign also sent us a list of smaller tax cuts that passed when Allen was governor. We found their value by researching impact statements that were prepared at the time by the Department of Planning and Budget. Here’s the list: *Major Business Facility Jobs Tax Credit, 1994, worth $2.1 million over two years. *Coal Employment Enhancement Credits, 1995, totaling $33.2 million over two years. *Enterprise Zones, 1995, worth $2.8 million over two years. *Film Production Tax Exemption, 1995, worth $571,000 in two years. *Military Tax Relief, 1996, worth $600,000 in two years. *Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, 1996, totaling $1.25 million in two years. *Space Flight and Space Launch Activities, 1997, worth $1.35 million annually. *Worker Retraining Tax Credit, 1997, worth $2.1 million in one year. *Virginia Coal Employment and Production Incentive Tax Credit, 1997, worth $13 million over two year. The list from Allen also included the BPOL tax cut on the earnings of businesses. The local tax was estimated to generate $300 million annually. The legislation allowed varying tax reductions depending on the size cities and counties. We were unable to find a value for the BPOL cut and the Allen campaign didn’t have one. Dan Allen did not include this reduction in his $600 million calculation. "Localities had their own flexibility on this, so it would be hard to quantify," he said. They also didn’t include tax cut proposals from George Allen’s farewell budget in 1998, which news reports valued at $350 million. The major one, approved by the General Assembly, was setting aside $260 million to phase in the first two years of a car tax cut promised by incoming Gov. Jim Gilmore, a Republican. We should note that Allen also proposed a massive $2.1 billion package of tax cuts in 1995 that was opposed by the business community and defeated by Democrats in the General Assembly. And despite Allen’s tax cutting efforts, state spending rose at an average level for Virginia governors during Allen’s term. Our ruling: George Allen said more than $600 million in taxes were cut during his governorship. We came up with $676.1 million in cuts, although we should point out that some of these reductions took place over six years. Allen, however, never qualified the time period for the tax cuts. And he arguably could have added other reductions to his list. We rate his statement True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2012-03-09T10:28:02	2012-02-23	['None']
pomt-07806	"The Constitution doesn't allow the governor to not-spend appropriations funds."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/17/jd-alexander/senator-makes-point-about-rick-scotts-authority-ni/	When Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced he had decided to kill a high-speed rail line connecting Tampa and Orlando, legislators, local officials, union groups and others grumbled about Scott's timing and reasoning. Then many of them thought: Wait, can he even do that? After all, the Legislature created the Florida Rail Enterprise in 2009 to manage the construction of a high-speed line, and then budgeted $300 million in state funds to help build the project. The rest of the money -- $2.4 billion -- was coming from Washington. Following Scott's announcement on Feb. 16, 2011, Senate Budget Committee Chairman J.D. Alexander suggested Scott overstepped his authority in declaring the rail project dead. "The Constitution," he said, "doesn't allow the governor to not-spend appropriations funds." And there is $300 million appropriated for the rail line between Orlando and Tampa, Alexander said. Is Scott overstepping his Constitutional powers? Can the rail project be saved by state lawmakers? The fact that Scott said he would reject federal high-speed rail wasn't itself shocking. The new governor has long been critical of President Barack Obama's spending policies and approach to government. But the timing of Scott's announcement -- at a hastily arranged morning press conference -- sent lawmakers in Washington and Tallahassee scrambling. In Washington, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and members of Florida's Congressional delegation pivoted to see if another agency could receive the federal money instead and manage the rail project. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Thursday gave Florida lawmakers one week to see if they could work out a deal, but said that Scott would have to sign off on any agreement. In Tallahassee, lawmakers similarly were scratching their heads and wondering what's next. A veto-proof majority of the Florida Senate wrote LaHood asking for time to seek an alternative to keep the 84-mile-long rail project alive while suggesting that the state's Florida Rail Enterprise could manage the project without Scott's approval. State Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, suggested another option -- though in its infancy -- would be to create a public corporation that could insulate the state from potential cost overruns to build the train, or operational losses once the train is running. "We want to try to keep this alive," Simmons said. Scott vs. the Legislature As Simmons, Nelson and others work on one hand to circumvent Scott, they also continue to poke at the governor by saying he can't just do this unilaterally. The current state budget includes $131 million in high-speed rail development (line item 2094). That's part of the $300-million-or-so the state has pledged as part of the overall $2.7 billion rail project. Alexander's contention is that, without the approval of the Legislature, Scott must spend that money on high-speed rail. He has a point. State statutes prohibit the governor from "impounding" state funds -- meaning the governor cannot simply choose to not spend money budgeted. The governor has to veto a spending proposal, or accept it. And if he accepts it, he must spend the money for that purpose. The wrinkle in this case, of course, is that Gov. Charlie Crist signed the current budget, not Scott. But the budget is a law, which Scott is obligated to follow. Alexander made the same contention when it came to Scott's decision to sell the state two airplanes, saying the sale may have violated the law. The current state budget includes funds to maintain and operate the planes, and Scott just can't ignore the line item in the budget. Scott said the decision was completely legal. A second point: While most of the federal money for the rail project has not yet been awarded, some has. The state received $66.66 million in a federal grant in May 2010 to begin implementing plans for the high-speed line. Officials say about $26 million of that money already has been spent. "The bottom line is that he can't reject this money: It was already approved by another Legislature and another governor," Simmons said. "It's like trying to veto a bill after it becomes law. It's too late." Scott still holds most cards The money in play -- the $300 million in state funding and the smaller federal portion -- is peanuts when considering the entire $2.7 billion project. And that is where Scott has the upper hand, lawmakers, former state officials and transportation experts told us. He can veto future appropriations in the state budget, whether the source of the funds is state money or federal. If somehow, those vetoes are overridden, Scott can wreak havoc on rail plans in other ways. If a bond issue is required, he could try to kill the project through a vote on the Cabinet, or he could to hold up giving away the right-of-way to build the rail line. Or he could order his Department of Transportation secretary to fire people associated with the rail project. "He has the ability to direct agency heads and the ability to control expenditures that come into the budget over the next few years through a veto," said former state Sen. Dan Gelber, who was the Democratic candidate for attorney general. "If the governor's dead set on making it not happen, he can make it not happen." Even Alexander said the idea of rail is likely dead in Florida as long as Scott opposes it. "It may be a moot point when he's clearly trying to pull the plug," said Doug Callaway, president of Floridians for Better Transportation, a statewide transportation lobbying group. Though we think Alexander should have cited state statutes and not the Constitution, he is technically right that Scott is required to spend money in the state budget the way it is appropriated. That means the Legislature could play a game of chicken, forcing Scott to spend the $131 million in the 2010-11 budget, and maybe the remaining $170 or so million of state funds, and maybe even the $66.66 million in federal money. But getting him to spend the necessary money beyond that, all the federal and state money actually needed to complete the rail program, is a much taller order. And when it comes to the outcome of rail in Florida -- at least when it comes to the Florida Legislature -- that is today a much more important point. That's the context that gives Scott the upper hand. We rate this statement Half True.	None	J.D. Alexander	None	None	None	2011-02-17T19:46:17	2011-02-16	['None']

pomt-06532	Says that politicians who approved collective bargaining restrictions for public employees "exploited a loophole exempting themselves from Senate Bill 5."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/07/we-are-ohio/we-are-ohio-says-politicians-who-approved-collecti/	A statewide TV commercial urging rejection of Issue 2 tells viewers that rank-and-file public workers are willing to make sacrifices in order to reduce the cost of government while powerful politicians who make the rules are finding ways to avoid the pain. Issue 2 is the voter referendum on Senate Bill 5, a new law that reduces collective bargaining power for public workers and makes several other changes to Ohio’s collective bargaining law. If voters reject Issue 2 on Nov. 8, SB 5 will be repealed. We Are Ohio, backed by labor groups and Democrats, produced the commercial, which has been in heavy rotation lately. The commercial flashes an image of Republican Gov. John Kasich, an Issue 2 supporter, while a narrator describes the sacrifices politicians have demanded of public workers to help balance the state budget. "But those same politicians exploited a loophole exempting themselves from Senate Bill 5," the narrator says. The SB 5 referendum will be among the most watched elections this fall, so PolitiFact Ohio is committed to helping voters parse through the onslaught of campaign messages before election day. On its face, the statement is this commercial appeared flawed. For one, elected officials already were exempt from the state’s old collective bargaining law, which was passed in 1983 and replaced by SB 5. Secondly, lawmakers cannot raise or cut their own pay if they wanted to. They can only adjust the pay of future state representatives and senators. We asked the organization that produced the commercial, We Are Ohio, to explain how the politicians who passed SB 5 exempted themselves from the law. Melissa Fazekas, a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, said the exemption can be traced to page 32 of the 304-page bill. A citation also appears on the screen during the ad narrator’s claim, along with a written message that says, "Senate Bill 5 payment provisions: Do Not Apply to Politicians." Language on that page of the bill relates only to payment provisions within SB 5. The exemption -- for elected officials and certain other workers -- is from sections 124.14, 124.15 and 124.152 of Ohio Revised Code, all of which deal with a job classification plan the Ohio Department of Administrative Services sets for state workers. The plan, which lists various job titles and responsibilities, is tied to a salary schedule in Ohio law that gives automatic pay increases to workers based on seniority. SB 5 eliminates those increases and awards pay increases based on performance. But keep in mind, elected legislators already were exempted from that pay schedule. The other half of the claim, that "politicians exploited a loophole," underscores the commercial’s overall message, that state lawmakers used trickery to avoid playing by the same rules they’re forcing public workers to play by. But the exemption is hardly a loophole. Lawmakers already were exempt from existing laws relating to the job classification plan and collective bargaining. SB 5 alters those laws while keeping the exemptions for elected officials and others intact. Legislators’ salaries are set in state law. The Ohio Constitution prohibits lawmakers from in-term pay raises or decreases. Their current pay — a base salary of $60,584 with significant additional pay for leadership positions and certain committee assignments — was last adjusted in 2008, the final year in a series of increases that was part of a bill passed in 2000. As for benefits, state lawmakers already pay health insurance costs and contribute toward their pension in line with SB 5’s provisions. Medical coverage rates and required pension fund contributions for lawmakers mirror those of unionized state workers. Therefore, they typically pay at least 15 percent of their medical insurance premiums and, if enrolled, must contribute 10 percent of their salary to the retirement system. The claim in the ad does contain an element of truth -- legislators are exempted from several provisions of SB 5. But the portion of the claim that they’ve exploited a loophole leaves out important details that would give a different impression. Those details include that lawmakers have long been exempt from Ohio’s collective bargaining law, that they already pay the same percentages for medical and pension benefits as SB 5 would require and that their wage is set by statute. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression rates one way: Mostly False.

pomt-13280	Says Donald Trump’s tax plan gives the wealthy and corporations "more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton/clinton-right-trump-tax-plan-gives-more-rich-bush-/	With a backdrop of leaked lewd comments and Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual misconduct, you may not necessarily remember what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton said about tax policy in the deeply personal and nasty Oct. 9 presidential debate. When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most. "His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two," Clinton said. "Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift." Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump’s tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts? The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP. The evidence shows Clinton is right. The Bush tax cuts As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003, reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 (tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year). Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP, while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.) Trump’s plan Trump’s plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2 to 19.9 percent, according to the Tax Foundation, and deliver a tax cut equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Two key provisions in Trump’s latest tax plan, released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check. First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.) Second, Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He would also apply this rate to pass-through businesses, so-called because their profits currently "pass through" the business and instead are taxed as their owner's ordinary income. These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups, sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs) and corporations with less than 100 shareholders. In its analysis of Trump’s tax plan, the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass-through business rate to assess the plan’s impact on individual taxpayers. The Tax Foundation found that, depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent. Here’s a table breaking down Trump’s proposed tax cuts by income group: Similarly, the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the Urban Institute, estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income. The think tank also said the Trump’s cuts would amount to about 2.6 percent of GDP, with 50.8 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump. The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters: eliminating the carried interest tax break. Currently, profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 23.9 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 39.6 percent. Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about $18 billion over 10 years. While Trump’s plan calls for closing this loophole, it could also lower the tax rate since he’s proposing to tax pass-through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent — an 8.9 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted. Our ruling Clinton said Trump’s tax plan will give the wealthy "more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two." After-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased by 5.4 to 6.7 percent thanks to the Bush tax cuts. The same group would see incomes gains of 10.2 to 19.9 percent under the Trump tax plan, if not more. Measuring it in a different way, the top 1 percent received a tax break equivalent to 0.66 percent of GDP under Bush. Trump’s tax plan would deliver a cut equivalent to 1.32 percent of GDP.

pomt-15327	Says she "called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight" early on in the financial crisis.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-called-wall-street-regula/	Hillary Clinton has a reputation for being cozy with Wall Street -- but in her 2016 campaign, she’s been striking populist tones. Clinton introduced her plan for a variety of economic issues in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 14, 2015. As president, she said, she would go "beyond Dodd-Frank" -- the regulations on financial institutions that took hold in 2010, following the economic crisis of 2007-08. She said she had been calling for financial regulations since the very early stages of the crisis. "As we all know, in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up," she said. "I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight." Clinton used to be the senator from New York, the home of Wall Street. She has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and of delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of a bank break-up bill, the Glass-Steagall Act -- a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis. So we questioned Hillary Clinton’s record of addressing financial regulations. Did she address derivatives, subprime mortgages and financial oversight so early in the crisis? The 2008 primary campaign While the financial crisis came to a head in summer 2008, problems with housing started to bubble up in 2007 during Clinton’s ill-fated presidential primary campaign. On the trail, Clinton addressed these nascent issues -- particularly the mortgage crisis -- as early as March of that year. Clinton, still a senator at the time, delivered a speech on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market on March 15, 2007. She said too many people were ignoring warning signs. "The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street," Clinton said. "It's a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard-working families." She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures. In August that year, she delivered a similar speech about dealing with problems from subprime mortgages. There, she reiterated earlier proposals, and also suggested laws establishing national standards and registration for loan brokers, as well as regulations on lenders. "I think the subprime market was sort of like the canary in the mine," she said. "You know, it was telling us loudly and clearly, ‘There are problems here.’ " It didn’t become law, but Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies in September 2007. The first time she mentioned derivatives was in a November 2007 speech in Iowa. (A derivative is a financial product that allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations in an underlying asset.) "We need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products," she said. "You can't let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just don't work out. Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families, as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments. Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought." In the same speech, she spoke again of the risky lending that led to the subprime mortgage crisis, adding that she called on then-President George W. Bush to convene a conference to find a solution. And she also pushed for more oversight of financial markets: "So as president, I will move to establish the 21st-century oversight we need in a 21st-century global marketplace. I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent." This November speech angered some of Clinton’s Wall Street donors, according to the New York Times. At the tail-end of her campaign, in March 2008 -- still before the financial crisis hit a peak later that summer -- Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation. The plan included, in part, more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened some consumer protections. After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made noticeably fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. But the record shows that establishing policies to address the then-nascent financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008. Our ruling Clinton said she "called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight" early on in the financial crisis. The crisis hit a peak in summer 2008, though it started to gain traction in 2007. Clinton began addressing the subprime mortgage issue in her appearances in March 2007. Later that year, she took on derivatives. She also proposed specific plans for solving these problems and increasing oversight of financial institutions. Her statement is accurate, and we rate her claim True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-07-15T10:15:59	2015-07-13	['None']

pomt-10012	"Tens of billions of dollars (from taxpayer-funded bailouts) ... flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/20/mike-pence/tens-billions-aig-bailout-went-foreign-comanies/	Amid all the furor over retention bonus payments to AIG employees, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chair of the House Republican caucus, said another outrage in the AIG bailout saga isn't getting enough attention. "And the other unreported story today is tens of billions of dollars that flowed straight through AIG into the coffers of foreign corporations and foreign banks," Pence said in an interview on MSNBC on March 17. "You know, the American people are frustrated with this." To date, American taxpayers are $170 billion into AIG bailout as part of an effort to save the global insurance conglomerate from a collapse that many fear would have a catastrophic effect on the U.S. and global economies. But for months, AIG refused to say where that bailout money was going. Under mounting pressure from Congress, on March 15 AIG finally released the names of financial institutions that benefited from the rescue money. Although U.S. firms like Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America got the lion's share of payouts, the list also included a number of big foreign banks: Société Générale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany, which each received nearly $12 billion; Barclays of Britain, $8.5 billion; and UBS of Switzerland, $5 billion. In all, corporations in France and Germany got nearly $36 billion; and all foreign companies got nearly $60 billion. So Pence is right, tens of billions of U.S. taxpayers dollars certainly flowed to foreign corporations and banks. But what did people expect? asked J.D. Foster, a senior fellow in the economics of fiscal policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. AIG is a global company, indeed the largest insurance company in the world. Remember, Foster said, "the reason that AIG was taken over by the federal government was to prevent it from going into bankruptcy." It had a number of contractual obligations to both U.S. and foreign firms that it could not meet. "If (AIG executives) had made the decision that they were only going to pay U.S. companies, the foreign companies would have gone to court and put AIG in backruptcy," Foster said. "And the whole point was to keep them out of bankruptcy." "It’s understandable that people would be mad that taxpayer dollars would go to a place that you might not want it to go, to foreign corporations," he said. "(But) the only reason to give money to AIG was to close out its contracts. Some of those contracts are with foreign corporations." Pence isn't saying AIG should only have used taxpayer money to pay off obligations to U.S. companies. Pence doesn't think American taxpayers should have been paying for a bailout at all. Pence opposed the first rescue plan last fall, despite the urgings of President Bush and many key Republican leaders. Although a number of Republicans supported the bailout — enough for it to pass handily — Pence noted this week that a majority of Republicans in the House voted against it. "The American people have had it," Pence said in a news conference on March 17. "They want this Congress to get back to fiscal discipline and restraint and the belief that the freedom to succeed includes the freedom to fail. We have got to bring this country back, this business community back to the notion of personal responsibility and accountability for one's actions." There are reasoned arguments on both sides of whether Congress ought to have committed billions of taxpayer dollars to bailing out the troubled AIG. But the fact is, one of the consequences of infusing AIG with taxpayer cash to help it pay off its financial obligations was that tens of billions of that money went to foreign companies. We rule Pence's statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91ae1e1f-21f9-41b0-9651-a7a0a0813f96	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-03-20T14:39:35	2009-03-17	['None']
pomt-11699	Wisconsin's state court agency "basically" has rented the same office space across from the Capitol "since 1974."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/22/matt-adamczyk/one-wisconsin-state-agency-has-rented-space-same-b/	Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee, started a segment on his Dec. 15, 2017 show by bemoaning how much the State of Wisconsin "wastes" on rent for office space. He then introduced state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, a Republican notable for campaigning on a pledge to work to eliminate the position. Adamczyk, who was elected in November 2014, argued that taxpayers are "getting ripped off" by the state renting space near the Capitol building, rather than buying buildings or building new ones. Giving one example, Adamczyk claimed the state courts agency "basically" has rented the same office space across from the state Capitol "since 1974." He’s correct -- even if it’s not clear that his implication, that the state is wasting money, is on target. The space Steve Michels, a spokesman for GOP Gov. Scott Walker’s Department of Administration, and Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed that the Director of State Courts office has leased space across from the Capitol, in the Tenney Plaza building at 110 E. Main St. in Madison, since 1974. The landlord is Tenney LLC. The owner is Urban Land Investments Inc. It’s been a bipartisan pattern. That span covers the administrations of eight governors -- four Democrats (Patrick Lucey, Martin Schreiber, Anthony Earl and Jim Doyle) and four Republicans (Lee Dreyfus, Tommy Thompson, Scott McCallum and Walker). Adamczyk provided lease documents showing that the Department of Administration most recently renewed the lease in January 2017. It’s a five-year lease, for 57,215 square feet, that started in October 2017. The first year’s rent is $1.35 million. With annual increases of 1.75 percent, the lease payment for the fifth year will be $1.45 million. A few points before we close: Lang and Michels told us that a renegotiation for the current lease produced a 23 percent reduction in the rent there, saving about $2.5 million. Adamczyk hasn’t spelled out where in a state-owned building the courts agency might go, what the savings might be and what other issues would come with owning rather than renting. As part of a separate branch of government, the courts agency generally has the authority to choose its own office space, Michels said. Our rating Railing against the state leasing office space as being too expensive, Adamczyk says the state courts agency "basically" has rented the same office space across from the Capitol "since 1974." He’s correct, although he doesn’t offer evidence indicating there is a viable alternative for the agency that would save money. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02453	More than 80 percent of Georgians don’t support legislation to ease gun restrictions in houses of worship, in bars and on campuses.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/26/mary-margaret-oliver/opposition-gun-bill-slightly-less-stated/	The Georgia House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would increase the types of places where guns could be allowed, but one lawmaker said most Georgians don’t support the changes. "You are aware of the polling data that dictates the views of people in relation to this gun debate," Georgia state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said during a floor debate concerning House Bill 875. "You are aware 80 percent-plus people don’t support these bills and these measures." One House member who supported the legislation questioned Oliver’s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Oliver had accurately portrayed the people’s sentiments about the bill, or was she stretching the truth to win lawmakers to her side to vote against the bill. HB 875, written and co-sponsored by several Republican lawmakers, would lift restrictions on guns in houses of worship and bars, and allow school board members to arm themselves. It would no longer be a crime for licensed gun owners carrying a firearm on a college campus, where they are banned, under the legislation. Instead, the penalty would be a $100 fine. The bill does includes some restrictions, such as the mentally ill cannot get a gun license. Despite Oliver’s protestations, the House overwhelmingly passed the bill by a 119-56 margin. Like many contentious bills, the vote went along party lines, with nearly all Republicans voting in favor of the legislation and virtually all Democrats against it.The legislation is now in the hands of the Georgia Senate. Oliver said in her speech before fellow lawmakers that she asked people in her district how they felt about legislation that would expand gun rights in such fashion. Only 10 said they supported it while 156 said they opposed it. That, however, was not a scientific survey. Since Oliver’s district covers only a portion of DeKalb County, we wanted to know what information she had to support her claim concerning how voters statewide felt about legislation like HB 875. Oliver sent us a January poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that found 72 percent of registered voters statewide oppose allowing firearms in houses of worship, while 26 percent said they favored the idea. The remaining 2 percent either did not answer or were not sure how they felt about the idea. The question offered some interesting findings. Sixty-three percent of Republicans opposed the idea, while more than 90 percent of Democrats opposed it. A higher percentage of voters older than 65 were against the idea than those between the ages of 18 and 39. More than four out of five women said they were against allowing firearms in churches, while about 60 percent of men opposed the idea. The poll also asked how did people feel about allowing people to carry firearms on college campuses and in dorms. Seventy-eight percent said they oppose the idea. Again, it showed a higher percentage of women were against the idea than men. Again, it showed a larger percentage of older voters were against the idea than younger voters. Seventy-one percent of Republicans polled said they were against allowing firearms on college campuses. More than 90 percent of Democrats opposed the idea. The AJC poll surveyed 802 adults statewide between Jan. 6 and Jan. 9 on what issues Georgians want their Legislature to tackle in 2014. The margin of error for each response is plus or minus 4 percentage points. It was conducted by Abt SRBI of New York by live operators and included respondents via cellphone and land line. Oliver also sent us data from a poll conducted by Georgians for Gun Safety in 2010. It showed 76 percent of the respondents felt the state "definitely should not" allow anyone with a gun permit to carry a firearm into a house of worship. An additional 10 percent said Georgia "probably should not" allow gun permit holder to carry in a house of worship. The Georgians for Gun Safety poll also asked for the public’s opinion about allowing people to carry firearms onto a college campus. Sixty-four percent responded "definitely should not" while an additional 12 percent answered "probably should not." In 2013, Atlanta’s NBC affiliate, 11 Alive, polled Georgians on the topic. It found 64 percent thought it should "remain unlawful" for firearms to be carried into churches. Twenty-six percent supported the idea. Sixty-five percent of those who responded to the poll said the law should be illegal to carry firearms on college campuses. To sum up, Oliver said more than 80 percent of Georgians do not support measures like those proposed in House Bill 875. Most of the polling data we reviewed shows a majority of Georgians oppose firearms in houses of worship or on college campuses. But there’s not much data that we saw that surpasses the 80 percent mark. Oliver’s overall point that most Georgians oppose firearms in bars, on campus or in houses of worship is on the mark. But her specific percentage is too high, and she used the number to pursue a specific political point. We rate Oliver’s claim Half True.

pomt-11174	The Mueller investigation is "soon to be $20,000,000."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/23/donald-trump/mueller-probe-costing-20-million-donald-trump-says/	President Donald Trump has criticized the special counsel investigation headed by Robert Mueller on a variety of grounds. In a recent tweet, he took it to task for its price tag. On May 20, he tweeted: "At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption..." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet caught our eye, because it doubled his estimate of the Mueller probe’s cost from $10 million just five days earlier. Trump echoed a comment by one of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, that pegged the figure at $20 million. Is the Mueller probe really approaching $20 million? It does if you use the most aggressive accounting method. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Looking at direct costs only The Mueller investigation is being funded through mandatory spending, which essentially means it is set up to be free of executive branch influence. However, Justice Department officials do have a degree of oversight to make sure that money isn’t wasted, as with any other department office. Mueller’s office has released one accounting of its expenses so far. The report was released in December 2017, and it covered the first four and a half months of the probe, from May 17-Sept. 30, 2017. According to the report, the Mueller investigation spent $3.2 million directly during that period. The biggest category was $1.7 million for staff salaries and benefits, while the second-largest was for equipment. Smaller categories included travel, rent, utilities and supplies. If you prorate that amount out to a full year—the approximate length of the investigation at the time Trump sent his tweet — it would come to about $8.5 million spent so far. That’s well below the $20 million Trump cited. As it happens, Congress and the White House projects that the Mueller investigation will be racking up costs at an even faster clip than what has been reported so far. The special counsel’s office is officially budgeted for $10.4 million in direct costs for fiscal year 2018 (running from Oct. 1, 2017, to Sept. 30, 2018), and the Trump administration has earmarked another $10.4 million in its budget request for fiscal year 2019 (running from Oct. 1, 2018 to Sept. 30, 2019). If the investigation ends up spending at this pace, it’s possible that it could eventually surpass $20 million in direct costs. That would be speculative, however, because that would occur months in the future, and because we don’t know whether the investigation will keep spending money at the same rate. Adding in indirect costs Using a different accounting method, however, the $20 million projected cost isn’t implausible. A footnote in the report says that the investigation has also incurred $3.5 million in indirect costs, a category it says is "neither legally required" for disclosure nor reported in filings by previous special counsels. Mueller’s office argues that these indirect expenses don’t amount to additional taxpayer expenditures, since these resources — especially personnel, such as employees of the FBI or other agencies — would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation. However, if you do count the indirect expenses, the total comes to $6.7 million spent during those first four and a half months. Prorated to cover the investigation’s full first year, the total of direct and indirect expenses reaches $17.9 million. That's not too far off from $20 million. Here’s a summary of what’s been spent by, authorized for, and requested for the Mueller investigation so far: Fiscal year Start date End Date Direct spending Indirect spending Total spent Authorized (direct only) Requested (direct only) 2017 May 17, 2017 Sept. 30, 2017 $3.2 million $3.5 million $6.7 million $3.9 million -- 2018 Oct. 1, 2017 Sept. 30, 2018 Not yet reported Not yet reported Not yet reported $10.4 million -- 2019 Oct. 1, 2018 Sept. 30, 2019 -- -- -- -- $10.4 million How does the Mueller investigation compare historically? The investigation of President Bill Clinton over Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky — headed by Kenneth Starr and then by his successor, Robert Ray — cost upward of $52 million over half a decade. Another $40 million-plus went toward a handful of other Clinton-era independent counsel investigations. Meanwhile, the investigation of Reagan administration officials over the Iran-Contra Affair, headed by Lawrence Walsh, topped out at more than $47 million over a roughly similar period. Those figures are direct costs only, and are not adjusted for inflation. Their price tags would be far higher when converted to 2018 dollars. Our ruling Trump tweeted that the Mueller investigation will soon be $20 million. Officially, it’s not costing that much. Counting direct costs only, as Justice Department and executive branch accounting rules specify, the investigation’s first year cost an estimated $8.5 million, assuming Mueller’s team continued to spend at the same rate it did for the first four and a half months. (It could be months before we have updated figures.) However, with the addition of indirect costs, the first year would be expected to cost a prorated $17.9 million, which is within shouting distance of the $20 million Trump cited.

pomt-09973	The Republican Party has "21 percent party ID and shrinking."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/06/democratic-national-committee/republican-party-identification-shrinking/	Democrats are still celebrating over Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch from Republican to Democrat — and are mocking the Republicans about it. Their latest Web ad is a spoof of the television show Survivor , showing a parade of Republican leaders and asking, "Which one will win the battle for the heart and soul of the GOP?" The ad was inspired by an op-ed that Republican moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine wrote for the New York Times, lamenting what she sees as the Republican Party's hostile attitude to moderates. "It is true that being a Republican moderate sometimes feels like being a cast member of Survivor — you are presented with multiple challenges, and you often get the distinct feeling that you’re no longer welcome in the tribe," Snowe wrote. "But it is truly a dangerous signal that a Republican senator of nearly three decades no longer felt able to remain in the party." The DNC's ad starts with that quote, then shows a parade of Republican leaders identified by their first names. There's Mitt (Romney, former governor of Massachusetts); John B. (John Boehner, the House minority leader); Sarah (Palin, the governor of Alaska); Karl (Rove, political adviser to George W. Bush) and more. The ad concludes with Rush Limbaugh. The video is really just an effort to mock Republican leaders. But one checkable fact stood out to us: "21 percent party ID and shrinking," meaning that the GOP now has only 21 percent of the electorate, and that figure is declining. To find out the facts, we have to turn to polls for how people cited their party because some states don't require voters to declare an affiliation. Two nonpartisan polling organizations, the Gallup Polls and Pew Research Center for People and the Press, released polling data on party identification close to the same time the DNC ad was released. Gallup found 28 percent identified as Republicans, while Pew counted it at 23 percent. To broaden the picture, we turned to the Web site Pollster.com The site creates data models that aggregate many polls, with an eye toward more accurate results. The site lists an NBC poll at 20 percent and one from the Associated Press at 18 percent, but most are above the 21 percent cited by the Democrats. Using the range numbers, Pollster.com calculated an overall estimate of 26.4 percent. So the Democrats are cherry-picking the low end. The next question is whether Republican registrations are declining. The ad doesn't give a time frame. Both the Gallup and Pew polls show declines since roughly 2005. Gallup has recorded a decline in Republican Party identification from about 35 percent in 2005 to 28 percent in 2009. Pew showed a decline from 30 percent in 2004 to 23 percent in 2009. During similar time frames, Democrats have seen small upticks or been flat. Pew showed independents increasing from 30 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2009. So the DNC is right that the number of voters identifying themselves as Republicans has been declining. But 21 percent is from the low end of accepted estimates. So we rate their statement Mostly True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2009-05-06T16:22:52	2009-05-05	['None']
pomt-07113	State Sen. Alberta Darling "voted to add more than $1 billion in additional spending" while cutting programs such as education and health care	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/20/sandy-pasch/wisconsin-rep-sandy-pasch-says-sen-alberta-darling/	As Republicans moved to aggressively cut the two-year state budget in the spring of 2011, state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, praised the move to smaller government and no new taxes. Meanwhile, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, a Democrat from Milwaukee’s North Shore, fought against the cuts, in particular pushing to save funds for SeniorCare, the state’s drug assistance program for some residents over 65. Now Pasch is running in a recall election against Darling, co-chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Little surprise she would target Darling’s work on the budget, which makes controversial cuts in education and aid to local governments to close a more than $3 billion shortfall. Here’s the twist: Pasch argues the final product makes "a mockery of Senator Darling's claims of fiscal responsibility." "Voters in our district would be stunned to learn that all the while Senator Darling is talking about getting the budget under control, she actually voted to add more than $1 billion in additional spending," Pasch said in a campaign news release. Campaign watchers will see this claim repeated by Democrats in this summer’s recall elections. Already state Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo, has launched a similar attack against Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon. Indeed, both sides are working overtime to put their spin on the budget -- and doing it in some head-spinning ways. Democrats are hammering their rivals about all the budget cuts, while simultaneously criticizing efforts Republicans made to soften some of the cuts. Republicans are touting their fiscal responsibility but also want credit for adding back some spending to ease some of Walker’s proposals. Let’s look at Pasch’s claim of a $1 billion spending increase. Is it true? Pasch’s campaign pointed us to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s accounting of the work of the Joint Finance Committee. The committee, with members of both parties and both chambers, is the first stop for the budget, which won final approval June 16, 2011. The fiscal bureau scored it this way: The 2011-’13 budget approved by the committee with Darling’s support was $1.1 billion higher than the budget of former Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s including all state and federal funds in the budget, for a 1.8 percent increase. But there are other ways to look at it. The committee’s starting point was not Doyle’s last budget, as Pasch’s statement implies, but the newly crafted budget for 2011-’13 from Walker, who had built in a 1 percent spending increase. When you look at what the committee added compared with the Walker starting point, the figure is much lower -- $528 million, according to the fiscal bureau. That was possible largely because of revised revenue forecasts, that increased the amount the state is expected to take in. In any case, both the $528 million and the $1.1 billion figures are appropriate and commonly used, depending on what point is being made, said Bob Lang, director of the fiscal bureau. And Capitol reporters -- including those from the Journal Sentinel -- have long measured increases by comparing the new budget to the previous year’s budget. That’s the $1.1 billion difference. In the end, the committee did not go back to Doyle’s budget or even stay with the level of spending Walker introduced. So Pasch’s claim about the increase seems to be on target. But there is this caveat, unmentioned by Pasch: According to the fiscal bureau, $154 million of the spending increase stemmed from late-breaking estimates of higher enrollment in state Medicaid programs. The fiscal bureau itself suggested that add-back as an option. What about the second part of Pasch’s claim -- that Darling, while putting in "additional spending," backed major cuts in education and cuts to SeniorCare? This one’s a bit more complicated. Darling did back the Joint Finance Committee version of the budget that left intact the bulk of Walker’s plans. For example, local school aids dropped by nearly $800 million. So Darling supported most of Walker’s dramatic cutbacks. But she didn’t support them in total. It’s worth noting the cut in local school aids would have been $116 million higher but for action by Darling and her committee. And on SeniorCare, Darling and the Republicans bucked Walker and kept SeniorCare in its current form. The Pasch news release, though, hits Darling for cutting SeniorCare. In short: Some of the "additional spending" that Pasch attacks was more or less forced by events (the Medicaid piece) and some involved two issues where Pasch simultaneously criticized Darling for cutting back. Darling’s campaign estimated that about $140 million of the funds that Joint Finance added back to the budget went for things Democrats wanted restored. What’s the bottom line? Trying to turn Darling’s claims of fiscal austerity against her, Pasch contended that her opponent actually had voted for a budget that increased state spending by more than $1 billion. And that she did it while cutting key programs such as education and health care. The $1 billion figure is a real number. And Darling backed many major cutbacks. But Pasch’s statement needed some clarification and additional information -- including that some of the $1 billion went to ease the cuts in programs Pasch simultaneously accused Darling of gutting. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Sandy Pasch	None	None	None	2011-06-20T09:00:00	2011-06-14	['None']

pomt-06240	Says Barack Obama promised to halve the deficit in his first term.	true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/02/matt-mackowiak/Republican-consultant-Barack-Obama-promise-deficit/	Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak casts the 2012 presidential race as a tilt between Republicans for limited government and Democrats pushing expanded government. In an opinion article published Dec. 1, 2011, in the Austin American-Statesman, Mackowiak says President Barack Obama "has talked a good game about deficit reduction, but his actions have demonstrated a clear disregard for record deficits and our $15 trillion debt." And his piece includes this checkable claim: "Obama promised to halve the deficit by the end of his first term. He didn't." The annual deficit, meaning the difference between what the government is spending and what it’s raising from taxes and other sources, has grown on Obama’s watch. According to a White House historical table, the deficit was $458.6 billion in 2008, the year he won election. It reached $1.4 trillion in 2009, a year over which he and his predecessor, George W. Bush, both held budgetary sway. The deficit was nearly $1.3 trillion in 2010. And according to a November 2011 report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit was also $1.3 trillion for fiscal 2011, which ran through September 2011. And did the Democratic president promise to cut the deficit in half? Bingo. PolitiFact noted in a June 2011 fact check that Obama said at a "fiscal responsibility" summit at the White House in February 2009: "I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office." Obama continued: "Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." Earlier in his remarks, Obama said his administration had "inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit—the largest in our nation's history." After making his pledge, Obama said the budget he would soon propose "will look ahead 10 years and will include a full and honest accounting of the money we plan to spend and the deficits we will likely incur. To start reducing these deficits, I've committed to going through our budget line by line to root out waste and inefficiency." Obama went on to say he was intent on restoring pay-as-you-go budgeting and also ending the "payments to agribusiness that don't need them and eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq. We'll end the tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas," he said, "and we'll stop the fraud and abuse in our Medicare program." We rate Mackowiak’s statement True.

pomt-08870	Republican candidate for governor "Karen Handel has run a 100 percent negative campaign."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/04/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-karen-handel-running-negative-cam/	Once again, a contender in the Republican runoff for governor has launched a negative attack. The reason? His opponent has gone too negative, he said. The campaign of former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal of Gainesville launched its assault in a news release Friday. It said former Secretary of State Karen Handel has run "a 100 percent negative campaign. Not one all-positive mail piece or TV ad." The Handel camp disagrees. Portions of its mailers are positive, a spokesman said. The remainder are "contrasts" that accurately compare her with her opponents. Plus, Deal's campaign has done its share of attacks. The winner of the Aug. 10 runoff will go on to face former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, during the general election in November. So has Handel really run a "100 percent negative campaign"? Deal's camp produced four Handel mailers and two TV commercials as evidence. This item reviews each of them but does not assess whether the attacks are true. "Solid" Handel's campaign launched the "Solid" TV ad for the runoff against Deal. "One carries a purse," an announcer says over images of a green purse and Handel. "The other carries baggage," he continues. A black-and-white image of Deal appears next to a moneybag. Quotes about Deal using the words "corrupt" and "scandal" zip across the screen. At one point, it calls Deal "a corrupt relic of Washington, D.C." Negative. "Investigation Journal" This four-page runoff mailer looks like a magazine. The title "Investigation Journal" runs across its cover near a photo of Deal. "Nathan Deal's Corruption Probed," it says. "Back Room Deals, Million Dollar Payments and Resignation from Congress." The remainder reviews news accounts of accusations that Deal violated ethics rules. Negative. "Lipstick" This 30-second spot ran during the Republican primary. The attacks take place in the ad's first 12 seconds. "Three who have iffy ethics. One who wears lipstick," it begins. Three black-and-white smiles appear on the screen next to a pair of red lips. "Three who look after themselves. One who looks after you," the announcer continues. The black-and-white smiles transform into photos of Handel's opponents in the primary, Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, state Sen. Eric Johnson and Deal, next to a smiling pair of red lips. Negative. "Three Who Look Out for Themselves, Only One Who Looks Out for Us" The title of this four-page primary mailer is self-explanatory. It attacks the same opponents that she did in the "Lipstick" ad. A chart comparing the candidates says they all have ethics problems and were previously Democrats, among other things. Negative. "Fulton County's Own Karen Handel Stands Up Against Corruption ... While her Opponents are Politics as Usual" This four-page primary mailer attacks the same three candidates. Although two pages are mainly devoted to her campaign promises and records, the front and back covers are attacks on her opponents and accusations that they behaved unethically. Mostly negative, with some positive portions. "Georgia Conservative" This eight-page primary mailer, which also looks like a magazine, is mostly positive. The cover touts her conservative credentials, life story and business history. Two pages detail her personal, business and political records. Two discuss her platform. But the next two are once again attacks on Republican primary candidates that repeat accusations from other attack mailers. The back cover calls her opponents "good-ole-boys." Mostly positive, with some negative portions. So where does this leave us? PolitiFact Georgia asked Handel's camp for wholly positive mailers to counter Deal's claim, but it produced none. Her camp's defense is that what Deal's campaign said are negative attacks are actually "comparisons" between her and her opponents. Still, they are negative comparisons. So the Deal campaign's claim that none of her mailers or TV ads are completely positive is correct. Now labeling anything "100 percent" anything is trouble. Significant portions of two of her mailers are positive. In addition, Handel's campaign website, which the Deal campaign's accusation didn't mention in its claim, contains positive elements as well as attacks. Plus, Deal's campaign doesn't smell like roses. For instance, one TV ad, "How Can We Trust Karen Handel on Anything?", accuses Handel of telling "lies" about Deal but doesn't say what they are. A mailer accuses her of a "record of gay activism" that social conservatives would oppose. The claim that Handel has run "a 100 percent negative campaign" is an attack in itself. And the fact remains that both of Handel's TV ads are negative, and the majority of pages in Handel's mailers are focused on attacks. While Deal's campaign paid too little attention to the positive elements of her campaign, the overall impression its statement gives is true. Handel's campaign is negative. We rule Deal's accusation Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-08-04T06:00:00	2010-07-30	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-10793	"A lot of people don't know that 50,000 Americans now make their living off eBay."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/09/john-mccain/going-going--probably-wrong/	John McCain might be right, but we don't think so. McCain's campaign didn't return repeated calls and e-mails to confirm where the 50,000 number came from. But it clearly didn't come from eBay. "We're not exactly sure where he got the number. We don't even calculate according to the U.S.," said eBay spokeswoman Deanna Monestero. "I don't want to say it's wrong, but I can't trace it." The latest figures for the U.S. date back to 2005, when an A.C. Nielsen study revealed 724,000 Americans used eBay to make some money. But the survey didn't break down the number to figure out how many were just making a few bucks compared with the number making a living on eBay. Back in 2003, a similar survey found that 430,000 Americans made all or some of their income from the internet auction site. But once again, the survey didn't break down the "all" and "some" income numbers. That same year, Jim Griffith, who is eBay's so-called "dean of education" (who knew there was one?), was quoted in a Colorado newspaper as saying, "More than 20,000 people earn their living selling on eBay in the United States." But a company spokeswoman couldn't say where that number came from, either. These days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide. That number, based on a 2006 Nielsen study, is estimated at 1.3-million. But again, it doesn't distinguish between full-time and part-time on-line auctioneers. The bottom line: Lots of people make money on eBay, but how many depend on it to pay their bills remains unclear.

pomt-04639	"We just don't want to get to be like Louisiana, where you have drive-up daiquiri shops."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/13/bill-kennemer/are-there-daiquiri-drive-thrus-louisiana/	Oregon is a control state. Not only does the state regulate the consumption of all alcohol, but the state buys, stores and sells distilled spirits to retailers and consumers. That may change, with rumblings Thursday of a citizens’ initiative to loosen our uptight liquor laws if lawmakers don’t in 2013. Some legislators appeared reluctant to follow Washington state in privatizing liquor sales, as reported in a three-part series published in The Oregonian this week. State Rep. Bill Kennemer told a reporter: "We just don't want to get to be like Louisiana, where you have drive-up daiquiri shops." PolitiFact Oregon wondered if perhaps Kennemer had first-hand knowledge to back up his bold statement. Because anyone who’s grown up on the West Coast and has not traveled to the South knows there’s no such thing as ordering a cocktail to go, especially from behind the wheel. (PolitiFact Oregon knows someone who knows someone who tried to order a takeaway gin-and-tonic from a San Francisco bar but was rejected, even though the person was on foot!) It turns out, Kennemer did have direct knowledge. In an interview, he explained he was driving around the New Orleans area with his wife, Cherie, one recent summer and they kept spotting these signs for daiquiris. The signs were attached to buildings with drive-thru windows. Blended frozen daiquiris are made with rum, lime juice and sweetener and have the consistency of iced smoothies. They come in many fruity flavors, plus chocolate. "So after seeing this and being tempted multiple times," he said, "and thinking what in the world could this possibly be, we drove into one and ended up ordering daiquiris." PolitiFact Oregon: Did you order the drinks and then drive off? Kennemer (small voice): "I’m afraid we did." So there’s your evidence. Still, we understand that readers may want legal proof of proofed drinks to-go by vehicle, other than the word of a visiting legislator. For that, we contacted Jacques Berry, a spokesman for the Louisiana lieutenant governor’s office. Berry couldn’t tell us how many such drive-thrus dot the South Louisiana landscape, but he verified that a person doesn’t usually have to go far to find one. For locals, it’s a popular frozen treat on a Friday afternoon. "It’s not as much of a late-night thing," he said. And why the daiquiri, in particular? Well, Berry thinks it has to do with New Orleans bartenders mixing the ingredients that were plentiful and on hand, in this case, fresh fruit, rum and ice. The drinks caught on. Donnie Silva, owner of Big Easy Bachelor Parties in New Orleans, says he thinks the blended drinks are popular because of the climate. He was in Las Vegas recently when he says, "I really wanted a daiquiri. I guess it’s just the heat, we really don’t have a winter. Fifteen of the last 25 Christmases I’ve been in shorts and a T-shirt." Which is an utterly foreign concept to Oregonians. As foreign as the daiquiri drive-thru. (Technically, Louisiana does not allow open containers in vehicles. The way it works is that an attendant hands you a drink and a straw and what you do with those two objects is up to you. Also, in some states, you can buy packaged liquor and beer through a drive-thru window. ) We realize Kennemer is citing an extreme example, and that’s fine, but we should also remind readers that loosening our liquor laws won’t necessarily turn us into Louisiana. California has liquor stores that any kid can enter to buy a pack of gum. And still you can’t get a decent frozen daiquiri to go, by car, or a gin and tonic, by foot. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04791	Says U.S. Senate hopeful Tammy Baldwin voted for a $1 trillion stimulus bill that included a wasteful "$800,000 to replace light bulbs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/23/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-baldwin-voted-spend-800000-rep/	On Day 1 of Wisconsin’s general election contest for an open U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Tammy Baldwin got a scolding from a conservative advocacy group. "Big spending in Washington is terrible for Wisconsin’s economy, and Tammy Baldwin hasn’t helped," a Crossroads GPS TV ad began. "Tammy Baldwin voted for the failed $1 trillion stimulus, including projects like $800,000 to replace light bulbs." The ad includes an image of a standard-issue light bulb, the kind you might have in your living room, and goes on to rip Baldwin, a Democrat from Madison, for trillions being added to the national debt during her 13-plus years in Congress. We’ve heard a lot of claims over the years about stimulus spending. But a wasteful $800,000 for light bulbs? The stimulus bill Baldwin did vote for the stimulus package, known formally as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009. But it did not carry a $1 trillion price tag at the time. The 2009 estimate was $787 billion and later revised to $814 billion. Interest costs on additional debt will bring it over $1 trillion, but Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said it’s somewhat misleading to pin that figure on Baldwin. So the ad is a bit shaky on the big picture. Light bulbs Now let’s try to shed some light on the claim of a wasteful $800,000 in stimulus funds to "replace light bulbs." Crossroads GPS pointed us to a November 9, 2011, online story by WITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee that focused on stimulus-funded projects that, in the words of the story, weren’t "exactly stimulating much of anything." The story said the U.S. Department of Energy had "showered" the city of Racine with nearly $800,000 in stimulus money, which Racine used to replace street lights with energy efficient LED lights. But, the story said, only one unemployed electrician was needed to install the lights. So, while the ad leaves the impression these are ordinary light bulbs, that’s far from the case. As in many other U.S. cities, the Racine money came through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. At least 30 cities asked for more than $104 million in federal stimulus funds to help them change to LED (light-emitting diodes), replacing high-pressure sodium lights, USA Today reported in March 2009. Racine’s total grant was $795,000, but not all of it was for the street lights. A good chunk of it -- about $194,000 -- was for energy audits of homes and loans to residents who wanted to save money through weatherization and other energy-saving changes. Another $79,500 was for administration. A total of $521,500 was for the new LED lights, with about half for street lights and half for city government buildings, according to Kathleen Fischer, the city’s assistant finance director. So the Crossroads ad is off on the $800,000 claim as well. The installation did only result in enough work for one full-time electrician, according to Racine Mayor John Dickert. But there are a couple other aspects to this. First, Racine is saving 59 percent on energy costs thanks to the lights. That is projected to amount to about $40,000 a year. "It was money well spent," said Mark Yehlen, commissioner of Public Works. "We have realized significant savings." What’s more, one of the primary suppliers of LED lights for the Racine project was a Racine-area company, Ruud Lighting, that builds the lights. Ruud has expanded and added jobs while winning contracts to supply LED lights all over the United States to municipalities -- many of them using the federal stimulus dollars flowing through the Department of Energy’s block grant program. "BetaLED, a division of Ruud Lighting, Inc., is seeing a healthy boost in business as cities tap into their Recovery Act funds...", a Department of Energy news release said in April 2010. When Ruud was purchased by Cree Inc. in 2011 and announced job-expansion plans, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker praised the company and said Ruud would be eligible for up to $4 million in state tax credits. For years, many of the LED conversions involved lights mostly made in Asia, though the lights often were assembled in the United States, PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org found in previous fact checks. That was because the Energy Department initially felt insufficient components were available domestically. Ruud has won some contracts because it uses more American-made parts than other companies, according to news coverage in Pittsburgh, where it also won work, though not through stimulus funding. "These ads are really disappointing," said Dickert, the Racine mayor. "They are only telling half the story, if that." Our rating Crossroads GPS charges that Baldwin voted for wasteful spending through a "$1 trillion stimulus" plan, specifically citing "$800,000 to replace light bulbs." On both counts, the numbers are too high. While only one job was created to complete the project, city officials say it will save city taxpayers money every year and a growing local company got a big chunk of the contract to make the lights. They are in the midst of a hiring effort and have won stimulus-funded work all over the country. There’s an element of truth in that federal stimulus money went to buy light bulbs, but overall we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07828	"The alternative" to higher state worker pension and health care payments "is to look at 1,500 layoffs of state employees or close to 200,000 children who would be bumped off Medicaid-related programs."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/15/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-alternative-state-/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has rocked the state Capitol with a host of proposals that would affect state employees, including requiring them to pay more toward their pensions and health care. Those two moves, part of a budget repair bill introduced Feb. 14, 2011, would raise nearly $30 million. The Republican-controlled Legislature has the measure on the fastest of tracks, and could approve it in under a week. Raising $30 million would be a big step toward meeting a $137 million budget shortfall before the 2010-2011 budget year ends June 30, 2011 -- and help reduce a larger gap in the next two-year budget. In pitching his proposal for the higher pension and health care payments at a Feb. 11, 2011, news conference, Walker presented a stark picture of the options he has: "The alternative in this budget alone, in fiscal year 2011, is to look at 1,500 layoffs of state employees or close to 200,000 children who would be bumped off Medicaid-related programs." As governor, Walker certainly has the power to lay off state workers. But can he remove children from Medicaid, the state-federal program that pays medical bills for low-income individuals and families? To back up the statement, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie provided a Feb. 8 memo from the state Department of Health Services. It says spending $30 million over three months provides BadgerCare, a Medicaid program, to 194,539 Wisconsin children. That supports the numbers. But the memo says nothing about whether the state has the authority to cut kids from the Medicaid program. We asked Walker directly whether the state has such power. "Well, that’s what the equivalent would be," the governor replied. "That’s just one option. The more immediate one -- if I had to, I don’t want to do any of them -- would be the 1,500 layoffs. But that’s what the equivalent cost is." OK, we understand that removing nearly 200,000 kids from Medicaid would save $30 million over three months, but could the state do that? "Again, we just picked out numbers in terms of equivalent dollar amounts," Walker said. "I literally did not even go through the mechanics of that because I’m planning on doing what’s in this bill, not the alternatives." We looked at the mechanics by consulting several experts: Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families Joan Alker, co-executive director of Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families Kaiser Family Foundation, a national research organization that focuses on health care (memo) The Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s memo on Walker’s budget-repair bill They all agreed: The federal health care reform law that took effect in March 2010 prohibits states, until at least 2019, from changing their Medicaid eligibility requirements for children. In other words, states can’t take Medicaid away from kids who are receiving it. In fact, if a state did cut kids, it would forgo all federal Medicaid funding, according to a Center for Children and Families memo. That would be significant, as Wisconsin spent $6.7 billion last year in federal and state money on Medicaid for children and adults. "I think when you’re discussing how to balance your (budget) choices that you ought to make comparisons of actual options," Peacock said. Let’s review. Walker said that if his proposal for state employees to pay more for their benefits is not adopted, alternatives such as removing nearly 200,000 children from Medicaid would have to be considered. But that’s a phony alternative. Legally, the state does not have the option to remove kids from Medicaid; Walker acknowledged he did not check before making the statement. We rate Walker’s statement on Medicaid and kids False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-02-15T15:31:44	2011-02-11	['None']

pomt-07393	Says it probably costs more than $300,000 to run for a seat on the Pedernales Electric Cooperative board of directors.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/may/02/troy-fraser/state-senator-says-it-probably-costs-more-300000-r/	State Sen. Troy Fraser, who’s been in the thick of years-long tussling regarding the Pedernales Electric Cooperative, wants co-op directors elected from regional single-member districts. Pitching legislation mandating that change, the Horseshoe Bay Republican noted the expense of seeking election via at-large balloting open to the co-op’s entire membership. Fraser told the Senate Committee on Business & Commerce on April 19: "If you’re a person that lives, let’s say, in Marble Falls and you want to run, you’ve got to... solicit the support of 210,000 people, probably costing in excess of $300,000 to run for a co-op board, which is a little absurd." Ka-ching. Is his claim on the money? In an interview, Fraser pointed out that each of the seven Pedernales directors is elected by the co-op’s 200,000-plus members, spread across a 24-county region. In contrast, Texas House members represent about 139,000 residents each. Fraser told us his cost estimate presumes a board candidate would send at least one mailing to every co-op member, at a minimum cost of $1 per recipient so a single mass mailing would cost more than $200,000. He said candidates also spend money on items such as websites. But what do campaign spending reports for Pedernales director candidates show? Turns out there are none. The state does not require them because the co-op is not a government entity. For his part, Fraser referred to Texas House candidate campaign spending tallies indicating that into October 2010, the least costly winning House campaign had cost about $296,300.The most costly campaign--which did not end in victory--had cost more than $1.2 million. Fraser drew the spending figures from a Texas Tribune chart published in November. The chart, limited to candidates in contested races, totaled spending from July 2009 through Oct. 23, 2010 -- hence understating how much candidates likely spent through the November general election. And according to the chart, Nueces County Republican Raul Torres spent $296,284 through Oct. 23 on his way to victory while Democrat Patrick Rose of Dripping Springs spent $1.2 million in his re-election try. Using the same chart, we later identified more than 50 House winners who spent less than Torres through Oct. 23, though many of the lightest spenders faced only third-party challengers. Re-elected GOP Rep. Susan King, on her way to besting a Libertarian and Independent, spent the least: $30,995. Among victors with major-party opponents, Republican John V. Garza, who unseated Democratic Rep. David Leibowitz, had spent $72,583. When we inquired into the cost of past board campaigns, PEC spokeswoman Anne Harvey encouraged us to contact candidates directly. We emailed or left telephone messages with the 13 candidates for two board seats last year, asking how much they spent on what. Among defeated hopefuls, Ken Rigsbee saId he spent $2,700 of his own money traveling around, Dan Pedersen said he spent around $1,000 on yard signs, T-shirts and advertising and Ted Lehr said he spent less than $500. At the low end, Thornton Keel said he spent a small sum to buy a list of co-op members. Geoffrey Vanderpal and Bob Driscoll each said he spent no money. More detail from losing candidates:: --Steven Carriker said he spent $2,000 almost exclusively on newspaper ads. He said too that a group that backed him, Clean Water Action, sent out 4,000 postcards, perhaps costing $2,000. David Foster, state program director for Clean Water Action in Texas, told us in an interview that for the annual board races in 2008 through 2010, the group spent $15,000 on postcards listing its preferred candidates that were mailed to the group’s 7,000 members in the co-op's service area. It also reached members electronically and by phone. Carriker said he doesn’t think a shift to 30,000-resident districts, as Fraser proposes, would change much: "I recognize (due to first-hand experience) the formidable task of communicating successfully with 200,000 other members, (but) it is hardly a less formidable task to communicate with even one-seventh that number." --Joe Summy said: "I had little money, less than $3,000 and had to depend on volunteers and word of mouth." As for Fraser’s $300,000 figure, he said, "I have no way to confirm that number." Summy’s email continued: "However, unless a candidate has the backing of special interest groups and/or political parties the common candidate has little chance of winning....especially when only 10-12 percent of the (co-op) members vote. in the 2010 races, 20,727 co-op members voted, according to results made public by the co-op at the board’s June 28 meeting. "The PEC area is over 8,000 square miles. Five of the six candidates have won" in elections since 2009 "because they had the support of various special-interest groups" which "want to maintain the at-large system because any candidate with their support has a tremendous advantage," Summy said. "The system now has been established to keep a certain elite in power." As for successful candidates: --Chris Perry, who won the District 4 seat, said he spent less than $1,000 of his own money, mostly for a website, leaflets and travel. He said he did not seek or accept donations, but fielded endorsements "from a variety of individuals and organizations but I have no idea what they may have spent or what they may have done to support me, other than notifying their friends or members of their endorsement." Perry said: "I don’t know anyone who would" spend $300,000-plus. "It would be an outrageous amount of money to spend on a cooperative board election." --Ross Fischer, who won the District 5 race, said he spent about $4,200, or less than $1 for each of the 4,824 votes he drew "to communicate directly with PEC voters in order to overcome a coordinated effort to control" the board. He said in his email that Fraser "is right that it is cost prohibitive to reach (all) PEC voters. A candidate must be willing to spend money in order to compete with the special interests who want to raise rates in order to finance an environmental agenda. Single-member districts would make it financially feasible for an average ratepayer to run for the PEC board, and would increase meaningful communications between members and their board." Fischer and Summy both referenced a Feb. 15 letter to board members from the steering committee of PEC4U which describes the group’s formation four and a half years ago as a "loose-knit organization and website" that initially wanted whose "initial motivation was "to encourage PEC to reduce fossil fuel use and make renewable energy and conservation programs available to all PEC members. We quickly learned that no real change would come about without substantial changes in PEC's governance and board election process." The letter also expresses pride in the group’s recruitment and backing of candidates in the last three board elections. "You are all directors whom we endorsed and helped get elected," the letter says. "We feel that our close relationship with the press, as well as with Clean Water Action and Public Citizen, played a key role in those elections." At Public Citizen’s Texas office, researcher/organizer Andy Wilson told us that group does not endorse Pedernales board candidates but encourages voter turnout. Wilson said it has taken no position on whether co-op members should elect the board from single-member districts. Next, we asked PEC4U steering committee members about their expenditures. They replied that the group never has had a political kitty and has not made candidate donations or campaign-related expenditures. "We have no hidden deep pockets and have not spent money on campaigns," said committee member Sue Barnett. However, steering committee member John Watson said, the group has "engaged in emailing, phoning and personal contact" with co-op members. Member Bill Christensen said: "Though some individuals may have spent a few dollars here and there to make photocopies and such, PEC4U itself does not spend any money - it doesn't even have a bank account or any legal status. It's a very loose organization." Member Ric Sternberg said: "My out-of-pocket expenses have been about $30/year for (web) domain renewal fees since 2006 or 2007 . . . I think we may have also donated some poster board and toner and paper for our printer." Summing up: Of 10 candidates who responded to our inquiry, only one said he spent more than $4,000; others said they spent from nothing to $3,000. We circled back to Fraser, who said his original "offhand remark" reflected what it would cost a typical resident to beat a foe backed by PEC4U and Clean Water Action, which along with Public Citizen he called "the machine." Noting that only the well-prepared Fischer has bested such a candidate since the groups started influencing co-op elections, Fraser said: "I’m not sure if it’s $300,000 or $50,000 or $1.2 million... Under any scenario, if you’re going to contact 210,000 people, it’s expensive." Our final analysis of Fraser’s cost declaration: Get out. We see no reason for using any Texas House race as a guide to estimating the costs of seeking a board seat. And the responses we got from most of last year’s candidates suggests there’s no basis for pegging the costs of such campaigns anywhere near $300,000, which is more than 60 times--60!--the most that anyone told us they spent. The statement is so inaccurate, it smokes. Pants on Fire.	None	Troy Fraser	None	None	None	2011-05-02T06:00:00	2011-04-19	['None']

Undergraduate students in law, business and economics pay over 80 per cent of their course fees. Most postgraduate students pay their full course fees, as do most students enrolled at non-university higher education institutions. And there is more to the cost of higher education than course fees. Looking only at domestic undergraduate students at public universities, the Government would be justified in saying it subsidises more than half the fees per student on average. In addition, the taxpayer contribution to average costs includes carrying HECS or HELP loans from the Government that are not repaid by students. But it cannot be said that the Government subsidises more than half "the cost" of "each student's" higher education.

pomt-06957	Says $500 billion in Medicare cuts are coming.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/17/lois-kolkhorst/lois-kolkhorst-says-obama-administration-cutting-m/	Defending her own health care measure, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst answered a colleague’s query about preserving insurance for the elderly of Texas by warning that national cuts loom. The Brenham Republican, who chairs the House Public Health Committee, said during June 15 floor debate: "We know they are reducing the entitlement to Medicare." She added: "We know that we have these cuts coming our way of over half a trillion to Medicare." We do? Some background: PolitiFact teams in Washington and other states have pointed out that it’s incorrect to deem reductions in the growth of Medicare spending, written into the federal health care overhaul signed into law last year by President Barack Obama, as cuts. These reductions are being counted as projected savings compared to what would have happened without the change in law. The program’s overall costs are projected to increase to $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in 2009, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Also, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, tagged Obamacare by critics, doesn’t eliminate benefits. Indeed, portions of the law improve benefits and coverage, according to Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit health care research organization. Medicare will cover more preventive health care services, such as wellness visits, and recipients won't face the "doughnut hole" gap in prescription coverage imposed under an existing Medicare program. Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund other coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, Neuman has said. To back up Kolkhorst's claim, which was brought to our attention by Democratic activist Phillip Martin, her office passed along a September 2010 Wall Street Journal opinion piece quoting Richard S. Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, outlining intended cuts in payments to medical providers and hospitals as well as reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage, an optional program where the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare recipients. It was hoped that competition between private insurers for Medicare Advantage programs would drive down costs and make the system more efficient, ultimately saving the federal government money. But it has not worked out that way. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than traditional Medicare. The 2010 health care law will phase out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The law also calls for slowing increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. Also, the law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, though the board — the Independent Payment Advisory Board — is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Kolkhorst’s office pointed us to the Medicare actuary’s April 2010 analysis, which includes a chart suggesting that through 2019, the new law will net Medicare "savings" of $575.1 billion. It also says that 60.5 million Americans will be covered by Medicare in 2019, the same number that would have been covered without a change in law. Foster’s memo says the Medicare savings are to be achieved largely through reduced payments to medical providers including hospitals, tied to raised productivity expectations. It warns, though, that those gains are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis and would also probably prove unworkable and less than projected in some health-care sectors during the law’s roll-out. Moreover, his memo says, health care providers "for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their business could find it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries)." It says its own simulations suggest that about 15 percent of providers in the Medicare program specific to inpatient care in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as hospice care and home health services would become unprofitable by 2019 due to the productivity provisions. Kolkhorst’s chief of staff, Chris Steinbach, suggested the projected reductions in rates are tantamount to cuts in Medicare. He said by email: "If there is an entitlement for everyone eligible to receive a pizza, and we are cutting the rate paid to pizza kitchens by x percent, then there will be less of that entitlement for pizza." Similarly, Kolkhorst told us the changes built into the 2010 law will reduce access to Medicare. "You’re splitting hairs to say those are savings; they’re cuts," she said, adding: "Things are going to change ... To say that everything is going to remain as it is today, that’s erroneous." That last point seems reasonable, but it’s not exactly what she told her House colleagues. The referenced $500 billion figure depends on a slowing in the pace of Medicare cost increases. That’s not the same as cutting back. Medicare spending will still grow; benefits will expand. Still, there remains the prospect of some providers quitting Medicare, possibly making it harder for patients to get care. Kolkhorst’s statement has an element of truth, making it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03541	Says 70,000 children "have lost their Head Start slots" because of the sequester.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/may/28/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-sequester-has-caused-70000-childr/	Faced with complaints about airport delays being caused by the sequester, Congress last month halted a furlough of air traffic controllers that had been part of its budget-cutting agreement. U.S. Sen Mark Warner, D-Va., recently wondered why members of Congress -- frequent fliers, themselves -- haven’t shown the same urgency to protect disadvantaged 3- and- 4-year-olds who also are being hurt by the spending cuts. "Everybody gets up in arms when people have to wait to get an airplane ride and Congress acts immediately because that’s visible," he said during a May 14 interview on WHRV-FM in Norfolk. "What’s not visible is the 70,000 kids who have lost their Head Start slots..." For several years, Warner has been seeking a bipartisan solution to the nation’s budget stalemate that includes spending cuts and tax increases. He has called the sequester, which began triggering automatic cuts to defense and domestic programs on March 1, "the most stupid option on the table." During his recent radio interview, he also lamented sequester-caused reductions in federal grants for college students and research at the National Institute of Health. We were struck by his claim that 70,000 children have lost access to Head Start, an educational program that prepares disadvantaged kids to start elementary school, and decided to see whether Warner is right. More than a million children -- from families that live below the poverty line or receive public assistance -- are enrolled in Head Start half-day or full-day programs. The federal government offers competitive contracts to public and private providers, so many groups may offer Head Start programs in a locality. As PolitiFact Florida recently noted examining a similar claim, Head Start enrollment hit record highs in recent years because the Obama administration nearly doubled the number of children eligible for Early Head Start, which serves eligible children up to the age of eligibility for Head Start. Congress then decided to spend more money on Head Start to maintain enrollment for those children. A month before the sequester began, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sent a Feb. 1 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee detailing cuts to programs under her purview. Among them, she wrote, "up to 70,000 children would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start services." Warner’s statement went a step further, saying 70,000 children "have lost their Head Start slots." When we asked his office for an explanation, spokesman Kevin Hall emailed us two news releases and two news articles about the sequester that were written after Sebelius’ letter. He included a Feb. 8 White House fact sheet on the harm of the sequester. At the top of the list, it said "70,000 young children would be kicked off Head Start …" Hall also sent news articles written by NPRand Education Week and web postings from the National Head Start Association -- a group of the agencies that run local programs -- that, in varying ways, say a reduction of 70,000 Head Start slots may or will happen. Annual funding for Head Start is being cut by 5.27 percent. HHS spokesman Ted Froats said Sebelius’ estimate of losing up to 70,000 spots hasn’t changed. But he also said HHS does not know how many children have been dropped since the sequester began and that the agency is gathering that data and hopes to release a report in June. Each local program across the nation has the flexibility to determine how it will adjust to its budget cuts and news reports say many are exploring solutions that don’t involve reducing enrollment, such as switching from a full-year to a nine-month program, closing one day a month, or fundraising. For Virginia, the White House estimated that up to 1,000 children would lose Head Start or Early Head Start services before the end of the year. But state officials don’t yet know what the results will be. Maxine McKinney, executive director of the Virginia Head Start Association, wrote in an email that she thinks most state programs so far have been able to maintain programs because the sequester did not begin until well into their budget year, which runs from the start from July to the end of June. But she hasn’t received figures yet on how the local programs will cope with the coming budget year. "Many programs are reducing enrollment," she said. "Others are able to absorb the cuts by eliminating non-mandated services, reducing staff, etc." Of the 21 programs she’s heard from so far, 10 are reducing their slots by 263. But the 21 programs accounts for fewer than half in the state. Our ruling Warner said 70,000 children have "lost their Head Start slots" because of the sequester. He strains the limit of an Obama administration estimate that "up to" that number of children may lose out. There’s no doubt that many children will lose Head Start spots as the budget cuts sink in, but at this point, nobody knows how many already have. HHS is gathering that information. The White House estimate assumes that local Head Start organizations will respond to funding cuts by reducing slots, but that isn’t the only option. Many organizations are exploring different options, such as fundraising and reducing hours. Warner’s statement contains an element of truth in that some children already have lost Head Starts slots and others have less access to the program. But by and large, he assumes that a worst-case scenario for Head Start has already taken place. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-02175	David Perdue supports Common Core	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/29/david-perdue-files/common-core-claim-doesnt-make-grade/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue is now on a list that shows he’s truly arrived in politics -- he’s the subject of a website attack. It’s called "The David Perdue Files," and it accuses the political newcomer of being a RINO -- Republican in Name Only -- with "liberal positions and establishment ties." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column brought the website to our attention with a post about it. The website included several "facts" about Perdue. One caught our attention, since it’s an issue that many conservatives have been as strident in their opposition to as the federal health care law, aka Obamacare. "David Perdue supports Common Core," it says. True? The website cites a Marietta Daily Journal interview with Perdue done in February. The article, though, offers some context that’s not offered on the web post about the candidate. The people who put the website together haven’t identified themselves (the website’s author is Truth Be Told), so we couldn’t talk to them about it. Perdue is part of a crowded field of Republicans running this year for an open seat in the U.S. Senate. The current senator, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican, is retiring. Perdue, a former CEO of several larger companies and a cousin of former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, has risen to the top of some polls and, thus, become a target of his opponents and others leery of some of his positions. The Republican Party primary is set for May 20. The campaign for the GOP nomination has largely been a contest among the candidates to prove who is the most conservative. On one issue, Common Core, the candidates have largely spoken against it. The anti-Perdue website, though, says he supports it. If true, it could mean trouble for Perdue. Common Core is a set of educational guidelines aimed at creating uniformed standards for student proficiency in several subjects. They were created by governors and education officials and adopted in nearly every state. Sonny Perdue helped spearhead the effort and has said it was a way to prevent the federal government from interfering in state education policies. The Common Core standards were released in June 2010 with the support of the National Governors Association and other groups. "We felt like we needed to take steps as governors to actually prevent a federal mandate that came in this area. We saw No Child Left Behind as somewhat of an intrusion in state business," the former governor said in a 2013 Washington Post interview. "We didn’t want another federal mandate that came in and said: ‘Here’s what your state looks like compared to Switzerland’ or wherever." The Common Core plan was adopted by Georgia GOP leaders in 2010. This past June, however, the state Republican Party voted unanimously to urge state leaders to withdraw from the program because it "obliterates Georgia's constitutional autonomy." Tea party leaders and others say Common Core was adopted with little debate, and they worried it would be a federal takeover of education. The Obama administration has awarded extra points in its Race to the Top funding program for states that have worked to create common college- and career-ready standards. The Republican-led state House of Representatives passed legislation this year to create a study committee on Common Core and the federal government’s "increasingly greater role in public education." David Perdue, whose wife and parents were teachers, said he has talked to his cousin about the issue. "The original intent, I agree with that. It’s where it gets into the details, into the weeds of how it’s going to be administered, that’s where I have a problem with that," Perdue said in the Marietta Daily Journal. The candidate said Georgia should determine how it sets its standards, and the newspaper reported that Perdue said he agrees with Gov. Nathan Deal’s position opposing the testing component of Common Core. Perdue made similar comments in an interview posted on YouTube. The candidate said he didn’t have a problem with Common Core’s original intent. "When they start trying to legislate and dictate curriculum and that sort of thing, and that includes how you measure up in the test, I have a major problem with that," he said. "I’d really like to get the Department of Education out of this and get that money back to the states and put the power back into teachers and parents, which is where it belongs." Some conservatives question Perdue’s explanation. Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator and radio show host who has endorsed former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel in the Senate race, asked Perdue about his comments in the Marietta Daily Journal. Perdue said Common Core had gotten "convoluted" when the federal government got involved. His campaign said Perdue supports what was put together by the National Governors Association. "I want to clear the air. I think Common Core is overreaching right now and should be abandoned in its current form," Perdue said in a radio interview with Erickson on News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB. News 95.5 and AM 750 WSB is owned by Cox Enterprises, which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey told PolitiFact Georgia that the candidate believes "Common Core has become overreaching and should be abandoned." Dickey called The David Perdue Files "a crass, politically motivated effort to misrepresent many of David’s positions." Judging from The David Perdue Files website, Perdue has not convinced some conservatives about his position on Common Core. To sum up, a website claimed Perdue "supports Common Core." Perdue has said in several interviews that he believes in the initial intent of Common Core as a means of states setting their own educational goals by what was proposed by the National Governors Association. Perdue, though, has said he is concerned about federal involvement in the effort. The website is correct on some level. Perdue did initially support the concept of Common Core, like many other Republicans. But he has made it very clear he has soured on the details and now opposes it. There is a kernel of truth here, but just a kernel. We rate the website attack on Perdue as Mostly False.	None	The David Perdue Files	None	None	None	2014-04-29T06:00:00	2014-04-21	['None']
pomt-06907	The 2011-13 state budget "cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/25/jennifer-shilling/wisconsin-jennifer-shilling-state-budget-cut-publi/	As the historic Wisconsin Senate recall elections drive toward their end, Democrats are working overtime to highlight what they consider lowlights in the Republican-drafted state budget. Cuts to public school funding are near the top of their list, with a chorus of critics repeating an eye-popping figure: $1.6 billion. One recall candidate, state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), complains on her legislative website that the Republican budget "cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion statewide..." Shilling is trying to unseat state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse). Did the two-year budget really take that big a bite out of schools? Shilling and Democrats point to statements by state schools Superintendent Tony Evers and a report by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Evers is an elected official who runs the state Department of Public Instruction. Both present the $1.6 billion figure -- but do it in tandem with a second, much lower figure of $800 million to $900 million. Here is an important note: Shilling’s claim of $1.6 billion relates to the new revenue limits the budget put on local school districts. (Shilling is also critical of the cut of $792 million in direct state aid to schools. That’s been the subject of TV ads against the GOP senators, the cut of "nearly $800 million." But that cut is separate from the $1.6 billion claim we are looking at here. Shilling’s office acknowledges that point.) This may all sound arcane, but ultimately the revenue limits determine how much your schools can take in from local property taxes and state school aids -- and how much money gets into the classroom. Let’s look back in time to figure this out. As they worked to close a big budget shortfall projected for 2011-’13, Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature cut direct state aid to schools (the $792 million). Then they greatly restricted schools’ ability to raise property taxes to make up for the lost aid. The goal was to be sure a savings at the state level was not eaten up by higher local taxes. It was not the first time the state squeezed school aid. In 2009, Gov. Jim Doyle and Democrats who controlled the Capitol enacted an aid trim in the 2009-’11 budget. They also slowed the growth in how much schools could raise in property taxes. But the Dems left a little gift for schools. They wrote into state law a provision on the property tax limits. They directed the next Legislature to re-set the revenue limits in the 2011-’13 budget to what they were before they were tightened. Think of it as your boss promising you a catch-up raise in writing two years from now … even if it’s not certain your boss will be around then. Indeed, Doyle did not run again, many of the Democrats are gone and the the party lost both chambers in the November 2010 election. And the new bosses, Walker and legislative Republicans, turned to school cuts to help balance the budget. They also agreed that they couldn’t accept the Democrat-set limits, and they put in place a real cut in both state school aid and allowable property tax growth. Now, back to the future. Today, Democrats such as Shilling are saying the budget "cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion." That is, schools can take in $1.6 billion less over two years as a result of the revenue limits. They get that by comparing the stricter limits enacted by the GOP to the increase Doyle and the Democrats had built into the budget for 2011-’13. But that can be a skewed way to measure a cut. Actual school spending from one year to the next will not go down $1.6 billion. The year-to-year comparison gets you to the smaller number -- an $800 million to $900 million-plus loss of potential resources for schools. Two education financing sources we turned to -- Russ Kava of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau and officials at the state Department of Public Instruction -- said their agencies choose to present both perspectives. They said they did this because of past practice and the value of showing both the actual impact as well as the larger swing from the Democrat-desired limits to the new budget. A May 31, 2011 statement from Evers put it this way: "Last week the Joint Finance Committee, on a 12-4 vote, cut public schools by $1.6 billion compared to current law and over $850 million compared to current levels by making the first significant reduction to revenue caps ever." In making her case, Shilling, as well as fellow Democratic recall candidate Shelly Moore in River Falls, cherry-picks the higher number. There are a couple of problems with that. One is that when you look at what the state budget actually saved on K-12 education compared with the last budget, experts say it’s close to the $800 million to $900 million. Second, even the lower figure (the $800 million to $900 million) is only an estimate, and one that assumes that school districts would have "taxed to the max" without the limits. That’s unlikely, based on recent history, according to Andrew Reschovsky, a University of Wisconsin-Madison economist who publishes reports on school funding. That means even the $800 million to $900 million figure could be high, and underscores the importance of presenting multiple perspectives. Reschovsky prefers to study the actual year-to-year change, which yields the smaller number. He says the average person just looks at the bottom line difference, not what might have been. Remember that promised pay raise from your boss? If your salary was cut instead, your household budget would be reduced only in the actual difference -- not the theoretical difference, with the promised raise included. Democrats argue that schools planned on the restoration of the 2009 cut because it was in statute. But others say the handwriting was on the wall long ago. Reschovsky, who describes himself as an ardent support of public education, said it’s hard to argue that any governor could have avoided some cuts to education given the size of the budget gap. Finally, there is the issue of the spending side of school budgets. Along with the reduction in state aid and tougher tax limits, Walker and the GOP provided local school districts with a savings opportunity. Their limits on collective bargaining by public employees allow the school districts to require employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions. The "tools," as Walkers calls them, have allowed some -- but not all -- districts to offset the reduction in spending on education, at least for next year, the Journal Sentinel reported. So from some school districts’ perspective, the state budget giveth as well as taketh away -- and Shilling cited only the taketh away part. Let’s put away the calculator. Like some other Democrats, Shilling claims the 2011-’13 state budget cut $1.6 billion from local schools. The number comes from respected sources, but she uses it out of context, leaving out the much lower companion figure of around $800 million to $900 million that experts typically present along with the $1.6 billion as a measure of the true year-to-year loss. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores the reality behind the lower figure. That fits the definition for Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02848	In "reality," there have "been no problems whatsoever" with the Texas voter ID law.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/nov/19/greg-abbott/texas-problems-voter-id-law-popped-during-earl/	On the eve of the 2013 general election, a Republican candidate for governor of Texas in 2014 suggested the state’s mandate requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls was proving no big squeeze. Critics including Democrats had said the requirement, implemented for the first time in the November elections, would deter voters lacking an accepted ID, especially the elderly, minorities and the indigent. But a Nov. 4, 2013, Associated Press news story quoted Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who has defended the 2011 law in court, as saying critics failed to make their case. "I haven't ever seen anything that was overhyped as much as some partisan efforts to overhype concerns about this," Abbott said, "when, in reality, there has been no problems whatsoever." Not a one? Speaker Wright's ID Hector Nieto, a spokesman for the pro-Democratic Lone Star Project, disputed Abbott’s statement after bringing it to our attention. By email, Nieto noted news reports indicating the ID hurdle affected Sandra Watts, a Nueces County state district judge, and Jim Wright, the former U.S. House speaker. According to an Oct. 22, 2013, news account by KIII-TV, Channel 3 in Corpus Christi, Watts said she had to check a box swearing she was who she said she was when her name on her ID did not match her name on voting records. (Abbott and Wendy Davis, the Democratic state senator running for governor, similarly reported having to do the same, according to subsequent news reports.) Wright, 90, saying his driver’s license had expired, said he had to dig up a copy of his birth certificate before the Department of Public Safety would grant him a free personal identification card enabling him to vote on Election Day, Nov. 5, according to a Nov. 4, 2013, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story. Under the law, whose implementation was delayed by legal challenges, voters going to the polls are expected to present a photo ID issued by the DPS (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). News accounts generally upbeat Mindful that Abbott piped up before Election Day, we considered solely news stories completed by that time. This means that, like Abbott, we were limited to considering how the ID mandate affected voters in the state’s "early voting" period, which ran from Oct. 21 through Nov. 1. By email, Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland pointed out news stories indicating no problems with the ID law. Among them, a Nov. 4, 2013, Waco Tribune-Herald story quoted Kathy Van Wolfe, the McClennan County elections administrator, as saying: "I haven’t had any of my polling places call me because there was a problem." Similarly, other newspapers mostly reported smooth sailing, though officials also cautioned against sweeping conclusions by suggesting the 2013 ballot was unlikely to drive high turnout, meaning casual voters (including those less likely to carry appropriate IDs) were not expected at the polls. Statewide, voters were mostly considering proposed constitutional amendments and local propositions, though Houston had a mayoral election. In a Nov. 2, 2013, news story, the Houston Chronicle said that according to officials in Harris County and elsewhere, the ID mandate had not prevented anyone from voting. The Chronicle noted "minor instances of confusion" around the state and quoted the Harris County clerk, Stan Stanart, as saying the ID law caused no real problems; seven voters had to cast provisional ballots, which wouldn't be counted unless the voters proved their identities and were registerd to vote in the county. "Two of the seven showed up without a photo ID, two had out-of-state IDs, and the other four had IDs that were long expired," Stanart told the paper. "In the big picture, that's not much when you consider more than 80,000 people voted" locally. Steve Raborn, elections administrator for Tarrant County, told the Star-Telegram for an Oct. 28, 2013, news story: "We’ve really had no complaints, concerns or issues. But it’s only a small test given the low turnout," Raborn said. "Voters who turn out for these constitutional amendment and bond elections are frequent voters. They know the drill." The 2014 ballot will feature races for a range of offices topped by the U.S. Senate. An Oct. 27, 2013, news story in the Dallas Morning News reported "hiccups" at the polls, otherwise quoting Toni Pippins-Poole, the Dallas County elections administrator, as saying that many voters had to sign affidavits, swearing they were who they said they were, but no voter had been deterred from casting a ballot. On Oct. 29, 2013, the Dallas newspaper said on its Trailblazers blog that at least one in seven of more than 6,800 early voters had cast ballots after signing affidavits. The blog post said: "Election officials are taking pains to minimize the hassle. At polling locations in Dallas County, voters also have the option of updating their information in the voter registration database so it matches their photo identification going forward. But at the least, there’s an extra minute or two of inconvenience for some voters." In an Oct. 31, 2013, news story, the San Antonio Express-News quoted the Bexar County elections administrator, Jacque Callanen, as saying that local voting had been mostly uneventful. The story also said: "That's not to say there haven't been some disgruntled voters -- three, to be exact. Callanen said they had voter registration certificates but no photo IDs and grew irate when asked to take additional steps to vote." A couple days earlier, an Express-News news story quoted a Rice University political scientist, Mark Jones, as saying that the requests that voters affirm their identities wasn’t overly complicated. Jones said: "If no one is denied the right to vote, and the sole impact is they have to check a box ... that's unlikely to resonate outside of the (Democratic Party) faithful. For me, the voter ID law's principal impact is the impact you can't see: the person who does not turn out because they lack documentation." An Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Oct. 28, 2013, quoted election officials in Travis, Hays and Williamson counties as saying the ID law wasn’t keeping women from voting. The story quoted Jason Barnett, Williamson County’s elections administrator, as saying he taught election workers to look at the "totality of circumstances" to determine voters' identities when names weren’t identical on IDs and voter registration cards. "It's not a complicated process," Barnett said. Joyce Cowan, the Hays County elections administrator, said the law hadn't brought troubles. "We have not had major problems," Cowan said. An Oct. 26, 2013, El Paso Times news story reported no local problems with the ID law, also quoting an early voter, Jose Rodriguez, as saying the law didn't inconvenience him. Challenges for the elderly Informed of the tenor of these news stories, Nieto emailed us links to an Oct. 22, 2013, news report by KLTV-TV, Channel 7 in Tyler, stating that Elizabeth Pottinger, 96, would have to vote by mail--which does not require an ID to be presented--because she lacked the documents needed to obtain an ID that would be accepted at the polls. Nieto also pointed out a Sept. 21, 2013, news story by KTRK-TV, Channel 13 in Houston, stating that Dorothy Card, 84, of Lufkin, had failed to present the documents needed to get a DPS ID card. State law permitted her to vote by mail, the story said, but Card said voting at the courthouse had been her Election Day routine for years. Ultimately, the story said a DPS spokesperson, not identified, had assured the station that Card would be issued an ID card without more difficulties. Turnout and provisional ballots on rise Next, we wondered if there was an effect on turnout or the prevalence of provisional ballots--the kind that an adult can submit with the understanding that it won’t be counted unless they soon resolve the issue that prevented them casting a regular ballot. Turnout in the early-voting period was up from 2011, the last time the state had a comparable low-key general election. In 2013, nearly 284,000 Texans voted early in person, as opposed to by mail, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office, accounting for 3.3 percent of the state’s more than 8.5 million registered voters. In contrast, the office says, 156,317 voters, or 2 percent of 8 million registered voters, voted early in 2011. The number of provisional ballots cast also was up compared to 2011, according to information emailed to us by Jeff Hillery, a spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State’s office. According to the state, 131 provisional ballots were cast in the 2011 early-voting period. In the 2013 early-voting period, 398 provisional ballots--or 200 percent more than in 2011--were submitted. As in 2011, most counties fielded no provisional ballots, according to this information, while Medina County had the state’s most provisional ballots: 92. But that county didn’t have voter ID troubles, according to its elections administrator, Patricia Barton. Only two of the provisional ballots cast during early voting came from individuals lacking proper IDs, Barton told us by phone, and both were "cured"--meaning the voters returned with proofs of identity that meant their ballots would be counted. Barton said the remaining provisional ballots came from individuals who were not registered to vote or not registered in the county. In Austin and Travis County, four of 31 provisional ballots collected during early voting involved individuals lacking an accepted ID, Dana DeBouviers, the county clerk, said by telephone. State official: Provisional ballots not problems Hillery suggested by email that provisional ballots aren’t "problems" at the polls. "A problem would be if the correct process wasn’t followed during the election," Hillery said, adding that the agency "had very few reports of any confusion or issues on what the acceptable forms of ID were." Hillery stressed, too, that provisional ballots were an option mandated by the federal Help American Vote Act of 2002. "All voters who show up at the polls are offered at least the opportunity to vote provisionally," Hillery said, which "means that no voter is turned away from the polls because of the need for an acceptable form of photo ID. Here in Texas, if a voter shows up at the polls with an expired driver’s license or without any of the seven acceptable forms of ID, they will at least get a provisional ballot—meaning that they can still exercise their right to vote under the available circumstances. The voter then has a reasonable amount of time (six days; seven in this last election) to cure their vote and have it counted after going to the county registrar’s office and showing an acceptable form of photo ID to prove who they are. It’s also important to note that not every provisional ballot is necessarily the result of the photo ID requirement." Our ruling Abbott said there were "no problems whatsoever" with the voter ID law leading up to the 2013 Texas elections. As Speaker Wright and some fellow Texans could attest, none is not correct. News stories reveal various if rare experiences that could be construed as problems, such as voters having to scramble to get the proper ID. There also was a surge in provisional (largely uncounted) ballots, though we did not determine whether the ID law was key to that. This claim has an element of truth but overlooks the overriding reality that there were some problems. Mark the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03033	I am "the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants."	false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/09/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-isnt-alone-among-candidates-oppose-sta/	Dan Patrick wasn’t an elected official when lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to authorize in-state college tuition for certain children of illegal immigrants living in Texas. Now, the Houston state senator says in a campaign ad that he is "the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." Patrick is among Texans jockeying for the GOP nomination to fill the post overseeing the Senate. The others are third-term incumbent David Dewhurst, state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. In 2001, when the law came to be, neither Patrick, Dewhurst or Patterson had direct says on it. Dewhurst was then the state land commissioner and Patterson was a former state senator. Staples was an East Texas senator and among the vast majority of legislators who voted for House Bill 1403, which became the law that lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify for in-state tuition — if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so. Through August 2011, 38,656 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. And as we noted in a 2011 article, only five of 181 Texas House and Senate members voted against the legislation. The Texas House passed the measure 142-1 before the Senate approved an amended version by 27-3, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition. Staples was among a dozen Republicans voting "aye," according to the Senate Journal entry for that day. The House went along with the Senate version with Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson, pushing the legislation’s total tally of "no" votes to five. In 2011, Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, filed a proposal to repeal the tuition law, but it never made it past the four Republicans and three Democrats who comprised the Senate Higher Education Committee, the Austin American-Statesman said in a Sept. 28, 2011, news article. Birdwell then offered an amendment on the Senate floor that was intended to keep illegal immigrants from qualifying to pay in-state tuition. A document posted online by Patrick’s campaign on behalf of his ad notes that Patrick was among four Republican co-authors of that amendment. According to the Senate Journal showing that May 9, 2011, action, Birdwell withdrew the amendment without the Senate voting on it. According to the Senate’s video of Birdwell’s presentation of his floor amendment, Patrick did not speak during the 30-minute floor discussion; seven other senators asked questions or made statements. Legislative records also indicate that Patrick filed his own repeal proposal in the 2009 regular session; it did not get a hearing. So, is Patrick the only one among the four candidates "to oppose" in-state tuition for illegal immigrants? He’s not the only one who opposes it. Staples has said he favors repealing the law. Dewhurst has said that if had been governor in 2001, he would not have signed it into law. And Patterson has said he opposes the benefit, stressing that the issue of legal residency status should be dealt with first. By email, Staples’ campaign spokesman Kent Sholars provided a statement from Staples saying: "I oppose giving benefits to those who have violated our nation’s entry laws. If that bill came up for a vote today, it would not pass, and I support its repeal." Sholars also provided a video excerpt of Staples referring to the 2001 legislation during an Oct. 3, 2013, candidate forum in Houston. Staples, who left the Senate in early 2007, said that the measure "that created in-state tuition was predicated on the assumption that those students would correct their status. That has not been enforced. And it should be repealed." Good reminder. In 2010, we reported that neither the Texas Education Agency, the coordinating board or the University of Texas at Austin was checking on whether students had applied for permanent residency as they were promising to do in the required affidavits. Institutional officials told us that no law required such follow-ups. By email, board staff spokesman Dominic Chavez recently told us that state law remains silent on designating an agency to check on students seeking legal residency, but the board now has rules requiring affected colleges and universities to retain student affidavits indefinitely or until a student documents compliance. Also, Chavez said, the board has instituted a policy requiring institutions to annually counsel students about their responsibilities in accord with the affidavits. The document from Patrick’s campaign points out that Dewhurst made his opposition to the law clear in 2011--which was at a time Perry was getting pummeled in GOP presidential debates for standing behind the law. Dewhurst said in a September 2011 interview with WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas: "If we're not going to give fellow Americans who live in Louisiana or Oklahoma or New Mexico the ability to come into Texas and have in-state tuition and save, then is it fair to give that break to people who are not citizens here? So, I would not have signed that law." Dewhurst did not say in that interview whether the law should be repealed, according to a Sept. 26, 2011, Dallas Morning News news article. By email, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine told us Dewhurst has always opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. News stories we found using the Nexis service show no signs that Dewhurst tried to repeal it. A Sept. 27, 2011, Associated Press news story said that at the time, Dewhurst's political rivals, including Ted Cruz, who was then scrambling to overtake the better-known Dewhurst for the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate nomination, "blamed him for not doing more to repeal the law as leader of the Texas Senate." The AP story quoted Matt Hirsch, spokesman for Dewhurst’s Senate campaign, as defending Dewhurst’s legislative record. "The overwhelming majority of the Senate favored the in-state tuition benefit," Hirsch said, and Perry "has been firm in his support of the law. In light of Gov. Perry's veto pen, it was clear that any attempt to repeal this benefit would not be signed into law." Earlier, a May 10, 2007, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story quoted Dewhurst as saying that if a House proposal to repeal the 2001 law had reached the Senate, its chances of passage would have been slim. "We'd take a look at it, but historically the Senate has been in favor of providing in-state tuition for everyone living here," Dewhurst said then. The September 2011 American-Statesman news article recapping Dewhurst’s statement that he would not have signed the 2001 legislation into law also noted that Dewhurst and state lawmakers had shown little appetite for repealing it. The story said "there is little evidence to suggest" that Dewhurst had tried to repeal the law since becoming lieutenant governor in 2003. "In fact," the story said, "a 2005 piece of legislation clarifying the policy passed the Senate with a 29-0 vote. (The lieutenant governor does not vote.)" In a June 20, 2012, news story, the Texas Tribune said: "Dewhurst has said he opposes it but never pushed for the Legislature to repeal it because the votes weren't there." Regarding Patterson, Patrick’s camp asserted that in a February 2013 interview with the El Paso Times, Patterson said both that he did not support in-state tuition "for illegals" and that he supports the idea of "fixing" the legal residency status of undocumented immigrants attending Texas colleges and universities. In a telephone interview, Patterson said he was trying to stress the importance of federal immigration reform. After the Times asked Patterson his position on the tuition law, he replied: "I don't support the idea of saying, ‘We're going to ignore the law and let you do that.’ I support the idea of fixing their status as opposed to trying to just sweep the status under the rug. I would not support an in-state tuition bill for illegals. I would support a method of providing them a lawful status where in-state tuition for illegals wouldn't be a problem. We're Band-Aiding." Patterson told us federal immigration reform would presumably resolve the legal status of many residents. He also said the Texas law should be repealed. On Patterson’s campaign website, Patterson listed 10 positions he has on immigration, followed by No. 11: "Unlike others in this race, I didn’t vote for and I would have never voted for or supported in-state tuition for illegal aliens." Patterson’s campaign manager, Chris Elam, told us by telephone that No. 11 was added after the candidates sparred Oct. 3 in Houston. We told Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, that Patrick doesn’t appear to be alone among the candidates in opposing the law. Whoa, Spence basically replied, stressing in an email that Staples voted for the measure making the law, Dewhurst failed to let repeal measures clear the Senate and Patterson’s reply to the Times suggests he wants a "sanctuary" state. In contrast, Spence said, Patrick proposed a repeal measure and co-authored the Birdwell amendment. "You don't see a distinction?" Spence wrote. Our ruling Patrick said he’s "the only candidate for lieutenant governor to oppose in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." He is the one candidate who has filed specific proposals to repeal the law. But each of the Republican candidates was public about opposing the law before Patrick debuted his ad while it leaves the impression that other candidates favor the law or have taken no position on it. That’s just not so. We rate Patrick’s statement as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-02576	"We have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan area."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/30/nathan-deal/deal-defends-comments-bad-weather-was-unexpected/	Motorists stuck for hours and hours on ice-covered roads. Cars abandoned on I-285. Children forced to spend the night in schools. Across metro Atlanta, nearly everyone was saying they had never seen anything like this. At a late-night news conference just hours after the Tuesday chaos began, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal offered his initial assessment. "As you know, we have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan area," Deal said. The president of the American Meteorological Society quickly disputed the governor’s statement. "Some in the public, social media or decision-making positions would ‘blame’ the meteorologists. I began to hear things like ‘this was not expected in Atlanta’ or ‘they said this was going to all be South of Atlanta’ or there were no Watches or Warnings until snow started falling or ‘weather is just unpredictable.’ Wrong, Wrong, Wrong, and Wrong!" Marshall Shepherd, the AMA’s president, who also teaches at the University of Georgia, wrote on his blog. Was this storm "unexpected," as Deal said? PolitiFact Georgia trudged in, searching for some answers. Deal and other Georgia leaders, such as Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, have faced withering criticism about their response. Even Al Roker, the gregarious "Today" meteorologist based in New York City, took them to task. "The mayor and the governor got on television yesterday and said, ‘Oh, this wasn’t expected,’ and that’s not true," Roker said. "We were talking about this Monday." The first question posed to Deal during a testy news conference Wednesday was whether the severe weather was "expected." The governor clarified his remarks. Deal said he thought the Atlanta region would not get the worst of the weather conditions, based on some forecasts. Areas south of Atlanta would be in more trouble, Deal said. The governor said the weather reports on the fast-moving storm conflicted. In the face of a flurry of reporter questions, Deal said that some initial forecasts had Atlanta facing only "a dusting." "I think (local forecasters) were more correct than the national weather folks were," he said. Some local television meteorologists began warning viewers a snowstorm was headed to Georgia a week beforehand. But it first appeared that the brunt of the storm would strike communities south of metro Atlanta. On Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for central Georgia and south metro Atlanta. Before dawn Monday, the watch was expanded to the entire Atlanta region. The National Weather Service said Monday that central Georgia was most likely to see the most snowfall, especially overnight Tuesday, with up to three inches of the white stuff. The big concern in South Georgia, they said, was ice. "The snowfall amounts are going to matter very little in this situation because of the ice potential," said Jason Deese, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, according to The Associated Press. "Some parts of the state may end up seeing the greatest impact just because they get more ice than snow." Deese cautioned that the storm’s path was not entirely predictable. "We have increasing confidence a winter storm is going to affect portions of Georgia," Deese said. "It's just a matter of which portions of Georgia." The Weather Channel, based in Cobb County, predicted Monday that the brunt of the snow would hit metro Atlanta. "We could see anywhere from one to three inches here in the metro area," a forecaster said. The Georgia Emergency Management Association posted on its Facebook page Tuesday that the heaviest snowfall amounts would be between Macon and metro Atlanta. Southeast areas could expect icing from freezing rain and possible power outages. At 3:38 a.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta, starting at 9 a.m. It was at 9 a.m. that the city started pre-treating its roads, Reed told reporters Wednesday. The mayor said the problem was more complicated than just a weather event. Reed said everyone tried to leave at once just as the storm hit. Major roads, he said, were immediately clogged. Many school districts dismissed classes early, prompting parents to get in their cars to pick up their children. Employers across metro Atlanta told workers to go home early. The situation created a traffic nightmare in the region Tuesday afternoon in an area already jaded by gridlocked commutes. At 12:15 p.m. Tuesday, Deal said area roads were moving smoothly. Twenty minutes later, the governor said the roads were snarled. By evening, temperatures dropped and the roads iced, making it almost impossible to travel. "The error was letting everyone out at once," Reed repeatedly said. Some talk-show callers widely criticized Fulton County school officials for not letting children out earlier Tuesday. Fulton Superintendent Robert Avossa said Wednesday that the meteorologists and emergency management agencies were originally projecting that the winter storm would hit Tuesday afternoon after school was out. "As a result, we canceled after-school activities so students and staff would not be delayed in getting home," he said. "Throughout the day Tuesday, it became increasingly apparent that the weather model had changed and that the storm was arriving faster and more severe than expected. The target area also was changing to cover more of Fulton County, especially in the north, whereas the original projections were that it was going to hit south and below Fulton County." He wasn’t sure the outcome would have been different. "Several surrounding school systems did (release students earlier) but still experienced similar problems," Avossa said. So was the governor correct? Or was his statement part of a blizzard of misinformation. Deal said the Atlanta region was hit with an "unexpected" snowstorm. Deal is correct that some forecasters predicted metro Atlanta would not get the brunt of the storm. The closer the storm came to the region, the more apparent it was that metro Atlanta would see rough weather. Deal’s statement contains an element of truth -- there were conflicting weather reports as the fast-moving storm approached. But there is a lot of context necessary here. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta before dawn Tuesday. Ultimately, it is the job of elected leaders to make the correct calls based on the best information available. The governor and other elected officials had that information from some sources hours before the storm struck. We rate Deal’s statement as Mostly False.

pomt-14467	"I don't know anything about David Duke."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/donald-trump/trumps-absurd-claim-he-knows-nothing-about-former-/	A few days before Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday, the Republican frontrunner was being rebuked left and right for declining to denounce former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The controversy began Feb. 24, when Duke said that he supports Trump’s candidacy and told listeners of his radio program to "get active" for Trump. Two days later, Trump disavowed Duke in a news conference. But Trump, who claims to have the "world’s greatest memory," seemed to have forgotten this by Feb. 28. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about Duke, Trump claimed ignorance four times: "Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. "I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. … "I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him." Later that day, Trump tweeted a video of his earlier disavowal of Duke, and blamed his failure to do it again on CNN on "a very bad earpiece." As fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org have pointed out, Trump knew enough about Duke to denounce him several times over the past two decades. Duke mentions this election Trump, as we previously noted and as he acknowledged himself, renounced Duke just two days before he told Tapper he knew nothing about the white nationalist. When a reporter asked about Duke’s support on Feb. 26 (without identifying Duke as a former Klansman), Trump said, "I didn’t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right, I disavow, okay?" And a few months ago, in August 2015, Trump "repudiated" an earlier expression of support from Duke in a Bloomberg interview: John Heilemann: "We’ve heard this week that David Duke — former Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan — has come out and said he’s in support of your candidacy. So my first question is why do people like that like Donald Trump? And second, how do you feel about the David Duke quasi-endorsement?" Trump: "I don’t know the answer to the first. Who knows why? But I don’t need his endorsement. I certainly wouldn’t want his endorsement. I don’t need anybody’s endorsement. I’m not looking for…" Heilemann: "Would you repudiate David Duke?" Trump: "Sure, I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate. I don’t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. And actually I don’t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all the candidates. But I wouldn’t want him …" 2000 Trump: Duke is ‘a big racist’ Fifteen years ago, when Trump was flirting with a White House bid as a Reform Party candidate, he named Duke as a cause of concern at least three times. In 2000, former wrestler and then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura broke with the Reform Party because he didn’t want to be associated with the Reform Party’s presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, whom Duke supported. "Buchanan is an anti-abortion extremist and an unrealistic isolationist," Ventura told the New York Daily News on Feb. 12, 2000. "The latest I hear is that he's now getting support from David Duke. I can't be a part of that and I won't be part of that." Before he called it quits, Ventura said he consulted with Trump. After Ventura left the party, Trump also named Duke as one of the Reform's "biggest problems" on NBC’s Today Show. "Well, you've got David Duke just joined — a big racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party," Trump said on Feb. 14, 2000. He announced that day that he wouldn’t seek the nomination of the Reform Party, naming Duke as one of his reasons. "Now I understand that David Duke has decided to join the Reform Party to support the candidacy of Pat Buchanan," Trump wrote in a statement. "So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a Neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a Communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep." A few days later, Trump himself quit the party and repeated his earlier statement. "Although I am totally comfortable with the people in the New York Independence Party, I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep," Trump wrote in a Feb. 19, 2000, New York Times op-ed. 1991 Trump: A vote for Duke is ‘an anger vote’ Even earlier, Trump appeared on CNN on Nov. 19, 1991, and discussed Duke’s defeat in the Louisiana governor’s race and his possibly running against then-President George H.W. Bush. (Duke declared his candidacy as a Republican about a month after Trump’s interview.) Larry King: "Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him. Four hundred New Yorkers contributed."

Trump: "It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble.

Trump: "Well, I think if they run, or even if David Duke — I mean, George (H.W.) Bush was very, very strong against David Duke. I think if he had it to do again, he might not have gotten involved in that campaign because I think David Duke now, if he runs, takes away almost exclusively Bush votes and then a guy like (Mario) Cuomo runs. I think Cuomo can win the election." King: "But Bush morally had to come out against him." Trump: "I think Bush had to come out against him. I think Bush — if David Duke runs, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes. Whether that be good or bad, David Duke is going to get a lot of votes." Our ruling Trump said, "I don't know anything about David Duke." Trump seems to have forgotten that he knew enough about Duke to denounce him twice this election cycle. In 2000, he knew enough to criticize Duke’s racism. And in 1991, he knew enough to say he hated what votes for Duke represented. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05025	"We are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/15/joseph-kyrillos/joe-kyrillos-claims-united-states-not-producing-jo/	Joe Kyrillos rejects the term "Bush tax cuts." Rather, the Republican U.S. Senate hopeful casts the looming expiration of lower federal tax rates -- enacted under former President George W. Bush -- as tax increases the country can’t afford. That’s his argument considering the jobs market, which Kyrillos erroneously claimed in a recent interview is not growing. "If we don’t take action there will be tax increases and I guess we would call them [President Barack] Obama tax increases or [U.S. Sen.] Bob Menendez tax increases," Kyrillos, a state senator who is challenging Menendez this November, said in a July 11 interview on WNYC’s The Brian Lehrer Show. "Here's the thing: our economy is not performing. We are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs. And so listen, raising taxes now in these times is not going to help with job creation." Actually, the nation is adding jobs and has been for more than 20 months. So what is Kyrillos -- who has been traversing New Jersey on a "statewide jobs tour" -- talking about? "Our country has 4.894 million fewer jobs than we did at the start of the recession. That is the net job loss the Senator was referring to," Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, said in a written statement. Federal labor statistics confirm the country shed nearly 4.9 million jobs since December 2007, the official start of the recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. But since June 2009 -- the official end of the recession -- the nation added nearly 2.6 million jobs. So to support his claim that the "net of it all is that we lost jobs," Kyrillos includes all of the job losses incurred during the recession. Fay said the point Kyrillos was "making is that we still have lost a lot of jobs since the recession and are not replenishing them fast enough. That is the context of his sentence and that is factually correct." But Kyrillos didn’t make any reference to that time frame in the interview, as he explained why the economy can’t now afford a tax increase. And the fact is the trend has reversed since the end of the recession. Though it may not be the growth Kyrillos or the rest of the country would like, the nation added 80,000 jobs in June, according to preliminary estimates. Fay said in his statement that "the 12.7 million Americans currently unemployed are certainly not reassured by the measly 80,000 jobs netted last month." But there still has been job growth. The nation has added more jobs than it lost every month since October 2010. In the private-sector, job growth has been sustained even longer, with gains every month since March 2010. Year over year, the country added more than 1.7 million jobs overall from June 2011 to June 2012. Over the same time frame, more than 1.9 million private-sector jobs were added. Our ruling Kyrillos said "we are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs." The country is producing jobs. To suggest otherwise is wrong. Kyrillos’ campaign manager said the Republican candidate was referring to total job losses dating back to December 2007, the start of the recession, when he said "the net of it all is that we lost jobs." But Kyrillos doesn’t make that distinction during the interview. The nation has sustained monthly job growth since October 2010. And year over year, more than 1.7 million jobs were added. We rate this claim False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Joseph Kyrillos	None	None	None	2012-07-15T07:30:00	2012-07-11	['None']
pomt-12913	Obamacare "is in what the actuaries call a death spiral."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrongly-claims-actuaries-have-determined/	As Republicans in Washington move toward a repeal of Obamacare, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is doubling down on criticism of the sweeping healthcare law. That included a description in his Jan. 12, 2017, weekly briefing about the current state of Obamacare. "The law is in what the actuaries tell us (is) a death spiral," the Wisconsin Republican said. "So we’ve got to intervene to prevent this from getting worse." Ryan used the same ominous term — death spiral — in his Jan. 5, 2017, weekly briefing and as far back as a Fox News interview in December 2016. But is it accurate? Death spiral has a precise meaning The phrase "death spiral" evokes an airplane in a nosedive, but in the world of health care it carries a specific definition. Ryan appears to be referring to that definition since each time he used the term, he attributed it to actuaries. So this isn’t a fact check on the health or success of Obamacare, but on whether the present condition is consistent with what industry number-crunchers call a "death spiral." The term refers to a cycle where shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (that is, healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle. "It’s a well-known and documented phenomenon," said David Cutler, a Harvard University economics professor who was among the early users of the term in a 1998 paper, though he doesn’t believe he was the first. Three elements to a death spiral So a death spiral requires 1.) shrinking enrollment, 2.) a deteriorating risk pool and 3.) rising premiums. Let’s look at those one by one. The latest figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchange is up slightly from last year. Through Dec. 24, 2016, some 11.5 million people were signed up for coverage, an increase of 300,000 from the same point last year. "This market is not merely stable, it’s actually currently on track to grow," said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. "These (death spiral claims) are claims that have been sort of demonstrably false for a while, but it’s even more irresponsible to be repeating them now when we actually have enrollment data for 2017." As for the risk pool, Aron-Dine said it improved in 2015. Data for 2016 isn’t available yet, but the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports the share of people signing up for 2017 in the low-risk demographic — ages 18-34 — is on par with 2016, at 26% of enrollees. Larry Levitt, vice president of the health care-focused, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, noted the 26% number in a Jan. 10, 2017, tweet, adding, "You'd expect that number to go down in an insurance ‘death spiral.’" And data maintained by Standard & Poor’s shows the pool of people insured through the marketplace is improving, as the insurer cost per enrollee dropped below costs in the employer-sponsored market for the first time since Obamacare began, said Ben Wanaker, deputy assistant secretary with HHS. The role of premiums is more nuanced. Premiums are going up significantly this year. The benchmark plan used to gauge changes increased an average of 24% across the 50 states and Washington, D.C., the Kaiser Family Foundation reported. But most consumers won’t see any increase in what they pay because Obamacare includes subsidies that cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person). Among the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81% will receive a subsidy. As a result, for most there is no direct connection between premiums and enrollment — the core connection that defines a death spiral. For example, Arizona has by far the largest premium increase for 2017 (145%) but has still seen Obamacare enrollment increase by 8 percent so far. "When the premiums go up, people don’t drop coverage because the amount they pay hasn’t changed," Cutler said. When asked for evidence of the death spiral, Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana provided links to other people who have claimed the system is in a death spiral and details on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace. But he did not provide any data that showed the conditions being met for the actuarial definition of a death spiral. None of this is to say things are rosy for Obamacare. Several of the country’s largest insurers have abandoned or drastically scaled back their involvement in the exchanges, meaning one-third of counties will now have only one company offering plans on the exchange. But that’s not a death spiral. Mark Pauly, a conservative health economist at The Wharton School, said it was a "poor choice of words" by Ryan. "It’s not a death spiral, it’s just a downward spiral," he said. Our rating A death spiral is a health industry term for a cycle with three components — shrinking enrollment, healthy people leaving the system and rising premiums. The latest data shows enrollment is increasing slightly and younger (typically healthier) people are signing up at the same rate as last year. And while premiums are increasing, that isn’t affecting the cost to most consumers due to built-in subsidies. So none of the three criteria are met, much less all three. We rate Ryan’s claim False.

pomt-02391	"If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State."	true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-correct-trucks-cost-half-much-rent-goin/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, you may recall, isn’t impressed by states led by Democratic governors, including New York and California. Perry, who may run for president again in 2016, delivered a curiously focused dig in his well-received remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 7, 2014, saying another sign of things going well in red states and not so much in blue states lies in the relative costs of hauling stuff in a truck between blue California and red Texas. "If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State," Perry said with a grin. Notably, Perry did not say it’s cheaper to live in the city by the bay. According to an online Bankrate.com cost-of-living calculator, someone earning $53,000 a year in Austin would need nearly $92,000 a year to maintain their standard of living in San Francisco. Conversely, someone getting by on $53,000 a year in San Francisco could absorb a 42 percent income cut and still enjoy an equivalent standard of living in Austin, according to the calculator. Setting aside cost-of-living differences, was Perry right about the relative truck rental rates? By email, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed suggested we check rates for ourselves. We followed Nashed’s suggested methodology: "1. Go to www.uhaul.com 2. Pick a date, any date (tomorrow, a week from now, the 27th… whatever) 3. Austin zip code 78701, San Francisco zip code 94114." Upshot: Perry appears to be onto something. On the afternoon after Perry’s speech, we checked online U-Haul rental rates for five different-length trucks for four dates: March 8, March 19, March 30 and April 28, 2014. We also checked the rates for rentals from Austin’s central 78701 ZIP code to San Francisco’s 94102, which is downtown. The rates for each truck did not change by date--and each Austin-to-San Francisco rate was at least half its comparable San Francisco-to-Austin rate. The biggest difference, according to our search, was for renting a 26-foot truck. For that truck, the Austin-to-San Francisco rate, $931, was 39 percent of the $2,383 rate for renting such a truck and driving the other way. (See our chart here.) Wondering if U-Haul is unique in this price contrast, we spot-checked the rental of a Penske truck for March 19, 2014; it would cost $448 to rent a Penske truck in Austin and return it in South San Francisco in comparison to costing nearly $1,487 to take a truck the other direction. Next, we asked Nashed how Perry concluded that the price difference ties to there not being enough U-Haul trucks to flee the Golden State. By email, Nashed pointed out a question and answer posted on U-Haul’s website. Question: "Why does it cost less to move from Point A to Point B than vice versa?" U-Haul’s answer: "Many variables go into establishing rates. There are times when more people are moving out of a city than into it. Because we want more equipment going back to that city we will often discount the rate." To our emailed inquiry, Ashleigh Wagner, a spokeswoman for U-Haul International, Inc., echoed that online answer without directly addressing the Austin-San Francisco contrast. Our ruling Perry said: "If you rent a U-Haul to move your company, it costs twice as much to go from San Francisco to Austin than the other way around, because you can’t find enough trucks to flee the Golden State." His rate contrast is spot-on--with the difference even wider for renting a big truck. U-Haul generally says rate differences reflect its need to keep equipment available to customers everywhere. We rate this claim as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2014-03-12T11:17:16	2014-03-07	['San_Francisco', 'Austin,_Texas']
pomt-07724	Says the high-speed rail project provides "short-term jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/03/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-high-speed-rail-jobs-wont-last/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott made time during his two-day promotional tour of northern U.S. cities on March 2, 2011, to stop into New York's Fox News studios and talk high-speed rail. In an interview with Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, Scott first brushed off a lawsuit filed by two state senators challenging the new governor's ability to unilaterally kill the project. "I represent the taxpayers," he said. "This doesn't make any sense." Doocy then asked if a high-speed train is "really what people need." But before Scott could answer, Doocy said the project would provide jobs, right? "Short-term jobs," Scott said. "The federal government gives you all this money and then you have to pay for it down the road." In a previous item, we checked a claim from U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, that the rail line from Tampa to Orlando would create 60,000 jobs and rated that False. This time, we wanted to drill down on Scott's assertion that the jobs created would be "short-term jobs." For starters, we should note that estimating job numbers is a little bit like estimating ridership figures when it comes to the Tampa-Orlando train. There is science to it, of course, but there is a bit of art, too. Nevertheless, the Florida Department of Transportation provided a detailed job-creation estimate (page 16) as part of its application to the federal government for high-speed rail funding in October 2009. The state was awarded $2.4 billion in federal money for the $2.7 billion project, the money that Scott rejected. The job estimates are spread out over the four-county area along the 84-mile high-speed line, covering Hillsborough, Polk, Orange and Osceola counties. The 2009 application was based on a four-year construction period, beginning in 2011, and broke down the jobs created into three basic categories -- construction, engineering services and operations/maintenance. The estimate includes direct jobs -- those directly hired as a result of the project -- and indirect jobs, which FDOT said are jobs created to support the suppliers of the materials and equipment to the project. FDOT concluded that the rail line would create a total of 48,800 direct and indirect jobs over the construction of the system and another 1,100 total jobs once the line is in operation. (FDOT predicted the line would start running in 2015.) The jobs are measured in job-years, which is different than how most people would classify a job. The idea is that a "job" equals a year someone is employed -- that's a job-year. It could be one person working a year, or two people working six months each, or some other combination. In counting job-years, FDOT adds each year's job total to create one big number. It's a perfectly valid calculation -- as long as you understand the difference -- but to many, it comes off as a way to inflate the impact of a project. Here's how the FDOT breaks down the job creation in job-years: Employment (job-years) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Construction Direct 2,100 9,700 9,000 1,000 0 Total 4,500 20,400 18,900 2,100 0 Engineering Services Direct 700 500 0 0 0 Total 1,700 1,200 0 0 0 Operations/Maintenance Direct 0 0 0 0 600 Total 0 0 0 0 1,100 Total Direct 2,800 10,200 9,000 1,000 600 Total Overall 6,200 21,600 18,900 2,100 1,100 After 2015, FDOT says, the operations and maintenance jobs would continue (600 direct, 1,100 total) while the construction-related work would not. In the most favorable light, that's a total of roughly 50,000 job-years spread out over five years, with 1,100 of those jobs continuing in perpetuity. But 40,500 of those jobs -- more than 80 percent -- are confined to just two years during the rail construction, 2012 and 2013. Scott said the high-speed rail project provides "short-term jobs." He's largely right. More than 80 percent of the jobs created (talking job-years again) only exist for two years, and 98 percent of the jobs last no more than four years while the rail's being built. That leaves just 1,100 direct and indirect jobs created as a result of the operation of the train that are truly permanent. We rate Scott's claim Mostly True.

pomt-04174	"In the last 15 years, we've witnessed a dramatic expansion in the jailing of immigrants, from about 70,000 people detained annually to about 400,000."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/17/aclu-georgia-foundation/group-says-number-detainees-has-skyrocketed-15-yea/	The American Civil Liberties Union estimates the federal government spends $1.7 billion a year to detain illegal immigrants, which the group thinks is a waste of money. The ACLU Foundation of Georgia recently sent out a news release that decried the spending, made complaints about inadequate staffing levels and claimed some detainees are being mistreated at federal facilities, including the Stewart Detention Center in southwest Georgia. There was one set of numbers included in the release about detainees nationally that PolitiFact Georgia wanted to fact-check. "In the last 15 years, we've witnessed a dramatic expansion in the jailing of immigrants, from about 70,000 people detained annually to about 400,000," the release said. The liberal-leaning foundation has used these estimates in other news releases. We wondered whether the claim was correct, or is the ACLU using inflated numbers to bolster its argument? Azadeh N. Shahshahani, director of the foundation’s National Security/Immigrants' Rights Project, said it based the claim off reports it has seen. We found lots of information detailing the current number of detainees. The data for detainees held 15 years ago? Not so easy to find. In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Under the law, any person entering the United States illegally will be barred from entering the country legally for five years. A person who enters the United States illegally again and is caught will be banned from entering legally for 20 years. Federal reports we reviewed show there’s been an increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained since the law was passed. The federal government says it has put a greater emphasis on enforcement, spent more on beds to house detainees, given more money to states toward the effort and has a policy of mandatory detention of illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes. "The detention budget has increased, and our ability to detain more people has similarly increased," U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Vincent Picard said. The federal government uses a 12-month budget cycle that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. For fiscal year 2011, which covered Oct. 1, 2010, to Sept. 30, 2011, there were 429,247 illegal immigrants detained by the federal government, according to ICE. Detainees were held an average of nearly 30 days, ICE data show. The average daily population was 33,330. Picard said annual data go back to 2001. That year, 204,459 detainees were held. ICE keeps data on the average number of detainees held each day going back to 1994, we found. Part of the difficulty in tracking these numbers is the federal government reorganized its immigration enforcement under the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, abolishing the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which tracked immigration data. So where did the earlier estimate come from? Shahshahani said the ACLU found it on several websites, which she shared with us. Indeed, the estimate of 70,000 detainees held in the mid-1990s is included in various blogs by human rights organizations. None, however, contained the source of the claim. Shahshahani suggested the annual total is likely still accurate if you look at the annual figures since 2001. "Obviously, the daily figure has increased, so, possibly, the same extrapolation can be made of the annual figures," she said. Typically, the average daily detainee figures are about one-tenth the total of the annual figure. In 1995, the year before the law was passed, federal data show an average of 7,475 detainees were held. PolitiFact Georgia did some more digging and found a U.S. Justice Department report that backs up the ACLU Foundation’s claim. The report covered fiscal years 1994 to 2001. "The number of aliens ordered detained and taken into the custody of the INS pending removal from the United States or other outcome of an immigration proceeding increased from 72,154 during FY 1994 to 188,547 during FY 2001," the report said. Picard, the ICE spokesman, said he wouldn’t dispute the Justice Department report. To sum up, the ACLU Foundation of Georgia claimed the number of federal detainees has increased in the past 15 years from about 70,000 to 400,000. The 400,000 estimate seems accurate. One federal estimate from the mid-1990s corroborates the foundation’s argument. We rate the claim True.	None	ACLU Foundation of Georgia	None	None	None	2012-12-17T06:00:00	2012-12-07	['None']
pomt-10902	Says the Koch Brothers sponsored "a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/03/bernie-sanders/did-conservative-study-show-big-savings-bernie-san/	When a free-market think tank published its analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ single-payer health care plan, Republicans took to social media to tout the report’s most eye-popping finding. Sanders’ Medicare for All would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years, an amount they framed as crushingly large. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sanders, however, found good news for his idea in the generally skeptical report. In a video he shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the report’s findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. Sanders said, "Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. … That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Sanders’ plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone’s medical bills. Sanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers. Skeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyone’s bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses. In this article, we’ll look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays. In a way, Sanders is right, though his assertion glosses over some caveats. Where the $2 trillion estimate comes from The Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders’ bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, it’s not hard to find the $2 trillion in question. It’s the difference between the Department of Health and Human Services’ projection of the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal. (See Table 2.) Under Mercatus’ projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system. Specifically, total health care expenditures would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years, according to Mercatus. So there’s definitely something to what Sanders said. Some reasons for pause The Mercatus report’s author took issue with Sanders’ focus on that figure. Charles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders’ plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. However, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively (see Table 4) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. So while the number Sanders chose really does appear in the report, he’s cherry-picked the more flattering of two estimates. Sanders’ bill "indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicare’s payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance," Blahous said. "Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending." But would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are "not likely feasible," said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it’s a "pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically." In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. Josh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. "Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care," he said. Our ruling In cheekily thanking the Koch brothers, Sanders said a study they indirectly sponsored "shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period." The $2 trillion figure can be traced back to the Mercatus report. But it is one of two scenarios the report offers, so Sanders’ use of the term "would" is too strong. The alternative figure, which assumes that a Medicare for All plan isn’t as successful in controlling costs as its sponsors hope it will be, would lead to an increase of almost $3.3 trillion in national health care expenditures, not a decline. Independent experts say the alternative scenario of weaker cost control is at least as plausible. We rate the statement Half True.

However, they oversimplify what has happened to the gender pay gap in recent decades. When it comes to the role of government policy, the Government claims that job creation and economic growth were key drivers behind the lower pay gap. But experts told Fact Check a booming economy would likely correspond with a larger gender pay gap, as had occurred during the mining boom when men's wages rose faster relative to women's. Experts said the current government could not claim credit for decreasing the pay gap, and that the only government measure that may be responsible for narrowing the gap was a policy legislated by the former Labor government.

pomt-02570	Says President Barack Obama "spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/30/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-barack-obama-spent-nearly-trillion-/	Even though the stimulus enacted by President Barack Obama in 2009 has been phased out for a few years now, it remains a talking point for some Republican critics. During his response to Obama’s State of the Union address, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a shot at the stimulus when he said this: "Mr. President," Paul said, "where are the jobs? You spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs and still joblessness confronts the next generation." We wondered whether Paul -- a potential 2016 presidential candidate -- was correct to say that Obama "spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs." First, some background on the stimulus, which was passed in 2009 with almost exclusive Democratic backing. When it was passed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expected more than 90 percent of the cost to occur within fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. It has found that those expenditures have proceeded more or less on schedule. So far, the stimulus has spent $816 billion. One could characterize that as "nearly a trillion dollars," especially when you add in the debt incurred in order to make that spending possible. The estimate for the debt required to support the stimulus was $347 billion over 10 years, making the combination of the stimulus and the added debt a bit under $1.2 trillion. What’s more problematic about Paul’s claim is his charge that this money went toward "make-work government jobs." This claim is dubious on two levels. First, not all the stimulus money went to paying government employees -- only a modest (though uncertain) fraction did. The stimulus included three broad categories of spending, broken down below with the amount spent so far: • Tax benefits to individuals and businesses: $290.7 billion • Entitlements, including Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment benefits: $264.4 billion • Contracts, grants and loans in such areas as education, transportation, infrastructure, energy, science and health: $261.2 billion So right off the bat, more than two-thirds of the total -- tax benefits and entitlement payments -- cannot be fairly categorized as funding "make-work government jobs." These were payments and tax givebacks for individuals and businesses to spend as they saw fit. The third category, worth $261.2 billion, did include funding for some government jobs, such as teachers, but a sizable chunk of this money was used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors. It’s also worth noting that neither the federal government nor government as a whole has seen a surge in employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statsitics, the size of the federal workforce has declined by 69,000 since Obama took office, though it has risen by about 65,000 if cuts in the Postal Service workforce are not included. That’s about a 3 percent increase over a five-year period if you use the figures that exclude the Postal Service. The drop is even more clear in government jobs at all levels -- federal, state and local. Since Obama took office, government employment has plunged by 734,000 jobs, which is a decrease about 10 times bigger than the federal increase. Which brings us to the second concern: Not all of these government employees were engaged in "make work." Webster’s New World Dictionary defines "make work" as "a job, project or assignment that serves no useful purpose other than to give an otherwise idle or unemployed person something to do." The classic example is of paying an unemployed person to dig a hole, then to fill it up again. Whether something qualifies a "make work" is open to debate; critics of all ideological stripes can surely find examples of specific projects in the stimulus that they would consider unworthy of taxpayer support. Still, the biggest category of "contracts, grants and loans" -- accounting for more than one-third of this heading -- is education, and a big chunk of those funds, about $51 billion, went toward keeping previously employed educators from being laid off. Another $16 billion went to student financial aid, plus a combined $24 billion for educating disadvantaged and special-needs children. Since much of this funding went toward teachers who were already employed, and were in danger of being laid off, it seems hard to characterize their duties as "make work." When we checked with Paul’s office, aides offered a revised phrase to replace "make-work government jobs" -- namely, "government-facilitated job growth." This terminology would be more accurate; indeed, we’d expect to find little disagreement with this from Democrats who supported the stimulus. The stimulus was the keystone of Obama’s efforts to stop the nation’s economic freefall, while also accomplishing some other priorities in such areas as infrastructure and scientific research. Democrats tend to believe that government spending -- called "Keynesian" after its progenitor, the late economist John Maynard Keynes -- plays a major role in economic downturns in replacing vanished or reduced spending by the private sector. Some Republicans are skeptical of this approach, suggesting that tax cuts get more money into the hands of private individuals who can lead an economic recovery more effectively than the government can. We won’t referee that debate. Instead, we’ll note that we would have agreed there’s a good argument that Obama engaged in roughly $1 billion of "government-facilitated job growth." That, of course, begs the question of whether the payoff in job creation was worth the $1 trillion spent. Employment is up by 3.2 million since Obama was sworn in, but it remains almost 1.2 million below its peak, almost five years into the recovery. Our ruling Paul said Obama "spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs." It’s plausible that through the stimulus, Obama spent nearly $1 trillion of taxpayer dollars in hopes it would create jobs. But Paul is wrong to suggest that all $1 trillion was spent on "make-work government jobs." Two-thirds of the stimulus was spent on tax cuts and entitlements, and of the remaining one-third, much was paid to private contractors. Only a modest fraction of the $1 trillion was spent on government jobs, much less on jobs spent doing nothing. We rate his claim False.

pomt-12621	Says former Sen. Rick Santorum said, "Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/01/blog-posting/uspoln-puts-rape-pregnancy-words-ex-us-sen-rick-sa/	Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum has been a pro-life stalwart throughout his political career. He’s regularly said he would oppose abortion in all cases -- even incidents of rape and incest. But did he recently go so far as to say, "Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims?" According to Uspoln, a "U.S. political news" site with 23,000 Facebook likes (and some of the weirdest "you may also like" links of all time), Santorum made the comment on "Piers Morgan Live" in mid-February. It uses that quote as a headline and then presents further comments about abortion attributed to Santorum. Here’s the thing: Santorum didn’t give most of these comments in the way Uspoln presented them, and he certainly didn’t say them this year. Uspoln published the article Feb. 18, 2017. Its article states Santorum spoke to Piers Morgan "last Friday," which would have been Feb. 17. That is not possible. Morgan has been off the air since 2014. He is currently working as an editor for the Daily Mail. Now, during his time on CNN, Morgan did once host Santorum. During Santorum’s presidential run in 2012, he and his family appeared on the show, and Morgan asked him about abortion in cases of rape and incest. Uspoln’s article partially paraphrases and partially directly quotes Santorum. It says, "sexual assault victims should ‘accept this horribly created’ pregnancy because it is ‘nevertheless a gift in a very broken way’ and that, when it comes down to it, a victim ‘just has to make the best out of a bad situation.’" Uspoln also quotes Santorum and Morgan having an exchange in which Santorum compares a pregnancy through rape to a suicide bombing. This is the full statement Santorum made to Morgan, according to a transcript from the show: "As horrible as the way that that son or daughter and son was created, it still is her child. And whether she has that child or doesn't, it will always be her child. And she will always know that. And so to embrace her and to love her and to support her and get her through this very difficult time, I've always, you know, I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created -- in the sense of rape -- but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you. As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can't think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation." According to the transcript, the conversation between Santorum and Morgan about suicide bombing and a pregnancy from a rape did not occur. Santorum’s remarks did lead to some backlash in 2012. An opinion writer for The Guardian, for instance, wrote a critical story on Santorum with the headline, "Rick Santorum thinks pregnancy through rape is God’s gift? Seriously?" Uspoln did not respond to an interview request. The site appears to regularly twist and embellish the words of famous politicians and then publish or re-publish the articles months after the comments were made. For example, after a Sarah Palin Facebook post about Black Lives Matter caused controversy last summer, Uspoln ran an article falsely claiming Palin said, "I’m sick of being called a racist. If it’s dangerous for blacks here, they can go back to Africa." Our ruling The website Uspoln claimed Rick Santorum said, "Sometimes pregnancy is God’s way of comforting rape victims" and also made other comments comparing suicide bombing and pregnancies because of rape in February 2017 on a TV show with Piers Morgan. "Piers Morgan Live" has not been on television since 2014 and in a 2012 interview with Morgan, Santorum made no such comments. Though he did say pregnancy from a rape should be "approached...as a gift in a very broken way," Santorum did not say pregnancy was "God’s way of comforting rape victims" and made no comparisons to suicide bombing.

pomt-03601	Says he has sued the Obama administration 25 times.	true	/texas/statements/2013/may/10/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-he-has-sued-obama-administration-/	Here’s a typical workday for Texas’ attorney general: "I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home," Greg Abbott was quoted as saying to a tea party group in an April 30, 2013, Associated Press news story. Speaking to FreedomWorks Texas in Austin on April 27, Abbott said, "I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times, over the last four years." Last fall, the Associated Press tallied two dozen: Abbott "has filed 24 lawsuits against the federal government since Obama took office — litigation that has cost the state $2.58 million and more than 14,113 hours spent by staff and state lawyers working those cases," said a Sept. 9, 2012, news story. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us an updated list of Texas’ lawsuits against the federal government: three during President George W. Bush’s tenure and 27 since President Barack Obama’s Jan. 20, 2009, inauguration. (Abbott himself was sworn in Dec. 2, 2002.) Outcomes of the 27 Obama-era lawsuits, by our count: five clear-cut "wins," eight "losses," four cases in which Texas agreed to dismiss its case when circumstances changed, nine cases in progress -- and one that could be called a partial win, perhaps: 2010’s 26-state challenge to Obamacare that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care, but states could not be required to expand Medicaid. Abbott’s staff, Bean said, would count eight "wins" during the Obama administration, including the Medicaid decision and two dismissals in which "the state got what it wanted." Bean noted all but one "win" are final (can no longer be appealed) and of the eight "losses," she said, six are being appealed and one could be appealed. In our count of five "wins," four lawsuits were against the Environmental Protection Agency and one against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The EPA has appealed one ruling to the Supreme Court, and FERC filed for a clarification of the judgment in its case. In most of the 27 cases, Texas was the lead plaintiff or only plaintiff. These included lawsuits in which Abbott was acting at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Bean said, "We file them on behalf of state agencies. We’re the lawyer, they’re the client." Twice, Texas was originally listed among other states but not as the lead plaintiff, and in 11 cases Texas and other states or parties filed similar lawsuits that were bundled together by the courts sometimes resulting in Texas not being listed as the lead, or original, plaintiff. Both cases in which Texas was an original plaintiff but not the lead plaintiff involved challenges to Obamacare: the 2010 lawsuit by 26 states that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care and the 2012 case in which seven states sued over a requirement that religious employers offer insurance covering certain birth control methods. For perspective, we reached Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs at the University of Texas Law School with a specialty in empirical legal studies. Lindquist told us by phone that she would not attach much significance to those circumstances when trying to determine whether Texas was itself suing the federal government agency. "This is situations where they’re actually named parties in the suit," she said, rather than, for example, filing a brief lending support to one side. States’ attorneys general often join forces to challenge laws, she said, as in the Obamacare lawsuit that eventually included 26 states. (Texas was among 14 states listed as plaintiffs in the original suit, filed by Florida.) "They’re lending resources, so it’s not that Texas is not a real litigant," Lindquist said. Even when later joining other plaintiffs, she said, "I don’t think that means they’re not a plaintiff, I just think it means they’re one of many." Democratic activist Matt Angle, whom we asked to weigh in, did object to Abbott’s inclusion of the two multi-state Obamacare lawsuits. But he raised a larger objection: the inclusion of two cases in which Texas sought preclearance under the federal Voting Rights Act for changes to its voting process. Angle, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Lone Star Project, told us by email that in filing these suits, Abbott "took action as a defensive and not offensive tactic. ... No way he should get credit in these two instances." Under the Voting Rights Act, governments in certain jurisdictions (notably, several Southern states) where minority voter turnout was previously low must get federal clearance before changes in voting laws can take effect. To get that clearance, Lindquist said, "you have a choice of two different avenues. One is you can request the preclearance of the election law change with the Department of Justice via letter. … Or, you can go to court to seek the preclearance" by the action of filing a lawsuit. During the Obama administration, Texas has sought preclearance twice in high-profile cases -- in 2011, for redrawn legislative voting districts, and in 2012, for a measure requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls. In those cases, Lindquist said, "to say yes, that the State of Texas sued the government, yes that’s true." But looking at the main purpose of such suits, she said, "it’s not quite the same as suing the government to force the government to change its behavior. They’re suing the federal government to seek preclearance under a federal law, and they’re just going to a different forum to do it." Our ruling Abbott said, "I’ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times." Since Obama became president, Texas has filed or been a party to 27 lawsuits against the federal government.

pomt-00975	In the past year, DeKalb has "attracted and retained more than 2,300 jobs."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/13/lee-may/dekalb-jobs-claim-needs-some-refining/	With economic indicators ticking up in Georgia and headlines of new jobs coming to metro Atlanta, the state’s third-largest county is touting its successes. DeKalb County has "attracted and retained more than 2,300 jobs" in the last year, interim CEO Lee May told business and community leaders during his State of the County address last month. May went on to describe his efforts to improve the county’s image to attract businesses and support job growth. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered, could the county often in the news for corruption allegations and political gridlock also be responsible for growing jobs? We decided to check. May directed us to DeKalb Workforce Development, the local agency that provides "one-stop" education, training and employment programs under the federal Workforce Investment Act. The agency keeps track of jobs in several categories, said Workforce Director Sheryl Stone. They are: Geographic Solutions: A statewide database that counts only full-time employees hired or retained through federal Department of Labor funds. In 2014, DeKalb saw 731 new hires in this category and 602 people who retained new jobs for at least a year. Total: 1,333. Capital Improvement Plan (CIP): A count of workers hired or retained, either part-time or full-time, as part of DeKalb’s $1.35 billion overhaul of its water/sewer system. Last year, 107 people were hired and 386 saw jobs retained as part of working for contractors on the program. Total: 493. Taleo: Employers who work on the county level to recruit for part-time and full-time jobs use DeKalb’s Taleo system to filter resumes. Some workers will transfer to the state Geographic Solutions system once they have completed probationary periods for full-time work. The county does not break out the number of jobs based on full-time or part-time in this category, but all are unsubsidized with government dollars. Total: 348. Job training: Workforce uses federal dollars to subsidize up to half of a new hire’s salary for 90 days. The employer recruits through the agency and must hire the employee at full time with benefits. The subsidy is designed to serve as a training cost. Total: 167. Stone said the agency determined that, over a 10-year period, the average salary for workers it helped find employment was $56,000. "We really are making a difference," she said. And, adding up the categories, Workforce counts 2,341 people working for the year. That would fully support May’s claim, except for hiccups with the counts themselves. The local Taleo category, for instance, counts part-time jobs as equal to those with full-time hours (which the county considers after only 32 hours). Job seekers are apt to view even 32 hours per week to be part-time, suggesting that category is inflated, according to experts. The bigger question is how Workforce is counting workers in the water/sewer overhaul. Stone said the agency counts workers as reported by the contractors selected for different projects. Some of those people may work only a few days or months on a specific task, Stone said, but they are included in the total headcount reported. The agency’s lead over the CIP said each worker is only counted once, though they may work on several tasks in a specific project. And, if someone is hired or keeps a job for three months, that person then counts as a full-time equivalent worker, though the agency does not have a breakdown of how many would fall into that category. That’s problematic, because the definitions can affect the counts, said Tom Smith, a finance professor at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University. For instance, a pizzeria can claim to have sold a pizza for every 8 slices it sells. But those slices may not come from the same whole pizza – meaning the count doesn’t adjust for what would have been thrown away from one whole pizza that had been divvied up. "You run into problems when you try to count things the same but in different ways," Smith said. "Four thousand people who work a quarter of the year is not really the same thing as 1,000 jobs." Barbara Neuby, a professor of political science at Kennesaw State University, said the massaged definitions also direct focus away from statistics that may not be as positive. For instance, state Department of Labor figures show that the number of new unemployment claims in DeKalb were down about 12 percent between December 2013 and December 2014. But the claims are up 44 percent between November and December last year, the last figures available. "If they wanted to be truly accountable and transparent, they could say they created work in the private sector by issuing contracts," said Neuby, who specializes in government budgets and finance. "But to say these are jobs created, no. We don’t have exact numbers to make that claim." May said the county plans to do a better job of counting positions in that category going forward. But, he notes that the work is creating jobs – something that the experts agree on in principle. "We spent $62 million on the CIP last year, and that translates into people who are working," May said. "We didn’t define that and we will drill down to be more probing about what kinds of jobs. To us, a job is a job if you’re working, it counts." To that end, May is correct. The state Labor Department defines a job simply as a task that is performed. The number of people employed to do that task can be less than full time, or more. So, was May on target when he said DeKalb had created or kept more than 2,300 jobs last year? By the state’s broad definitions, the county’s Workforce Development office backs him up on the number of people working. That’s not the same thing as the number of jobs. The distinction boils down to that difference. Looking at the categories, the bulk of the people being counted - those on the state level, in job training and some hired on the local level - are likely to be the same as the number of jobs. But for some people working part-time on the local level, or in the CIP, the distinction could boost or underestimate the actual number of jobs. Without more data, which the county does not collect, we don’t know what is happening. Overall, that means the statement is mostly right, except for problems the county acknowledges in its counts. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Lee May	None	None	None	2015-02-13T00:00:00	2015-01-22	['None']
pomt-14790	"15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/dec/02/bill-maher/bill-maher-cancer-drugs-cost-10000-month/	Patients used to pay $10,000 a year for cancer drugs, but now they’re paying $10,000 a month, according to HBO talk show host Bill Maher. That’s a message circulating on Facebook recently, promoted by the "Bill Maher Fanpage." A reader asked us to check it out. The quote comes from the Oct. 2 episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, where Maher discussed Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight. "Not that (Turing CEO Martin) Shkreli is unusual for the pharmaceutical industry," Maher said on his show. "Fifteen years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month because this cartel owns the U.S. government every bit as much as Mexican drug lords own theirs." It’s well known that the cost of health care is on the rise, but has the annual cost of cancer drugs really increased so dramatically in just a decade and a half? Maher’s team sent us links to some news articles about the rising cost of cancer drugs, and we tracked down information that speaks to his claim. The best information we could nail down is the cost of anticancer drugs at launch, the initial price when the Federal Drug Administration approves a drug. These are the sticker prices set by the pharmaceutical companies, not the prices patients actually pay out of pocket, which are reduced by insurance payments, patient assistance programs and other discounts. Costs increases, though, are often passed on to consumers. Maher has a point that cancer drug costs are on the rise. We charted the launch costs of cancer drugs the FDA approved since 1999, using a list compiled by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The second half of Maher’s statement -- that cancer drugs now cost about $10,000 a month -- is also on solid ground. Of drugs approved in 2015, the monthly average cost is $11,319. And experts in the field often cite that $10,000 figure themselves. Because many cancer drugs are not administered to patients for a full year, it’s difficult to determine an average annual cost, so the first half of Maher’s statement -- that they cost about $10,000 a year 15 years ago -- is hard to nail down. To his point, though, the monthly cost of a new drug was dramatically lower in 2000 than what it is now at about $4,634. One of the news articles that Maher’s team sent us is an academic article in the Journal of Oncology Practice that supports his statement. The report reads, "The average cancer drug price for approximately one year of therapy or a total treatment duration was less than $10,000 before 2000." Maher’s statement is "in the ballpark," if not an understatement, said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago who researches cancer drug prices. In a 2015 paper Conti authored with three other leading health economists, she examined the launch cost of anticancer drugs controlled for inflation and the benefit to the patient (how much it prolongs life expectancy). For example, in 1995, anticancer drugs cost $54,100 for an additional year of life, the study found. In 2005, drugs cost $139,100 for the same benefit, and the price grew to $207,000 in 2013. In the United States, pharmaceutical companies set their own drug prices. What’s pushing them to increase the costs? It’s not necessarily that cancer drugs are getting better and are thus worth more. Conti’s research concluded that just about one-fifth of the cancer drug cost increase can be attributed to a better product. There are two primary forces behind annual cancer drug cost increases, Conti said: First, pharmaceutical companies estimate a "zone of indifference" -- based on last year’s prices, how much more would buyers be willing to pay? Second, rebates and discounts for drugs have also increased over time, and this creates an incentive for drug companies to increase their costs alongside the discounts. Pharmaceutical companies defend drug price increases by emphasizing that the revenue funds innovative research and that drugs lower overall health care costs by treating illnesses. Because there’s no formal price regulation and competition in the industry is rare, "It really is a system where there’s no downward pressure on drug prices," said Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes in an interview with Fortune. Our ruling Maher said, "15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month." The average annual cost of a drug isn’t easy to calculate, given the way cancer drugs are scheduled; many drugs aren’t used every month for an entire year. So the first half of the statement is hard to verify, though we did find one academic source that cites a similar figure. However, Maher has a point that the cost of cancer drugs has increased dramatically since 2000, when the average monthly price of a cancer drug, when it first hit the market, was about $4,600. In 2015, the monthly cost is over $10,000. Maher’s numbers are a little squishy, but they’re in the ballpark. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-01529	The Obama administration is using as its "legal justification for these airstrikes (on the Islamic State), an authorization for military force that the president himself has called for repeal of."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/18/julie-pace/justify-airstrikes-against-islamic-state-obama-usi/	On Monday night, Jon Stewart took aim at President Barack Obama’s strategy to take down the Islamic State, highlighting the Obama administration’s mixed messages about whether or not their airstrikes were "sustained counterterrorism activities" or "war." "There are legal ramifications to this," Stewart said. "How we define the conflict will inform who has the authority to address the threat from ISIS-ISIL." Stewart then played a clip where Fox News’ John Roberts explains that "the president is relying on the Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that President (George W.) Bush had signed in 2001 and 2002." After a ditty about Middle Eastern wars, Stewart played a clip where Obama said he "look(s) forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate." "Wow, then you are lucky that Congress never does anything you ask, because otherwise you would be screwed right now," Stewart joked. This isn’t the first time Obama’s gotten flak on this: Associated Press reporter Julie Pace recently asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest about the "irony in using as your legal justification for these airstrikes an authorization for military force that the President himself has called for repeal of." So we wanted to check: Is Obama justifying his airstrikes using the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, while arguing that he wants the same AUMF repealed? When can the president wage war? Under the War Powers Act of 1973, the president has the power to wage war for 60 days before an AUMF or a declaration of war is needed from Congress. Obama authorized airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS on Aug. 7, so to carry out what Obama called a "sustained counter-terrorism strategy" against the Islamic State, he will need some sort of legislation from Congress. That’s what Bush did in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Congress passed an AUMF that gave the Bush the power to use "appropriate force" against anybody behind the attacks. That’s been understood to mean al-Qaida, and while the Islamic State used to be part of al-Qaida, they’ve since split over ideological differences and spats over leadership. Congress passed another AUMF in 2002 authorizing the Iraq War. But in his Sept. 10 speech about the Islamic State, Obama said, "I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL," meaning he believes that attacking ISIS is permitted under an existing AUMF, either from 2001 or 2002. Obama made a similar statement during a Sept. 7 Meet the Press interview, but in neither case has Obama explicitly said that he’s using the 2001 or 2002 AUMF to justify his actions. Others in the White House have been more clear Others in his administration, though, have named the 2001 AUMF specifically. When Pace drilled Earnest on "an AUMF he (Obama) wanted repealed," Earnest responded by calling it "an AUMF that he (Obama) believes continues to apply to this terrorist organization that is operating in Iraq and Syria." Various sources, included The New York Times and Time, have quoted a statement from a senior administration official provided to the media that specifically points to the 2001 AUMF as a justification for the U.S. airstrikes against ISIL. Even though al-Qaida and the Islamic State have formally split, the administration’s statement cites the group’s "long history of conducting … attacks against U.S. persons and interests, the extensive history of U.S. combat operations against ISIL … and ISIL’s position … that it is the true inheritor of Osama bin Laden’s legacy" as reasons why the 2001 AUMF applies. So although Obama himself hasn’t publicly named the 2001 AUMF, others in his administration have made it clear that he considers the legal justification for his airstrikes on the Islamic State. Missing context on Obama’s 'repeal' statement All that said, there’s no question that Obama said that he wanted the 2001 AUMF repealed. In a May 23, 2013, speech at the National Defense University -- from which Stewart got his clip -- Obama said that he looked "forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate." Earlier, he notes that "the AUMF is now nearly 12 years old," so it’s clear that he’s referring to the 2001 AUMF. Honing in on the "repeal," though, oversimplifies Obama’s position. Pace’s formulation -- that Obama "has called for repeal of" the AUMF and that it's an "AUMF he wants repealed" -- implies that Obama wants the AUMF repealed immediately. That’s not the case. In the statement Pace was referring to, Obama said he wanted "to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF’s mandate." So refining comes first, and repeal is somewhere down the road. Clarifying the timeline In fact, in the same speech, Obama mentioned his administration’s campaign against al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP) in Yemen, which his administration has justified using the 2001 AUMF. About a year after Obama’s 2013 statements about the AUMF, a senior administration official (unnamed in the White House transcript) put a more specific timeline on refining and repealing the AUMF. The Obama administration, said the official, will "want to talk to Congress about the AUMF as we approach the end of the year (2014)." And on Sept. 12, Earnest said that there had been "conversations between senior White House staffers and members of Congress" in response to a question about "revising, refining, or repealing the 2001 AUMF." There’s actually been more than just conversations: Since Obama’s 2013 speech, the House of Representatives has voted against two separate amendments from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that would have repealed the 2001 AUMF. But as far as we can tell, the Obama administration didn’t comment on those amendments. So repeal may be somewhere down the line, and the Obama administration has consistently stated they plan to change the 2001 AUMF, but saying Obama wants the 2001 AUMF repealed is an a bit of a simplification. Our ruling Pace said that the Obama administration is using as its "legal justification for these airstrikes (on the Islamic State), an authorization for military force that the president himself has called for repeal of," and several other publications have reiterated her point that Obama wanted the 2001 AUMF Pace is referring to repealed. There’s no doubt that the Obama administration is using the 2001 AUMF as its "legal justification." Obama hasn’t publicly named the 2001 AUMF, but his press secretary and a statement from a senior administration official have. Saying that Obama "called for repeal of" the 2001 AUMF, though, is an oversimplification. Obama said he wanted to work with Congress "to refine and, ultimately, repeal" the 2001 AUMF, meaning he wants it repealed eventually, but not now. Other statements by his administration have been consistent with that point of view. Pace’s statement could have used some additional clarification or detail, so we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-00378	Teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher's unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/07/michael-lee/nc-senator-claims-teacher-pay-increased-under-repu/	Teacher pay is always a popular topic around election time. Republicans and Democrats either want credit for any progress being made, or want to blame the other side for any lack of progress. Sen. Michael Lee, a Republican from Wilmington, is gearing up for re-election against Harper Peterson, a former Wilmington mayor. He tweeted on Aug. 28 that "teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher’s unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017." Did teacher pay increase over the past five years? Here’s the average teacher salary from the past five years: 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 2017-18: $50,861 Those teacher salaries also include supplements, but those are provided by the local district and not the General Assembly. The numbers do not take into consideration any rise in health care premiums, cost-of-living or other expenses. The average rate of inflation over the course of these years was 2.3 percent, based on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At first glance, it does appear that teachers got a pay raise every year. However, the salary schedules from the North Carolina Department of Instruction tell a slightly different story. Teachers with 35 years of experience were being paid $52,150 in the 2013-14 school year. In the 2014-15 school year, the base salary for teachers with 25 years of experience or more dropped to $50,000. The 2016 "Held Harmless" statute made sure no teacher would make less in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. So, those teachers did not receive a pay cut in the following years. The average pay did increase every year after the 2013-14 school year. In the 2017-18 academic year, teachers with 35 years of experience were paid $51,300. Basically, teachers who reach 35 years of experience today because they are now included in the overall "25-year-plus" category. (Clarification: An earlier version of this story said teachers received pay cuts following the 2013-14 academic year. However, we neglected to factor in the "Held Harmless" statute that prevents teacher pay cuts.) It’s the same story for teachers with 36 years of experience. They were paid $53,180 in the 2013-14 academic year, but teachers who reach 36 years of experience would’ve been paid $50,000 in the 2014-15 academic year. In the 2017-18 academic year, these teachers were paid $51,300 as well. The same "Held Harmless" statute has been included in the 2018-19 budgets so no teacher gets a pay cut. In addition, teachers with up to four years were the only ones to get a base salary increase in the 2015-16 academic year. They were paid $33,000 in 2014-15, and then paid $35,000 in 2015-16. In the following years, first-year teachers did not see an increase to their base salary. It stayed at $35,000. How fast did teacher pay increase? North Carolina was ranked second in having the fastest teacher pay raise in 2016-17 nationally, according to the National Education Association. This is where Lee’s legislative assistant, Emily Barnes, says Lee got his information. However, that hasn’t always been the case. In the 2013-14 academic year, North Carolina was ranked 48th for percentage change in average teacher salary, with a -1.6 percent change. The state also ranked 41st in the 2015-16 academic year for teacher pay raises with a 0.3 percent change. North Carolina did rank first in teacher pay raise in 2014-15 with a 6.3 percent change from the previous year. Our ruling Teachers did get a salary increase in each of the past five years under Republican leadership. However, despite the "Held Harmless" statute, teachers who reach 25 years of experience or more today would not make as much as they would have in 2013-14. That’s the main wrinkle in Lee’s claim. North Carolina ranked second in fastest-rising teacher pay in 2016-17, though the ranking wasn’t consistent over the years. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-12411	Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich "apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/23/newt-gingrich/claim-slain-dnc-staffer-seth-rich-gave-emails-wiki/	It’s been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election, including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks. Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016. Seth Rich, who worked on voter access projects for the DNC, was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later, the case remains unsolved, though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery. WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich’s murder. The story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich’s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right. But the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day, and the Rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks’ source. Even so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. "We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments," Gingrich said on Fox May 21. "Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians." Contrary to Gingrich’s statement, the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim, Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory. Scant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG-TV on May 15. Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler’s investigation. Wheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich’s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor’s office and the DNC. "But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?" asked the WTTG-TV reporter. "Absolutely," Wheeler replied. "Yeah, and that’s confirmed." The next day, a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheeler’s findings. And according to the federal investigator, an FBI analysis of Rich’s laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from DNC leaders. Here’s the problem: Hours after Fox published its report, Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he hadn’t seen the evidence himself, and his knowledge of Rich’s alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter, not his own investigative work. "Let me just really quickly say this," Wheeler said on Hannity’s show May 16. "I don't know for sure, I don't know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else, but it sure appears that way." Fox retracted its own May 16 article, saying "the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting." So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case. The theory also doesn’t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn’t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity. All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit. Lots of evidence Russia stole, then leaked, the emails The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints. The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups, dubbed APT28 and APT29, also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations. There’s also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well-documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT, a state-owned network, for example. Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russia’s culpability in official reports in October, December and January. And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since. "The final piece of Russia's modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked," said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent, in a March 30 Senate hearing. "The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years." There’s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn’t as robust as the DNC hack. "The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets," said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing. "Russia also collected on certain Republican Party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data." Our ruling Gingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich "apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians." There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery, not a political assassination. The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators — based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work. Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10382	We are "borrowing Saudi money for Saudi oil" with the result being "dependency and debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/20/john-mccain/pushing-the-envelope-to-link-debt-and-energy/	John McCain says we're borrowing money from foreign governments to buy oil. He's not too happy about this. ( Read our story on how other candidates make similar statements here .) "We are borrowing from foreign lenders to buy oil from foreign producers," he said in a Houston speech. "In the world's capital markets, often we are even borrowing Saudi money for Saudi oil. For them, the happy result is that they are both supplier and creditor to the most productive economy on earth. For us, the result is both dependency and debt. "Over time, in interest payments, we lose trillions of dollars that could have been better invested in American enterprises. And we lose value in the dollar itself, as our debt portfolio undermines confidence in the American economy." When McCain says "borrowing", he doesn't mean a literal loan from a foreign country's government. Rather, it's the investments that foreigners make -- through buying bonds, but also through investments in the private sector -- because they see America as a good place to invest their money and want to keep their wealth in dollars. Economists we talked to say McCain is right that collectively the United States as a whole spends more than it saves. "As a country, we borrow because American households save very little and the government runs large budget deficits. As a result, we have a saving deficit that can only be financed by borrowing from abroad," said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan research group. We also import much more oil than we produce -- a lot more -- and that leads us to the second part of McCain's debt equation. But there's no direct line between borrowing money from the Saudis and buying their oil, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC., who also blogs for the liberal magazine The American Prospect. "What McCain says about Saudi Arabia and oil would be equally true of any imported good from any country," Baker said. "China is also a huge buyer of dollars, so they are lending us the money to buy their clothes." Jerry Taylor, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, had the harshest assessment of McCain's comments. "All trade across borders implies some degree of 'dependency,' as John McCain seems to define the term. If 'dependency' is bad, then free trade is bad," Taylor wrote us via email. "Restricting investments to 'American enterprises' is to restrict profit opportunity." Bosworth says McCain is connecting problems -- low savings and dependence on costly foreign oil -- that are really separate issues. "I don't think that there is any link between oil prices causing the low saving of American households or the government's budget deficits," he said. "Both preceded the rise in oil prices. Some people will prefer a solution that increases energy supply and others will argue that it is time to reduce demand. I don't think the lack of saving will play much of a role." McCain is right in some of the larger themes he's expressing. The U.S. does borrow more than it saves, and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy expenditures. But the two phenomena aren't causally related. The Saudis aren't running a company store, where we're required to borrow from them to buy the product. Rather, these are two issues taking on new relevance because of dramatic increases in oil prices. McCain isn't entirely wrong, but by his choice of words he gives the impression that the two dynamics are working together. For this reason, we find his statement Half True.

pomt-13681	"As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-clinton-democrats-r/	Did Democrats rig the presidential debate schedule so the highly anticipated faceoffs would run opposite major sporting events? Donald Trump seems to think so. "As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games," he wrote in a July 29, 2016, tweet. "Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!" He was referring to the the first two debates -- Sept. 26, when the Atlanta Falcons are set to play the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night Football, and Oct. 9, when the New York Giants are scheduled to play the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football. Trump’s tweet underscores one of Trump’s recurring campaign themes -- that Hillary Clinton is "crooked," including playing with a stacked deck against her primary challenger, Bernie Sanders. Hard evidence to support the allegation of bad faith by the Democratic National Committee against Sanders in scheduling the primary debates is elusive, as we’ve noted. But what about the fall’s debate schedule, which includes three presidential and one vice presidential debate between Sept. 26 and Oct. 19? The short answer is that Trump is wrong: The national parties have no role in setting the dates for the general-election debates. They were actually determined by an independent, bipartisan organization, well in advance of when the parties’ nominees became clear this year. (Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry.) The debate-setting process Unlike primary debates, which are set by the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in collaboration with media outlets, the four general-election debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. While presidential debates were held in 1960, 1976, 1980 and 1984, the current system emerged in 1987 with the creation of the commission. At the time, it was co-chaired by two party leaders, Democrat Paul Kirk and Republican Frank Fahrenkopf. Those two men left their party positions in 1989, and since then the commission has included both Democrats and Republicans, along with journalists and other prominent figures, while staying away from people holding the parties’ official leadership positions. Fahrenkopf remains a co-chair, with Mike McCurry, a spokesman for then-President Bill Clinton, co-chairing for the Democrats. Democrats on the commission include former Rep. Jane Harman of California, while the Republicans include former Sens. John Danforth of Missouri and Olympia Snowe of Maine and former Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana. The commission works hard to avoid any suggestion of bias, said Alan Schroeder, a Northeastern University journalism professor and author of Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail. "The way to depoliticize is to do everything early -- the candidate-inclusion criteria, the dates and locations, the formats, " Schroeder said. In the case of the 2016 general election debates, Schroeder said in January 2015 the commission solicited bids from universities willing to host a debate, and announced the 16 applicants in April 2015. Most importantly for evaluating Trump’s tweet, the commission announced the dates and locations on Sept. 23, 2015. That’s almost 14 months before Election Day. Back then, the Republican field had 17 candidates and there was widespread skepticism that Trump could win the nomination. Clinton, for her part, was the frontrunner but facing a spirited challenge from Sanders. Equally important, the NFL schedule wasn’t set until April 14, 2016 -- about seven months after the commission announced the debate dates. It shouldn’t be a surprise that there would be a game on a Sunday or a Monday night -- the NFL has been playing football on Monday nights since 1970 and on Sunday nights since 1987. But it’s something of a game of triage when trying to avoid sporting events at that time of year. Besides professional football, debate planners typically have to contend with playoff baseball and Saturday college football. "In choosing the dates, the commission sits down with a calendar to look at network programming -- the Olympics, playoff games, religious holidays," Schroeder said. "It’s never a clear calendar -- there are always conflicts of some kind or another. So they pick the best days possible and days that would generate most viewership." The debate commission echoed this theme when it responded to Trump’s tweet with this statement: "The Commission on Presidential Debates started working more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debates. It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles. A debate has never been rescheduled as a result. "As a point of reference, in a four-year period, there are four general election debates (three presidential and one vice presidential) and approximately 1,000 NFL games. "The CPD selects the debate dates a year in advance in order for the television networks to have maximum lead time and predictability in scheduling these extremely important civic education forums. The CPD believes the dates for the 2016 debates will service the American public well." In 2012, the final presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama was scheduled on a Monday night that happened to be opposite a professional football game between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears, and Game 7 of the National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals. And of course, for Americans torn between football and politics, there are more options today than ever, including DVR and online streaming. Put it all together, Schroeder said, and the "idea of anyone gaming that process is really inconceivable." Our ruling Trump said that Clinton and her party "are trying to rig the debates" so that NFL games drain away viewers. However, neither Clinton nor her party were involved in setting up the dates for the general-election debates, as they were during the primary debates. Instead, that task falls to a bipartisan commission that has no connection to either the campaigns or the parties. In fact, the debate dates were chosen seven months before the NFL schedule was even released, making scheduling conflicts almost unavoidable -- not the work of one campaign or party.

pomt-09448	"The Florida Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion" in the 2009 session.	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/08/charlie-justice/charlie-justice-says-legislature-raised-2-billion-/	Facing a staggering budget shortfall last year, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature had to make some tough decisions. Lawmakers relied on $5 billion in federal stimulus money, trimmed Medicaid reimbursement rates and cut several hundred government jobs. They also raised taxes and fees, a move that didn't sit well with Sen. Charlie Justice, D-St. Petersburg, who is running for the congressional seat now held by Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young. "The Florida Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion" in the 2009 legislative session, Justice claimed in a press release. He said the new taxes fell disproportionately on the middle class and that lawmakers should end exemptions to the sales tax and corporate income tax that "cater to corporate special interests." Republicans say their goal was to maintain basic levels of service while still cutting government. (State spending has dropped more than $7 billion since 2006-07, largely because of plummeting tax collections.) "We were in kind of a unique situation last year," said Todd Reid, the staff director for House Majority Leader Adam Hasner. Reid said that Florida had to maintain previous levels of education and health care spending to qualify for stimulus funds. "We felt we had reduced about as much as we could at that point." Given the size of the budget shortfall and the state's high unemployment rate -- it was 11.8 percent in December -- lawmakers sought new revenue sources. But $2 billion in tax and fee hikes? From a Legislature dominated by Republicans? We wondered if that was right. According to the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, the number mostly checks out. The office, which crunches budget figures for the Legislature, published a handy spreadsheet that details all of the laws passed in 2009 that affected state revenue, either positively or negatively. They include: - $935 million from a $1-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. - $797 million from sharp fee increases to get a driver's license or new car tags. - $304 million in higher business taxes to replenish Florida's bankrupt unemployment compensation trust fund. - $195 million from fee increases for filing various types of court motions. The bottom-line projection for the budget year that ends in June: A little more than $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees (in a total state budget of $66.5 billion). So Justice was actually a little low. Two caveats: On the first day of the 2010 legislative session, lawmakers voted to delay the increased unemployment compensation tax for two years. (The rate was scheduled to jump from $8 per employee for most businesses to more than $100.) Without that increase, the total in new taxes and fees drops below $2 billion. But even though they put off the tax increase, lawmakers still approved it in 2009. Also, it's worth noting the Legislature didn't increase taxes all by itself. Gov. Charlie Crist had veto power over every revenue increase and chose to strike only two small items from the budget. Still, Justice's comment about new taxes is generally correct. State economists confirm that lawmakers passed new taxes totaling more than $2 billion last session. Even though he was slightly low, Justice was close enough to earn a True.

pomt-13938	Says Russ Feingold’s "campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/22/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-right-about-russ-feingolds-campaign/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont loves to boast about his independence from super PACs and billionaires, saying his campaign relies on the support of small donors. Recently, the Democratic presidential hopeful extended his small donor claim to Russ Feingold. Sanders sent out a news release May 26, 2016 that said he would be raising money for Feingold, a former U.S. senator who is aiming to unseat Republican incumbent Ron Johnson in a rematch of their 2010 contest. Sanders also sent an email to his national fundraising list. "We are going to have to elect candidates up and down the ballot who recognize that it is too late for establishment politics and economics," Sanders wrote. "Candidates like my friend, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold." Sanders continued: "Russ led the fight with me to make the Affordable Care Act much stronger in 2009. He voted against the USA PATRIOT Act and the war in Iraq. He authored and passed landmark campaign finance reform legislation and his campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours." That last accolade caught our eyes. Sanders’s record-breaking level of small-contribution support has been well noted. We wondered if small donors were also "powering" Feingold’s campaign. Sanders’ backup Typically, small donors are considered those who give $200 or less over an election cycle. Having a lot of small-dollar contributions can indicate strong grassroots support and an effective online fundraising effort. When asked to back up the statement, Sanders’ team sent us to a news release issued by Feingold’s campaign in April 2016. At that time, the release said, 30,000 Wisconsinites had contributed to Feingold’s campaign with money coming in from each of the state’s 72 counties. The release also claimed 96 percent of all contributions in the first quarter were $100 or less. The problem for fact-checkers -- it cannot be independently verified. PolitiFact National explored the issue when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said "our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support." Her team provided similar information, saying more than 50 percent of the money raised by the campaign came from "online grassroots donations," with 98 percent smaller than $250. Until an individual donor surpasses $200 in contributions, their funds are unitemized on campaign disclosure reports. So the number of donors who give less than $200 is unknown. Numbers reported to the Federal Elections Commission provided weak support for Clinton’s statement, PolitiFact National found. And small donors accounted for less than 20 percent of Clinton’s total donations, according to those figures. The claim was rated Mostly False. FEC numbers The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group, tracks money given to candidates from individuals and PACs, as well as those self-financing their campaigns and money contributed from other means. Sanders’ profile on the group’s web site reports that 99 percent of his campaign’s more than $200 million in funds has come from individual contributions (as opposed, for instance, to political action committees). Of that, 62 percent -- or more than $129 million -- was from contributions of $200 or less. The other part comes from large individual contributions of up to $2,700. So what about Sanders’ Wisconsin pal, Feingold? According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Feingold has raised more than $10 million in the race against Johnson. Like Sanders, an overwhelming amount of his funds, 93 percent, come from individual contributions. But, Feingold has received a larger share of donations from large donors than small ones. Feingold received 52 percent of his overall funds from people who gave more than $200. Another 41 percent came from small individual donors. He also received about $600,000 from PAC contributions. So, the majority of Sanders’ funding -- 62 percent -- comes from these small donors while 41 percent of Feingold’s funding came from small donors. The phrase "powered by," of course, is open to some interpretation. We took a look at candidates in other competitive Senate races across the country this election cycle. Most candidates received less than 20 percent of all campaign funds from small donors. Some approached 30 percent -- still far below the proportion of funds Feingold has raised from small donors. So, while Feingold is not above 50 percent -- and does not match Sanders’ level -- we feel like the claim is generally on target. It doesn’t factor into this claim, but as a point of reference, Johnson has raised just less than $12 million. Individuals donated about 80 percent of that money. He has gotten a far greater share of his contributions from big spenders -- those donating between $200 and $2,700 this election cycle. Just 15 percent of his funds come people who donate less than $200, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Our rating Sanders said in a fundraising letter that Feingold’s "campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours." Both the presidential and congressional hopefuls have received the majority of their support from individual donors. While small donors have played a role in Feingold’s funding, they’re not as integral as Sanders’ small donors. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05373	Crime rises in communities with casinos.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/09/georgia-family-council/linking-crime-casinos-not-always-safe-bet/	Developer Dan O’Leary is pushing a big idea that he says will bring scores of jobs and truckloads of money to Georgia. The state’s most powerful political leaders, however, don’t like his plan -- a casino-style entertainment complex with video lottery terminals that could be a source of lottery revenue for the state’s HOPE scholarship program. One group offered another reason to fight O’Leary’s plan that had the Truth-O-Meter spinning like a roulette wheel. The Georgia Family Council put together a fact sheet that said crime will increase if any form of casino-style gambling is allowed. PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be interesting to see if the council was gambling with the facts with its claim. O’Leary, part of a team that operates Underground Atlanta, wants to build the complex near the busy I-85 interchange at Jimmy Carter Boulevard in Gwinnett County. At one meeting last month, the Gwinnett-based council presented an argument why O’Leary’s plan is not a good idea. Some of the crime statistics included: "A city can expect its crime rate to increase by 8 percent within four to five years of introducing casinos." "After casinos opened in Atlantic City, the total number of crimes within a 30-mile radius increased 100 percent." Much of the research on crime and casinos was done slightly more than a decade ago when more states permitted casinos. Some experts say most of the reports are flawed. The council’s policy analyst, Toby Tatum, sent us several reports to back up the organization’s claim. Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm representing O’Leary, sent us information to support that side. PolitiFact Georgia took a look at their reports, and some research we found ourselves. It’s been generally believed that casinos result in more crime in the surrounding community, primarily because of concerns about organized crime. In the 1990s, experts said in one report that for each dollar in legalized gambling, there is a similar amount in illegal gambling. There have been occasional news reports of cases like gamblers committing insurance fraud to get more money to feed their addiction or stories of people embezzling money from their employer for gambling. A 2004 Department of Justice-sponsored study found pathological gamblers more likely to be arrested for such offenses as probation or parole violations, liquor law violations, trespassing and other public order offenses. There’s evidence that casinos may have an impact in less likely areas, such as driving under the influence. One Journal of Health Economics report found there is a higher percentage (9.2 percent) of DUI fatalities in counties with casinos. They are more likely to occur in rural counties, but less likely in urban areas. In 1999, a federal panel released what was considered the most comprehensive study on casinos in America in a quarter-century. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission wrote there is insufficient data to determine whether casinos cause more crime. "The problem is that although a great deal has been written on the subject, so much of the writing on all sides is bombast and blather that it is difficult to discern any strong facts," the report said. Still, the commission concluded: "Taken as a whole, the literature shows that communities with casinos are just as safe as communities that do not have casinos." One of the most widely discussed studies on the topic was released in 2001 and co-authored by University of Georgia associate economics professor David Mustard. The study found some crime could decline because more less-skilled workers get jobs working at casinos and that the casinos improve economically depressed locations. Conversely, it found crime may rise because casinos draw unsavory characters and some compulsive gamblers commit crime to get more money to gamble. The study covered all 3,165 U.S. counties from 1977-1996. The study concluded that casinos increased all crimes except murder. Most offenses showed that the impact of casinos on crime began about three years after a casino opened. Eight percent of property crime and 10 percent of violent crime in counties with casinos was due to the presence of a casino, the study found. More recent news accounts of crime and casinos offer support to both sides of the debate. The Press of Atlantic City reported in September that the violent crime rate there was highest among the top-ranked gaming markets in the U.S., according to an analysis of 2010 federal crime statistics. Police Department leaders in that city and some researchers note that the Atlantic City statistics do not consider that the crime rate is based on its population of 39,000, rather than the 29 million visitors the city sees each year. In February, The Associated Press examined crime rates in areas near two large Connecticut casinos opened in the 1990s: the Foxwoods Resort and Mohegan Sun. The news organization looked at crime rates for several years before they opened and afterward and reported crime dropped by double-digit percentages in the nearby municipalities compared to the years before the casinos opened — mirroring a drop in crime nationwide. Few gambling facilities, though, are similar to what O’Leary has in mind in Georgia. The most frequent comparison is Dover Downs, located in Delaware. Dover Downs is one of the few casinos with video lottery terminals, which resemble slot machines. Jim Hutchison, a former Dover mayor and retired Dover police chief, worried about crime and other unruly elements when the state approved casino gambling in the mid-1990s. "It's nice to say that after all the years they've been operating here in Delaware, specifically Dover Downs, all those concerns I had are truly unfounded," Hutchison, who has testified to Georgia lawmakers on behalf of Dover Downs, the city's biggest taxpayer, told the AJC in March. There is some research that shows crime does increase in communities with casinos. There are some reports, such as the AP investigation, that show a drop in crime in some communities with casinos. The anecdotal evidence from Hutchison suggests crime hasn’t increased since Dover Downs opened. To say the least, the evidence is mixed. Crime has gone down in some areas with casinos. It has increased in others. But there does appear to be some truth to the council’s claim, though it needs a lot of context to move the needle higher on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate the council’s claim as Half True.	None	Georgia Family Council	None	None	None	2012-05-09T06:00:00	2012-04-19	['None']

pomt-03070	"The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — (voted) to keep our government open."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/30/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-democrats-and-republicans-senate/	As the United States government hurtles toward a shutdown, the blame game is well under way. Congress and the White House are at loggerheads over what to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law. Major aspects of the law are set to go live on Oct. 1, the same day as funding for the federal government runs out. But efforts to keep the funding flowing have floundered on the demand of some Republicans to defund or delay the law. The president, for his part, has refused to eliminate or pare back his signature legislative achievement. We noticed two similar, but opposite, claims about how the parties broke on key votes in the conflict. Here, we will look at a claim by Obama. In a separate fact-check, we’ll look at one by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Obama’s comment on Sept. 27, 2013, came shortly after the Senate passed a bill to keep federal funding flowing but without a provision that would defund Obama’s law. "If Congress chooses not to pass a budget by Monday — the end of the fiscal year — they will shut down the government, along with many vital services that the American people depend on," Obama said in an appearance before reporters in the White House. "The good news is, within the past couple of hours, the United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open and delivering the services the American people expect." Was it accurate to say that "The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open"? As Politico noted shortly after Obama made the claim, Obama is incorrect, at least by the most literal reading. The final measure passed by a 54-42 margin, with two Republicans not voting. All 54 who voted for the measure were either Democrats or independents who caucus with the Democrats. All 42 who voted against the measure were Republicans. Not a single member of the Senate crossed party lines on that vote. When we asked the White House to explain, a spokesman pointed not to the final vote but rather to the preliminary vote to proceed to debate, known as a "cloture vote." Being able to proceed to a final vote requires reaching a 60-vote threshold, assuming all senators are present and voting. In this case, the cloture vote did indeed pass by a 79-19 margin, with two senators not voting. Of the 79 votes in favor of cloture, 25 came from Republicans -- a strong showing in these polarized days. "I'd refer you to the comments of Senate Republicans on the Senate floor on Thursday and Friday who voted for cloture, saying that they opposed Obamacare but that they didn't believe they should shut down the government over it," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. "So, they voted to keep it open. That was a strong bipartisan vote." The White House has a point that not every Republican who voted against the "clean" continuing resolution on final passage -- that is, on the version that was stripped of the language to defund Obamacare -- did so to protest the removal of the defunding language. To the contrary, the proposal, advanced by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and others, deeply split the Republican Party over legislative tactics. However, Obama went too far when he said the "Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open." He didn’t say that Democrats and Republicans alike preferred to avoid a shutdown, a claim that would be largely accurate. He specifically said members of both parties voted to advance that goal. The problem, veterans of congressional procedure say, is that the significant Republican support for cloture should be seen as a way to move the process along, so that all options can be exhausted, not as an expression that they support the underlying bill. Only Democrats, not Republicans, voted in a way that supported the final version of the bill. "The cloture vote is a vote to end debate, and not on the substance of the matter you are voting to end debate on," said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee. The fact that so many Republicans supported ending debate, he said, suggests they "wanted to advance the ball to expedite the ping-pong match of negotiations over various options before the fiscal new year's ball hit the ground." Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, added that he sees "a kernel of truth" in the statement, but one "surrounded by a lot of fleshy falsehood." Our ruling Obama said, "The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open." The president has a point that 25 Republicans backed a procedural motion to proceed to the bill itself. But experts said that when analyzing Obama’s comment, it’s more important to note that not a single Republican ultimately voted "to keep our government open" when the chamber took up the bill itself. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-09-30T17:21:10	2013-09-27	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'United_States_Senate']

pomt-03746	Air travelers "can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check" on them.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/09/dannel-malloy/air-travelers-get-background-checks-some-gun-buyer/	Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, whose state is still mourning the massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, is pushing for a federal expansion of background checks on gun purchases. In an interview on MSNBC, Malloy cited strong public support for expanded checks and claimed that another, more pedestrian area of American life is more tightly controlled than weapon transfers. "I’m a governor. I can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me, but I could go places in this country and buy a weapon and not have that done. It makes no sense to anybody, quite frankly," he said. We wondered if that’s true -- that air travelers are subject to background checks, and how it compares with the requirements on gun purchases. First, guns. Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers -- such as those selling at gun shows -- to do such background checks. Gun control advocates want the background check requirement expanded to cover those and other private purchases. According to federal figures, applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected for having a prior criminal conviction or restraining order, being a fugitive from justice or in the United States illegally, being under indictment or having been dishonorably discharged from the military. Others are denied because they failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form. So what’s required of air travelers? Malloy’s spokeswoman, Juliet Manalan, told us that Malloy was referring to the Secure Flight program, created in response to the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation of uniform pre-screening of passenger information against government watch lists. The program, run by the Transportation Security Administration, requires airline passengers to provide their name, date of birth and gender to be matched against watch lists including the "no fly" list. That list, which is classified, contains the names of suspected terrorists who are barred from boarding planes flying in or out of the United States. It does not bar felons or other convicted criminals from flying. "In short: there is a list that prevents people from boarding a plane, but no list that prevents people who shouldn’t have firearms from purchasing them," Manalan said. So there’s a list, but is there a background check? Not exactly, and not a criminal one. "Passengers names are checked against the no-fly and selectee list via the Secure Flight process, but they do not undergo the fingerprint-based criminal history record check/security threat assessment process that airport/airline employees undergo," said Jeffrey Price, an aerospace professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Douglas Laird, an independent aviation security expert, called it a stretch to describe the airline procedure as a background check. "TSA runs the data received from the airlines computer reservations systems through various databases, but this is not a background check by any stretch of the imagination," Laird said. Still, there is a definite security element to the airlines’ process. "It is basic information, but the airlines could use it for a background check. I believe that is what (Malloy) is trying to say," said Clifford Winston, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution. "I don’t think it is the case that before you can buy a ticket, you have to undergo a background check." Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with the advisory firm Hudson Crossing, added, "It may not be a true ‘background check,’ but passenger data is passed through a database (possibly more than one) to detect possible terrorists." Our ruling Malloy said he "can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me," while less oversight exists for gun purchases. Background checks on gun purchases -- which assess a person’s criminal history -- do not apply to the private transfer of weapons, only to purchases from licensed gun dealers. And it’s true that many guns are bought legally with no background check. But the Secure Flight program does not check people’s legal history in the same way. It compares passenger information with lists of suspected terrorists. It’s a security measure, but not a true background check. Though unlike with guns, it applies to everyone. Malloy’s statement is only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Dannel Malloy	None	None	None	2013-04-09T11:32:16	2013-04-03	['United_States']
pomt-03999	Says Texas ranks last in the percentage of residents with high school diplomas.	true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/08/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-ranks-last-res/	In an editorial poking at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to ogle Texas, the Sacramento Bee's editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways. The editorial says, for instance: "Yes, come check out Texas. Check out a state that ranks dead last in the percent of its population with high school diplomas." (Click here to read our evaluations of more Bee claims.) Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, pointed us to an Aug. 22, 2011, San Francisco Chronicle news article on Perry’s record. That story draws on the Legislative Study Group, a caucus of the Texas House whose staff analyzes legislation and makes recommendations to its members, which during the 2011 session included one Republican and 48 Democrats. The story quotes the study group as saying Texas is "dead last in the number of residents over 25 who have a high school diploma." Texas was last by its lonesome a few years ago, we found, but it shared the dubious ranking with California and another state in 2011, the latest year researched. Nationally in 2011, nearly 86 percent of adults 25 or older had completed high school or the equivalent, according to results from that year’s American Community Survey, a mail survey that the U.S. Census Bureau annually sends to more than 2 million households. Among the states, Montana led the nation, with 92.3 percent of adults clearing the high-school hurdle, according to the survey, while Texas ranked last, with 81.1 percent of its adults having completed high school. However, the Texas rate matched the rates for Mississippi and California, according to the bureau. For both Texas and California, the bureau says, the margin of error was plus or minus 0.2 percentage points. States with better results included Louisiana (82.5 percent); Alabama (82.7 percent); Kentucky (83.1 percent); New Mexico (83.2 percent); and Arkansas (83.8 percent), the bureau says. We asked the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter, about the bureau’s figures. By email, Potter said the survey is "really the one standard we have for cross-state comparisons." He pointed out, too, that the Texas tie with two states in 2011 marks an improvement from 2010, when the survey indicated Texas was tied for last with California, and from 2009, when the survey placed Texas last by itself. Our ruling The Bee’s editorial board said Texas ranks last in its share of residents with high school diplomas. That’s right, though Texas lately has company. In 2011, the Lone Star state tied for last with Mississippi and California. In each state, 81.1 percent of adults 25 and older had completed high school or the equivalent, the government says.

pomt-07589	"A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/25/worldnetdaily/planned-parenthood-funding-did-gao-really-find-mil/	Congress is looking to reduce federal spending, and one of the organizations under scrutiny is Planned Parenthood, a group that promotes contraception and family planning. Planned Parenthood is also a well-known abortion provider. Opponents of abortion charge that while Planned Parenthood gets federal dollars ostensibly tagged for preventive health care -- things like pap smears and HIV prevention -- the money supports the overall organization and its abortion services. We noticed one argument made by several websites and columnists recently, that Planned Parenthood was awarded more money from the federal government than it spent. One of the earlier versions of the claim was from the conservative website WorldNetDaily. A July 2010 news report said: "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008." WorldNetDaily’s statement was made last year, but we feel it’s fair to check since it’s being repeated now that Planned Parenthood is again in the news. WorldNetDaily went on to note that Planned Parenthood had received $2.02 billion in federal grants from 2002 through 2008, even though "the nation's largest abortion-industry player only reported spending $657.1 million of the taxpayer funds." Did the GAO find that $1.3 billion in funds went missing? We decided to check it out. The official number: $657.1 million The Government Accountability Office report in question, published May 28, 2010, compiled federal funds disbursed to family planning agencies for the fiscal years 2002 to 2009. The agencies included Advocates for Youth, the Guttmacher Institute, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Population Council and the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States. Members of Congress who requested the report oppose funding for abortion providers. But we should note that the GAO is a nonpartisan, respected office, whose findings are often cited by both parties. The report documented how much different groups received from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for HIV/AIDS, family planning, and reproductive health, both in the United States and abroad. The report stated that Planned Parenthood spent $657.1 million in federal funds between 2002 and 2009. That was the amount Planned Parenthood itself reported to the government in the form of audited annual reports, which the GAO described as "sufficiently reliable for our purposes." The WorldNetDaily account said unequivocally that "the GAO report said that Planned Parenthood had received $2.02 billion in federal grants from 2002 through 2008 but that the nation's largest abortion-industry player only reported spending $657.1 million of the taxpayer funds." But there was no statement nor any evidence anywhere in the GAO report that Planned Parenthood received $2.02 billion or that any money was missing. The other number: $2 billion The first reference we found to $2 billion or more was a June 2010 op-ed in the Washington Times by Rita Diller, the national director of Stop Planned Parenthood, which is part of the American Life League. (Diller is quoted in the WorldNetDaily story. We contacted her for comment but did not hear back.) In 2010, Diller wrote that "Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s (PPFA) audits show the organization spent just $657.1 million between 2002 and 2008 from federal government grants and programs, but the abortion behemoth’s own annual reports show that it took in $2.3 billion from government grants and programs during the same time period." Unlike WorldNetDaily, Diller made it clear that she was questioning the difference between the GAO report and Planned Parenthood's previously published numbers. Diller’s Stop Planned Parenthood web site tracks money that Planned Parenthood lists in its annual reports. According to those reports, Planned Parenthood received a total of $2.02 billion in federal funding for the years 2002 to 2008. We compared the information from Diller’s site with Planned Parenthood’s actual annual reports and found the numbers appeared to be in order. Different ways to count the money So the GAO report never said that there was $2 billion in funds with only $657 million spent. But it still raises the question: Why the difference between the GAO report and Planned Parenthood’s annual reports? The report itself explains one difference. GAO said it was not able to count all the federal funds that ultimately go to Planned Parenthood, because sometimes the group receives government contracts or grants indirectly. The Department of Health and Human Services, for example, gives grants to states that then give money to Planned Parenthood. Similarly, USAID gives money to other groups that sometimes subcontract with Planned Parenthood. The report didn’t include those funds. "As a result, obligations and disbursements in this report may understate the actual amount of federal funds provided to the selected organizations and their affiliates," the report noted. We next contacted Planned Parenthood. Spokesman Tait Sye offered several additional reasons for the difference between the amount in the GAO report and Planned Parenthood's numbers. • In its annual reports, Planned Parenthood reports all government funding as one category, which includes federal, state and local funding. The GAO report counted only direct federal funding. • Planned Parenthood sometimes gets money from Medicaid, a state-federal partnership that offers health insurance to the poor. The GAO report does not appear to count money from Medicaid. • Planned Parenthood has more than 80 affiliates, many of which get subcontracts paid for with federal funding. The GAO report noted that it only counted money for 21 affiliates. Finally, Sye noted that the federal funding Planned Parenthood receives is routinely audited to make sure it is spent appropriately. Our ruling WorldNetDaily wrote, "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008." We found other websites making similar claims. The GAO never reported that Planned Parenthood and its affiliates couldn’t find $1.3 billion. It simply said that Planned Parenthood spent $657.1 million. The GAO also didn’t say that there was any sort sort of discrepancy or that money was missing, as the headline on WorldNetDaily’s news report said. The website's conclusion was reached by looking at numbers not even mentioned in the GAO report. In fact the statement conflates two different sets of numbers and is an extreme case of comparing apples to oranges, taking one number calculated by the GAO, and another calculated by adding numbers published in Planned Parenthood’s annual reports. The difference is what is claimed to be missing. Planned Parenthood includes all federal, state and local money under the category "government grants and contracts" in its annual reports. The GAO only looked at direct federal funding and noted it was likely undercounting the amount Planned Parenthood receives. The statement irresponsibly suggests misappropriation of federal funds without any evidence. That makes it not just false, but ridiculously so. As a result, we rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-02241	"Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/apr/14/new-hampshire-republican-party/nh-gop-says-jeanne-shaheen-votes-obama-99-percent-/	With midterm elections on the horizon, Republicans have targeted incumbent U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for her support of President Barack Obama and his health care reform law. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- remains unpopular in the state, according to findings from the WMUR Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. The New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video in March 2014 aimed at capitalizing on those trends. Titled "99 Percent," the video asserts that Shaheen consistently supports the president and "votes with Obama 99 percent of the time." "Sen. Shaheen can run, but she can’t hide from her loyal and unwavering support of the Obama-Biden agenda," NHGOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said in a statement that accompanied the clip. Democrats across the country have been targeted with similar critiques, with varying degrees of accuracy. In 2012, the Ohio Republican Party claimed that Democratic U.S. Sen Sherrod Brown voted with Obama 95 percent of the time. PolitiFact found that claim to be True. In Alaska, one of Sen. Mark Begich’s Republican opponents claimed Begich supported the president’s economic policies 97 percent of the time. That statement earned a Mostly False rating, because the numbers looked at more than just Obama’s economic policies. In reality, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen’s voting record. The 2014 New Hampshire Senate race is shaping up to be a closely watched contest with former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown entering the race on the GOP side. We asked the NHGOP for some evidence to back up their statement about Shaheen’s support for Obama. Executive Director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly’s annual presidential position votes report. CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support, or the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position. The 2013 CQ analysis shows that, out of the pool of votes on which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen’s vote matched the president’s stance 99 percent of the time. We found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year. Overall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen’s votes have aligned with the president’s position 98 percent of the time. That’s pretty close to the figure offered by the state Republican party. However, it’s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen’s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis. Shaheen communications director Shripal Shah said the former New Hampshire governor only votes with Obama when it "makes sense for New Hampshire." At times, she has broken with the president, and in some cases on issues that have not come to a vote. For instance, Shah noted that Shaheen opposes an Internet sales tax -- something Obama has endorsed. She also spoke out against another round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits. There are also other ways to measure Shaheen’s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That’s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list. In October 2013, a column published in The Telegraph of Nashua by veteran New Hampshire political reporter Kevin Landrigan stated that Shaheen "has had success throughout her political career by carving out issues over which she has crossed party lines to try to get results." And in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a "Bipartisan Champion" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation. Shaheen’s camp also pointed to the relatively small set of votes considered in the Congressional Quarterly analysis of presidential support. In 2013, for example, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on only 108 of those votes, or about one third. Many were votes on presidential nominations. "It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes," Shah said. That’s a valid point. But Shaheen didn’t show the same reluctance to evaluate politicians based on presidential support when she first ran for a U.S. Senate seat. During a 2008 debate with then-Sen. John E. Sununu, Shaheen said that Sununu voted with President George W. Bush 90 percent of the time. The NHGOP directed us to a video recording of the debate. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time. Indeed, in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. And overall, her votes have aligned with the president’s wishes 98 percent of the time since she took office. We should note that it’s fairly common for a senator to vote in support of a president of the same party and in some cases Shaheen has broken from the President. Still, NHGOP’s claim about Shaheen wasn’t far off. If the party had specified it was referring only to votes in 2013, the advertisement would have been right on the money. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	New Hampshire Republican Party	None	None	None	2014-04-14T16:30:09	2014-03-24	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-15015	"States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/06/barack-obama/obama-more-gun-laws-means-fewer-gun-deaths/	In the wake of a Oct. 1 shooting spree in Oregon that killed 10, many -- including President Barack Obama -- are calling for more gun control laws. "There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America," Obama said in remarks the day of the shooting. "So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens, and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence." There is plenty of debate over the effectiveness of gun control laws, so we decided to dig into Obama’s sweeping claim: that "states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths." We ran this claim past several experts and found that the statistic generally holds up, but the implications are less clear. Cause and effect The meat of the claim comes from a 2015 National Journal investigation, which concluded that "the states with the most gun laws see the fewest gun-related deaths." The report considered seven types of gun control: handgun permits, background checks, handgun registries, "stand your ground" laws, concealed carry permits, open carry permits and gun purchase waiting period. It found that states that had generally more restrictive laws within these categories generally had fewer annual gun deaths. Here’s a chart by National Journal showing the states with the fewest and most gun deaths per 100,000 people, compared to each state’s’ gun laws (more blue = more restrictive laws). You should look at the chart that shows all 50 states. There are some limitations to this kind of research, notably that they do not determine cause-and-effect: whether a state has fewer gun deaths because of the law, said Adam Winkler, a University of California Los Angeles law professor and second amendment expert. Other demographic characteristics -- such as education level, marital stability, rural or urban -- might explain the fewer gun deaths in a particular state. Setting that caveat aside, Winkler said Obama’s statement is true. There are also a couple of outliers to National Journal’s report. For example, New Hampshire has some of the least restrictive gun laws but also the seventh-lowest gun death rate. An academic study published by the American Medical Association in 2013 found similar results: "A higher number of firearm laws in a state was associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state." In a commentary on the 2013 study, Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, pointed out that the correlation between restrictive laws and fewer deaths "essentially disappeared" when firearm ownership rates were taken into account. "Perhaps these laws decrease mortality by decreasing firearm ownership, in which case firearm ownership mediates the association," Wintemute wrote. "But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low — there will be less opposition to them — and firearm ownership confounds the association." While wary of making such a general claim, Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said Obama’s claim is generally accurate. In many states, individual gun laws have shown to be associated with fewer gun-related deaths. He linked us to some of his own research showing, for example, a reduction in murders committed with firearms followed a handgun purchase permit law in Connecticut. In contrast, the repeal of a permit law in Missouri preceded a rise in firearm-caused murders. We looked for evidence to contradict Obama’s statement, and found several complaints from those who favor gun rights. James Agresti, a gun control expert for the conservative-leaning think tank Just Facts, wrote in an email to reporters that statements like Obama’s are "meaningless" and "subjective and ill-defined," linking to a Just Facts article that said classification systems that evaluate gun laws state-by-state can be "haphazard." Agresti added that the claim ignores the number of lives saved by defensive gun use, and the fact that some states with highest gun-ownership rates also have low homicide rates. Overall, though, we found nothing that offered an outright contradiction to the National Journal analysis. States with laws that restrict guns do tend to have lower death rates, as Obama said. Suicide vs. homicide A notable critique of Obama’s claim is that these gun deaths include suicides -- which account for more than half of all gun deaths -- and Obama was delivering remarks in the context of how to prevent future mass shootings. While research does show that gun laws correlate with fewer firearm-caused suicides, there’s not universal agreement on the effect of gun laws on murders. In his commentary on the 2013 study, Wintemute noted that the vast majority of the observed decrease in gun deaths were suicides. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did a calculation of their own and found that when suicides are taken out of the picture, there’s not as clear a correlation between more gun laws and fewer non-suicide gun deaths. (They rated Obama’s statement as two out of four Pinocchios.) Obama’s use of this factoid is deceptive because he was selling gun control as a way to stymie murders, not suicide by gun, said David Kopel, a gun rights advocate and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver. He likened it to a car salesman telling a family a car is "safe, according to government studies." The family takes this to mean the car will protect them in an accident, but the salesman was actually referring to the fact that studies have found the car to be safe for the environment. Experts do, though, see reason to believe that stronger gun laws will reduce homicides, as well, even if the research isn’t conclusive yet. One survey of about 150 researchers actively publishing work on guns found that 71 percent believe that strong gun laws reduce the number of homicides, compared with12 percent who disagree. While there are always exceptions, "the research on the whole shows that if you make it more difficult for individuals -- especially individuals with a criminal background -- to obtain firearms you will prevent some gun-related criminal offenses," said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida who studies homicide and violent crime. Our ruling Obama said, "States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths." Research shows that the more gun laws a state has, the fewer gun deaths there are. Obama gets some wiggle room because he said "tend to" as opposed to making a definitive statement. The problem is, however, that this is an overly general statement. The research doesn’t prove a universal cause-and-effect relationship between gun laws and fewer gun deaths; it might just be a correlation. Some laws are more effective than others, and other cultural, demographic or socioeconomic factors might be the driving force behind the number of gun deaths in different states. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of James Agresti, to clarify his views and to provide links to his original commentaries.

pomt-07053	"What I have done -- and this is unprecedented ... is I've said to each agency ... 'look at regulations that are already on the books and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them.'"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/29/barack-obama/obama-claims-his-regulatory-review-unprecedented/	With the economy continuing to languish, many Republicans are clamoring to ease federal regulations on businesses as a way to goose job creation. In a press conference on June 29, 2011, President Barack Obama said that's a priority for him, too. In fact, he claimed, his administration was taking a never-done-before, government-wide look at existing regulations to eliminate ones that don't make sense. "One of the things that my administration has talked about is, is there in fact a tangle of regulations out there that are preventing businesses from growing and expanding as quickly as they should?" Obama said. "Keep in mind that, you know, the business community is always complaining about regulations," Obama said. "When unemployment's at 3 percent, and they're making record profits, they're going to still complain about regulations because, frankly, they want to be able to do whatever they think is going to maximize their profits. "I've got an obligation to make sure that we're upholding smart regulations that protect our air and protect our water and protect our food. You know, if you're flying on a plane, you want to make sure that there are some regulations in place to assure safety in air travel. And so there are some core regulations that we've got to maintain. "What I have done -- and this is unprecedented, by the way; no administration has done this before -- is I've said to each agency, 'Don't just look at current regulations or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that we're proposing. Let's go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them.'" We wondered if a systematic review of old regulations was really such an unprecedented effort. And we found it isn't. In 1993, President Bill Clinton created the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), headed by Vice President Al Gore. Among other things the NPR was tasked with cutting regulatory red tape. On Sept. 30, 1993, when Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 calling for a comprehensive review of regulatory policy, he used language that sounds a lot like Obama's. Here's the directive on existing regulations: "In order to reduce the regulatory burden on the American people, their families, their communities, their State, local, and tribal governments, and their industries; to determine whether regulations promulgated by the executive branch of the Federal Government have become unjustified or unnecessary as a result of changed circumstances; to confirm that regulations are both compatible with each other and not duplicative or inappropriately burdensome in the aggregate; to ensure that all regulations are consistent with the President’s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order, within applicable law; and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of existing regulations: (a) Within 90 days of the date of this Executive order, each agency shall submit to OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs) a program, consistent with its resources and regulatory priorities, under which the agency will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified or eliminated so as to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective in achieving the regulatory objectives, less burdensome, or in greater alignment with the President’s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order." Elaine Kamarck, a special assistant to Gore who managed the project, told us via e-mail."We conducted, as part of the reinventing government initiative, a regulatory review that resulted in 16,000 pages being cut from the federal register." Kamarck is now a lecturer in public policy at Harvard. Here's how a June 13, 1995, story in the Washington Post described the results: President Clinton said good riddance to 16,000 pages of federal regulations yesterday and took special satisfaction in saying goodbye to a rule on how to test the consistency of southern grits. "I would wager a considerable amount of money that no one will ever write me a letter complaining about the demise of these regulations," Clinton told small business leaders, with all 16,000 pages stacked up next to his lectern. Clinton said the pages were being removed from the Code of Federal Regulations, out of 86,000 pages reviewed with an eye toward eliminating unnecessary red tape. James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Clinton's executive order directed all agencies to regularly review rules on their books. "That order is still in force, making the Obama directive technically redundant," Gattuso said. And Clinton wasn't the first to initiate comprehensive regulatory review, said Gattuso. In the early 1990's when Gattuso was on the staff of Vice President Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush ordered a 90-day (later extended another 120 days) moratorium and review of all existing regulations. "I was on the vice president’s staff at that time working on the initiative and have found the parallels (to now) striking," Gattuso said. In a Jan. 28, 1992, memo to department and agency heads on "Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation," Bush wrote: "I am concerned that, because of the constant pressure to develop new programs, we are not doing nearly enough to review and revise existing programs. For that reason, I ask that each of your agencies set aside a 90-day period, beginning today, to evaluate existing regulations and programs and to identify and accelerate action on initiatives that will eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burden or otherwise promote economic growth." Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, called Obama's comment a "nonsense claim." "I would question whether President Obama has done more in re-examining existing regulations than prior presidents, and if he has I would ask why he wasted the resources," Baker told us via e-mail. "Whatever it is called, presidents are always reviewing regulations to eliminate ones that impose unnecessary burdens." In fact, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report on July 16, 2007, states that, "Every president since President Carter has directed agencies to evaluate or reconsider existing regulations." Obama claims that his administration is doing something unprecedented -- "no administration has done this before," he said -- by having each agency review existing regulations, with an eye toward eliminating ones that don't make sense. Lots of presidents have done that. We rate Obama's statement Pants On Fire.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-06-29T18:55:22	2011-06-29	['None']

In a Dec. 2, 2012, opinion column in the San Antonio Express-News, Sherry Sylvester said Democrats will not regain ground in statewide elections until the party changes its financial backers and rejects policies routinely pushed in support of personal-injury trial lawyers, whom she called "the primary funders of Texas Democrats." The "personal-injury" descriptive applies to cases in which a plaintiff says injuries occurred due to the actions or negligence of another person or entity. The American Bar Association says most personal-injury cases arise from automobile accidents, though the label also extends to medical malpractice and other events. Sylvester further wrote: "Personal-injury trial lawyers not only have provided over 80 percent of the funding for the Texas Democratic Party for over a decade, trial lawyers provided virtually all the funding for the Bexar County Democratic Party in this election." We focused on the first part of that statement — that more than 80 percent of the state Democratic Party’s funding has come from personal-injury trial lawyers for over a decade, presuming this was not a claim about donations to individual candidates. Indeed, Sylvester said by phone, she based her analysis on the Texas Democratic Party’s contribution and expenditure reports for 2006 through 2010. She said, too, that she should not have said the percentage held "for over a decade" without checking the party’s finance reports for 2002 through 2004, which she did before following up with us by email. From 2002 through 2010, Sylvester said, the state party fielded nearly $15.7 million in contributions, not counting contributions from federal Democratic committees such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee clearly made in connection with federal races, which Sylvester said is not her focus. Sylvester said $11.75 million, or 75.4 percent of the adjusted total, came from personal-injury trial lawyers or groups steered by them, such as the Texas Democratic Trust, which was a political committee guided by the late Fred Baron, a Dallas lawyer. She later stressed that conclusions should not be reached for 2012 until end-of-year finance reports are filed in January 2013, though rolling in available information for the year only mildly reduces the overall percentage, to 74.7 percent. Next, we made our own run at identifying such contributions to the party from 2002 through fall 2012. This tally is imperfect given that we likely failed to catch some donations or, conversely, filter them out. We also did not research how many contributions were returned; that occasionally happens. At any rate, our calculation is that nearly $14 million of more than $18 million given to the party, or 75 percent, came from trial lawyer interests. Notably, though, the party’s draw from such contributors fluctuated year to year. In 2002, an election year that included every legislative seat and races for statewide office including governor and the U.S. Senate, more than 70 trial-lawyer-connected contributions accounted for about $5.4 million, or 81 percent, of the party’s $6.7 million in contributions, not counting the party-committee donations targeting federal races. Sylvester separately concluded that $5.5 million of $7.7 million in the party’s contributions, 71 percent, came from trial lawyer interests. In 2003, by our calculation, such contributions dipped to 26 percent of about $509,000 donated to the party. Such contributions accounted for 36 percent of the party’s donations in 2004 and 24 percent in 2005--well below 80 percent. Then again, such aid accounted for more than 70 percent of party donations from 2006 through 2010, topping out at 93 percent of donations in 2008. Such donations fell to 40 percent of total donations in 2011 and less than 30 percent part-way through 2012. The group steered by Baron was dominant through the decade, accounting for more than $5 million in contributions. But others also were crucial. Texas 2000, a group organized by trial lawyers, and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association accounted for more than $2.3 million in donations. The Beaumont-based law firm of Provost & Umphrey, ponied up $1 million through October 2008. Nix Patterson & Roach, which has offices in Texarkana, Dallas, Austin and Daingerfield, gave $925,000, while.Houston lawyer John O’Quinn, who has since died, donated $730,000. A Sept. 26, 2002, Austin American-Statesman news article quoted Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, which tracks campaign-finance spending, as saying that Texas 2000 and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association function just as the political committee of Texans for Lawsuit Reform. "Like-minded individuals appoint a treasurer, sit in a circle and throw some money in the hat," he said. Critics including Sylvester have noted that pro-trial groups often have names not revealing their pro-trial leans. Separately, we asked the Democratic Party and the trial-lawyers association about the decade-long share of donations from trial-lawyer interests. Party spokesman Jacob Limón emailed that since Gilberto Hinojosa won election as party chairman in June 2012, trial lawyers have not accounted for the majority of contributions--about $32,000 of $91,000 donated to the party between Hinojosa’s election through late September, 35 percent. Willie Chapman, spokesman for the trial-lawyers association, emailed that while it has not calculated the share of trial-lawyer contributions to either major party, his hunch is that, "whatever the percentage is, using the last decade gives a lot of weight to the multi-year commitment to the Democratic Party made by" Baron. Our ruling Sylvester wrote that for over a decade, personal-injury trial lawyers have accounted for over 80 percent of the Texas Democratic Party’s contributions. When we inquired, she pegged the percentage at 75 percent--what we found as well. So the published percentage is an exaggeration, though certainly trial lawyers have been dominant party benefactors. On another front, this statement failed to clarify that the share of lawyer contributions bounced around year to year. That is, personal-injury attorneys didn’t consistently account for over 80 percent of party receipts. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-06164	"Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns . . . Mitt Romney still won’t."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/democratic-national-committee/dnc-says-presidential-candidates-usually-release-t/	More than one political opponent has attempted to make an issue of Mitt Romney’s personal fortune. Romney’s years leading the private equity firm Bain Capital — which sometimes made money by laying off workers and closing businesses it had acquired — have led to charges that he is a creature of Wall Street and disconnected from the lives of average Americans. According to the financial disclosure required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission, Romney’s personal fortune is between $190 million and $250 million. All presidential aspirants are required to file Office of Government Ethics Form 278 with the Federal Election Commission. Details about Romney’s wealth are scarce, however, because he is only required to fill out the standard disclosure form about his assets. And unlike some past and present presidential candidates, Romney has not released his income tax returns during this campaign or in previous races for state and federal office. Another GOP contender, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, has called on Romney to go beyond the legal requirements and release his tax returns. Perry released his own returns in October 2011. The Democratic National Committee raised the tax return issue in a video released earlier this month, "What Is Mitt Romney Hiding?" In it, the DNC makes the point that Romney’s father, then-Michigan Gov. George Romney, released his tax returns during the 1968 primary campaign when he sought the Republican presidential nomination. George Romney put pressure on his opponents by releasing 12 years of income tax returns in November 1967. The DNC narrator states in the video: "Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns. ... Mitt Romney still won’t." So, do presidential candidates really have a tradition of releasing their tax returns? And has Mitt Romney refused to do so? What constitutes a tradition? In the post-Watergate era, many, but not all, primary candidates have released their personal tax returns, in some cases going back decades. Here's a sampling of some recent elections, based on news coverage, publicly available returns and a list put together by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that promotes ethics and accountability. Presidents and vice presidents routinely release their returns in office. 2008 Tax returns were an issue in the 2008 primary campaign. Sen. Barack Obama went first, releasing returns dating back to 2000 in March 2008. Sen. Hillary Clinton waited until April to release tax records dating back to 2000 for herself and former President Bill Clinton. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., also released tax returns during the primary, but Joe Biden didn’t release his returns until September, when Obama selected him as a running mate. John Edwards did not release tax returns, though he had released a decade of returns in September 2004, when he became John Kerry’s running mate. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who eventually won the Republican nomination, released his individual tax returns in April. Cindy McCain, his wife, initially refused but then released summaries for 2006 and 2007. Romney declined to release returns, as did former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who both had released tax returns during earlier runs for state and municipal office. 2004 All the major Democratic contenders for the nomination released at least one year of tax returns, a list that included Kerry and Edwards, as well as Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Richard Gephardt, Dennis Kucinich and Joseph Lieberman. 2000 George W. Bush largely cleared the GOP field early in the primary season. He and running mate Richard Cheney were the only Republicans to release returns. Vice President Al Gore and his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, of New Jersey, both released returns as well. Ralph Nader, whose third party candidacy played a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the general election, did not release his returns. 1996 Among GOP primary candidates in 1996, Sens. Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander and Jack Kemp released their tax returns. Publisher Steve Forbes, columnist Pat Buchanan and Sen. Richard Lugar did not. 1992 In April of that year, Bill Clinton released tax returns dating back to 1980. His closest rival for the nomination, former California governor Jerry Brown, did not. 1988 The top two Democrats in the race to face Vice President Bush, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, both released returns. 1984 The controversy over tax returns fell on the vice presidential candidates when Geraldine Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro, acquiesced to pressure and released their individual tax returns. After they did, the couple ended up paying more than $50,000 in back taxes. 1980 President Ronald Reagan, who like Romney had refused to release his tax returns during previous campaigns for state and federal office, relented in August and released his tax returns for 1979 after it became clear he was the likely nominee. Reagan’s chief rival for the 1980 nomination, George H.W. Bush, had released his in April, pressuring Reagan to do the same. 1976 Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford both released their 1975 tax returns and it was noted that an investment tax credit signed into law by Ford resulted in a significant tax windfall for a peanut warehouse owned by Carter. Is it true that Romney "won’t" release his tax returns? Romney’s camp did not respond to questions about if and when he would release his income tax returns. In response to the question when the Perry camp raised the issue, a Romney spokeswoman said the campaign would revisit the question during the next tax-filing season, presumably in April. Our Ruling Of 34 presidential and vice presidential candidates reviewed above, only seven -- Brown, Buchanan, Huckabee, Forbes, Giuliani, Lugar, Nader -- declined to release personal tax returns. So while most follow the practice, not all do. We rate the DNC’s claim Mostly True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-12-16T10:50:10	2011-12-06	['None']

pomt-14465	"Every Republican Senate candidate has now announced whether or not they support the Senate taking up the Supreme Court vacancy…except for Congressman Heck."	false	/nevada/statements/2016/mar/03/nevada-state-democratic-party/is-joe-heck-the-only-senate-candidate/	Reluctance by Senate Republicans to confirm President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia is giving Democrats across the country plenty of political ammunition. It’s also playing out in Nevada, where the state Democratic Party is repeatedly slamming Republican Senate candidate and U.S. Rep Joe Heck over his measured, non-committal position on filling the vacancy. Party operatives have unleashed at least five press releases and countless tweets and emails attacking Heck over his stated preference that "each entity should exercise its prerogative." But one attack stuck out as particularly noteworthy — the claim that "every" Republican Senate candidate other than Heck has announced a position on taking up the vacancy. Here’s what party spokeswoman Sarah Zukowski said: "Every Republican Senate candidate has now taken a position on the issue of whether the Senate should go a whole year without doing its job, but all we get from Congressman Heck are non-answers and Washington-speak," she said in a press release on Feb. 23. It’s quite a claim to say that literally every Republican senatorial candidate has taken a position on any issue, much less the politically-charged Supreme Court vacancy, so we decided to look into it. Journalists at the New York Times and liberal websites Think Progress and Daily Kos have tried to chart out where individual Senate Republicans stand on the issue of approving a nominee either now or under the next president. But those lists are mostly focused on the positions of sitting senators, and don’t include Senate hopefuls like Heck. So we put together a more complete list of what candidates and incumbent senators up for re-election in 2016 have said about the court vacancy using candidates listed in political scientist Larry Sabato’s "Crystal Ball." We found several who haven’t addressed the issue at all. In Maryland, for example, at least 14 candidates have filed as Republicans to run for the open Senate seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski. Only a handful of the candidates have functioning websites, and we could only find two candidates — Mark McNicholas and Chrysovalantis Kefalas — who even addressed the vacancy issue. It’s a similar case in Colorado, with 12 Republicans vying to take on incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet. Candidates there are all over the map, including some like state Sen. Tim Neville who have taken a similarly neutral or otherwise vague position. "As far as the schedule is concerned, the U.S. Senate is going to have the final say on who gets approved," he said to the Aurora Sentinel. "So whether it happens now or after the next election, the Republican Senate majority needs to stand strong and only confirm a nominee that will stand firm in defense of the Constitution." Duf Sundheim, a California Republican running a long-shot Senate bid, issued a similarly vague statement. "Whether they approve or reject a nominee is a decision that should be made by each senator," he said. "But they should do so with the highest level of veracity and honor." In total, we found at least 15 candidates who issued vague statements not specifically spelling out what they believe the Senate should do regarding the court vacancy, and many more who didn’t announce any position on their website or social media accounts. It’s fair to point out that many of the listed candidates are, to put it generously, running grassroots campaigns with little money and little hope of ending up in office. Zukowski issued a backtracking statement to PolitiFact saying, "All serious GOP Senate candidates have made it clear where they stand on the GOP's refusal to do its job." But the party is wrong in saying that the entire field of Republican Senate candidates have announced a clear stance on the issue, and in declaring that Heck stands alone in taking a guarded position on the vacancy. Our ruling The Nevada Democratic Party says that "every Republican Senate candidate" has announced their position on the Supreme Court vacancy, except for Heck. Our research shows that’s not the case. There are more than a dozen candidates, at least, who issued similarly neutral statements, and even more who haven’t addressed the issue at all. We rate the claim as False.	None	Nevada State Democratic Party	None	None	None	2016-03-03T18:12:53	2016-02-23	['None']
pomt-12452	Says if the AHCA replaces Obamacare it will "significantly reduce insurance premiums in" North Carolina.	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/10/ted-budd/what-will-happen-north-carolina-premiums-if-ahca-r/	One of the Republicans key to the American Health Care Act’s passage was North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd, who had said in March he would oppose the bill but in May ended up voting for an amended version of it. He was one of about three dozen Republicans who flipped from a No to a Yes, according to a Washington Post tally. The bill needed 216 votes to pass and squeaked by with 217. "Ultimately, the legislative process is a human process with all the flaws that entails," Budd said, explaining why he supported the AHCA. "The results of that process are never perfect, and this bill isn’t either. What I believe it will do is significantly reduce insurance premiums in our state, and help put the individual insurance marketplace on a more sound financial footing." The claim that the AHCA will "significantly reduce insurance premiums" in North Carolina stuck out to us. Budd clarified in an email that he was talking about premiums for people who don’t buy health insurance through work. So we kept our research focused on non-employer coverage. Half a million North Carolinians buy their health insurance on the individual market. A general summary For people who get health insurance on their own, experts agree that premiums nationwide would likely rise in the short-term but decrease in the long-term if the AHCA replaces the Affordable Care Act. So from that birds-eye view, Budd’s claim could be called right or wrong. PolitiFact previously ruled Half True a claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan that "the American Health Care Act will lower premiums." We asked Budd for proof about his claim that focused on North Carolina; he responded that national factors will apply to North Carolina as well. "Reducing premiums by increasing flexibility will in turn provide the incentive for young and healthy people to re-enter the insurance market, making the insurance pool as a whole healthier," he said. "A healthier pool is more cost effective and sustainable." He’s right that healthier pools are cheaper for everyone. But unfortunately for his argument, the AHCA is expected to do the exact opposite of what he described, at least in the beginning. Short term vs. long term By 2026, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in March, 24 million people are expected to drop their health insurance if the AHCA passes. The AHCA was amended since then, but there’s no new CBO analysis yet. First, healthy people who don’t need coverage will drop it because the AHCA would get rid of Obamacare’s penalties for being uninsured. As they leave, the CBO found, premiums will rise and millions more will drop their health insurance as it becomes unaffordable. And in those next few years, North Carolinians on the individual marketplace would be worse-off than people in every other state but Alaska, according to a study by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, based on CBO data. North Carolinians would face an average $5,900 premium hike, as we found in a previous fact-check of Democratic N.C. Rep. David Price. As insurance becomes less affordable, that’s where Budd’s explanation about healthier people re-entering the market fits in. "Over the long run premiums would go down as expensive-to-cover people (primarily older buyers) are priced out of the market," Duke University health care researchers David Anderson wrote in an email. By 2026, the CBO estimated, premiums would be 10 percent lower under the AHCA than under Obamacare. Not apples-to-apples There are more caveats to Budd’s claim. One is that North Carolina might not just be an outlier in the short-term, but also the long-term. "North Carolina is an expensive state with high premiums," Anderson said, due in part to its unusually large rural population. But right now there’s no way to know exactly what might happen to premiums by 2026 in North Carolina if the AHCA passes – either for us or for Budd – because no nonpartisan analysis at the state level goes that far into the future. Budd might well end up being right, but he has no evidence. In general, Anderson said, young people and wealthy people will likely end up paying less while poor people and older people will either have to pay more or stop being insured. It’s also impossible to gauge a last-minute change to the AHCA, to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than Obamacare would allow. The House passed the bill before the CBO could analyze the financial impact it would have. For more on that procedural oddity, see PolitiFact’s "Full Flop" ruling for House Speaker Paul Ryan. Another caveat is that long-term cost savings will only materialize if people accept plans with fewer options, since the AHCA would allow insurers to offer less coverage than Obamacare. The Brookings Institution found that if people want to keep their same level of coverage, in 2026 premiums would actually be 13 percent higher under the AHCA – not 10 percent lower. The final caveat is that even people with lower premiums might still pay more for health care. That’s because the AHCA would also allow insurers to charge higher deductibles. Premiums are what you pay to buy insurance, and deductibles are what you pay before that insurance kicks in. People who wouldn’t max out their deductibles under the ACA wouldn’t notice the difference, of course, but Anderson said people who would hit those caps under the ACA will certainly feel the pinch of having to pay even more money under the AHCA. "Increasing out-of-pocket maximums harms people who are already at the limit," he said. Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. Ted Budd defended his vote for the American Health Care Act, saying it will "significantly reduce insurance premiums in" North Carolina. In the short-term, insurance premiums on North Carolina’s individual market would actually increase. It’s not a small increase, either, but is rather expected to be the second-largest in the nation. Budd does have a point that premiums are expected to decrease in cost nationally a decade from now. People can quibble over whether an expected 10 percent decline is "significant," but it is a decline. However, that’s a national estimate. There’s no solid analysis yet into how North Carolina specifically might fare, a point against Budd. It's also just an average. Some people will see lower premiums, while others will see higher premiums – for many of them, high enough that experts believe they'll drop insurance entirely. And finally, even people with lower premiums might still pay more in the end, since their deductibles could be higher under the AHCA. Since Budd’s claim is partially accurate but missing some important context, we rate it Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ted Budd	None	None	None	2017-05-10T14:03:12	2017-05-04	['None']

pomt-09502	"We have solved the problem. ... Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/22/harry-reid/reid-calls-nuclear-waste-issue-solved/	Nuclear power re-emerged as a hot-button issue earlier this month, when President Barack Obama announced that the Department of Energy was offering conditional loan guarantees worth $8.33 billion to support the construction and operation of two nuclear reactors in Burke, Ga. -- the first new nuclear generators to be built in nearly three decades. A return to nuclear power means new questions about the nation's long-term strategy for handling the nuclear waste created by electricity generation. Today, much of the nuclear waste produced by the electricity industry is stored where it was generated. But for years, the federal government has been planning to construct a single long-term storage facility where all of that waste can be consolidated. That site was to be at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. But the project has faced numerous technical, bureaucratic and political obstacles, and Obama made clear by the funding priorities in his fiscal year 2010 and 2011 budgets that the Yucca Mountain facility won't be the solution during his presidency. For many years, one of Yucca Mountain's most prominent -- and influential -- opponents has been Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. In a Feb. 19, 2010, television interview with Reid, Las Vegas-based political analyst Jon Ralston asked the senator about what the administration's interest in promoting new nuclear plants means for nuclear waste generally and Yucca Mountain specifically. "What about the issue of everyone being so gung-ho now on nuclear power, including the president, when you still have not solved the waste problem?" Ralston asked the senator. Reid responded, "That's where you're wrong -- we have solved the problem." Ralston interjected, "It's sitting around at all these sites." Reid replied, "Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is, in deep ground storage. And when I say deep ground, (I mean) 10 feet underground. The new nuclear power plants are going to be built, and it's terrific that the president stepped forward on this. I'm not against nuclear power. I'm against bringing nuclear waste to Nevada. Scientists say leave it where it is. That's what we have to do." We acknowledge that there's a raging political debate about what to do with nuclear waste. But in checking on Reid's statement, we were interested in whether there's a technical consensus about the most promising approach. We asked an array of nuclear waste experts -- in the nuclear power industry, in academia and in nuclear-skeptical nonprofit groups -- whether they thought that scientists generally agreed with Reid that the best way to store nuclear waste is at the scattered sites where it is produced. Reid is correct that most nuclear scientists -- as well as the federal agency responsible for the industry, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- agree that storing nuclear waste on-site at a power plant or an off-site facility can be safe for 100 years. It's called "dry cask storage." According to the NRC, the system allows spent fuel -- a type of radioactive waste produced in the electricity-generation process -- that has already been cooled in water for at least one year to be surrounded by inert gas inside a container called a cask. In a "confidence decision" first made in 1990 and reaffirmed in 1999, the NRC declared dry casks to be safe for the storage of spent fuels for at least 100 years. As recently as May 12, 2009, NRC chairman Dale E. Klein stated that using the dry cask storage system, "spent fuel can be safely and securely stored on site, without significant environmental impact, for at least 100 years." Some industry watchdogs argue that the NRC's regulations should be more stringent, and there is professional disagreement on some of the technical issues of how, and for how long, dry-cask storage should be implemented. But experts we spoke to said that Reid is generally correct that dry-cask storage is a credible solution that can work effectively for many decades. But the senator did not bring up a key qualifier -- that dry-cask storage is not typically envisioned as a long-term solution. While 100 years may seem like a long time to most people, in the life of radioactive decay it is but a blink in time. Most scientists agree that, over the longer term, one of two possible courses should be considered -- deep-geologic repositories, such as Yucca Mountain, or reprocessing, a technique that essentially recycles spent fuel into new material that can be used for power generation and other uses. The industry, for one, sees far broader support for the geologic solution than for Reid's approach. "The scientific consensus since 1957 is that the best place for high-level radioactive waste, whether in the form of glass logs from reprocessing or used fuel, is deep geologic disposal," said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry trade group. "Even scientists, and there are only a few, who don’t like Yucca Mountain as a disposal site agree with the need for deep geologic disposal. No scientist we have ever heard of thinks that on-site storage at reactor sites is the best place for this material in the long run." Edwin Lyman is a physicist and senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group that often crosses swords with the Nuclear Energy Institute. But asked about Reid's comment, Lyman agreed with the industry group, saying he is "unaware of any significant support in the technical community for leaving spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites indefinitely. There is a broad consensus that interim storage of spent fuel in dry casks can be managed at reactor sites for at least several decades." Lyman, like the Nuclear Energy Institute, says that deep-geologic storage eases security worries. Today, the security of on-site storage locations is relatively easy, since the adjoining nuclear generators have to be protected from intruders anyway. That becomes harder once a plant is decommissioned after a few decades of use. "In the long run, institutional control over these sites cannot be assured," he said. "Therefore, spent fuel, which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years, will need to be disposed of in a deep geologic repository that in theory is able to isolate the waste from the biosphere without the need for active controls." Other experts we spoke to agreed with Reid that a Yucca Mountain repository isn't a good answer -- but not even they join the senator in advocating scatter-site storage. John Poston Sr., a nuclear engineer at Texas A&M University, said he favors reprocessing rather than using geologic storage, noting that it reduces the amount of waste that needs to be stored. (For the record, Reid told Ralston that he opposes reprocessing as well. "How do you get the stuff to reprocess? Does it just show up one morning? ... You have to bring it there. ... We don't want to haul through here 77,000 tons from around the country.") Ultimately, our sources agreed, Reid jumps to an unjustifiable conclusion. "I would say he's wrong in saying 'we have solved the problem,' " said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear policy specialist at Harvard University. Dry casks are "not a really long-term solution, and it ultimately needs to go underground." They also agreed that Reid introduced a puzzling concept into his comments -- the idea that dry-cask storage typically occurs underground. In fact, in most cases today, the casks are stored above ground. "The casks emit heat from their surface, produced by the radioactive decay of the material inside," said Clifford E. Singer, a professor of nuclear, plasma and radiological engineering at the University of Illinois. "They can be located below grade but thus still need air circulating around them for many years, so 10 feet underground is possible but not the same as 'buried.'" Jon Summers, a spokesman for Reid, defended the senator's statement. He argued that the dangers of transporting radiological materials around the United States outweigh the risks of keeping them where they are. He added that since the spent fuel needs to cool before being transported, these sites need to have technical and security infrastructure in place anyway. And he said that having a cushion of 100 years "buys time" to improve the technology to deal with radioactive waste. "Sen. Reid agrees that dry-cask storage is not the permanent solution," which is why he supported creating a blue-ribbon commission to come up with recommendations for permanent disposal, Summers said. He added, though, that "dry-cask storage is already securing waste at over half of the nation’s nuclear sites." But even if you accept that Reid was merely advocating dry-cask storage as something less than a permanent solution -- an interpretation we did not make when saw the interview -- Reid's comment suggests a finality on this debate that simply isn't there. Using the word "solved" to describe a hard-fought and highly technical debate strikes us as inadvisable. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-00417	Studies are showing California’s wildfires "are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/aug/29/kevin-mccarthy/wildfires-or-cars-which-produces-more-emissions/	Wildfires have ravaged California again this year, destroying hundreds of homes and killing six firefighters, as well as several residents. This year also produced the largest single fire in California’s history, the Ranch Fire, which had burned more than 400,000 acres and spread across four counties near the Mendocino National Forest as of late August. Smoke up and down the state, for days at a time, has blanketed metro areas miles from the fires, raising worries about air quality and pollution. The wildfires have led some, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to claim the blazes are spewing out more pollution than the state’s millions of vehicles. "I have a real concern about air quality because of where I come from," McCarthy, a Republican who represents the southern San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, said during a speech in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018. "(We’re at the) bottom of all the mountains and we collect (air pollution) all the way from San Francisco." "What I have found, because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing," he added. SOURCE: Public Policy Institute of California Was McCarthy right? We decided to fact-check his wildfires-versus-cars comparison. Our research Sean Raffuse, an analyst at the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center, told us McCarthy’s statement is correct, but for only for one category of emissions — particulate matter. The claim is not true, however, for climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Cars still produce far more of those. Particulate matter, or PM, is a mixture of microscopic particles and liquid droplets that, when inhaled, can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health problems. For months, officials have issued health warnings that particulate matter from the wildfires could trigger asthma attacks or aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases. Specifically, Raffuse said, the fires produce more PM 2.5 than all cars. PM 2.5 refers to particles two and one half microns or less in width, or about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. "PM 2.5 emissions are greater than what we see from cars, and that’s typical, not just of California during the wildfire season," he said, "but even if you look overall at the nation for an entire year, there will be more emissions from particles from wildfires than there will be from motor vehicles." Clean combustion regulations, he said, are one reason vehicles produce fewer particulate matter than fires. Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed rules that would ease vehicle emissions standards nationwide. The proposal would also challenge the right of states, California in particular, to set their own, more stringent tailpipe pollution standards. Greenhouse gas emissions Bill Stewart, a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Forestry, said there’s a key point missing from McCarthy’s statement. While fires emit more particulate matter, cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, he said. "Those are two important but different issues," Stewart said. Mike Kleeman, a UC Davis professor of environmental engineering, added that wildfires also emit some greenhouse gases. "But burned areas also regrow during which time they act as a net carbon sink. Assuming a burned area regrows completely over a time of decades, the net CO2 emissions should be low," Kleeman wrote in an email. "Wildfires are a problem," he added, "and we should be taking steps to reduce their frequency and intensity. But it isn't an ‘apples to apples’ comparison to an every-day source like cars." McCarthy’s response Asked for evidence supporting the claim, McCarthy’s spokesman pointed to an October 2017 NBC News story that examined the emissions produced by that year’s deadly Wine Country fires. The story had the misleading headline: "California Wildfires Emitted a Year's Worth of Car Pollution in Less Than a Week." It quoted Raffuse of UC Davis, who told NBC the fires had released the same amount of particulate matter as come from California vehicles in one year. He didn’t claim the fires had produced more of all types of emissions than cars. In the article, the researcher "pointed out cars pollute in other ways, too." Raffuse summed up the congressman’s statement saying it’s "partially correct but omits a key distinction." McCarthy’s spokesman did not cite any specific studies to support the claim. We reviewed several that described wildfire emissions as a growing concern, but did not say they produce more pollution overall compared with cars. One such report by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy in 2014 found that by the year 2085, emissions from wildfires are projected to be equal to the annual emissions of about one fifth of all of the cars currently registered in California. Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed "because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing." Wildfires produce more of one key pollutant, particulate matter, than cars, both in California and nationwide. But that’s all. McCarthy cherry-picked this one category and ignored the fact that cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, than fires. We rate McCarthy’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-10314	Barack Obama wants to "restore" the estate tax that George W. Bush "repealed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/chain-email/bush-didnt-repeal-it-obama-would-expand-it/	A chain e-mail claims that Sen. Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false. Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about Barack Obama and the estate tax, which it refers to as the inheritance tax. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read our full article here . The e-mail claims that President George W. Bush "repealed" the estate tax, and it now stands at 0 percent. Though Bush reduced the tax, he did not repeal it. Rather, under his 2001 tax cut package, the estate tax reduces every year and then goes away for just a single year — 2010 — before reverting back to higher rates. (See the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on estate taxes for more details.) Currently, the estate tax generally applies only to estates worth more than $2-million (or $4-million for couples). Above those amounts, the tax rate tops out at 45 percent. Both Obama and McCain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes. McCain proposes to increase the exemption to $5-million ($10-million for couples) and reduce the tax rate to 15 percent. Obama proposes to increase the exemption to $3.5-million ($7-million for couples) and leave the top rate at 45 percent. So the e-mail is wrong when it says McCain wants a "0 percent" estate tax and that Obama wants to "restore" it. We rule this statement False.

pomt-07485	"Foreign aid makes up about 1 percent of our entire budget."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-foreign-aid-makes-1-percent-us-b/	President Barack Obama’s April 13 speech on federal debt and spending contained plenty of interesting claims, and we’ll be checking those in the coming days. We wanted to start with with a remark the president made to back up his contention that politicians often focus their deficit-cutting rhetoric on hot-button programs that are just a small portion of the federal budget. Politicians in both parties, he said, "suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1% of our entire budget." We wondered if foreign aid really makes up such a small portion of federal spending. In February, PolitiFact checked a claim by Ross Douthat, a columnist at The New York Times. Douthat said Israel and Egypt receive more foreign aid from Uncle Sam than any other nations. We rated that True, noting that if you exclude the spending on Afghanistan and Iraq, where military operations continue, Israel received $2.4 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, while Egypt got $1.5 billion. Those 2008 figures came from the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract. The United States spent a total $49.1 billion on foreign aid that year. According to the Treasury Department and historical tables on the federal budget, total federal spending was $2.98 trillion for the 2008 fiscal year. That means foreign aid made up 1.64 percent of budget. What about 2009? In that fiscal year, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United States spent $44.9 billion, while overall government spending was $3.52 trillion. Foreign aid spending was 1.28 percent of the total budget. If you’re wondering who else is a major U.S. aid recipient, here’s the rest of the top 10 from 2008: Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). The totals reflect both economic and military aid. So Obama was almost exactly right in saying foreign aid consumes about 1 percent of the U.S. budget. In fiscal 2008 U.S. foreign aid spending of $49.1 billion made up 1.64 percent of total spending. The next year foreign aid spending was $44.9 billion, or 1.28 percent of the total budget.

pomt-08014	Georgia lawmakers fuel up for the session by feasting on "wild" hogs.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/11/new-georgia-encyclopedia/georgia-politicos-pork-out-wild-pig-begin-each-leg/	There are a lot of peculiar political rituals we could talk about here at PolitiFact Georgia. But few are more colorful than the pre-legislative feast laid out for the Georgia Legislature every year for the past five decades. It takes place at the old train depot near Underground Atlanta and is attended by hundreds of folks -- lawmakers, the governor, state officials, reporters, lobbyists and just about anybody else who can score a ticket. "Since 1962 the Georgia General Assembly has opened its new legislative session each January with the 'Wild Hog Supper,' at which legislators enjoy such state delicacies as barbecued wild pig and Brunswick stew," notes the New Georgia Encyclopedia in its extensive entry on hogs in Georgia history. No doubt about the Legislature kicking off the year with a "Wild Hog" feast. But in an age of "cloud computing" and factory farms, are they REALLY still serving "wild" pigs, the intrepid fact-diggers at PolitiFact Georgia wondered? To get to the answer, PolitiFact trekked back into the legendary swamps of south-central Georgia. Bob Addison, who runs Addison Wild Boar Hunting near Abbeville, and whose family and community still supply the victuals for the Wild Hog feast, knows the history as well as anyone. He's lived it most of his life. The story begins with Addison's late father, E.C. "Boo" Addison, who for most of his 80 years pursued a cunning and dangerous animal that has roamed the wilds of south-central Georgia since the first Europeans arrived. Early settlers brought domestic livestock into the area and often let their hogs and cattle roam free. Some of the pigs became wild, and later were crossbred with a much larger Russian boar to produce the wild hogs that now populate the swamps. Back in the late 1950s, "Boo" Addison was camping in a Dodge County swamp with Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Phil Campbell and state House Speaker George L. Smith when the idea of a legislative hog supper took root. Thousands of feral hogs still roam those river-bottom woodlands. "They got some hogs and they barbecued 'em down in the swamp," Bob Addison said. "George L. said to Phil, 'This is mighty good eatin'. It's a shame the legislators in Atlanta couldn't have a chance to get some of this good food.' And Daddy said, 'I'll furnish the hogs.' Well, they went back to Atlanta and decided that the Sunday before the Legislature opened, they'd have this supper. And it's been happening ever since." Addison said the first supper took place at the Henry Grady Hotel -- since demolished -- and was attended by about 300 people. The event moved to its current location about a decade ago and now attracts more than 1,000 guests. Over the years, the Wild Hog Supper came to define the Legislature's return to the Capitol. About 15 years ago, organizers began issuing tickets to control the crowd. "Busloads of people would pull up, and we had no idea who they were," said former Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin. One thing that hasn't changed much over the years is the entree. The hogs that end up on dinner plates begin life in litters of up to 14 born deep in the dark undergrowth of Addison's swamp. Coyotes and other predators quickly thin their ranks. The hogs that survive eat just about anything that won't eat them -- acorns, roots, even snakes and small animals. Addison supplements their diet with grain, peanut shells and barrels of discarded candy from a nearby factory. The male hogs, the boars, are the wildest. They average 250 pounds but can tip the scales at 600. Their razor-sharp tusk can rip a man or dog to shreds. "No matter how young they are, boars have a strong taste," said Bob Addison's wife, Jo Ann. "We don't use boars for the Wild Hog Supper." The Addisons use only sweeter-tasting female hogs for the legislative shindig. The hogs -- very wild indeed as it turns out -- are captured in large "Jurassic Park"-looking cages several weeks before the supper. They are penned up and fattened on grain before they are slaughtered. "It sort of tenders them up a bit," said Jo Ann Addison. She said they used 20 wild hogs for this year's supper, which attracted a packed house even as a major snow and ice storm moved into metro Atlanta. It turns out the hogs at the 49th annual Wild Hog Supper were indeed wild -- these critters never see a pen until they are captured. We rate this one True. And in case you're still reading, we're including a bonus. Below you will find Bob Addison's recipe for cooking a wild hog -- just in case you ever need it: Prepare oak coals two hours before cooking begins in the evening. Allow the coals to form a thin dusting of ash. Place the hog carcasses on metal racks 18 inches above the coals in special covered pits in the ground. Put the skin side up. Keep the pit temperature about 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook for eight hours. Just after sunrise, turn the meat. "That boils the grease back up through the meat as a natural tenderizer." Cook for a few more hours until the ribs separate from the meat. Total cooking time --- 12 hours. Serve with barbecue sauce and enjoy.

pomt-14629	On opposing citizenship for illegal immigrants	half flip	/florida/statements/2016/jan/29/marco-rubio/did-marco-rubio-flip-flip-amnesty/	Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Marco Rubio to explain what sounded like different positions on granting legal status to people living in the country illegally, often described as amnesty, during the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28. "When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants," Kelly said during the Republican debate in Des Moines on Jan. 28. "You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. senator as well." She then played a series of video clips in which he spoke against "amnesty" in the past. Kelly then asked Rubio, "Within two years of getting elected, you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?" Rubio countered: "No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty … ." The back and forth between Rubio and Kelly continued. We decided to put Rubio’s past statements on amnesty on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures to what extent -- if any -- a politician has flipped on an issue. We don’t make a judgment on the change of position, only whether the candidate actually changed position or not. Rubio’s statements about amnesty in 2010 race Immigration reform was a hot topic in the 2010 Florida Senate race when Rubio ran against Charlie Crist, who ultimately ran as an independent, and Democrat Kendrick Meek. The conservative Shark Tank blogger, Javier Manjarres, asked Rubio in 2009: "Are you pro-amnesty for illegal immigration?" "No, no. Never have been. In fact, I'm strongly against amnesty for a number of different reasons. The first is, I always use the example of the speed limit. If you say the speed limit is 70, but you don’t ticket people until they reach 80, well then the speed limit is really 80, it’s not 70. Amnesty is the same thing. The most important thing we need to do is enforce our existing laws. We have existing immigration laws that are not being adequately enforced. Nothing will make it harder to enforce your existing laws if you reward people who broke them." Rubio also said: "I will never support – never have and never will support – any effort to grant blanket, legalization, amnesty to folks who have entered or stayed in this country illegally." In October 2009, Rubio said in an interview on WSRE in Pensacola: "You cannot grant amnesty. If you grant amnesty, you will send a message that all you have to do is come into America illegally, stay here long enough, and we will let you stay. No. 2, you will destroy any hopes you have of having a legal immigration system that works. If the American people see us grant amnesty, they will never again believe in legal immigration, they will never again support it. And that’s wrong for our country, bad for our future." "In fact in ’86 when Reagan created an amnesty program, about 3 million people were granted amnesty. The result was that you had a bunch of people standing in line to enter legally who all claimed to be illegal because it was easier to get through the amnesty program. So we can’t have amnesty. "And I think if you have a guest worker program in place that functions, the illegal folks that are here now will go back home through attrition." In a Senate debate on Univision in September 2010, Rubio spoke against the DREAM Act, which Senate Democrats planned to debate the following week. Dreamers are young people brought to the United States illegally as children. "What they're offering now is a bill that would in essence grant amnesty to 2 million people," Rubio said. "It’s a cynical way to play politics with the lives of real people . . . This is what always happens with Hispanic voters in this country, they manipulate them come election time." (The DREAM Act didn’t pass. In 2012, President Barack Obama announced Deferred Status for Childhood Arrivals to give temporary status, without a path to citizenship.) In an October 2010 debate, CNN’s Candy Crowley asked Rubio what he would do with the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants: Rubio replied: "Well, first, I don't believe we can grant amnesty, because I think it's unfair to the people who have entered this country legally. And I also think it will undermine ... Crowley: "So you would send them all out of the country?" Rubio: "Well, it's not that simple. We all know -- I've never advocated that we round people up. I don't know anyone who is seriously talking about that. What I have said needs to have happen is we have to have a legal immigration system that functions." Later in the debate, Rubio said: "First of all, (an) earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It's what they call it. And the reality of it is this: This has to do with the bottom line that America cannot be the only country in the world that does not enforce its immigration laws. "It is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so. And all I'm saying is that if you do that ... you will never have a legal immigration system that works. No one is going to follow the law if there is an easier way to do it." So in 2010, Rubio spoke against amnesty. In the CNN debate, Rubio opposed amnesty and linked it to an earned path to citizenship. This is a contrast to how he would later talk about the 2013 bill. What Rubio said about amnesty in 2011 and 2012 In May 2011, Rubio told Politico with respect to the DREAM Act, the solution "can't be part of some broader effort to grant blanket amnesty." "I've said repeatedly I want to help these kids. I think these were kids who were brought to this country by their parents when they were very young; they were high academic achievers and want to go to college and contribute to America's future or serve in the armed forces," Rubio said. "And I think helping them would be good for America. I do want to help them; I just don't think the DREAM Act is the right or best way to do it." What Rubio said about amnesty in 2013 While a senator, Rubio co-authored the Gang of Eight bill in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship. Ahead of the release of the bill, Rubio said that the proposal "is not amnesty." Rubio argued that the legislation outlining a 13-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship is not amnesty. He was right that the bill does not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods, and it was tougher than its 1986 predecessor. But it also offered a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. We rated his statement that the proposal "is not amnesty" Half True. In April 2013, Rubio went on Meet the Press to defend the bill. Host David Gregory asked Rubio about his past and current positions on amnesty: Gregory: "Three years ago in a debate you were clear on this. You said, ‘To earn a pathway to citizenship, you have to leave this country if you are here illegally -- go back home. And then you could come back in.’ You said an earned pathway was amnesty. Yet you've changed your mind here -- why?" Rubio: "Well, first of all, what I said throughout my campaign was that I was against a blanket amnesty, and this is not blanket amnesty. On the contrary, this is not blanket anything. And, secondly, it's not amnesty because you pay serious consequences for having violated the law. "Third, we need to understand the existing law. The existing law does not prohibit someone -- the law today does not prohibit someone who violated the immigration laws from getting a green card. It simply says you have to leave the United States, and you have to wait 10 years." He then recapped the provisions of the bill that include the waiting period. The bill never reached a vote in the House and died. Rubio now favors a piecemeal approach rather than one comprehensive bill. Our rating Rubio opposed amnesty while running for Senate in 2010. He flatly said that he would oppose granting "blanket, legalization, amnesty" in an interview with a conservative blogger. In a CNN debate that year, he again opposed amnesty and linked it to a path to citizenship when he said that an "earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty" and that it would be unfair to "create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so." But in 2013, he was one of eight authors of a Senate bill that included a path to citizenship and declared that it was not amnesty. Rubio can argue that the bill -- which died in the House -- was not "blanket amnesty," because it included significant hurdles including fines and a waiting period. That’s a partial change of position, so we rate it a Half Flip.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-01-29T00:13:49	2016-01-28	['None']
pomt-07234	Says that PolitiFact Ohio confirms that Betty Sutton "maxed out federal debt"	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/we-said-what-nrcc-claims-politifact-ohio-confirmed/	Is up down? Is red blue? Is rain the same as sunshine? In Washington, it is, and if it isn’t, someone will insist it is anyway. So PolitiFact Ohio is amused -- and not entirely surprised -- that when we rated a claim "Barely True," a political organization quickly sent out an e-mail to the press crowing that we had confirmed something that we absolutely did not confirm. On Tuesday, May 31, we ruled that a claim by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), attacking Democratic congresswoman Betty Sutton, was Barely True. The claim was that Sutton and her Democratic colleagues ran up the nation’s credit card with unsustainable and irresponsible spending and "now their credit card is maxed out." In other words, the nation’s federal debt problem was her fault. While Sutton certainly voted for various spending bills, as we noted, our reporting also found that wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts (extended under President Barack Obama) and the recession played roles in the debt, too. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that "Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — including their associated interest costs — account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies." But an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation said such an analysis "fails basic statistics" because it doesn’t look at Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary spending. In other words, you can’t just blame the programs and decisions you don’t like or find convenient and ignore all others. That cherry-picking criticism was apt for the claim about Sutton. As we noted, Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling seven times under Bush, and three times under Obama. So yes, Sutton voted for spending bills, as detailed by NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola, one of the sources with whom we checked while researching this matter. But you cannot ignore the roles that the wars, tax cuts and the struggling economy also played in the nation’s debt. Those were critical facts ignored by the NRCC claim that led to the Truth-O-Meter rating of Barely True. Fast-forward to 9:51 a.m. today (June 1, 2011).That’s when Mazzola sent out this e-mail news release: "PolitiFact Confirms Sutton ‘Maxed Out Federal Debt’ As She Ducks For Political Cover." In the text of his message, Mazzola wrote: "POLITIFACT OHIO SAYS TRUE: ‘Betty Sutton and Her Fellow Democrats Went On A Spending Spree And Now Their Credit Card Is Maxed Out.’ For backup, Mazzola noted the sections of our fact-checking in which we quoted or paraphrased him. He ignored everything else. We sent him an e-mail this morning (June 1) noting our puzzlement, and he replied. "By ruling it ‘true,’ albeit barely, you determined that the Democrats' responses were not believable, not credible, or false at least a degree more than ours were true," he said. We could parse, say up is down, left is right, or that it’s snowing in Washington (never mind the heat wave), but Mazzola’s logic on this just won’t fly -- even inside the Beltway. The Truth-O-Meter defines Barely True this way: The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That description fits the NRCC’s criticism of Sutton. The Truth-O-Meter has other ratings available, of course, including its lowest, Pants on Fire. The definition? "The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim." One other way to put it is: We said what? Both fit the NRCC’s characterization perfectly.

pomt-08650	Taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/15/john-dennis/gop-rival-says-taxpayers-pay-18000month-nancy-pelo/	What do you do when you're a Republican running an uphill, some would say quixotic, campaign against Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in historically liberal San Francisco? Trailing badly in the polls, John Dennis appears to be trying to raise his profile via the viral campaign video route. Dennis has introduced a Wizard of Oz-themed ad, with Pelosi, of course, cast in the role of the Wicked Witch of the West. "I will save you from those evil Republicans," the Pelosi character cackles. "But first, pay $18,000 a month for my downtown office." She then talks about running up the debt and summons her "monkeys" (sporting IRS tags) "to make you pay for it all." Cue Dennis. "Step back everyone," says Dennis, appearing in the frame. He pours a bucket of water (labeled "Freedom" -- we're not making this up) and melts the witch. Hokey? You bet. But with 500,000 hits in its first few days online, we'd say, mission accomplished. None of the actors is likely to get much Oscar buzz, but we're not here to review the ad's artistic merits. We'll stick to a fact-check of the claim that taxpayers are on the hook for $18,000 a month for Pelosi's downtown San Francisco district office. The rent for Pelosi's district office is actually $18,736 a month, as first reported in June 2010 in a Roll Call analysis of a database assembled by the Sunlight Foundation. Pelosi moved into the 3,075 square foot space in the new, 18-story federal building in downtown San Francisco in the fall of 2009. It was a significant upgrade, more than quadrupling the rent she paid for her previous district office, and is nearly double the next-highest rental paid by a member of the House. According to the Roll Call analysis, the next highest monthly office rent, $10,600, belongs to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose district office is in a federal building in Manhattan. Democratic Reps. Jose Serrano (Bronx, N.Y.), Doris Matsui (Sacramento) Stephen Lynch (Boston) and Diane Watson (Los Angeles) all pay $9,000 to $10,000 a month for district offices. This rental data comes courtesy of Pelosi, who allowed the release of the House's quarterly Statement of Disbursements online for the first time in November 2009. Drew Hammill, Pelosi's press secretary, said the decision to move last fall was justified because after 20 years, "the old office was no longer able to meet the needs of San Franciscans in the existing space and the new office will expand office size by nearly a third, allowing better service for San Francisco constituents." The office is more centrally located, Hammill said, allowing constituents better access via public transportation. Better security was also a priority, he said. "In the role as speaker of the House, the new federal building offers enhanced security features, a major factor in the decision to move offices," Hammill said. "This move did not come without additional expense," Hammill said. "As every San Franciscan knows, the city is one of the most densely populated areas in the county and, of course, office space rents are among the highest, on average, in the country." Hammill also noted that the rent is being paid back to the federal government, which owns the building, and that Pelosi pays the same cost per square foot as any other federal agency that is a tenant of the building. By way of context, Roll Call reporter Paul Singer noted in his report that serving as speaker carries additional cost and that previous speakers have paid substantially more for their district offices than other nearby members of Congress. One other piece of context is warranted. The expense for district office rent is paid out of set amount allotted to members called the Members' Representational Allowances (which typically range from about $1.4 million to $1.7 million for each office). Out of this account, members pay for their staff, travel, office rent, office art, flowers, bottles of water etc. The amount of the allowance varies based on factors such as the distance of a member's district to D.C. and the relative cost of office space in the member's home district. Pelosi's allowance is higher due to the travel distance to California and the high rents charged in San Francisco. In addition, because of the additional responsibilities, the speaker gets a higher allowance. Members can decide for themselves how to spend their allowances. And Pelosi did not exceed hers. So one could argue that while Pelosi decided to prioritize spending for her office space, it didn't cost taxpayers any more, that she simply had less to spend on other things. Members can give back the unused part of their allowance, but in practice, very few ever do. They simply find other ways to spend it. We're not going to weigh in on whether Pelosi's rent is justified. But the ad says the American public pays $18,000 a month for Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco, and its $18,736.

pomt-05247	Ted Cruz "helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jun/01/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-ted-cruz-helps-run-two-nationa/	David Dewhurst, seeking the Republican U.S. Senate nomination, declared before his party's May 2012 primary that opponent Ted Cruz helps steer two groups seeking amnesty for illegal immigrants. Dewhurst, who faces Cruz in a July 31, 2012, runoff, leveled the claim in a radio ad his campaign released May 24, 2012, five days before the primary. In the stop, two women discuss Cruz's candidacy and one says: "Cruz helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants." "Amnesty groups? Ted Cruz?" the other woman replies. "Yup," woman No. 1 says. "He’s on their boards." The specter of Cruz, the state’s former solicitor-general, leading groups that back amnesty runs counter to a March 5, 2012, commentary by Peggy Fikac of the Hearst Newspapers Austin bureau pointed out by Cruz's campaign in response to Dewhurst's ad. Fikac wrote: "While (Cruz) often tells the story of his father fleeing Cuban oppression and celebrates legal immigration, he's a hard-liner on border security and illegal immigration. He opposes amnesty. ..." We wondered if Dewhurst, the Texas lieutenant governor, accurately captured Cruz's amnesty activism. An anti-Cruz website set up by Dewhurst’s campaign says Cruz sits on the boards of the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute and the Hispanic Leadership Fund, the implication being that both groups are leading the push for amnesty. About amnesty: As PolitiFact noted in a December 2, 2011, article, Merriam Webster defines amnesty as "the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals." With respect to illegal immigrants, the historical standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. That law enabled illegal residents to become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in the United States by Jan. 1, 1982, and met other minimal requirements. It was widely described as an "amnesty" program. But amnesty can be defined differently depending on one’s view of immigration policy. Advocates for more legal immigration often maintain that amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Those who oppose additional immigration define amnesty more broadly. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, previously told PolitiFact: "Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty." To gauge Dewhurst’s claim, we sought details about the mentioned groups and Cruz’s connections. Nexis searches for news stories on the groups calling for amnesty came up empty. But Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed us to the HAP Institute website, which lists Cruz as among about 35 members of its board of advisors. When we peeked, the group also had posted this statement: "The HAP Institute does not support amnesty nor have we in the past. We seek a productive dialogue from our leaders that will promote free market principles." Then again, Hirsch pointed out, the institute in 2011 said it was reasonable for Texas to establish a system enabling illegal immigrants to work legally in the state as proposed by state Rep. Paul Workman, R-Austin. An April 6, 2011, blog post by the institute urged readers to take action as a Texas House committee held a hearing on Workman’s proposal. Generally, the institute post says, "a comprehensive state reform bill would need to address three pillars – tougher enforcement, a guest worker program, fines and worker permits – in order to be beneficial. Several states have passed reform bills and the most recent bill passed in Utah contains these elements. Texas in in dire need of comprehensive immigration reform legislation and efforts to pass bills to address these elements must be given a chance." We recently reviewed Workman’s proposal in rating Half True a claim by Workman’s 2012 Republican primary challenger, Ryan Downton, that Workman’s legislation provided amnesty for illegal immigrants. House Bill 2886 would have enabled illegal residents paying a fee and clearing a background check to receive state-issued cards enabling them to work in Texas for eight years at a time. That seems a kind of forgiveness some would consider amnesty. However, the proposal does not go as far as the 1986 federal act, which enabled immigrants to become legal residents for all purposes, not just to work for a period in one state. Significantly, that law put beneficiaries on paths to citizenship; Workman’s proposal would not. An institute representative, Suzanne Bellsnyder of Austin, registered in favor of Workman’s proposal, according to a witness list for a hearing held by the House Committee on State Affairs on April 6, 2011. Bellsnyder, a consultant to the institute, which has offices in Austin and Washington, told us by telephone that the group, whose founding members include Cruz, earlier backed President George W. Bush’s 2004 call for immigration reform. Cruz was an adviser in Bush’s 2000 campaign and worked for federal agencies while Bush was president. Bush outlined an approach, which did not pass into law, that included a temporary worker program for newcomers and for immigrants already living illegally in the country, according to a summary by the Migration Policy Institute. Beneficiaries would have had to apply for renewable three-year temporary visas, the summary says, while unauthorized immigrants applying from within the United States would be required to pay a fee and prove they were already employed. Applicants from other countries would have to show they had a job offer from an American employer. Bellsnyder said: "We like guest-worker programs and we want to have a positive debate and momentum on these issues and at some level, a path to citizenship," though she cautioned any endorsement of a plan would depend on its provisions. "It’s not black and white." She said the group -- whose education arm, the Hispanic Alliance for Progress, hosted Dewhurst as a speaker at a March 31, 2005, Austin event -- has never been for amnesty, which she defined as letting an offense pass without punishment. Any required payment, she said, would be punishment. Contrary to Dewhurst’s backup information, Cruz is not a board member with the non-partisan Hispanic Leadership Fund, according to a list on the 4-year-old group’s website. The group’s president, Mario Lopez, told us by phone that he briefed Cruz about the group’s interest in an immigration system that works a couple years ago, though Cruz has not served on its board. Mindful that since 1986, Congress has not approved a rewrite of immigration laws that might be interpreted as amnesty, we queried national experts and activists on whether the HAP Institute ranks among leading advocates for amnesty, as Dewhurst says. Negative, they uniformly said. Donald Kerwin, executive director of the New York-based Center for Migration Studies, told us by phone there has been no recent national push for what he would consider amnesty, meaning forgiveness without hurdles. Kerwin, who wrote a December 2010 report sketching out the history of U.S. immigration law, further said that business, labor and civil rights groups are most associated with attempts to establish a way for a share of illegal residents to attain legal residency. Conversely, he said, the HAP Institute has not been a leading advocate. Similarly, Tamar Jacoby of Washington-based ImmigrationWorks USA, which says it seeks laws bringing the country's legal intake of foreign workers in line with labor needs, said the institute has not been a leading advocate on immigration issues, including amnesty. Chris Chmielenski of NumbersUSA, which favors reductions in immigration and also tries to track Senate candidate positions on immigration, replied to our inquiry with an email listing 20 groups he considers leading advocates of amnesty. By telephone, Chmielenski said he doesn’t recall institute members testifying before Congress or speaking to immigration on news programs over the past few years nor does he consider them a top proponent of amnesty. "I definitely would not call them a national leader," he said. Contacted about what we found, Hirsch of Dewhurst's camp urged us to quiz two HAP Institute advisory board members, Jacob Monty and Massey Villarreal. Monty, a Houston lawyer, says in a statement posted online by Dewhurst’s campaign that Cruz was instrumental in helping the institute craft its "policy on immigration reform" and says he also supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, giving speeches about it. Bellsynder told us by phone: "There isn’t a institute policy or position paper on immigration at this point. We’ve weighed in on proposals." We failed to reach Villarreal, but Monty said by phone that Cruz always aligned with the institute’s support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for certain illegal residents. He said the group's support extended to members urging senators to back a failed 2007 immigration law overhaul proposed by Sens. Ted Kennedy and John McCain, which Bellsnyder confirmed. However, Monty told us, he has never viewed the institute as favoring unconditional amnesty. As we completed this review, Cruz spokesman James Bernsen sent emails pointing out that Monty has donated to Dewhurst's campaign and stressing Cruz's statements on the stump that he opposes amnesty. Our ruling Dewhurst says Cruz, who has said he opposes amnesty, "helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants." That’s weakened from the top because Cruz is on the advisory board for one -- not two -- relevant groups. The HAP Institute favors comprehensive immigration reform, including hurdles that illegal immigrants must clear to qualify for legal residency. It’s at least debatable whether that’s amnesty. Most significantly, we were struck by the utter lack of evidence for saying the institute has been leading the national push for amnesty. Far as we can tell, it’s not even among the top 20 advocacy groups on immigration policy. This misrepresentation isn’t just inaccurate; it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10656	Biden was responsible for "ending genocide in Bosnia."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/31/joe-biden/he-was-one-voice-of-many/	In the waning days of the Iowa campaign, dark horse Democratic candidate Sen. Joe Biden has gone to the airwaves to distinguish himself as a steady leader with broad foreign affairs experience. One of his ads claims that he ended genocide in Bosnia. He explained in a 1997 speech: "Appalled by the naked Serbian aggression and genocidal attacks on Bosnian civilians, in September 1992 I called for a 'lift and strike' policy. ... "My views were not widely shared at that time. As the war escalated — with massacres, 'ethnic cleansing,' and rapes — a few other senators, including Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman, joined my call for action. But it took more than two years of failed diplomacy — and a quarter-million killed and 2-million homeless — before we finally came around to the 'lift and strike' policy in the fall of 1995. Guess what? The policy worked!" "Lift and strike" is shorthand for the policy of lifting the U.S. arms embargo against the Bosnian government and launching military strikes against the Bosnian Serbs accused of genocide. It's clear Biden was among the earliest and most vocal members of Congress to advocate an end to the violence. But it's wrong for him to take sole credit for ending the genocide. "He was a constant pest to push people in that direction," said Ivo H. Daalder, a former director for European affairs on the National Security Council and author of the book Getting to Dayton: The Making of America's Bosnia Policy. "There is no doubt that Joe Biden wanted to end the genocide and was willing to use force to end it before either the Bush or Clinton administrations." But Biden's influence remained that of one of 100 senators, noted Daalder, who now serves as an adviser to Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign: "The war was ended by a whole bunch of people, most of whom were in the administration." Indeed, it was former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke who was nominated for a 1995 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring the war in Bosnia to a close. It was Senate Majority Leader Dole who in 1995 filed the bill that Biden co-sponsored ending the arms embargo against Bosnia. Passage of that bill helped pave the way for President Bill Clinton to change his Bosnia policy. NATO, led by Gen. Wesley Clark, played its role, too, as did many other U.S. and international leaders. So yes, Biden wanted to stop the genocide. He played an influential role in the debate. But he didn't end the war himself, as his ad implies. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2007-12-31T00:00:00	2007-12-27	['Joe_Biden']
pomt-02057	"Solar panels drain the sun’s energy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/29/chain-email/claim-solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-are-satire-no/	Recently, several readers -- feeling depressed after reading that a promising type of clean, renewable energy was seemingly weakening the earth’s very life force -- asked us to check a claim circulating on social media that "solar panels drain the sun’s energy." Rest easy, readers: The claim stems from a bit of satire being passed along by the scientifically gullible. In mid May 2014, the website National Report published an article headlined, "Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say." Here’s an excerpt: "This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming. "Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as ‘forced photovoltaic drainage.’ "‘Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,’ WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. ‘Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.’ "WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. ‘Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.’" However, people passing along this story by email appear not to be aware that the National Report is a satire site. As we noted just a few days ago in another check of a National Report piece that went viral, the site’s tongue-in-cheek disclaimer says, in part, that "the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report." The urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer said, "National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental." (Snopes also debunked the solar panels story on May 25, 2014.) We checked with a solar energy expert to make sure we weren’t missing something, and they agreed that the sun-draining claim is pure hokum. "The sun is really big, really far away, and constantly producing mind-boggling amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. It couldn’t care less about your puny solar panel," said Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University’s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. The closer you read the National Report item, the more obvious the satire becomes. It turns out that the Wyoming Institute of Technology only exists as a website, with an obviously fake backstory. "WIT," according to the website, was originally founded in 1943 as the Wyoming Institute of Education and Nuclear Energy Research (WIENER, get it?) and has purportedly invented such technologies as "smellovision," the "space toilet," the world’s first computer virus, "the world’s first 100% organic artificial nose, which was created for pop-star Michael Jackson in 1999," and the "E-condom." Our ruling As is often the case, what you see on social media isn’t accurate. It’s not true that "solar panels drain the sun’s energy." This claim originated with a satirical site, and it has no basis in science. Cue the solar flares: It gets a Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-05-29T15:46:05	2014-05-19	['None']

Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, "chose the (Washington) insiders over our generals" in the battle against the Islamic State. The Restoration PAC ad says when it comes to national security, Bennet chose to "serve" the insiders instead of America. "On ISIS, he chose the insiders over our generals," said the ad’s narrator, who then refers to Bennet's Republican opponent. "Darryl Glenn made choices, too. Unlike Bennet, he'll always put America first," the narrator concludes. We asked Restoration PAC for evidence supporting its claim that Bennet "chose the insiders over our generals" in the fight against the terrorist group. The PAC supplied news stories and opinion commentaries that mostly criticized President Barack Obama’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011. According to a 2014 Washington Times story cited by the PAC, Obama ignored a recommendation by Army General Lloyd J. Austin III to maintain an ongoing force of 23,000 U.S. soldiers to support the Iraqi Army as it assumed full responsibility for the nation's security. Without American military support and advisers, the Iraqi Army floundered, stopped training troops, and soldiers ran from battles as Islamic extremist groups rose up, the Washington Times reported. However, as PolitiFact has reported, Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished in Iraq after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein, and the group eventually evolved into Islamic State. And the 2011 troop withdrawal deadline was forged by President Bush's 2008 Status of Forces agreement with then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who -- along with many Iraqis -- increasingly wanted the American military gone. Restoration PAC also cited an August Time magazine story, in which retired generals and unnamed current commanders said the Obama administration has a "bad strategy" for destroying Islamic State in Syria and Iraq that includes an "anemic application of force" and a lack of a local ground forces to reclaim territory from ISIS. Yet the Time story also states: "The U.S. is beating ISIS handily, judging by Vietnam’s body-count metric. The total number of ISIS battlefield deaths claimed by U.S. officials has jumped, from 6,000 in January 2015 to 45,000 last month—a bloodbath for an enemy force estimated to number about 30,000." What role does Michael Bennet play in any off this? Restoration PAC spokesman Dan Curry pointed to a December 2011 Bennet news release, saying it shows the senator supported Obama’s troop withdrawal from Iraq, which fueled Islamic State’s growth. "After nine long years, $1 trillion spent and 1 million service members deployed, Americans and Coloradans welcome the responsible end to the war in Iraq," Bennet said in the news release. "Our troops have performed bravely and effectively in Iraq and accomplished everything that was asked of them: securing communities and creating the space for democratic change to take root." Bennet wasn’t alone in supporting bringing the troops home. At the time Obama announced the withdrawal, three-quarters of Americans approved of it -- yet more than half of Republicans did not. In an earlier statement on the Iraq withdrawal, Bennet stressed that "serious threats against the United States remain, and we must continue to work to ensure we have the best-trained and best-equipped military in the world," Westword magazine reported. "Whatever Bennet's true motivation, he went along with Obama's plan over the advice of generals who warned pulling out of Iraq would be a disaster and it was," Curry said in an email to PolitiFact. The PAC also cites a Bloomberg TV interview days before the 2012 presidential election, where Bennet said: "I think the president gets enormous credit for promising to end the war in Iraq and ending the war in Iraq, for announcing a deadline on Afghanistan and sticking with that when his opponent is basically taking every position possible. And I think that the people of Colorado think he's a strong foreign policy president." Yet, Bennet has worked on bipartisan legislation to shield the country from terrorism attacks. He cosponsored the Visa Waiver Program Security Enhancement Act, a December 2015 bill to plug security gaps and prevent terrorists from entering the country. The Visa Waiver Program allows citizens of 38 countries to travel without a visa to the United States for business or tourism for stays of up to 90 days. Key sections of Bennet's bill were passed in December as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Now individuals who have traveled to Syria or Iraq in the past five years are required to acquire a traditional tourist visa instead of traveling to the United States without a visa under the waiver program. This requires them to be interviewed by an American consular official and submit biometric information, such as their fingerprints, so they can be vetted before they’re allowed to enter the United States. "We have to continue to do everything we can to degrade and destroy ISIS, including increased air strikes targeting their economic infrastructure and oil production. We also need to redouble our efforts to disrupt their recruitment online," Bennet told Colorado Public Radio recently. Our ruling Restoration PAC says Bennet "chose the (Washington) insiders over our generals" in the battle against Islamic State. The group says President Obama’s withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq fueled the rise of ISIS and blames Bennet for supporting the withdrawal and for generally backing Obama. However, Bennet has advocated for a strong defense against terrorism, passed legislation to prevent potential terrorists from using the Visa Waiver Program to easily enter the United States and backs initiatives to counter extremists from recruiting people online. It's a big stretch to say that because Bennet supported the withdrawal and welcomed home U.S. troops after a long war, he chose Washington insiders "over our generals." We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/631c3593-8987-495b-9829-ce229320ff0f	None	Restoration PAC	None	None	None	2016-10-27T15:36:27	2016-10-13	['None']
pomt-00959	"Monarch butterflies are becoming extinct" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/17/peter-defazio/are-gmos-causing-monarch-butterflies-become-extinc/	Monarch butterflies are an unexpected victim of the widespread adoption of genetically modified crops, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said last week. A genetically modified organism has had its DNA altered in a way that does not occur in nature. One purpose is to increase the plants’ tolerance to pesticides and herbicides. Opponents of GMOs, as they are called, believe they pose health risks, though there’s no generally accepted science that says GMO products are harmful to health. Environmental impacts, however, are the focus of DeFazio’s claim. DeFazio is an advocate for policies that would require food labels to indicate if the product was made with genetically modified crops. In an appearance on MSNBC with celebrity chef Tom Colicchio on Feb. 12, DeFazio said GMO crops are harmful to nature. "We certainly know there is going to be secondary harm to the environment," he said. "In fact, monarch butterflies are becoming extinct because of this sort of dumping, (the) huge increase in pesticides’ use because of these modified organisms." We decided to take a closer look at the effect of GMOs on the iconic orange and black butterflies. There’s little doubt that the monarch population is on the decline, but experts say that the adoption of genetically modified crops is not the sole factor. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the monarch population has dropped 90 percent over the past 20 years. Every winter, monarch butterflies migrate from the Midwestern United States corn-belt region to the Oyamel fir forests in Mexico. This chart from Monarch Watch, a conservation group, shows the steep population change, in terms of the total area occupied by monarchs during their winter stay in Mexico: The evidence suggests that DeFazio exaggerated when he said monarchs are "becoming extinct." The World Wildlife Fund classifies them as "near threatened," which means they are "likely to become endangered in the near future." That classification is several steps away from extinct. And conservation experts told us that they are optimistic that the monarch population can be at least partially restored if the right steps are taken. "Monarchs are not in danger of extinction," said Lincoln Brower, a monarch conservation scientist at Sweet Briar College. "What is endangered is their spectacular migration and overwintering behavior." Still, even if they are not on the verge of extinction, monarchs are certainly on the decline, at least for now. Why? Several reasons are evident, including deforestation in Mexico, recent weather patterns and reduced availability of milkweed, the butterflies’ main food source. The deforestation stems from illegal logging in Mexico. It has reduced the areas where monarchs can migrate, affecting their lifecycle. However, the Mexican government has largely curtailed the problem in the past five years, Brower said. As far as weather, a serious drought in Texas a couple years ago reduced the amount of flowers along the monarchs’ migration route. This is a problem because, in order to survive the migration, the butterflies need to pick up nectar along the way. And in 2014, an extra-long winter prevented monarchs from migrating successfully back to the United States from Mexico, Brower told the Washington Post. By far the biggest threat, though, is the lowered prevalence of milkweed, due to the increasing use of GMO crops that can withstand a heavy dose of herbicides, Brower said. Milkweed grows in and around crops such as corn and soybeans that are heavily concentrated in the U.S. Midwest. This is the monarch’s spring, summer and fall habitat, and milkweed serves as both the species’ primary food source and where its larvae grow. The problem is that, unlike the GMO crops in close proximity, the milkweed cannot withstand the herbicides. (Milkweed, like other weeds, can stifle crop yield, so farmers don’t like it.) Brower cautioned that there is not yet certain proof that the expansion of GMO crops is causing milkweed declines. But there is an "extremely tight correlation" among the increased use of herbicide-tolerant crops, fewer milkweed plants and the declining monarch population, he said. A 2012 study in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity estimated that between 1990 and 2010, milkweed prevalence declined 58 percent in Midwest agricultural areas. Over the same time frame, the Monarch population declined 81 percent. By 2011, 94 percent of soybean crops were genetically engineered to withstand the widely used herbicide Roundup, and 72 percent of corn crops were herbicide-tolerant. Both genetically modified crops were introduced in the mid 1990s. Additionally, a 2007 congressional ethanol mandate increased the price of corn and soybeans, which encouraged farmers to convert grassland -- where milkweed grows -- into cropland, said Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch and a professor of ecology at the University of Kansas. Some argue that conservationists and the media have placed too much blame on GMOs for the loss of monarchs, saying correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Andrew Kniss, a weed expert at the University of Wyoming, wrote in a blog post that the Insect Conservation and Diversity study does not specifically examine if the adoption of GMO crops and herbicides are the reason why milkweed is dying out. There could be another cause, he said. To back up his point, Kniss pointed to a study out of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Pennsylvania State University that showed only limited effects of herbicide-tolerant plants -- and the use of herbicides -- on native plant diversity outside the border of the agricultural field. Our ruling DeFazio said that "monarch butterflies are becoming extinct" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides. The evidence of a connection is suggestive but not conclusive. Monarch populations have been declining alongside a shrinkage in its primary food source -- milkweed -- and the increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides and herbicides. However, causation has not been established yet, and other culprits -- deforestation and unexpected weather events -- are likely to have played a role as well. Moreover, DeFazio exaggerated when he said that the butterfly species is "becoming extinct." It faces significant challenges, but monarchs remain several steps away from extinction, and many conservationists think the trend can be mitigated. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Peter DeFazio	None	None	None	2015-02-17T16:06:06	2015-02-12	['None']
pomt-10752	"More people in this country have seen UFOs than I think approve of George Bush's presidency."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/31/dennis-kucinich/bush-beats-aliens-by-16-points/	During the Democratic debate on Oct. 30, 2007, moderator Tim Russert asked longshot candidate Dennis Kucinich about a report that he had seen an unidentified flying object near the home of actress Shirley MacLaine. (MacLaine is the godmother of Kucinich's daughter.) Kucinich didn't say he believed in aliens, but he confirmed that he did see a mysterious light in the sky -- an unidentified flying object. Kucinich also had the snappy retort to Russert's playfulness: "More people in this country have seen UFOs than I think approve of George Bush's presidency." So do they? Russert's question riffed off a new Associated Press/Ipsos poll done for Halloween, which asked people about their belief in and experiences of the paranormal. The poll found 14 percent said they had seen a UFO themselves, and 34 percent said they "believed in" UFOs. We'll take the 14 percent of the people at their word that they did indeed see strange flying objects with no everyday explanation. But that's still a good 16 to 21 points below George Bush's approval ratings, which have hovered in the 30 to 35 percent range in 2007. Kucinich would have been accurate if he had said "More people BELIEVE in UFOs than approve of Bush's presidency." But because he said it the way he did, we find his claim to be False.

pomt-03470	Says a group "estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/15/oregon-republican-party/do-illegal-aliens-cost-oregon-1-billion-year/	The Oregon Republican Party endorses an initiative to overturn a new law that allows people in the country illegally to apply for special driving cards in Oregon. Suzanne Gallagher, the state party’s chairwoman, issued a press release with a list of reasons to reject the bill that was signed into law by Gov. John Kitzhaber on May 1. Here’s one reason that caught our eye: "OFIR estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion." Oregonians for Immigration Reform is a vocal and passionate group that opposes illegal immigration. OFIR did not itself calculate the costs, but relies on a December 2012 report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington, D.C., organization that also opposes illegal immigration. FAIR offers state analyses as well as a national analysis. It is impossible to get firm numbers when it comes to undocumented immigrants. Furthermore, studies differ on whether they are a net drain or net gain or have a negligible effect on government. Recent news reports indicate that unauthorized workers put more money into Social Security and Medicare than they will get out, because they’re not eligible for those benefits. Actually, they are not eligible for most government assistance, but their children, born in the United States, are U.S. citizens and can qualify for medical assistance and social services. Our sister PolitiFact publications have tackled similar statements in their states and ruled differently: Half True in Georgia and False in Florida and in New Jersey. They could not offer better calculations on the costs of immigration. We won’t either. FAIR study How did FAIR figure a $1 billion hit to taxpayers in Oregon? First, the organization estimates that 170,000 undocumented immigrants -- or "illegal aliens" -- and their children live in Oregon. Schooling costs make up roughly half of the $1.077 billion they consume in government services; K-12 classes plus help for students with limited English skills make up nearly three-quarters of the $1.077 billion. The rest of the costs to taxpayers comes from criminal justice and social services. On the flip side, FAIR estimates that undocumented immigrants contribute about $77 million a year in the form of gas, property, income and tobacco taxes. The yearly difference, then, is $1 billion. The Pew Hispanic Center puts the undocumented population in Oregon at 160,000, with a low of 110,000 to a high of 220,000. FAIR’s overall number of 170,000 is in the ballpark. FAIR estimates there are 10,715 undocumented children in Oregon schools, plus 48,215 children born in the country to undocumented parents, for a total of 58,930 children in Oregon schools. Public schools don’t track the information, as they must provide education regardless of documentation. What we do know is that in 2011-12 there were roughly 59,000 students identified as "English Language Learners" in Oregon, of which 46,500 receive language development services, according to a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Education. Obviously, not every child who needs help learning English is in the country illegally, or is the child of parents who are here illegally, but this leads us to think that FAIR’s population estimates could be, again, within field-sized ballpark range. The statewide average cost to educate a child was $9,364 in state, local and federal money in 2011-12. Schools receive from the state an additional $3,000 -- very roughly -- for each child who needs special language programs. Using FAIR’s numbers, you end up with $100.3 million to educate undocumented children and $451 million to educate children born in the country to undocumented parents. That’s close to FAIR’s overall estimate of $575 million for K-12 education. FAIR also calculates an extra $159 million to provide special English language classes for students. Most of that, $130 million, goes to help U.S. citizens, according to the analysis. We end up with $140 million if we multiply 46,500 students by $3,000. The rest of the study is summarized this way: About $111 million for health and emergency care, including $85 million for U.S.-born children; about $140 million for policing and incarceration of criminals; about $13 million for food and child care assistance on behalf of citizen children; and roughly $79 million in miscellaneous. Critics FAIR’s reports have been greatly criticized by both the Immigration Policy Center and Competitive Enterprise Institute. Both groups say that the analysis inflates the economic harm done by undocumented immigrants, ignores the tax benefits of immigration, and perhaps more significantly, unfairly includes the costs of educating and providing health care for U.S.-born children. FAIR says it’s fair to include the costs of educating children born in the United States. "We don’t try to hide that we are including the costs," said Ira Mehlman, a FAIR spokesman. "If not for the fact the parents were here breaking the law, we would not be incurring the costs." The Oregon Center for Public Policy did its own analysis in January 2012. The economic think tank is friendly to immigrants and estimates that the 110,000 to 220,000 undocumented immigrants in the state earn between $2.3 billion to $4.5 billion a year, which they spend on goods and services. The center also estimates workers pay between $154 million to $309 million in taxes, including Social Security and Medicare taxes they won’t be able to use later, as well as property, state and local taxes. Their employers also pay taxes on behalf of workers. Advocates of stricter immigration rules argue that those benefits are over-inflated because legal residents and U.S. citizens could just as easily hold those jobs. Ruling The Oregon Republican Party states that an outside organization "estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion." This is a murky area and if we could calculate a definitive balance sheet of what illegal immigration costs taxpayers, well, we’d be in a different line of work. Still, our reporting finds the education cost estimates are plausible. What is problematic is that well more than half of the $1 billion can be credited to U.S. citizens. FAIR’s own numbers suggest nearly $700 million for the lawful children of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Those citizens are not "illegal aliens." The $1 billion calculation also ignores taxes paid by and on behalf of undocumented workers. The statement includes an element of truth. There is some basis for some of the numbers. We can sympathize with critics of illegal immigration who say it’s appropriate to include the costs of educating children, even if they are U.S. citizens. But citizens are not "aliens" and the bulk of the estimated $1 billion goes to provide services to people entitled to receive those services. We find the statement Mostly False.

pomt-00103	"A lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care. There are counties out there, in my former Senate district, that didn’t have doctors and providers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/30/troy-balderson/ohio-troy-balderson-brings-seldom-mentioned-health/	Obamacare was supposed to make health coverage available to most Americans. But for someone to get coverage, an insurance company must sell it -- and that’s a problem when insurers pull out of a market, as they have in recent years, says an Ohio candidate in a 2018 congressional contest. Troy Balderson, who won a race this summer for a temporary stint representing Ohio’s 12th Congressional District and now is running to keep it, reminded voters of this recently. Discussing the Affordable Care Act on Columbus TV, Balderson, a Republican, said access is one of the health law’s shortcomings. He sees plenty of others -- he is a "repeal and replace" advocate -- but lots of other candidates are talking about those, and this was different enough to catch our attention. "A lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care," Balderson told Scott Light, an anchor of WBNS, during an Oct. 20 program on the race between Balderson and his Democratic opponent, Danny O’Connor. "There are counties out there, in my former Senate district, that didn’t have doctors and providers." Did that really happen? And wasn’t the ACA supposed to provide access to care, not remove it? Let’s see how things have turned out. Last year’s worries Broadly speaking, Balderson was referring to the start of the Affordable Care Act, his campaign said. The main provisions began in 2014. "Numerous insurers pulled out of communities and counties when Obamacare was enacted leaving many of the constituents in my former State Senate district to drive to other parts of Ohio, and even across state lines, for their health care needs," Balderson told PolitiFact in a statement. "This was just the beginning of the problems with Obamacare, and it's one of the many reasons I am committed to solving the problems in our healthcare system so patients have access to affordable care by a doctor in their community." We’ll look at what happened at the beginning. But first, since Balderson was speaking in such narrow geographical terms, it helps to go back just one year, to the summer of 2017. That’s when health insurers were preparing for the coming year and the Ohio Department of Insurance announced preliminary participation by county. The number of insurers selling policies in the ACA marketplace was falling, with some companies complaining the cost of care was too high or the ACA market, mired in political controversy, was too uncertain. For a time, it looked as if 20 Ohio counties might wind up with no insurers at all in the ACA’s individual market for 2018. That included Guernsey, Morgan and Muskingum counties, in Balderson’s Senate district. What would people do if that happened? It became unnecessary to answer that question, because Gov. John Kasich and the Ohio Department of Insurance persuaded insurers working in other counties to fill the void. The crisis was averted. Nevertheless, 42 out of Ohio’s 88 counties wound up with only one insurer, and 20 counties wound up with two, according to the state insurance department. That meant residents buying policies on the individual exchange had limited or no choice of insurers. It also meant that if they wanted to stay in-network and avoid potentially big costs, they had to use the doctors and hospitals chosen by the limited number of insurers. More time We looked at the three above-mentioned counties to see how this played out. Guernsey, Morgan and Muskingum counties have only one ACA insurer now, CareSource. Each also had only one insurer in 2017. That insurer was Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. In other words, people buying ACA policies in both 2017 and 2018 had only one choice, but that choice required a change from Anthem in 2017 to CareSource in 2018. In 2016, the choice for those consumers was much broader, since Guernsey and Muskingum had 5 companies vying for ACA customers and Morgan had six. The ACA market has never been entirely static. From its start, insurers tested it for a year or two and then made new decisions. For example, in 2014, Guernsey and Muskingum counties had two insurers, and Morgan had three. Two more insurers decided to enter each of those counties in 2015, and one more in each county in 2016. That was the trend: A small number of insurers came into the market, more joined it the next year and even more the year after. But then came a retreat in 2017, with some insurers beating a path out. Rural counties hit hardest We were curious to see if fewer people bought insurance coverage as the number of carriers fell. So we looked at ACA enrollment data reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, comparing 2016, when there were more choices, and 2018. Two of the counties, Muskingum and Guernsey, both of which went from five insurers to one, saw a drop in insurance purchases -- Muskingum by nearly 16 percent, Guernsey by 9 percent. Yet Morgan, which went from six insurers to one, saw a 7 percent rise. Because of other factors, including the economy, it is impossible to say there was a direct cause and effect. This is not to minimize the difficulty there, but for insurers, these are tiny markets. Only 1,504 people bought ACA policies Muskingum County this year, and only 303 in Morgan and 676 in Guernsey, according to CMS data. Looking up Balderson spoke of the past. But what lies ahead? It turns out that Ohio will gain two more insurers in 2019, although they won’t all participate in each county, bringing the statewide total from eight to 10. One of the new ones is Anthem, which retreated from Ohio amid uncertainty over the ACA but is coming back. In Balderson’s old Senate district, Guernsey County, now with one ACA insurer, will have two next year, according to the state. So will Morgan County. And Muskingum will have three. A broader view Before we rule on Balderson’s claim, it’s important to note that Balderson says he was speaking of changes after the ACA’s enactment, not just last year. So we wanted to look at pre- and post-ACA factors. But we found that good county-by-county counts of insurers didn’t exist before the ACA because there weren’t requirements to keep them at such a narrow level. But what about states? Were there more carriers in each state -- providing more access -- before the ACA? The problem with such comparisons, we found, is they are like comparing apples to oranges. The nature of the policies and their coverage was different before the health law kicked in in 2014. Before the ACA, a company could reject customers with pre-existing conditions, pay for fewer kinds care, close off enrollment or insure only a tiny or select group of people, Cynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation told us. In fact, insurers set up subsidiaries sometimes for just that purpose. "So before the the ACA, you see a bunch of plans with about five people enrolled in them," Cox, the Kaiser foundation’s director for health reform and private insurance, said. She said that in 2006, 27 percent of plans in a given state had fewer than 100 enrolles. To make accurate comparisons, Cox looks at the number of insurers that are significant competitors, a measure that groups subsidiaries as part of the parent company. A significant competitor is a company with more than 5 percent of a state’s market share. In Ohio, there were three such companies in 2011, three years before the ACA kicked in. The number grew to four with the start of the ACA, then to five in 2015, then back to four in 2016. Overall, the trend nationally -- the number of carriers -- is "remarkably flat," Cox said. There are other ways to measure access to care, including changes in the number of uninsured people, although that includes a large number who got coverage through Medicaid’s expansion, a facet of the ACA. Counting them, the share of uninsured Ohioans fell by 45 percent -- to 6 percent -- between 2013 and 2017, U.S. Census figures show. Our ruling Balderson said that "a lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care." He then spoke specifically about people in his former Ohio Senate district. It is true that a number of them dealt with changes, especially in the counties we mentioned. Nearly half of all Ohio counties, each in a small market, wound up with only a single ACA carrier this year. For some people, that changed their access to the doctors and hospitals they preferred. Yet things will improve for many in 2019. And even counting all the changes since the ACA began, many more people have health coverage now than before. This has been part of the ACA’s push and pull from the start. If you are a constituent who lost access to your preferred insurer or provider, you might have called Balderson to urge him to fight for change. If you are a citizen who got health care because of the ACA, you might have joined a protest in hopes Congress will leave it alone. That’s why we rate his claim Half True.

Gallego is challenging Hurd in a November 8 general election, a rematch that saw Gallego lose to Hurd two years ago in the "swing" congressional district. Gallego has gone after Hurd’s voting record as a defender of the national park in an attack ad and news releases. In an April 22, 2016 press release, Gallego said Hurd co-sponsored "a bill that would militarize our border and allow 200 miles of new roads to be built in the Big Bend region -- cutting up our beloved park." Gallego said he was concerned about the Secure Our Borders First Act, or House Resolution 399, introduced by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, on Jan. 16, 2015. The bill would bring an increase in federal agents and hundreds of new miles of roads to Texas’ most scenic area. In a Jan. 17, 2015 video, McCaul said his measure sets new infrastructure requirements for each U.S. Customs and Border Protection sector along the entire U.S.-Mexico border and provides penalties to step up security. According to congressional records, Hurd was one of 15 original cosponsors of HR 399. Ten of the original cosponsors were Texas Republicans; all of the bill’s cosponsors, totalling 29 representatives as of Jan. 22, 2015, were Republicans. The bill authorizes new roads across the entire southern U.S. border with Mexico, and it specifies construction in what U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement calls the Big Bend sector. The sector, formerly called the Marfa sector, encompasses 77 Texas counties and the state of Oklahoma — 165,154 square miles. The Hurd-backed measure, which cleared the McCaul-chaired House Committee on Homeland Security on Jan. 21, 2015, requires 192 miles of road to be built in the Big Bend sector federal land, which includes the national park. It also authorizes three Forward Operating Bases with detention space, power and water, and a helicopter landing zone, and six miles of vehicle fencing. To our query about the backup for Gallego’s claim, campaign spokesman Anthony Gutierrez pointed out by email that "the legislation in question specifically directs the chief of Border Patrol to prioritize the ‘physical land border’ and to move personnel to the border...Big Bend National Park is on the border." The bill also waives 16 different federal laws relating to historical preservation, conservation and the environment — a major reason why a coalition of 85 environmental advocacy groups including the Sierra Club opposed the bill in a Jan. 27, 2015 letter to Congress. It also forbids the Agriculture and Interior secretaries from restricting Customs and Border Protection activity on federal land located within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, for the purposes of conducting a list of activities that begins with "Construction and maintenance of roads." Dan Millis of the Sierra Club’s Borderlands program said: "Oftentimes these supposed border bills are disguised as border bills but they’re really public land attacks," he said. "In addition to waiving these important laws, the miles of border walls cause flooding, fragment wildlife habitat, and block wildlife migration corridors, and they don’t work—people are able to climb walls." Unlike states to the west, Texas doesn’t have much federal land along the border — only Big Bend, a wildlife refuge in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and the small Amistad Canyon National Recreational Area. That doesn’t mean that the roads the bill requires would necessarily be built in the park, but it does mean there would be less of a logistical hurdle to building roads in the park than elsewhere in the sector, since the government could skip the hassle of eminent domain claims on private land. To our inquiry, Justin Hollis, Hurd's campaign manager , said by email that the bill "would not authorize hundreds of miles of roads through the park or threaten natural habitats." Hollis pointed out that the Big Bend sector for Customs and Border Protection is far larger than just Big Bend National Park. But many of the provisions in the bill are specific to areas within 100 miles of the border or targeted at increasing "border accessibility." Because environmental protection laws would be waived, Gallego claims the bill would allow roads to be built in the park — but how likely is it that the roads would actually go through the park, as opposed to elsewhere in the sector? To find out where the roads might go, we spoke to Homeland Security committee staffer Paul Anstine. "The law mileage that you see in the bill were developed in close consultation with stakeholders like" the Border Patrol "and other people who are involved in the border security business but specifically where mile ‘x’ of 190 would go, that’s something that, in general, we defer to the executive branch," Anstine said, adding that the Border Patrol "is probably in the best position to tell you where each and every mile of the road needs to go, what areas they need access to." Anstine also pointed out that since the 2005 passage into law of the Real ID Act, it has been within the power of the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive laws protecting national parks for border security purposes. By email, Bill Brooks, Supervisory Public Affairs Specialist for CBP in Marfa, said he would not comment on pending legislation, but that the CBP sector and the park have "an excellent working relationship. In fact we have agents who live and work in the park. Additionally, we are most respectful of the environment in the park. As a matter of fact, when it is time to go off road to pursue illegal immigrants, we do it on horseback." We wondered whether other federal agencies might be able to shed light on the bill. A Jan. 22, 2015 statement by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson offered a sharp rebuke of the policies outlined in the bill, calling them counterproductive and "not a serious effort at legislating border security — and its authors know it." "The bill is extreme to the point of being unworkable; if enacted, it would actually leave the border less secure. The bill sets mandatory and highly prescriptive standards that the Border Patrol itself regards as impossible to achieve, undermines the Department of Homeland Security’s capacity to adapt to emerging threats, and politicizes tactical decisions," Johnson wrote. Our ruling Gallego said Hurd "cosponsored a bill that would militarize our border and allow 200 miles of new roads to be built in the Big Bend region -- cutting up our beloved park." Gallego accurately recapped key elements of the Secure Our Borders First Act backed by Hurd and other Texas Republicans in the House. The legislation would clear the way for construction of 192 miles of new roads, towers and law enforcement facilities along the border on federal lands in the vast Big Bend region of Texas. But whether these mandated moves entail carving up the treasured national park remains to be seen—or at least, Gallego didn’t prove nor could we confirm that outcome. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 6:00 p.m., May 27, 2016: After we published this fact check, the Gallego campaign pointed out that the Hurd-backed bill exempts both private and state-owned land, leaving only federal lands available for construction of roads and other border security measures called for in the legislation. We’ve corrected this fact check to show this exemption; it did not change our rating of this claim.	None	Pete Gallego	None	None	None	2016-05-25T20:00:00	2016-04-22	['None']
pomt-06652	"The first round of stimulus ... it created zero jobs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2009-stimulus-created-zero-jobs/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry criticized President Barack Obama's new jobs plan during a Republican presidential debate Sept. 12, 2011, saying his previous effort "created zero jobs." WOLF BLITZER: "Gov. Perry, the president in his new plan has a lot of tax cuts, payroll tax cuts, middle-class tax cuts, tax credits for hiring veterans, tax credits for hiring long-term unemployed people. Are those things you would support?" RICK PERRY: "And he's going to pay for them all with raising your taxes. That is the issue. He had $800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus. It created zero jobs, $400-plus billion dollars in this package. And I can do the math on that one. Half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs." PolitiFact has regularly checked job claims about the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, so this one caught our ears. Zero? Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts said in February 2010 that the stimulus bill "didn't create one new job." He earned a Pants on Fire. Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott said in September 2010 during his successful campaign for governor that the stimulus bill had "not created one private sector job." We smelled smoke. (We even found Billy Weston, a Florida Republican who personally credited the stimulus for his new job with a private Riviera Beach pharmaceutical manufacturer.) So, what's the evidence? The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Just for the quarter April 1 to June 20, 2011, the country had a reported 555,029 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the Recovery Act. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia have pointed out, in a report released March 18, 2011, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010. Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: • CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. • IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created. • Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created. • Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created. Note the language "created or saved," which means not every one of those more than a million jobs count as "created," as Perry said. But certainly more than zero. Ask Billy Weston. Perry said "the first round of stimulus ... created zero jobs." We say Pants on Fire.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-09-12T23:15:04	2011-09-12	['None']

pomt-00209	Says U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters "votes with Donald Trump 99 percent of the time."	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/oct/16/house-majority-pac/does-mimi-walters-support-trump-99-percent-time/	Democrats hoping to regain control of the U.S. House this November are trying to tie President Donald Trump and his policies around the necks of vulnerable congressional Republicans. That’s particularly true in California’s 45th Congressional District in Orange County, where Republican Rep. Mimi Walters is attempting to hold onto a seat in a district that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, puts Trump and Walters side by side a new TV ad. With Trump and Walters brand beer bottles in the background, and someone singing "99 Bottles of Beer," the House Majority PAC ad claims Walters votes with the president "99 percent of the time." The ad also says Walters "took big bucks from insurance interests" and that she voted for Trump’s plan to "strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and slap an age tax on older Californians." We addressed those claims in a separate fact-check. Here, we focus in on whether Walters’ votes put her in lock-step with Trump in a district that supported Clinton two years ago. 99 percent? House Majority PAC says Walters votes with Trump "99 percent of the time." That figure tracks back to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight. FiveThirtyEight tracked 93 key congressional votes since Trump took office to see whether members of Congress support or oppose the president’s agenda. According to FiveThirtyEight, Walters voted on Trump’s side in all but two instances. In one case, Walters missed a vote to rescind previously approved but as of yet unspent federal funding. Trump supported rescinding those federal dollars. In a second case, in July 2017, Walters voted to approve additional sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea that Trump had opposed. When you factor out the missed vote, according to FiveThirtyEight, Walters agreed with Trump in 91 of 92 instances, or 98.9 percent of the time. Five Congressional Republicans lined up a perfect 100 percent of the time with Trump, while Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., only voted in line with Trump 49 percent of the time. We decided to check Congressional Quarterly as well, which also tracks how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as his messages to Congress, news conference remarks and other public statements and documents. According to CQ (subscription required), Walters supported the president in 100 percent of the time in 2017. So, when it comes to votes, Walters has been almost always on the side of Trump. One caveat: As we have said in the past, you can debate the value of these types of comparisons, as they may overlook instances where an elected official bucked the leader of his or her party. Walters did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling The House Majority PAC says that Walters votes in line with Trump 99 percent of the time. It is true that Walters has supported Trump’s agenda in almost every case. FiveThirtyEight looked at 93 votes and found Walters on the side of the president 99 percent of the time. CQ said Walters agreed with Trump 100 percent of the time in 2017 in the votes they studied. The caveat in claims like these is that you can debate the usefulness of the statistic itself.

pomt-03113	"Since sequester began federal employment has been subtracting 6,000-7,000 jobs per month"	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/20/political-line/math-sequester-job-cuts-doesnt-add/	There has been a renewed focus on jobs and how many the economy has lost as Republicans and Democrats continue to do battle and threat of a government shutdown looms. Recently a political commentator took to Twitter highlighting job losses since across-the-board, automatic federal budget cuts -- known as sequestration -- took effect March 1. "Since sequester began federal employment has been subtracting 6,000 to 7,000 jobs per month," the Political Line Twitter post said. If Political Line’s claim is correct, that would mean between 30,000 and 35,000 federal jobs have been lost for the five months, through August, that the sequester has been in effect. That type of possible job loss had us intrigued, so we decided to follow the numbers. PolitiFact Georgia emailed Political Line and visited its website for more information about the claim and about the author but received no response to our requests. Political Line is a political blog of postings on a variety of national topics from health care to drug policy, along with an aggregation of news stories. Under sequestration, the federal government will cut about $85 billion in spending by the end of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. As a previous PolitiFact sequestration fact check noted, putting money into the economy does create jobs, and less money leads to fewer jobs in the short run. There have been numerous reports of the sequester’s impact, including departments limping along on tight budgets, employees forced to take unpaid furlough days and Head Start students being cut from the rolls. And this week, Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray blamed the horrific Navy Yard shooting on the sequester. When asked by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo how shooter Aaron Alexis, who was being treated for mental health issues, was still able to get access to areas that he probably shouldn’t have had, Gray responded: "As I look at, for example, sequestration, which is about saving money in the federal government being spent, have we somehow skimped on what would be available for projects like this and then we put people at risk," Gray said on CNN’s "New Day" the morning after the shooting. Those accounts have provided anecdotal evidence about sequestration’s impact. But when it comes to the actual number of jobs lost to sequestration, we really just don’t know, said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow and federal budget policy expert at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning D.C. think tank. "There isn’t anyone, including (the federal Office of Management and Budget), that has gone agency by agency and says what did you do, and how did you do it, and say how many jobs were lost," Lilly said. As for Political Line’s claim, with millions of federal employees, the 6,000-7,000 monthly job loss is statistically not a big thing, Lilly said. "You could lose that many with just inaccurate or inconsistent reporting. It makes sense to me." With no official analysis, numbers from multiple studies and financial reports have been used to detail sequester job cuts. In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 750,000 more full-time jobs would be created in the U.S. economy by the end of the year without sequestration. A Goldman Sachs study, released this month, noted that the sequestration could end up costing another 100,000 federal jobs in the next few quarters, and that federal jobs have declined by 71,000 since last year. To get a more accurate count, we reviewed month-to-month federal government employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from March 2013 (when sequestration began) through August, the most recent data available. Month All federal employees Month-to-month change Federal employees, minus postal workers Month-to-month change March 2,762,000 2,173,400 April 2,777,000 15,000 2,169,000 (4,400) May 2,757,000 (20,000) 2,168,200 (800) June 2,761,000 4,000 2,172,100 3,900 July 2,753,000 (8,000) 2,162,000 (10,100) August 2,752,000 1,000 2,162,100 (100) The BLS data showed that federal employment varied from month to month. Some months saw job losses exceeding Political Line’s claim of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs lost; but other months saw job gains. So what about Political Line’s claim? The political blogger said in a Twitter post that since sequestration, federal government jobs have decreased 6,000-7,000 jobs a month. There has been no official analysis of jobs lost to the sequester. There is anecdotal evidence that the budget cuts have hurt the federal sector, but at the same time, there have been job gains -- albeit marginal -- in the private sector. Using the best data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the numbers show that some months federal job losses reached and exceeded Political Line’s claim, but in other months, the losses were much less, and there were even job gains. Political Line’s statement contains an element of truth, but it needs clarification and additional information. Reviewing the data over the previous 12 months does show an overall downward trend in federal government jobs, but the monthly totals fluctuate. And overall the job reduction is far less than the statement would indicate. We rate it Mostly False.	None	The Political Line	None	None	None	2013-09-20T00:00:00	2013-09-11	['None']
pomt-01042	Middle-class Americans "pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/25/tammy-baldwin/middle-class-pays-higher-tax-rates-millionaires-se/	In his sixth State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise taxes on the rich and give tax breaks to the middle class. It was a message similar to one issued a week earlier by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. "For far too long, our tax code has unfairly favored the wealthiest Americans, while middle-class families in Wisconsin have struggled to get ahead," Baldwin said in a Jan. 13, 2015 news release issued with U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. "I’m proud to once again join Senator Whitehouse to introduce the Paying a Fair Share Act, also known as the ‘Buffett rule.’ It is simply unfair to ask middle-class Americans to pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires." Do middle-class Americans pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires? Some do. And some don’t. The Buffett rule The so-called Buffett rule refers to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. In 2011, he famously pronounced that he paid only 17.4 percent of his taxable income in federal income taxes, a lower percentage than any of his 20 employees. He proposed that federal tax rates be raised for taxpayers making more than $1 million. Obama took note of Buffett's comments in his 2012 State of the Union speech. Later that year Baldwin and Whitehouse introduced legislation that included the so-called Buffett rule: Under the measure, people making more than $2 million per year would pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent, while people making between $1 million and $2 million would see their minimum tax rates increase, on a sliding scale, up to 30 percent. The measure didn’t become law. Thus, the announcement from Baldwin and Whitehouse that they would reintroduce their legislation. Tax rates Hang with us here. The numbers can get kind of heavy. But it’s clear some -- though far from all -- middle-class Americans are paying higher tax rates. To back Baldwin’s claim about the disparity in tax rates, her office cited one portion of a March 2012 analysis of the proposed Buffett rule from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: A "large proportion" of millionaires pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than a "significant proportion" of moderate-income taxpayers, said the report, which defined moderate-income as taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000. More specifically, roughly a quarter of all millionaires face a tax rate that is lower than the tax rate faced by 10 percent of the moderate-income taxpayers. And on average, according to the report, the below-$100,000 taxpayers paid 35 percent of their taxable income in taxes (income and payroll), while the millionaires paid 30 percent. Of course, some middle-class taxpayers, and some millionaires, paid much lower or much higher rates. For instance, people in the 10th percentile of the below-$100,000 group paid a rate of 14 percent -- less than the 16 percent for the 10th percentile of the millionaire group. But looking at the 90th percentile in each group, the below-$100,000 group paid a rate of 49 percent, more than the 37 percent in the millionaire group. A key point: Higher-income taxpayers who enjoy low tax rates receive a very high proportion of their income from investment income, which is taxed at low rates, the report says. Conversely, lower-income taxpayers who face relatively high tax rates get most of their income from wages, which are subject to payroll taxes. In other words, your tax rate depends a lot on where your income comes from. We contacted the author of the report, economist Thomas Hungerford, who is now at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. He told us that since his report was published, taxes on wealthier Americans -- including on income, capital gains and dividends -- have been raised. But Hungerford said the thrust of his report remains accurate: A "substantial number" of middle-class Americans pay higher tax rates than some millionaires. A more recent report, published in December 2014 by the Tax Foundation, which promotes lower tax rates, noted that the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid a higher effective income tax rate (22.8 percent) than any other group and nearly seven times higher than taxpayers in the bottom 50 percent (3.28 percent). Our rating Baldwin said middle-class Americans "pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires." Some do and some don’t. For a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-09044	Says his GOP challenger, Doug MacGinnitie, "hadn’t voted in a Republican primary for almost 20 years until 2008.	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/04/brian-kemp/secretary-state-brian-kemp-says-challenger-didnt-v/	There's no shortage of sniping in the Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state. Candidates have traded accusations of political careerism, incompetence and dishonesty for months. This time around, seven-month incumbent Brian Kemp and opponent Doug MacGinnitie are squabbling over their voter registration histories. Kemp said in a speech posted on YouTube that MacGinnitie failed to vote in Republican primaries for two decades. MacGinnitie countered by posting a commercial that says Kemp's record shows he voted for Democrats. They have both accused each other of "hypocrisy." The brawl made its way from the Internet to the airwaves when reporter Lori Geary confronted the rivals on WSB-TV June 28. They repeated their attacks and piled on a couple more. A separate Truth-O-Meter item will focus on MacGinnitie's attack on Kemp. This one addresses Kemp's attack on MacGinnitie. Kemp bashed his rival during a Cobb County GOP breakfast June 5. His campaign posted a recording of Kemp's speech on YouTube. “I’ve got a solid conservative record. But when you look at my opponent, he doesn’t tell you that he hadn’t voted in a Republican primary for almost 20 years until 2008,” Kemp told the crowd. That's a long time for a Republican to opt out of voting Republican. We requested MacGinnitie's voter history from the Georgia secretary of state, which keeps voting records. Records show that MacGinnitie voted 23 times in Georgia since 1988. Six were in the Republican primary process: in 1988 for president; 1996 for president; 1996 in the general primary runoff; 2000 for president; 2008 for president; and 2008 in the general primary. MacGinnitie voted twice in Democratic primaries: the 1988 general primary runoff; and the 1992 presidential primary. In those races, he was using the "Rush Limbaugh playbook" -- voting for the weakest Democrat to boost Republican chances for victory, his spokesman said. Six votes in Republican primaries is a bit more than none. We contacted the Kemp campaign for an explanation. They said that while MacGinnitie did vote in presidential Republican primaries, he didn't start voting in state Republican primaries until 2008, when he was gearing up to run for higher office. This is a major failing on MacGinnitie's part, a Kemp campaign consultant contended. In areas such as their opponent's heavily Republican neighborhood, the party primary can be even more important than the general election because Democrats are such a long shot. "In those areas, the state Republican primary is the entire election. It decides who wins, not the general election," campaign consultant Joel McElhannon told PolitiFact Georgia in an e-mail. What's worse, MacGinnitie sat on the sidelines at a time when local and state Republicans needed supporters, McElhannon said. For much of the past 20 years, the party was in the midst of a resurgence that made it possible for the GOP to dominate Georgia politics for the first time since the Reconstruction. MacGinnitie's spokesman acknowledged that his candidate's voting record has room for improvement. It's correct that primaries often decide elections in areas that lean heavily toward one political party, and MacGinnitie did not vote in state and local races that were important to the Republican Party. But the attack Kemp made on MacGinnitie has serious problems. During the Cobb breakfast, Kemp could have told voters that MacGinnitie did not vote in a state Republican primary for 20 years. This would have been accurate. Instead, he said his opponent did not vote in a "Republican primary." There's no mention of state primaries. Kemp's campaign countered that most Republican voters in party strongholds understand that "Republican primary" means "state Republican primary." They added that typically, Kemp does specify in speeches and campaign e-mails that he is talking about state Republican primaries, not national ones. Yet Kemp's speech in Cobb was not a one-time misstep. His campaign has made the same inaccurate claim over and again. A flier and list titled "Doug MacGinnitie's Documented Lies" his own campaign e-mailed to PolitiFact Georgia contained the same accusation. We rule Kemp's statement False.

In her second inaugural speech in January and in her budget address Thursday, Feb. 12, Hassan, a Democrat, made a point of drawing attention to New Hampshire’s rosy reputation. "Our country’s economy continues to strengthen – and in many respects, New Hampshire remains ahead of the curve," Hassan said, ticking off a number of economic statistics. One was that "our median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation,." In both speeches, Hassan pointed out that statistics don’t always tell the whole story, saying that some working class families in the state continue to struggle. Still, was New Hampshire really at the top of the nation in 2013 in terms of household income? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check it out. The statistic Hassan cited came from data collected and compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, her staff pointed to a set of data released in September 2014 that summed up the latest findings from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement. While the census conducts a population count every 10 years, it also compiles other types of data — on income, for example — through other surveys that occur more frequently. In this case, the data was collected over a period of three months in 2013 — February, March and April. According to the census data, New Hampshire’s median household income was $71,322 in 2013 — which was not only higher than the national median, but also higher than any other state. As with any survey, there are some limitations to consider. One factor concerns how the data was calculated. To determine income, the census asks people to report the money they received during the previous year from multiple sources, including: earnings, unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, public assistance and more. The census also notes that "money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits," such as food stamps. As noted by Drew Desilver for Pew Research Center, "some economists say that income data have too many flaws to be the primary measure of inequality." "For one thing," Desilver said, "most income-inequality measures use income before taxes and transfer payments (such as Social Security, food stamps and unemployment benefits), which act to reduce inequality." Some researchers, Desilver notes, have instead suggested that other measures — someone’s consumption, for example — would be a better way to measure someone’s "economic well-being." Another factor to consider is the timing of the data. Using other census data that looks beyond just 2013, the year Hassan cited, shows that New Hampshire loses its top spot to Virginia when 2012 and 2014 information is considered. Our ruling Gov. Maggie Hassan said New Hampshire’s "median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation." Looking at U.S. Census data only for that year, Hassan is correct. For other recent periods, however, New Hampshire ranks just below the top. In the meantime, census data is widely trusted, but other calculation methods may have produced different results. However, Hassan was correct in qualifying that statement by suggesting that the survey might not tell the whole story. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Maggie Hassan	None	None	None	2015-02-13T16:17:15	2015-02-12	['None']
pomt-06526	"Today, the Social Security system is broke."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/09/steve-lonegan/conservative-activist-steve-lonegan-claims-social-/	If conservative activist Steve Lonegan is to be believed, millions of people throughout the country should not expect to receive any more Social Security checks. During a recent discussion on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show, Lonegan, state director of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, suggested that the federal program had run out of money. Lonegan appeared on the show with Deborah Howlett, president of the left-leaning New Jersey Policy Perspective. "Today, the Social Security system is broke," Lonegan said during the show broadcast on Oct. 1 and 2. "For the first year since the 75 years Deb talked about, they’re in a cash-flow negative situation." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Social Security is facing long-term fiscal challenges, but the program is not broke. According to federal projections, scheduled benefits should continue to be paid in full for about another 25 years. Let’s explain how Social Security is funded. Social Security benefits and administrative costs are paid from two trust funds, which are made up of payroll taxes, income taxes on some Social Security benefits and interest owed by the government for fund balances. The surplus in any given year is turned over to the U.S. Treasury to finance other government operations in exchange for government securities. Those securities, which comprise the trust fund balances, essentially represent money the government owes itself. By the end of 2010, the trust funds held securities worth about $2.6 trillion. But here’s the sign of long-term fiscal woes: starting last year, Social Security no longer takes in enough annual tax revenue to cover its expenses each year. With interest earnings, the program’s total income will only be able to pay the bills until 2023. After the trust funds start to make up the difference, those reserves will be depleted by 2036. At that point, tax revenues would only support 77 percent of scheduled benefits. In 2085, tax income would cover 74 percent of scheduled benefits. So even if nothing is done to address the problem, roughly three-quarters of benefits would still be paid about 75 years from now. Lonegan argued that "broke" wasn’t too strong of a word to describe Social Security. The revenues don’t match the expenditures, and the government will have to borrow money to meet the obligations of the trust funds, Lonegan said. "They’re basically living on borrowed time," Lonegan said. Lonegan referred us to Peter Ferrara, who served in the White House Office of Policy Development under President Ronald Reagan. Ferrara agreed that Social Security is broke, partly because tax revenues don’t fully support the program and trust funds are just made up of securities. "Those trust funds are not real money," Ferrara said. Other experts we spoke to argued that Social Security is not broke. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank, pointed out how the U.S. Treasury bonds held by the trust funds are "the most secure asset in the world," and can be presented for payment at face value at any time. "Is a person 'broke' if he has a big bank account that is paying interest, which together with current earnings, more than covers expenses, so that the account balance is increasing?" Aaron said in an email. "I don't think so." Virginia Reno, vice president for income security policy for the National Academy of Social Insurance, said of Social Security: "It’s not broke in the sense that it’s gone." Stan Hinden, a Social Security expert with the American Association of Retired Persons, compared the program to his 15-year old car in need of repairs. "So, could you say that my car is ‘broken’?" Hinden said in an email. "No, I would say that I’ve got a great car with lots of mileage left. It just needs some repairs to keep it running well." Our ruling Lonegan claimed "the Social Security system is broke." It’s true that annual tax revenues no longer support the program’s expenses. But made up of government securities, Social Security’s trust funds should be able to cover full benefits until at least 2036. That deadline may be cause for concern, but it also means the system is not broke. We rate the statement False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02272	Charlie Crist "raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/08/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-raised-taxes-2009-and-wont-rule-out-/	Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill that will cut auto tag fees and pointed the finger at his predecessor for raising them in the first place. "We are going to right the wrong of the 2009 tax increase that Charlie Crist enacted," Scott said as he signed the fee rollback on April 2. Scott, a Republican, is expected to face Democratic frontrunner Crist in November. The Republican Party of Florida joined the Crist-as-tax-hiker chorus on Twitter: ".@charliecrist raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again." We’ll examine what type of taxes were raised under Crist in 2009 and what he has said about raising taxes in the future. Crist signed tax and fee increases in 2009 In May 2009, then-Republican Gov. Crist signed a $66.5 billion budget that included a slew of new taxes and fees -- roughly $2 billion worth -- intended to balance the state budget during the recession. The hikes included auto tag fees, a $1-a-pack cigarette tax, as well as higher fees to visit state parks and to file civil lawsuits and foreclosure actions. There is no dispute that Crist signed those tax and fee increases into law, but the Republican Party of Florida omits that the tax and fee hikes were supported by the Republican-led Legislature at the time. That includes influential Republican legislators who now in key leadership positions: Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, who was House majority whip at the time; House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel; and Senate President Don Gaetz. Recently, Crist made no apologies for supporting the auto tag increase when he spoke during an event in Tampa on the same day that Scott signed the cut into law. "We had to get through a tough time, and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions," Crist said in Tampa. "And we saved thousands of teachers' jobs, law enforcement officers' jobs, firefighters' jobs." What Crist has said about the potential for future tax increases As for Crist’s willingness to raise future taxes, the Republican Party of Florida pointed to a brief clip of MSNBC’s Ed Schultz interviewing Crist on Nov. 18, 2013, a couple of weeks after Crist declared his candidacy. We went looking for the complete exchange about taxes; here’s how it went: Schultz: "What is your philosophy of taxation? What would you do different. We have income inequality as a huge issue in this country. The wealthy seem to get the breaks. They have under the conservative rule. What would you do differently? What would you do with Florida’s finances and what would you expect? Would you expect more out of the wealthiest residents?" Crist: "Well, I think we all have to expect more out of each other. I don’t like to raise taxes. I don’t know that anybody really enjoys the idea of doing that. I did that as a governor, though." Schultz: "Would you do it again?" Crist: "If necessary, I would. I mean, you know." Schultz: "Is it necessary now?" Crist: "We have the highest budget we’ve had in the history of Florida right now at $74 billion. So, I don’t know if it’s necessary right now. I like to live within our means if we possibly can do so, but we have to properly fund public education. We have to properly fund the needs of the most vulnerable in our society. And when Governor Scott got elected, the very first session, he whacked public education funding by $1.3 billion." Schultz: "Would you restore that?" Crist: "Absolutely, we’d restore that." Schultz: "So that money would come back in under Charlie Crist." Crist: "Yes sir. It would. And the $300 million, he took out of higher ed the second session." Schultz: "And how would you pay for it?" Crist: "Pay for it by the existing revenues that we have. And if necessary, if we have to raise taxes, I would do it, but I’d rather not if we don’t have to. Like I said, I like to live within our means." Crist’s campaign website includes a mention of "tax cuts for middle-class families" on his policy position page about the economy and jobs, but it’s vague. It states: "Today, Florida’s tax policy works only if you are a special interest with a lobbyist – but it fails everyday Floridians and small business owners. As Governor, Charlie will reform government to put the people first, using incentives to help homegrown Florida small businesses grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving handouts to political supporters." We sent the claim by the Republican Party to Crist’s campaign and an informal adviser to the campaign, former state Sen. Steve Geller. Geller said Crist supports giving small businesses a tax break and pointed to part of Crist’s announcement speech in November: "As governor, we are going to have a tax policy that puts you the people first – and when we can cut taxes – and I do believe in cutting taxes – it is you the people who would get the relief – and when we spend money to help business, we are using it to grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving it away to supporters." Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said that Crist "raised taxes in 2009 and won’t rule out raising taxes again." Crist -- along with the Republican-led Legislature -- did raise the cigarette tax and a slew of fees including auto tag fees in 2009 to balance the budget during a recession. When asked in November if he would raise taxes in the future, Crist said "if necessary." The Republicans omitted Crist’s softer language in the same interview when he added, "I don’t know if it’s necessary right now." We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02734	"Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/18/peter-orszag/peter-orszag-says-medicare-spending-has-actually-f/	There’s broad agreement that one of the biggest challenges for the nation’s future fiscal health is rising federal spending on Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans age 65 and older. That’s why a recent claim that the costs are slowing down caught our attention. On the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of CNN's State of the Union, Peter Orszag said, "Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year." Orszag is the former director of the Office of Management and Budget for President Barack Obama. We wondered whether this was correct. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan budget-analysis arm -- projected that the cost of Medicare would rise (from 3 percent of gross domestic product today to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2038) due in large part to the aging of the baby-boom generation. So Orszag’s claim that Medicare costs are slowing down is notable and surprising. Initially, we had trouble finding monthly data for Medicare expenditures, but when we contacted Orszag, he pointed us to a CBO document, the "Monthly Budget Review for November 2013." (Orszag knows his CBO documents -- before taking the reins of OMB, he was CBO’s director.) In the document Orszag cited, CBO reported that, according to preliminary data, outlays for Medicare fell from $101 billion in October-November 2012 to $96 billion in October-November 2013. And the year-on-year decline was actually a little bit bigger once CBO smoothed out some calendar oddities. This fits the bill for what Orszag claimed -- a year-over-year decline in "nominal" Medicare costs. In fact, Orszag told PolitiFact, this decline is "all the more remarkable because the number of beneficiaries is rising." In the meantime, while an absolute decline in Medicare expenditures is especially notable, there is evidence that something less dramatic, but still noteworthy, has been underway for even longer -- a slowing of the growth of Medicare costs. That is, Medicare expenditures have recently been rising, but at a slower rate than in the past. This isn’t as favorable for getting the federal budget into balance as an absolute decline would be, but it’s still an important step in that direction. This trend is documented in an August 2013 CBO working paper, written by a pair of present or former CBO health care analysts, Michael Levine and Melinda Buntin. They concluded that the growth in spending per beneficiary in Medicare’s fee-for-service program "has slowed substantially in recent years," specifically from 2000 to 2010. The authors said the slowdown "has been widespread, extending across all of the major service categories, groups of beneficiaries that receive very different amounts of medical care, and all major regions." That said, the authors noted that their understanding of why this expenditure slowdown occurred "remains incomplete." And that is a problem that limits the usefulness of the data points Orszag offered on CNN. For starters, past performance does not equal future performance, noted Joseph Antos, a health care specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The pattern Orszag cites "does not mean a slower trend will last," Antos said. And while Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said she sees the recent data as a positive development, she added wistfully, "If only anyone knew why and whether it will last." Orszag doesn’t dispute their words of caution. "I agree it's unclear how long it will last, but I am more hopeful than some others," he said, arguing that the decline in expenditures is "consistent with major structural changes in the sector that I see happening every day. ... The bottom line is that it's not guaranteed to continue, but it's a huge deal if it does." Our ruling Orszag said, "Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year." He’s right about the nominal decline in total Medicare expenditures over the past year, and he’s right that per-beneficiary spending declined broadly between 2000 and 2010. Determining the reasons why it’s happening remains a work in progress, but that doesn’t detract from the statement’s factual accuracy. We rate it True.

pomt-09136	Georgia could get money for schools by scraping “the gold off the gold dome” of the state Capitol.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/15/roy-barnes/barnes-suggests-mining-state-capitol-education-gol/	Okay, okay. We here at PolitiFact Georgia know that politicians are occasionally given to hyperbole. From time to time the political class seems driven to test the bounds of rhetorical gravity. And we feel inclined to test what they say. Take former Gov. Roy Barnes, a skilled orator and shrewd trial lawyer who to can turn on the aw-shucks routine with the best of them. Earlier this year, Barnes spoke in Summerville as part of the Chattooga County Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting. And man-oh-man did he ever come up with the money quote as noted in the Chattanooga Times Free Press, which reported it in a news story about his speech. "If we have to scrape the gold off the gold dome, you make sure that education comes first," Mr. Barnes told the group, according to the news article. He made the same claim in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an opinion piece he penned in 2008. “If we have to scrape the gold off the Capitol dome to do it, so be it. It's worth it, and we owe it to our children,’ Barnes wrote. The state’s schools are in tough shape due to the grinding recession that has withered property values and diminished state and local coffers. The schools now need billions to avoid furloughs, layoffs and school closings. Chris Carpenter, Barnes’ campaign manager, said Barnes made the statement to show how important he considers education. The former governor has also mentioned closing the Governor’s Mansion and the state Capitol – the same one he wants to relieve of its gold top – to raise money for state schools. “He just thinks public education is the No 1 priority,” Carpenter said. “Obviously there is some rhetorical flourish there.” Flourish, smourish. We wanted to know how much the state could get if it the gold leaf was actually scraped off the venerable old dome and sold. Not a lot, as it turns out, despite the fact that gold has recently surged past $1,200 an ounce. Gold first graced the dome after a late 1950s Capitol renovation in which the old tin-covered dome as was done up in 43 ounces of the glittering stuff. It was milled to 1/5000th of an inch thick before being affixed to the roof. The gold originally traveled to Atlanta from Dahlonega, site of the nation’s first gold rush, in a caravan of seven mule-drawn covered wagons, which took three days to reach Atlanta. The gold was expected to last thirty or forty years but by the late 1970s it had deteriorated to the point that the dome to be re-gilded, a project completed in 1981. Mike Kramer, owner and president of The Gilder’s Studio, runs the Maryland-based company that re-gilded the dome again in 1998. Workers first scraped off what was left of the old gold. “We had people that parked at the Capitol complaining because we were getting gold scrapings on their cars,” Kramer said in a telephone interview. Kramer reckons his company used about 85 ounces of gold gilding material. He said the new dome should be good for another 20 or even 30 years – as long as politicians don’t start scraping on it. As for Barnes’ idea about cashing in on the shiny Capitol covering, Kramer was, well, less than enthusiastic. “You’d have to dry scrape it off, and I’d probably charge a hundred-grand for that,” he said. “Then you have to contain it. Then you have to refine because it’s attached to the zinc-chromate primer.” Kramer figured that only about 60 ounces of the original gold could be salvaged. A refiner would charge you 20 percent or so to extract it once it was scraped off, he said. So at $1,200 an ounce, you get about $72,000 for 60 ounces. Subtract the refiner’s fee and you’re down to $57,600. By the time you pay Kramer his $100,000 for scraping the orb in the first place, you are actually in the hole by more than $40,000. “You’re not going to make any money,” Kramer said. In fact you would lose money, and end up with a naked Capitol dome. And nobody wants that. We give the former governor a Pants On Fire for this one.

pomt-13852	Harris County, Texas has "some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jul/08/rodney-ellis/sen-rodney-ellis-says-harris-county-has-some-highe/	Editor’s note, July 8, 2016: We originally published this fact check on June 13 and rated the statement False. After that, experts pointed out we left out a step in our calculation of Harris County’s incarceration rate. We have updated our story and the rating has changed. You may read an archived version of the original article here. Equal Justice Under Law, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, filed a lawsuit against Harris County’s bail system alleging that hundreds of offenders are jailed for minor offenses every day because they cannot afford to make bail. The group says that since 2015, it has filed 10 class action challenges to money bail systems in eight states. The May 2016 suit led state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, to issue a press release on May 19, 2016, sharing his support of the legal action, saying, "Harris County’s overreliance on the inefficient and ineffective use of mass incarceration as a means of dealing with low-level and nonviolent offenses continues to result in some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world." We’re familiar with incarceration rates. In August 2015, PolitiFact Virginia found Mostly True a claim the U.S. has the world’s highest incarceration rate -- meaning the greatest share of the population behind bars. In March 2016, we rated Mostly True a claim that Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran. So, does Harris County, the third most populous in the nation, also have one of the highest incarceration rates in the country and world? The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics defines an incarceration rate as the number of inmates per 100,000 residents held in state or federal prisons or local jails. To our request for the senator’s factual backup, Ellis aide David Edmonson emailed a spreadsheet listing incarceration rates for the five most populous counties in the state, based on data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Harris County had a rate of 234 inmates per 100,000, while the four less-populous counties had rates between 152 and 233 people per 100,000. Edmonson also included a link to a Washington Post fact-check stating the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and a link to the website of The Sentencing Project listing Texas as having the seventh highest incarceration rate in the country. Harris County, he said, has the highest prison and state jail rate of the five largest counties in the state, as determined by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. "In other words," Edmonson wrote, "Harris County sends the most people to prison and state jail -- in the state with the seventh-highest incarceration -- in the country with the highest incarceration rate." Checking with TDCJ With Edmonson’s reply in our pocket, we looked to verify figures on our own. First, we checked with TDCJ to see how Harris County’s incarceration rate compares nationally and with other counties in Texas, focusing on the agency’s 2014 annual statistical report tallying newly incarcerated people (receives) and each facility’s on-hand population, which provides a closer look at the incarcerated population on Aug. 31, 2014, all by county of conviction. The data reflect populations in state prisons, state jails and substance abuse felony punishment facilities. By phone, we asked Jason Clark, the director of TDCJ, what the different charts represented in the agency’s report, and which would be most accurate for reflecting each county’s incarcerated population in state facilities. Clark described the on-hand population as the best overall measure, as "new receives," only show the newly admitted population. He added one caveat — the counties listed show where a person was convicted, not necessarily where that person lived before or where that person is being detained. So, according to TDCJ, Harris County’s incarceration rate in state facilities in 2014, the most recent year published, was 599 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 26,647 inmates. By rate alone, that ranked Harris County 134th out of Texas’ 254 counties. However, there are many other prisoners held in local jailhouses. So we turned to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, which regulates county jails and municipal lockups. The commission’s monthly incarceration rate report reflects the average daily population of county jail inmates, based on a 12-month average of one-day snapshots, taken the first day of each month. According to the commission’s September 2014 report, Harris County in 2014 had a rate of 196.6 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 8,731 inmates in county and municipal lockups. Looking strictly at incarceration rates, regardless of the relative population of different counties, Harris County placed 169th in the state. By adding figures from both sources of data, we get a fuller picture of the number of people behind bars in Harris County, regardless of whether they are in a county jail or state prison. That gives Harris County a 2014 incarceration rate of 796 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 35,378 people who were in county jail, state jail, prison or substance abuse facilities. If we include federal prison inmates, the overall rate increases to 816 per 100,000 residents, or 36,234 people. U.S., world incarceration rates For the same year, the total United States’ incarceration rate was 716 per 100,000, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that advocates against what it calls mass criminalization policies. Worldwide, the Institute for Criminal Policy Research, a London-based nonprofit that conducts research on crime and criminal justice issues, calculated an incarceration rate of 144 per 100,000, based on United Nations data. That is, Harris County had a total incarceration rate exceeding both the world and U.S. rates. There are some Texas-centric wrinkles, however. Out of the five most populous Texas counties, Harris County’s rate came in second place for 2014. Dallas County had an overall incarceration rate of 913 inmates per 100,000, or 23,006 inmates. And far less populous counties had even higher rates. Notably, Kenedy County in South Texas ranked first in the state with an overall rate of 5,000 people per 100,000 residents, though the county accounted for a grand total of 20 inmates. At the time, Kenedy County was home to 400 residents; Harris County’s population was 4.4 million. Experts comment For guidance, we checked with two independent criminal justice experts. Peter Wagner directs the Prison Policy Initiative, which studies incarceration rates closely and often is called upon to explain such figures. Michele Dietch, a senior lecturer in the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, has worked on criminal justice issues since the late 1980s. Wagner said the initiative’s global report, which folds in U.S. states with other countries to make state-to-country incarceration rate comparisons, leaves out countries with populations of less than 500,000. Smaller countries could prove distracting in discussing how the United States differs from its peers, he said. According to the report, Texas had a 2014 incarceration rate of 1,063 per 100,000, which was the fifth highest in the world. Louisiana ranked No. 1 internationally; its rate was 1,341 inmates per 100,000 residents. Louisiana’s population of 4.6 million, according to 2015 Census figures, is comparable to Harris County’s population of 4.5 million for the same time period. The report includes federal prison populations in state incarceration rate calculations, since "state politics certainly influence whether and where federal prisons are built." Mississippi, Oklahoma and Georgia also topped Texas, with rates ranging from 1,074 to 1,155 inmates per 100,000 residents. Among countries, the U.S. had the highest rate, 716 prisoners per 100,000 residents. Since we began our research, the PPI came out with a new 2016 global incarceration rate report. While rates have changed (Texas went from a rate of 1,063 inmates per 100,000 to 890), rankings have more or less remained the same. Texas ranks eighth in the world, Louisiana is now second after Washington, D.C. and the United States is still the first country to appear on the list with a rate of 693 per 100,000. Dietch told us by phone that she sees value in both per capita rates and raw counts. Per capita rates, she said, are the best way to make comparisons because they adjust for what can be vast differences in population. "Per capita rates equalize comparisons across jurisdictions of different sizes," she wrote in a follow-up email. "Otherwise, big jurisdictions will always look worse in terms of absolute numbers." But, she said, there’s value in looking at absolute numbers, since jurisdictions contributing the largest numbers of inmates will have "by far the biggest impact on the system." That is, rural Kenedy County may have the state’s highest incarceration rate and may be sending a higher share of its residents into the criminal justice system, Dietch said, yet its share of all state prisoners remains negligible. "Those absolute numbers — not the rates — are one of the key drivers of the size of the incarcerated population," she said via email. "And none of this even begins to take into account issues such as the length of sentences, another key driver of incarceration trends in Texas." "You need to look at both to understand," she said. She explained one of the main reasons a smaller county may have a higher incarceration rate lies in the lack of local sentencing alternatives including support programs, substance abuse treatment or electronic monitoring. People end up in prison or jail, Dietch said, because there isn’t much else as an alternative. In contrast, she said, urban communities like Harris County have more options to keep people out of jail and prison, she said. Our ruling Ellis said Harris County has some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world. Harris County's rate -- calculated as the number of inmates per 100,000 residents -- exceeds the rates for the United States and world though we found jurisdictions including Dallas County with higher rates. To be fair, though, Ellis didn’t say Harris County’s rate is the highest, only that it’s among the highest. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14206	Says professional football coach Rex Ryan "won championships in New York. The AFC, I think, twice."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-praises-rex-ryans-imaginary-afc-champ/	Sometimes politicians make our jobs too easy. This is one of those times. At a rally in New York ahead of that state’s primary, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was introduced by Buffalo Bills football coach Rex Ryan. "There's so many things I admire about Mr. Trump, but one thing I really admire about him is, you know what, he'll say what's on his mind," Ryan told the crowd. "But so many times, you'll see people, a lot of people want to say the same thing. But there's a big difference. They don't have the courage to say it. They all think it, but they don't have the courage to say it." When it was Trump’s turn to talk, he repaid Ryan with a compliment. "You know, he won championships in New York," Trump said. "The AFC, I think, twice." Ryan has coached seven years in New York, six with the New York Jets (who technically play their games in New Jersey) and one with the Bills. He has a career coaching record of 58 wins and 61 losses. And, he has never won the AFC championship -- the winner of which goes on to the Super Bowl. Ryan’s teams lost in the AFC championship game both in 2009-10 (Indianapolis Colts 30, Jets 17) and in 2010-11 (Pittsburgh Steelers 24, Jets 19). Just to round this out, Ryan hasn’t won a division championship in New York, nor did he ever play on a New York team that won a championship. This claim rates False. Correction: The Colts made up an 11-point deficit to beat the Jets in the 2009-10 AFC Championship. We apologize for listing the wrong team in an earlier version of this fact-check, and for rubbing salt in the wounds of Jets fans. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3545a6ac-cb46-461f-a52e-3723ab604886	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-04-20T13:18:34	2016-04-18	['New_York_City', 'Rex_Ryan']

pomt-13670	Says Milwaukee County district attorney candidate Verona Swanigan "has worked as a prosecutor."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/04/milwaukeeans-self-governance/candidate-district-attorney-doesnt-say-she-worked-/	A third-party radio ad supporting Verona Swanigan, a lawyer who is trying to unseat 10-year Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, claims Swanigan "has worked as a prosecutor." That would be a key credential, given that Swanigan is trying to become the county’s top prosecutor by winning the two-way Democratic primary on Aug. 9, 2016. No Republican is running. But although she worked with prosecutors in the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office in California, even Swanigan doesn’t say she worked as a prosecutor. Neither does the office. What the ad says The ad is sponsored by Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance, which the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has described as a secretive group led by longtime conservative political operative Craig Peterson. In the April 2016 City of Milwaukee elections, the group ran attack ads against Mayor Tom Barrett, who easily won re-election, and backed the opponents of at least two Milwaukee aldermen, both of whom were re-elected. Swanigan’s latest campaign finance report, filed in July 2016, says Peterson printed $476 worth of campaign brochures for her. Her previous report says Peterson contributed $250 to her campaign and provided $1,681 in printing and food and beverages for a Swanigan fundraiser. The ad makes several attacks on Chisholm before making the claim we’re checking. It was included in this section: "Verona Swanigan is licensed to practice law in five states, holds a master’s degree in forensic psychology, has worked as a prosecutor, and a probation and parole officer, and she is the daughter of a 32-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department. She has never lost a trial. The current DA has never even taken a bar exam." (The Journal Sentinel reported that in the only Wisconsin felony case Swanigan ever tried, a jury found her client not guilty of sexual assault of a child. As for the allusion to Chisholm, graduates of the University of Wisconsin Law School and Marquette University Law School do not have to take the bar exam to practice law in Wisconsin. Chisholm is a UW law graduate.) As for the claim we’re checking, Peterson told us that while employed by the Fresno DA, Swanigan "filed cases, extradition motions and documentation," and made court appearances, which sounds like some of the things prosecutors do. What they say Fresno County Assistant District Attorney Steve Wright told us Swanigan was classified as a legal assistant/paralegal when she worked in the office from March to December 2006. He said he did not know her job duties, but that she was not a sworn prosecutor. Swanigan had earned her law degree from Northern Illinois University in 2005, but hadn’t yet passed the California bar exam when she was hired in Fresno. She said that under the program she worked in, she filed criminal complaints, although they were done in the name of a sworn prosecutor; and made court appearances on her own, though under the supervision of a prosecutor. Unlike Peterson, Swanigan said she would not call herself a former prosecutor. "I personally would not describe it that way," Swanigan told us, referring to the ad. "He could make a legal argument for it to be described that way, but I would not." Indeed, the biographical section of Swanigan’s campaign website says she worked at the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office, but no position is listed. Our rating Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance says in a radio ad that Swanigan "has worked as a prosecutor." Swanigan made court appearances and assisted prosecutors in other ways when she worked in the the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office in California. But she was classified as a paralegal, not a sworn prosecutor, and does not describe herself as a former prosecutor. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07039	"Since I took office, we’ve created 76,800 jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-touts-better-job-numbers-sign-succe/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who campaigned on a promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years, routinely touts the state's progress. A classic Scott-ism: "This is a contest to make our state the No. 1 place to do business, and that's what I'm going to do." So on June 17, 2011, the day Florida released its jobs numbers for May, Scott released this statement: "Florida is leading the nation in job creation and our unemployment rate has dropped for the fifth straight month, a huge win for Floridians. It is unfortunate the federal government can’t say the same thing for the rest of the country. "Our efforts to make Florida the most business friendly state are clearly paying off and we are bucking the national trend. "Since I took office, we’ve created 76,800 jobs for parents, recent graduates, workforce veterans and all Floridians who have been struggling to get back on their feet. "Texas is still leading the country in job growth this year, but Florida is trailing right behind at number two. We are gunning to be the number one state for job growth and I will not rest until Florida surpasses Texas for the top spot." Whether Florida led the nation in job creation in May is the subject of a separate fact-check. Here, we'll take a look at another of Scott's claims, that since he took office Jan. 4, "we've created 76,800 jobs." (Scott repeated the claim on July 1 during a speech to the Florida Society of News Editors.) We checked in with Scott's press secretary, Lane Wright, and Florida's Agency for Workforce Innovation, which among other things prepares labor statistics for the state. The 76,800 job figure quickly checked out. Scott used a mainstream estimate from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics: "total nonfarm employment" that had been "seasonally adjusted." Farms are commonly excluded because that workforce swings so dramatically. And it's helpful to look at estimates that have been "seasonally adjusted" because formulas make up for differences between months such as the number of weeks, holidays and seasonal employment patterns. Now, in our fact-check of the May numbers, we point out that some economists caution about relying too heavily on seasonally adjusted numbers right now. The jobs world has been so turbulent, it's very difficult to adjust for "normal" seasonal swings. So they also take a look at estimates that haven't been seasonally adjusted — the ones based directly on a survey of about 140,000 U.S. employers each month. Remember that these estimates don't account for things like number of weeks or holidays in a particular month — or seasonal shifts such Florida's tourist season — and so aren't considered a good way to compare change between months or over time. But in pursuit of a fuller picture, we checked the non-seasonally adjusted numbers, as well, and found they work in Scott's favor: Instead of showing 76,800 more jobs than when he took office in January, it showed 119,700 more jobs. So not only does Scott accurately cite federal statistics, looking at the numbers a second way still supports his underlying message -- Florida is creating jobs. But we're not done. At PolitiFact, we look at statistical claims like this one in two parts: 1.) Have jobs increased by 76,800 under Gov. Rick Scott? (By one official measure, they have.) 2.) Is Scott responsible? As University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith put it, "The numbers are easily verifiable. ... What I guess is implied is who's responsible for the creation of those jobs." Scott also invited this question when he added, "Our efforts to make Florida the most business friendly state are clearly paying off." We wondered: Already? As you might have guessed, this is where things get trickier. (And there's some fun journalism out there about whether politicians can really take credit.) First, Scott has only just started to implement his agenda. Should he get credit for jobs in January? In February? A small decrease to the corporate income tax passed this legislative session, for example — less than 1/10th of what Scott sought — but has yet to add any money to employers' bottom line. Second, it's too soon to identify a trend. "It is far too early to tell whether Gov. Scott's policies are having any effect on jobs in Florida," said David Denslow, an economist at University of Florida. He pointed out that recent history shows huge swoops in job creation — way, way up since 1990, with some leveling off in the early 2000s, then another climb, then the familiar sickening dive marking the Great Recession. The few jobs added since January 2011 barely register as a change on that roller coaster ride. So it's impossible to see yet whether there's a positive trend since then, he said. Third, Florida was projected to start adding jobs no matter who took office. In the 2011-12 fiscal year, for example, state economists have estimated we'll add 130,500 jobs, then 175,000 the year after, with diminishing but hefty additions as years pass. (In other words, if the governor who campaigned on a promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years takes credit for every job created, he'll meet the goal easily. But if they would have happened without him, can you give him credit for creating them? We'll weigh this issue as we decide how to measure his promise on our Scott-O-Meter.) "There's one thing you can't criticize about Gov. Scott, and that's his sense of timing," Snaith said. "He's coming into office at the perfect time on a platform of job creation. You couldn't time it better." Now, Scott does get some credit from economists for marketing the state for business, something he's done ever since he was elected in November 2010. Snaith of the University of Central Florida and Mark Vitner, an economist with Wells Fargo, noted that he's worked to get the word out that his policies will be pro-business. And taking a hard line on the state budget showed he'll act on his platform, Vitner said. "He's pretty much stuck to his word since he's been in office," Vitner said. "I think that gives businesses some confidence that they've got a partner." So where does that leave us? Scott got the number right, sticking to mainstream federal statistics. But he jumped the gun and overreached in claiming credit for those jobs. That's a pretty important clarification, and knocks him down a peg. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-01869	"We cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/10/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-cut-property-taxes-seniors-a/	After months of campaign ads from Gov. Rick Scott, Charlie Crist began rolling out his own commercials in this year’s gubernatorial race. In the first, entitled "Sunshine," Crist hearkened back to his single term as governor, from 2007 to 2011. "We saved the jobs of 20,000 teachers," he said. "We cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class." We’ve dealt with Crist’s track record with teachers' jobs before, but what about his history on property taxes? PolitiFact Florida decided to send you a notice a few months before your bill is due in November. Break for seniors Crist’s campaign pointed us to two events that happened during his term to prove its point. One was the 2007 legislation HB 333, a bill the Legislature passed that increased the homestead exemption for low-income seniors. It was the law that implemented Amendment 6, which voters had approved in 2006. HB 333 increased the maximum homestead exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 for seniors whose income was less than $23,414, if local governments allowed it. Crist signed the bill during his first legislative session in April 2007. While running for governor, he had broadly campaigned on lowering the property tax burden on senior citizens, saying the state’s booming economy would make up the difference. The exemption applied to cities and counties, not to school districts or special districts. By the time Crist approved the law, 53 counties and 158 cities had already approved an increased exemption, but the law allowed them to increase it up to $50,000 for 2007. Break for middle class The second item was the 2008 passage of Amendment 1, a constitutional change aimed at giving longtime Florida residents a break on ever-escalating property taxes. We should note that Crist says the break was for "our middle class," but doesn’t define the term. Most homeowners saw some benefit, no matter what their income level. The amendment increased the homestead exemption, saving homeowners an average of $240 on property taxes annually. It also allowed homeowners to transfer their tax benefits to a new residence (including benefits from the 1992 Save Our Homes tax provisions). The amendment further created a new $25,000 exemption for some business properties and limited assessment increases for non-homesteaded properties to 10 percent annually. Crist was a very vocal supporter of the measure, campaigning on the plan during the 2006 election. He frequently said taxes would "drop like a rock" under Amendment 1. Opposition came from newer residents who wouldn’t enjoy the benefits in the same way as long-term owners. Florida TaxWatch said it was potentially unconstitutional, and even state Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink worried about state fire-fighting agencies, among other departments, losing funding. Despite this opposition, the amendment passed on Jan. 29, 2008, with 64 percent of the vote. The 2008 Legislature fully implemented it with SB 1588, which Crist signed on June 17. We should note critics had reason to be wary of the change, especially because of the timing. The amendment made beneficiaries happy but wreaked havoc on state tax revenues, combined with the Great Recession’s crashing real estate market, which wiped out billions in taxable home values. Drastic budget cuts resulted in reduced services statewide. The bill was originally projected to save homeowners $1.3 billion the first year, but it’s unlikely the tax benefits amounted to that much because of property values declining in 2008 and later years. Experts told us an analysis to find out how much less would have to go parcel by parcel, taking into account taxable values and changes in local millage rates. The Republican Party of Florida has been saying that Crist actually raised taxes on the middle class $2.2 billion while in office. That actually came a year later, when he and the Republican-led Legislature raised taxes and fees, like $1 a pack tax on cigarettes, to close a budget hole in 2009. Other fees were increased on auto tags and fishing licenses. Were the property tax cuts outweighed by the later tax increases of 2009? It’s nearly impossible to quantify the impact on an average taxpayer, because it would depend on if an individual owned property, smoked cigarettes, owned a car or fished. Our ruling Crist said, "we cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class." Crist supported increased homestead exemptions for seniors, although only those considered low income. He also supported tax cuts for property owning residents, but not just an undefined middle class. Voters decided on both issues with constitutional amendments, and the state Legislature did its part by passing bills that Crist signed. Crist’s claim doesn’t specify the nuances, but property tax cuts for groups falling under those umbrellas did happen during his term. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11319	New York has "among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation"	true	/new-york/statements/2018/apr/12/marcus-molinaro/do-ny-residents-have-among-highest-tax-burdens-mol/	A Republican who wants to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this year says New York state residents face one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Dutchess County Executive Marcus Molinaro said Cuomo hasn’t done enough to lower taxes during his first two terms as governor. "I can imagine he wants to talk about anything but his last seven years in office and certainly the fact that we have among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation," Molinaro said to reporters in Albany. Molinaro wants to cut property taxes by reducing state mandated spending for counties, like Medicaid. The state would absorb that spending without raising taxes by cutting costs elsewhere. Cuomo has limited rising property taxes by capping how much local governments can raise them. PolitiFact New York rated as Mostly True the governor's claim that he's cut income taxes to the lowest rates in 70 years for middle-class New York state earners. So where New York state ranks in the nation for tax burden could change in coming years. But is Molinaro right? Do New York state residents still have among the highest tax burdens in the country now? Tax burden data To support the claim, a Molinaro spokesperson pointed to a New York Post article that relied on data and analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation. The group found the state's residents spent, on average, 12.7 percent of their income on state and local taxes, "the highest burden in the nation." But there's a caveat: The data's from 2012. More recent analysis from the Tax Foundation shows New York state ranked second in the nation for the amount of all state and local taxes collected per capita -- $8,722 -- in 2016. That includes property, income, sales and corporate taxes among others. Only North Dakota had a higher amount. For state and local income taxes alone, New York state ranked highest in the nation for the amount collected per capita -- $2,789 -- in 2015, according to the latest data from the Tax Foundation. For property taxes, New York state ranked fourth in the nation for the amount collected per capita -- $2,697 -- in 2015. The state has some of the highest local property taxes in the country. "Looking at all of the available metrics, some of this is of course driven by New York being a relatively high-income state," said John Buhl, a spokesperson for the Tax Foundation. "Nevertheless, by most measures, New York is one of the highest taxed states in the country." Other things to consider Per capita rates look at the total amount of tax revenue collected in a state divided by that state’s population. That doesn’t consider the number of wealthy earners and high-value homes in New York state, which inflate the revenue collected by state and local governments. New York state has the third-highest number of millionaires in the country, and those earners are taxed at a higher rate than in most states. The state also has the second-highest number of homes worth more than $2 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. New York state ranks 14th in property taxes as a share of the state’s average home value. New York state "does have a lot of very wealthy people, companies and buildings," said Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research organization. "All that wealth contributes to New York’s high tax revenue, even before we discuss tax rates and the tax liability of residents." Auxier co-authored a report that showed New York state relied more on property and income tax revenue than an average state in 2012. New York state relied on property taxes more than most states in particular. But the state also provides generous tax credits to low- and middle-income families. Our ruling Molinaro said New York state has "among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation." The Tax Foundation analysis shows New York state ranks among the highest for per capita collections of income and property taxes. Since Cuomo took office in January 2011, New York state has cut income tax rates and capped property tax increases. The changes could affect future rankings. But Molinaro’s claim is accurate. The tax burden for the state's residents remains among the highest in the nation. We rate it True.

pomt-08602	Children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/23/citizens-republic/mourning-america-ad-echoing-reagan-classic-gets-it/	On Sept. 21, 2010, a group called Citizens for the Republic unveiled a television ad called "Mourning in America," that mirrored, right down to its understated visuals and narration, a famous Ronald Reagan ad from his 1984 re-election campaign titled "Morning in America." Whereas the original ad exuded confidence and pride in the United States under Reagan's leadership, the new version -- aired by a group run by veterans of the Reagan administration -- presented a bleak look at the current state of the economy and a tone of sadness about the country's seemingly diminished prospects. "There's mourning in America," the ad begins. "Today, 15 million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work. Businesses shuttered. Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall. This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married, each of their children to be born with a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt." We won't judge whether these statistics support the idea that the country is "fading," that President Barack Obama's policy has "failed" or the ad's exhortation to vote for a "smaller, more caring government." But we will look at each of the statistics mentioned in the ad. (The ad was put together by Fred Davis, a leading Republican ad-man. We discuss some of the ads he made this year in a story posted today.) • "Fifteen million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work." According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, there were 14.9 million unemployed Americans in August. Close enough for us. • "Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall." According to RealtyTrac, the leading authority on foreclosure statistics, "lenders foreclosed on 95,364 U.S. properties in August (2010), the highest monthly total in the history of the report." If you divide that total by 31 days, you get 3,076 foreclosures per day. That's actually a little more than the ad indicates. • "This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married." This statistic was presumably included so the current ad would mirror the script of the one from 1984, which cited the then-rate of 6,500 marriages per day as evidence that couples were heading optimistically into the future. Since then, marriage rates have dropped, though it's not clear how much of this is due to economic conditions, as opposed to broader social and demographic trends. The most recent figures from the National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency, show that there were 2,077,000 marriages in 2009. Dividing this total by 365 days, you get 5,690 marriages per day. That's a little lower than what the ad says -- by about 5 percent. Also, those who are really picky may quibble that the number of marriages completed on weekdays is a lot lower than 6,000, and it's a lot higher on weekend days. Still, the ad is pretty close. • Each child born will have "a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt." At first, we were confused by this statistic because our reading of the ad's wording suggested that it should involve how many children were going to be born to couples who got married this year. But it turns out this statistic is much simpler than that. The ad writers divided the total estimate for the public debt at the end of 2010 ($9,297,653,000,000) by the total U.S. population (307,006,550) and came out with $30,286 for every man, woman and child. In a recent item, we discussed the relative merits of two different measures for the national debt. One is debt held by the public (which the makers of "Mourning in America" used, and the other is that amount plus debt held by the government, typically in trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. When we asked economists for their opinion of which measurement is more relevant, each of the two statistics had its fans, so we concluded that both are legitimate measurements. For completeness, we'll note here that using the larger figure, called gross federal debt, the per-person debt load would be just shy of $45,000, which would only make the ad's argument stronger. Put it all together and you have four statistics that are all very, very close to being accurate. So we rate the facts in the ad True.

pomt-08867	Jeff Greene on why he went Cuba.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/aug/04/jeff-greene/jeff-greenes-cuba-trip-business-or-pleasure/	Jeff Greene says one of his political idols was the first U.S. senator he remembers while growing up in Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. Well, like Kennedy, Greene's got a Cuba problem. The billionaire candidate running as a Democrat for U.S. Senate got into trouble on Aug. 1, 2010, when he was forced to answer questions about why his 145-foot-yacht Summerwind docked in a Havana marina in 2007. Knowing that Cuba travel is a delicate issue in South Florida Cuban American communities, we decided to review Greene's statements on the matter. Our tool for this analysis is the Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent a candidate has been. Aug. 1, 2010, debate In a televised debate with Bay News 9 in Tampa Bay and CFN 13 in Orlando taped on Aug. 1 and aired the next night, Greene said he stood firmly in support of the U.S. embargo of Cuba. The statement gave opponent U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek an opportunity to bring up a recent St. Petersburg Times story that said Greene went on his yacht to Cuba, and that crew members recalled extensive partying. Greene said he wasn't there. (Watch the entire exchange here). "I don't know if I need to slide my chair over, because a bolt of lightning may come in and hit Jeff,'' Meek said. "You're saying you weren't on your yacht, when it went to Cuba and eyewitnesses said you were on the yacht?" "No," Greene responded. "I went to Cuba years ago on a Jewish mission to Cuba, yes, for the Jewish community." "Were you on the yacht when it was reported …" Meek pressed. "No, not that time … I was not on the yacht on the trip you're talking about. I was on the yacht on another time when I had a visa to go there and visit the Jewish community," Greene stammered as Meek cross-examined him. To recap the exchange, Greene said that he wasn't on the boat during the trip mentioned in the story (the 2007 "party" trip) but that he did visit Cuba another time, had a visa and did humanitarian work in the Jewish community. We'll call that version No. 1. Hours later Immediately after the debate, Greene acknowledged he may have gone to Cuba in 2007. Greene said the Jewish Federation had obtained a visa for him to visit Cuba, the St. Petersburg Times reported, and that he and other members of the federation visited a synagogue. No partying though. "Who would you party with?" he quipped. Recapping Greene's revised recollection, the 2007 trip that Greene said he wasn't on, he now says he may have been on. But there was no partying, and Greene was there on a humanitarian mission to visit the country's Jewish synagogues. Let's call that version No. 2. Later in the week On Aug. 3, as more questions kept coming about the Cuba trip, the partying -- a deck hand reported the boat being "caked" in vomit from all the partying -- and Greene's humanitarian mission, spokesman Luis Vizcaino clarified that Greene's yacht stopped at a Havana marina in 2007 not for a party, and not for a humanitarian mission, but because the Summerwind was in need of repairs. "During the debate Jeff misspoke," Vizcaino said. "What he meant to say was that in 2007, he went on the boat from Honduras to the Bahamas, and en route the boat had a hydraulic problem. … The captain said we could wait for the part at Hemingway Marina." While docked in Havana, Greene went to visit a synagogue because he had heard about a Jewish humanitarian mission. "He didn't meet up with them," Vizcaino said. "He wanted to observe. … What he came away with was firsthand knowledge of the plight of the country." Vizcaino, when asked about the Jewish Federation visa, said of Greene, "again, he misspoke." The Greene campaign produced a letter from the Summerwind's chief engineer corroborating the campaign's latest thoughts -- the boat malfunctioned on the way to the Bahamas, went to see a Cuban synagogue while we waited -- which we're calling version No. 3. Another crew member disputes that version of events in comments to the St. Petersburg Times. We should also note that the Greene press release on Aug. 4 attempting to clarify the trip said that "Jeff and his then-fiancee, now wife, were en route to Honduras," which means headed to Honduras, which is the opposite of what Greene, Vizcaino and the chief engineer say happened. That's at least three significantly different versions of one story, crafted in three days. First Greene wasn't on the trip, then he said he was -- but that it was a humanitarian trip. Then the trip was a detour because of hydraulic issues. Our definition of a Full Flop is "A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop." In this case, that sounds just right. We rate Greene's statements on whether and why he went to Cuba a Full Flop.	None	Jeff Greene	None	None	None	2010-08-04T18:02:35	2010-08-03	['Cuba']

pomt-08690	Says Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mark-neumann-nancy-pelosi/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker’s new statewide TV ad hits the trifecta, touching on three hot-buttons issues in this election cycle: transportation spending, earmarks and ties to a Democratic Party whose popularity has sagged. In a direct-mail piece, radio ad and TV spot, Walker mocks GOP rival Mark Neumann’s claim that he is a true conservative and Washington outsider crusading against wasteful spending. Following a national Republican strategy of tying Democratic candidates to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Walker aims to do the same with Republican Neumann, who served two terms in Congress in the 1990s. Is the Neumann-Pelosi comparison accurate? Let’s focus on the TV ad, which echoes the approach on the radio and in direct mail. It features a crude hand puppet figure of Neumann, his eyes shifting. It ticks off a series of complaints, all focused on a single 1998 vote on a controversial transportation spending bill: "Mark Neumann says he’s against big government spending," the ad begins. "But in 1998, Congressman Neumann voted for one of the largest transportation bills in history. A bill that contained $9 billion in pork barrel spending. Including funding for the infamous bridge to nowhere. And a highway in Canada. You know who else voted for that $9 billion in pork barrel spending? Nancy Pelosi." As a Pelosi puppet pops out from behind Neumann, the narrator says: "Take a closer look at Mark Neumann. Remind you of anyone?" (Note: On Sept. 8, the Walker campaign changed the ending of the ad to say Neumann's excuse for the vote was that lots of others voted for it, too. The ad retained the Pelosi image. A new direct mail piece continued to use the "remind you of anyone?" line.) With the Sept. 14 primary approaching, Walker is also running a second radio ad, making a similar link based on a different bill. The point of the ads is more sweeping than comparing individual votes. Walker is likening Neumann to Pelosi. So in this item, we'll be examining whether he is correct to equate them. Neumann did join Pelosi and 295 other House members in backing the transportation bill. There were 86 votes against it. The exact tally: 143 Republicans in favor, 56 against. On the Democratic side, 153 supported and 30 voted no. One independent voted aye, according to congressional records. The bill was described by the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post as the largest transportation legislation in history. Media accounts also scored the bill as one of the most pork-laden of all time, funding $9 billion in "special projects." Critics and defenders argued over the need for many of them. The most famous, of course, was the "bridge to nowhere"in Alaska -- a familiar topic to political watchers. A big majority of both parties voted for the bill. In the Wisconsin delegation, three Republicans supported it, and one was opposed. Among state Democrats, three supported it and two voted no (including Tom Barrett, now running for governor). Their reasons were all over the map, creating a list of strange bedfellows. For instance, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Menomonee Falls) opposed the bill. But then-House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) -- a prominent conservative -- supported it, along with Neumann. Armey is now a leader of the tea party movement. How wide-ranging was the bill? Scott Walker himself, then a member of the state Assembly, applauded a piece of it -- sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri (R-Fond du Lac) -- that lifted a requirement that $241 million in federal money be used on either a light rail system or freeway bus and car-pool lanes in the East-West Corridor between Milwaukee and Waukesha. Walker spoke up in the week after the bill passed, as the leader of a bipartisan group of six Milwaukee County lawmakers. The ad is correct in stating Neumann voted for the measure. Neumann said he liked a provision in the bill that assured the federal share of the gas tax wouldn’t be used for other purposes. The legislation included a "minimum guarantee," according to a U.S. House committee report, to make sure states received more funding. Now let’s look at the Neumann and Pelosi comparison. Walker’s campaign says the ad does not try to tag Pelosi and Neumann as kindred voters, except for on this particular vote. But that is the implication of the ad. And it’s a reach. Pelosi, House speaker since January 2007, was not in a leadership position at the time. In fact, Republicans controlled the chamber. On most important votes involving spending and taxes, Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, and Neumann, who represented southern Wisconsin, were polar opposites. During his four years in Congress from 1995 to 1998, Neumann earned an "A" grade from the National Taxpayers Union, a group that believes taxpayers are overburdened and pushes for reforms in the federal tax system. During those same years, Pelosi earned an "F." The group says an "A" indicates the legislator is "one of the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies." By contrast, an "F" means the lawmaker is a "big spender." We turned to the Washington Post’s database of votes to sample Neumann and Pelosi’s record in the 105th Congress, the one in which the 1998 vote occurred. Of the 17 pieces of legislation deemed most prominent, Neumann and Pelosi agreed on six. The bills included four appropriations measures, an IRS reform bill and the transportation bill. On the six, Congress was nearly unanimous in approving three. In all but one -- an appropriations bill -- Neumann voted with the GOP majority. All told, in the 105th Congress, Pelosi voted with her party 89.9 percent of the time, the Post data shows. Neumann voted with Republicans on 86.6 percent, the Post data shows. So, where does that leave us? Walker’s claims on Neumann’s support of the transportation bill are accurate. The vote involved a major spending bill that drew a lot of attention, and Neumann does not dispute he supported it. But the ad suggests something much larger, that Neumann and Pelosi are somehow ideologically matched. Based on the ratings from an outside group and the lawmakers’ voting record, the two rarely lined up. Indeed, by the standard of linking them on a single vote, Neumann could as easily have been paired with Armey as Pelosi. Using Walker’s logic, Walker could have linked himself to Pelosi. After all, he supported a provision in the bill at the time. Walker wouldn’t agree with that comparison. And we don’t agree with the Neumann-Pelosi one. We rate the connection False.

pomt-13804	"There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/jeff-sessions/senator-jeff-sessions-says-about-350000-people-suc/	U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., spoke about jobs, wages and immigrant workers on the first night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Sessions said that when more workers come into the United States than there are jobs available, job prospects and wages fall. And when it comes to illegal immigration, "there are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year," Sessions said in his speech. We wondered if that number was right. We reached out to Sessions’ office for data supporting his statement but did not hear back. We found a Dec. 22, 2015, border security report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security detailing apprehensions by fiscal year. The federal government’s fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. In fiscal year 2015, Border Patrol tallied 337,117 apprehensions nationwide, a decrease from 486,651 in fiscal year 2014 — and almost 80 percent below apprehension peaks in 2000, according to the federal report. "Illegal migration, as defined by total Border Patrol apprehensions, continues to reflect an overall decline compared to the peak in 2000," the report said. Other sources point to apprehension levels hovering around Sessions’ 350,000 estimates, though they also find such numbers to be in decline. A report issued in 2013 by the National Foundation for American Policy, a think tank focused on trade and immigration, analyzed U.S. Border Patrol data and found that in fiscal year 1999, Border Patrol had more than 1.5 million apprehensions along the Southwest border. That number dropped by fiscal year 2009, when border patrol counted 540,865 apprehensions, according to the think tank. It was even lower by fiscal year 2012, with 356,873 apprehensions, NFAP found. But Sessions said that 350,000 "succeed in crossing our border." The apprehension numbers represent people who did not succeed. At any rate, the falling apprehension statistics were part of NFAP study, which found that "the rise in immigrant deaths comes at a time when fewer people are attempting to enter illegally, as measured by the significant drop in apprehensions at the border over the past several years." Border apprehension data is what is frequently used as a measure of illegal entry, though it represents events, not individuals, the Department of Homeland Security notes. As a result, apprehension numbers during a specific period will be more than total number of unique individuals, because some immigrants may be apprehended more than once, the department points out. An analysis by Pew Research Center published in 2015 also shows that in recent years, more Mexican immigrants have gone back to Mexico from the United States than have actually come into the country. That means the number of immigrants illegally in the country is staying the same or getting smaller. Stephen R. Kelly, a visiting professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, considers Sessions' statistic too high, even though no one knows exactly how many people illegally enter the United States every year, he said. "Sen. Sessions' statistic is undoubtedly too high, and ignores the larger trend of sharply dropping illegal immigration to the U.S.," Kelly said via email. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, also says Session’s figure is probably too high, pointing to border patrol data that says apprehension figures are declining. "If the stock of illegals is constant and the percentage of them who are coming legally and overstaying is increasing, then the number coming across the border must have fallen," Nowrasteh said in an email. Our ruling Sessions said, "There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year." The most common way federal officials track illegal entry is border apprehensions. In fiscal year 2015, the border patrol had 337,117 apprehensions nationwide, a decline from previous fiscal year and a significant drop from peaks in 2000. But those numbers represent people who are unsuccessful in crossing the border. Sessions said the opposite. Also apprehension numbers do not necessarily represent number of people crossing borders, since they track events, not individuals, according to Department of Homeland Security. The number of immigrants illegally in the country is staying the same or getting smaller. We rate Sessions’ statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ddd2a9fe-4155-4e6e-b370-852b72e82819	None	Jeff Sessions	None	None	None	2016-07-19T00:10:50	2016-07-18	['None']
pomt-00218	Says Tony Evers will "raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/11/scott-walker/mixed-evidence-scott-walker-claim-rival-tony-evers/	When Scott Walker put out a TV ad reviving a skit from "The Electric Company," a 1970s children’s television show that co-starred Morgan Freeman, Mashable snarkily called it "one of the most bizarre campaign ads of 2018." The ad aims to win the Republican governor a third term in the Nov. 6, 2018 election. It features silhouettes of a woman and a man facing each other. They take turns claiming that Walker’s Democratic challenger, state schools superintendent Tony Evers, would raise taxes. But there is a more conventional ad -- where Walker makes a similar, but more specific claim on Evers and taxes -- that we want to fact check. In that spot, released Sept. 20, 2018, Walker begins by saying: "With all the attack ads, it’s easy to forget" things in Wisconsin he likes to highlight, such as low unemployment and high-performing schools. Then Walker himself attacks, saying: "Tony Evers? Well, he’ll raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon." Walker has made claims like that in three more TV ads. What’s more, similar claims are made in a TV ad from the Republican Governors Association/Right Direction Wisconsin PAC and in a TV ad from Americans for Prosperity. So, what evidence does Walker have to back his political future-telling? It’s a mix: Evers is at least opening the door to higher property taxes; he said he will raise income taxes in at least one way; and he might raise the gas tax, but he says not by $1 per gallon. But it’s also important to note that, while Evers has said he is open to tax increases, it’s not clear that he would raise all the taxes Walker says. And when it comes to property and income taxes, Evers has not expressed support for across-the-board increases. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Raise Property taxes? Maybe Evers wants to raise limits on how much local school districts can levy in property taxes — in other words, giving school districts the ability to increase property taxes. He argues that because he also proposes increasing state aid to schools, among other factors, that will offset — at least in the aggregate — the need for any property tax increase. On the property tax side: Current law allows no per-pupil increase in local property taxes. Evers’ 2019-’21 budget request for his Department of Public Instruction calls for allowing school districts to increase local property taxes by $200 per-pupil in the first year of the budget and by $204 the second year. On the state aid side: But Evers has also called for, as part of his budget proposal, increasing state payments to schools by $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, over two years. Evers has said he could increase the aid by making cuts elsewhere in the state budget. The upshot, according to the Department of Public Instruction, is school districts with higher property wealth could their see property taxes go up, while less-wealthy districts could see property taxes go down. But the department says there would be no net increase in property taxes collected. The department provided us figures indicating that increased state aid and other factors would offset any property taxes in total during the 2019-’21 budget period. A spokesman for the department told us Evers is committed after that, when revenue limits would rise with inflation, to continue to provide enough state aid to keep property taxes flat overall. In any case, lifting the revenue limits at least opens the door to property tax increases. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Raise income taxes? Yes, in at least one way Before he secured the Democratic nomination, Evers said he wants to eliminate the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit, saying it favors the rich. His campaign has since repeated that Evers wants to eliminate the credit. Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby, supports the credit, saying it leads to business investment and job creation. The credit, part of Walker’s first state budget in 2011, gradually reduced the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses to nearly nothing -- from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent. (In 2017, we rated Mostly True a claim that 11 people who each make over $30 million got a total of $22 million in credits from the tax credit.) It’s also worth noting that Evers has said he is considering increasing income taxes on the wealthy and cutting income taxes for others — but adds: "There’s no definite plans at this time." So, by eliminating one tax credit, Evers would be increasing income taxes on manufacturers and agricultural businesses; and he is open to raising income taxes on the wealthy, but lowering them on others. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Raise gas tax? Maybe, but not up to $1 per gallon On Aug. 15, 2018, the day after Evers won the primary election, Walker said Evers might be willing to quadruple the state’s 32.9 cents-per-gallon state gas tax because Evers hasn't said how much he would be willing to increase it. Later that morning, a reporter asked Evers about Waker’s comment and whether he would raise the gas tax by $1. Evers responded more generally by saying: "I would support looking at anything, whether it’s removing tax credits, whether it’s slimming down state government, whether it’s gas taxes. Everything is on the table." But by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. "The only thing I ever said about that," Evers declared, "is that every possible revenue source is on the table." Evers has not said how much of an increase in the gas tax he could back. Evers has also said, in speaking about road funding, that he would consider increasing the gas tax or implementing tolls. He said he "has no range" in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider. Evers also has said that while he is considering increasing the gas tax to pay for roads, a $1 increase was "ridiculous." So, saying Evers will raise gas taxes by up to $1 per gallon, when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount, goes too far. Our rating Walker says Evers will "raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon." Evers has pledged to eliminate a Walker-era manufacturing and agriculture tax credit. So, that will result in higher income taxes for those who have taken advantage of the credit. On property taxes, Evers acknowledges that his proposed budget for the state Department of Instruction could result in higher property taxes in some school districts and lower levies in others. By lifting revenue limits, however, Evers would be allowing school districts to increase property taxes. And while Evers has said he is open to raising the gas tax, he hasn’t said he would seek any particular increase and has flatly denied that it would be $1. Moreover, while Evers is open to raising taxes, it's not across-the-board, at least in the case of property and income taxes. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Walker a Half True.

pomt-02853	The deficit this year could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/18/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-compares-size-federal-deficit-baseball-sala/	Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., talked debt and deficit with Granite Staters at a town hall meeting last month, trying to put the enormous numbers into context for the average person. The deficit could buy a large Dunkin’ Donuts coffee for every American every day for the next four years, she said. It also could pay for new iPhones for half of the people on Earth. And to really hit home the size of billions of dollars of deficit, Ayotte compared the figure with the salaries of Major League Baseball players. The deficit, she said, could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years." It was fitting timing for the comparison. Ayotte donned a Boston Red Sox hat during the town hall, held on the day of Game 2 of the 2013 World Series. It’s also an interesting statistic to cite. Could the deficit actually fund America’s favorite pastime for the next two-and-a-half centuries? We did the math. Tracking down the federal deficit was the easy part. At the time of the town hall event, the Congressional Budget Office’s most recent deficit estimate was $753 billion, from the monthly report published in September. The baseball numbers are a bit trickier to calculate. Each December, Major League Baseball calculates the total payroll of all baseball clubs to see which teams have to pay a luxury tax, incurred by those who have a payroll over the threshold set by MLB. The 2012 spending was $3.15 billion But what about 2013 figures? We struck out with both Major League Baseball and the players’ union, the Major League Baseball Players Association. The communications office said the official 2013 data is currently being calculated. So, we relied on Opening Day numbers reported by media organizations, which they attributed to a combination of the players association, club officials and Major League Baseball’s central office. According to ESPN, the sum of all the team payrolls on opening day was $3,059,073,869. USA Today and CBS Sports have similar but slightly different numbers -- $3,100,746,107 for USA Today and $3,098,746,107 for CBS Sports. The differences are generally explained by how signing bonuses and deferred money in contracts are counted, and whether injured players are included, said Jeff Euston, a baseball fan who runs a website called Cot’s Contracts at Baseball Prospectus. Ayotte’s math is accurate using the ESPN data -- the source her staff said she used. They said she used numbers reported by ESPN and divided that by the federal deficit estimated by the Office of Management and Budget in July. That’s $759 billion divided by $3,059,073,869, or 248 years. Using numbers from other media organizations, the deficit instead can pay baseball salaries for 238 years or 244 years. Meanwhile, using the CBO’s estimate from September brings the years to 236 or 242. Our Ruling: Ayotte said the deficit this year could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years." Given that she had a couple different options for data, the senator looked to ESPN for sports statistics, which seemed to us like a reasonable choice. The ESPN data produces a result of 248 years. Even if the answer is 236 years or 244 years -- the answer you get if you use different data sources -- it’s a long time. We rate her statement True.

pomt-15100	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker turned a $1 billion surplus into a $2.2 billion budget deficit.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/16/donald-trump/trump-walker-turned-1-billion-surplus-22-budget-sh/	The CNN moderators aimed to get the Republican presidential candidates to go head-to-head in the second GOP debate and the contenders complied. Frontrunner Donald Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker got into verbal tussle over who had a worse fiscal track record. Walker charged that Trump had taken four projects into bankruptcy. Trump fired back that Walker had ruined his state’s budget. "You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state," Trump said. "You lost 2.2 (billion). You have, right now, a huge budget deficit. That’s not a Democratic point. That's a point. That’s a fact." Trump is partly right on the money, but he’s mixing apples and oranges, and his use of the word deficit is problematic. PolitiFact Wisconsin covered much of the ground before. The rules By law, Wisconsin’s two-year budgets must be balanced -- revenue equalling expenditures. So, unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can never run an actual budget deficit by borrowing money that piles up as debt. That said, the state does various projections of what revenues and expenditures will be for the upcoming two-year budget cycle. Those projections can show a surplus or a deficit -- although "deficit" is more accurately termed a projected shortfall, since there is no actual red ink. But the two figures he cited were projections that received plenty of attention when they were made. The two figures In January 2014, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected Wisconsin would see a surplus of about $1 billion by June 30, 2015 -- the end of the 2013-15 budget cycle. At the time, revenues were coming in higher than expected. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in 2014, making good on a Walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers, but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes, such as boosting the state’s rainy day fund. Along the way, however, tax collections grew at a slower pace than had been projected. By November 2014, there was a reversal of fortune: Walker’s own Department of Administration projected a $2.2 billion shortfall for 2015-17. Once again, that figure was not an actual deficit. Indeed, even as a projected shortfall it was overstated. That’s because the standard for projections made in the months leading up to the next budget cycle is to include all the funding requests made by state agencies -- even though, in reality, those requests always get trimmed. That serves to temporarily inflate the actual picture. In the end, the 2015-17 budget approved by the Legislature and signed by Walker in July 2015 was balanced -- just as every other Wisconsin state budget is. Our ruling Mixing apples and oranges, Trump said that under Walker, "You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 (billion). You have right now a huge budget deficit. That’s not a Democratic point. That's a point. That’s a fact." There was in early 2014 a projection of a $1 billion surplus heading into the 2015-17 budget period. Late in 2014, there was a projection of a $2.2 billion shortfall -- the difference between expected revenues and the amount of money being requested by state agencies. But the shortfall was never a deficit -- and some of the surplus was consciously spent by Republicans, as tax cuts. Trump’s statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12700	"If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are. … Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/12/mick-mulvaney/fact-checking-white-house-attack-nonpartisan-cbos-/	As the Congressional Budget Office prepares its assessment of the Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the White House is already casting doubt on the agency’s credibility. During a segment on ABC’s This Week, White House Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney pointed to the CBO’s track record on the ACA as evidence that the agency isn’t capable of assessing a large piece of legislation. "If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are," Mulvaney said March 12. "So, I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard. They do. Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing." This talking point has been popping up a lot in the last week. Gary Cohn, the director of the White House National Economic Council, painted a less-than-rosy picture of the CBO’s track record on Fox News Sunday on March 12. In addition, at a March 8 press conference, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, said "If you’re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place." Mulvaney has a point that the CBO’s projections for how many people would gain coverage through the ACA was higher than reality, but that criticism isn’t enough to undermine its ability to analyze the Republican repeal-and-replace bill. CBO predictions versus reality The CBO — the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress — released enrollment projections for the health care law in March 2010. It estimated that 21 million people would purchase coverage through the new insurance exchanges by 2016. At the end of 2016, more than 11.5 million individuals actually signed up for 2017 coverage, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That’s a difference of 9.5 million enrollees, even more than the figure Mulvaney provided. It's also possible Mulvaney was referring to CBO's March 2010 estimate of the reduction in the number of uninsured people. The CBO predicted 30 million fewer people would be uninsured in 2016 because of the ACA. However, in March 2016, the CBO reduced its estimate of the same quantity to 22 million. That's a difference of 8 million people on the mark. Still, experts said CBO’s forecasts were reasonable at the time. "With respect to precise quantitative point estimates, the differences between CBO's estimates and actual experience are well within the range that I would expect given the scope of the change CBO was being asked to analyze," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. Fiedler also noted that CBO's "big picture" assessment of the impact of the ACA on insurance coverage was on point. Specifically, the agency estimated a significant decrease in the number of people without health insurance that would leave the uninsured rate at a historic low, which is what occurred, he said. In addition, the figure ignores the fact that the 2010 prediction couldn’t account the Supreme Court decision about Medicaid expansion that allowed each state to decide for itself. Nineteen states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility. According to a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, the CBO overestimated enrollee total, but still offered projections closer to reality than four other forecasters (the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute; and the Lewin Group). Importantly, the CBO reduced its projection of how many people would get health insurance this year through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces, from 21 million to 13 million. Initially, CBO analysts believed exchange enrollment would be higher in part because employers would drop insurance plans in favor of the marketplaces. That has not occurred. ‘They’re not capable’ Just because the CBO overestimated one measure of the Affordable Care Act in the past is not a reason enough to believe that they will miss in the same direction in the future, Fielder said. In fact, the CBO continuously adjusts their projections to incorporate new data, research, and experience, so if anything they shouldn’t repeat the same mistakes. With respect to the House bill, the CBO has the advantage of having just seen how implementing the ACA impacted insurance coverage. "That experience will be particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of rolling back provisions of the ACA, meaning that, if anything, one should probably expect estimates of this legislation to be more accurate than CBO's estimates of the effects of enacting the ACA," Fielder said. No prediction will ever be perfect, but for the most part, experts who have studied the CBO have found their projections to be largely sound. For example, the National Tax Journal in 1988 concluded that short-run projections from the CBO do not contain bias. A 2000 report comparing the forecasting of the CBO and the Federal Reserve Board concluded that, "The most accurate forecasting is done by the CBO, with the Fed a close second." Even the CBO released its own report in November 2015 that looked at how accurate their predictions have been, as well as what factors have contributed to forecasting errors. On average, between 1982 and 2014, the CBO overestimated two-year revenue forecasts by 1.1 percent and six-year projections by about 5.3 percent. Our ruling Mulvaney said, "If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are." Mulvaney went on to say that the CBO may not be capable of assessing the GOP’s replacement plan. The initial CBO analysis of the Affordable Care Act did forecast that more people would participate in health care exchanges than actually did, but the CBO has revised those estimates. Moreover, independent analyses, as well as experts agree that the CBO offers some of the best estimates given the information available at the time. Mulvaney’s statement is partially accurate, but misses context that would give readers a different picture of the CBO. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08664	"We will be the first party to elect a bald guy to governor."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/13/john-thrasher/would-rick-scott-be-floridas-first-bald-governor/	2010 is a historic election year in Florida. A gripping three-way U.S. Senate race that could decide the balance of power in Washington. Competitive races for the state Cabinet. A proposed constitutional amendment that could shape state growth for decades. Then there's the governor's race, where the Nov. 2 election will produce either Florida's first female chief executive or, a leading Republican says, its first bald one. (Cue screeching of brakes.) You read that right — bald. Republican Party of Florida Chairman John Thrasher made that claim about Rick Scott on Sept. 10 at a victory party in Scott's honor. "Rick, we will be the first party to elect a bald guy to governor," was the exact quote, according to the Associated Press' Brendan Farrington. Editors note: Being serious fact-checkers, PolitiFact Florida immediately abandoned analyses about the future of Social Security, the extension of the Bush tax cuts and federal hurricane policy. The staff thought it that critical to see if Scott can make hair history. Because hair, after all, is a nonpartisan political issue. The Economist, in a recent piece, raced hair in politics back to the Roman Republic, telling the story of how enemies of an up-and-coming young general Publius Cornelius Scipio tried to derail his rise by implying that he grew his hair un-Romanly long, in a Greek style that seemed soft and suspicious. Then there's the modern-day stories of John Edwards' $400 haircuts during the 2008 presidential campaign and Marco Rubio having to explain that his $135 barbershop bill in Miami wasn't for a back wax. Scott, himself, already has poked fun at his (lack of) hair. "Remember me, the handsome bald guy?" Scott said during his primary night victory speech. Let the record show, Scott does have speckled gray and white hair around the sides and back of his head, but he is bald on the top and describes himself as bald. The official definition, let the record also show, is "lacking a natural or usual covering," according to Merriam-Webster. Knowing all that, we turned to Museum of Florida History Senior Curator Lisa Barton to help our exclusive investigation. Barton, among other things, curates the exhibit of the official portraits of Florida's governors on display at Florida's Historic Capitol building in Tallahassee. She dutifully scoured the portraits, which you can see for yourself online. "Check out the portrait of the 15th governor, Harrison Reed," she said. "It looks like he was bald on top." Reed served as the state's governor from 1868-1873. He's the 15th person to hold the title of governor, and the ninth after statehood. He was a Republican who faced two serious impeachment attempts from members of his own party, according to his biography. After leaving office, Reed became editor of the Semi-Tropical, a monthly magazine devoted to southern agricultural and economic development. He died in Jacksonville, where a street is named in his honor, in 1899. But none of that's really germane to this investigation. His head is. The bald top of his head. Just look at his official portrait. "Reed was a little man, slightly built, with a big, bald head and a bushy beard -- almost goat-like -- the upper lip shaven clean," wrote William Watson Davis in the book The Civil War and Reconstruction in Florida, Volume 53. "A full fringe of hair on three sides of the bald spot, a high forehead, and heavy spectacles gave him an owl-like appearance, which accentuated his calm moderation and well-poised personal address." Richard Nelson Current in Those Terrible Carpetbaggers had the same opinion, describing Reed as "bushy-bearded, bald-headed, (and) bespectacled." During our thorough investigation, we uncovered several governors with receding hairlines but we're hesitant to declare any other governor bald. William Dunn Moseley, the first elected governor of Florida post-statehood, was perhaps closest (he has no hair from his forehead to the crown of his head in his official portrait) — but far from a Shaquille O'Neal. Other contenders included George Franklin Drew (12th state governor, very high hairline), William Dunnington Bloxham (13th governor, widow's peak), and C. Farris Bryant (34th governor, balding. But bald?) To confirm the results of our investigation, we turned to Mike Mercado, a stylist for 11 years who has spent the past three working as an educator at the Aveda Institute in St. Petersburg. We showed him pictures of Scott, as well as the previous governors. He reached a stunning conclusion: He doesn't think Scott is bald at all. "He definitely looks bald because he clips the hair on his side so short," Mercado said. But Scott calls himself bald, we said. Bald on top might be a more accurate description, Mercado said. And for the others? He singled out Reed and Moseley. If they clipped their remaining hair as short as Scott, they would look "just as bald," Mercado said. So Thrasher said Scott would be a trailblazer for bald Floridians, being the first bald person elected governor. Thrasher — sorry, bad-pun police — is a hair off. First, there is a debate if Scott is truly bald. And even putting that aside, Reed was "just as bald" as Scott way back in 1868, and is described by historians as bald. We rate Thrasher's statement False. Now back to digesting that report about the future of Social Security …	None	John Thrasher	None	None	None	2010-09-13T16:18:04	2010-09-10	['None']
pomt-04212	Says the state is required "pick up 70 percent of the cost" of K-12 education.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/30/john-kitzhaber/does-state-pick-70-percent-k-12-tab/	A few weeks back, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber offered his thoughts on several subjects during an address to the Oregon School Boards Association -- everything from PERS and No Child Left Behind to third-grade reading levels and his upcoming budget. Before wrapping up his speech, he said he wanted to touch on one more item: The "disconnect" between "what is bargained for at the local level and the actual fiscal condition of the state." The state, he said, has 197 school districts but nearly 350 local bargaining units and contracts. "These one- to three-year contracts that are bargained at the local level in many cases are disconnected from the revenue that's available in the state's school fund -- yet the state is required to come in on the back end and pick up 70 percent of the cost." There’s a fair point to be made there -- the state picks up part of the tab for spending that it doesn't have any hand in negotiating. Yet, the assertion that the state picks up 70 percent of what school districts spend caught us off guard. We did a quick check of the math from 2009-10 (that’s the most recent year that we have data available from the federal government) and found that total spending by K-12 school districts and education service districts was about $5.5 billion. The total state contribution to K-12 education that year was $2.95 billion. With a little division, you find that the state really only covered 53.4 percent of the bill -- not the 70 percent Kitzhaber referenced. That’s a ways off, so we got in touch with Amy Wojcicki, the governor’s spokeswoman, to see what was up. The governor, she said in an e-mail, was referring to "funding for schools that comes through the State School Fund. This includes local revenues (primarily property taxes) and state funding. The state funding equals about two-thirds of the State School Fund." If you go back to the 2009-10 figures, you can tease apart three pots of money in the total $5.5 billion going to K-12 education. About $4.4 billion comes from Oregon -- $2.95 billion from the state and $1.5 billion from local property taxes and whatnot. Another $1 billion or so comes from the federal government in various forms. To get that 70 percent figure, the governor looked at just the money originating in Oregon: $2.95 billion is about 66 percent of $4.4 billion. (He then rounded up.) But looking at the numbers that way didn’t make much sense to us. Why pretend that $1 billion doesn’t exist? Ben Cannon, the governor’s education adviser, laid out their reasoning for us. Basically, he said, the federal funding doesn’t take into account any of the local bargaining -- so it makes sense to look at just the funding that’s coming in at the state or local level. Even that explanation felt a little thin to us, though, because here’s the thing: The state and local funding levels aren’t connected to local bargaining either. Let’s say, for instance, that Portland Public Schools suddenly decided all teachers should receive $1 million a year in pay and benefits. Well, that doesn’t mean the state has to adjust funding to meet that additional cost or, for that matter, that property taxes would go up. Portland Public might put up a fight for it -- but ultimately the state can say "no." While that’s true, Cannon said, when school budgets grow, most of the pressure gets put on the state to step up. The reason for that, he said, is that the local taxes and the federal contributions are fairly fixed, so when the budgets are built, there’s essentially a gap between what schools need and what they’re getting through those first two sources. "The state's budget is built to fill that extra gap," Cannon said. "Do we have to fill it? No. But the expectation is the state will. The governor has said, on at least two occasions, "the state is required to come in on the back end and pick up 70 percent of the cost" of K-12 schools in Oregon. That’s really only the case if you don’t include federal funds in the entire K-12 budget. Moreover, the state isn’t "required" to fund to any level. Historically, the state has stepped up to fill that "gap," as Cannon describes it, but there’s no commitment that it must. This statement contains an element of truth but ignores some critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.	None	John Kitzhaber	None	None	None	2012-11-30T15:54:53	2012-11-10	['None']
pomt-15134	"Jesus was an undocumented immigrant."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/03/ryan-eller/jesus-was-undocumented-immigrant-ordained-minister/	An ordained minister on a CNN panel said people should choose their words carefully when discussing immigration, because even Jesus was "an undocumented immigrant." The Rev. Ryan Eller, executive director of Define American, a nonprofit promoting awareness of immigration issues, told Carol Costello that word choice about the issue matters. "Jesus was an undocumented immigrant himself when he fled to Egypt seeking persecution in his day," Eller said on Aug. 31, 2015. (Eller told PunditFact he meant "escaping persecution.") "And so the question becomes, would we call Jesus himself illegal if he were, you know, in our modern times?" Jesus’ immigration status obviously isn’t the most important part of his personal story. But people were curious if this piece of trivia holds up. In short, it doesn’t. The world in which Jesus lived was all a part of the Roman Empire, not necessarily a collection of separate sovereign nations. That makes it hard to call baby Jesus an illegal anything. What did Jesus do? Eller told PunditFact his comment was more about putting the plight of Jesus in the perspective of the modern world, not the bureaucratic details of his time. "Jesus was clearly an immigrant, and fled violence in his day," Eller said. "Many undocumented American immigrants have fled the most violent and desperate situations on the planet in search of survival and a better life." In the context of modern boundaries, border crossings between Israel and Egypt these days are contentious, but mostly because Israel aims to stop migrants and terrorists from coming into the country. Israel in 2013 erected a fence on the Egyptian border to reduce illegal migration. Egypt also has been working to prevent smugglers from moving people into Gaza. These days, it would indeed be difficult to move back and forth between the two countries easily without approval. But back to Jesus: The biblical account of what happened right after his birth is described in the gospel of Matthew, with some details provided in the gospel of Luke. Luke 2:1-5 says Joseph lived in Nazareth with Mary, who was pregnant with Jesus, when the Roman emperor called for all the residents of the empire to be counted and taxed. Joseph left for Bethlehem, where King David had been born, because Joseph had roots there. Anyone who celebrates Christmas is pretty aware what happened in Bethlehem, but Eller is referring to what happened after that. Matthew 2:12-16 describes how the Magi visited Jesus, then were warned by God in a dream not to tell King Herod, who wanted to kill the child. Joseph then took Mary and Jesus to Egypt. According to Matthew, Herod then had every male child in Bethlehem younger than 2 killed. Verses 17-23 say Joseph moved the family back to Nazareth after Herod died. That’s what the Bible says, but the historical context matters. To be clear, the Herodian Kingdom did largely correspond to what we now know as modern-day Israel. It was a client state subservient to the Roman Empire, ruled by Herod the Great, who had been appointed king by the Roman Senate. Egypt, or Aegyptus, was a Roman province and run by a prefect appointed by the emperor. There were many administrative vagaries among the vast territory Rome controlled at the time, but experts told us one thing was clear: Anyone who lived in the empire could pretty much go wherever they wanted. Well, as long as they paid their taxes. Clifford Ando, professor of classics, history and law at the University of Chicago, said historical accounts of the period offer an incomplete picture. But for the most part, we can say the empire did not restrict movement in a way comparable to requiring paperwork to cross provinces. There were customs stations in ports and on roads to tax goods, but nothing like a border patrol. "Rome did think of itself as keeping loose track of the borders of the empire, and of course it took a periodic census, and so did loosely record where people resided and owned property once a cycle," Ando said. "That's not the same thing as saying you couldn't move." By the second century C.E., subjects moving to a new province were required to register with the government, he said, but only if they planned to settle there. That likely was not what Joseph had in mind after being warned by God to flee to Egypt. Even though many scholars don’t agree on the exact years Jesus was born or moved to Nazareth as a youth, we know the family left Egypt after Herod the Great died in 4 B.C.E. The region known as Judaea (where Bethlehem was) became a Roman province in 6 C.E., after Rome removed Herod’s son Archelaus, who had become king of that portion of Herod’s kingdom. Nazareth, meanwhile, was in Galilee, an area later ruled by Herod’s son Antipas, known as the king who eventually beheaded John the Baptist. Charles Cochran, senior pastor at First Christian Church in Charleroi, Pa., said the Bible is full of scripture that illustrates the idea of accepting others as they are and helping those in need. But Eller’s description of Jesus and his family as comparable to undocumented immigrants was too much of a stretch, he said. "Joseph had to be cautious, but the caution had nothing to do with immigration status," Cochran said. "It was much more like sneaking across the Georgia-Alabama line than across the Rio Grande." Our ruling Eller said, "Jesus was an undocumented immigrant." He was making the point that Jesus and his family had to escape to a new land to avoid danger, as immigrant families sometimes do. In a historical context, however, Herod’s kingdom and the province of Egypt were ultimately governed by the Roman Empire, and weren’t separate nations as we know them now. Experts said there were likely very few, if any, restrictions on movement between the two, making the situation more akin to fleeing a state than another country. We rate Eller’s statement False.

pomt-04044	"One out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/29/dianne-feinstein/dianne-feinstein-says-one-five-law-enforcement-off/	Almost six weeks after the gun rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took the lead in proposing a new assault weapons ban. She later argued for its passage on the Jan. 28, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. Host Bob Schieffer asked Feinstein, "What about the idea -- which some gun rights supporters cite -- they say, ‘Look, all of this is just to make people feel good. It's just, kind of, feel-good legislation’ -- that, in the end, it's not going to stop these kinds of incidents?" Feinstein responded in part, "Well, that's absolutely not true. What we are trying to do is overall see that weapons ... are in the hands of responsible citizens, that they are used legally, not illegally, that they do not fall into the hands of gangs. Do you realize we have 150,000-plus gang members in this nation? When they go up against the police, it's generally an AK-47. You realize that police have had to break into gun stores to get weapons that would be stronger than the adversary they had? Do you realize that one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon?" A reader asked us whether it was true that "one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon." So we looked into it. Because Feinstein was talking about gun policy, we will only look at the police officers killed by guns, which in any case accounted for 92 percent of law-enforcement deaths as a result of criminal action between 2002 and 2011, according to FBI data. When we checked with Feinstein’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a data from the Violence Policy Center, a "national educational organization working to stop gun death and injury" and a group that generally favors tighter gun regulations. This data, obtained from FBI records, showed that eight of the 45 gun-related killings of law-enforcement officers in 2009 were committed with assault weapons. That works out to be almost 18 percent -- quite close to the one in five Feinstein cited. And this wasn’t a fluke. Calculations published in 2003 by the center showed that during the years 1998 through 2001, at least 41 of the 211 law enforcement officers killed by guns were killed by assault weapons -- 19.4 percent. We should make an important point, however: There is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered "an assault weapon." Not all rifles are assault weapons, and not all assault weapons are rifles. For instance, in California -- Feinstein’s home state -- the law includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of "assault weapon." But different state laws have different definitions. For the data it analyzed, the Violence Policy Center went beyond the basic statistics collected by the FBI, which is published in an annual report called "Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted." The FBI breaks the felonious killings of officers into those committed by handguns, rifles and shotguns (as well as by weapons other than guns). The FBI does not include a specific category for "assault weapons." For the two periods studied, the Violence Policy Center obtained additional information from the FBI about every incident in which an officer was killed, including the gun’s make and model. The Violence Policy Center has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for more recent data, but has not yet received the information yet, the Feinstein spokesman said. We showed the data to Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, to get an independent perspective on whether the Violence Policy Center’s classifications of weapons was reasonable. Safarik told PolitiFact that it’s reasonable to call at least seven of the weapons in the 2009 data "assault weapons." In the case of the eighth weapon -- a semiautomatic, .223 caliber rifle of unknown make and model -- he said it’s unclear whether it would qualify as an assault weapon. Dropping the number of assault weapons from eight to seven would make the percentage about 16 percent -- still not too far off from one in five. Still, Safarik and others urged caution, emphasizing that "assault weapon" can be molded to the purposes of whoever is using the term. "Whatever any politician wants to define as an assault weapon, that is the way it goes," said Vance McLaughlin, a criminal justice professor at Jacksonville State University in Alabama. "If I define an assault weapon as any semi-auto that has 11 or more cartridges in its magazine, I can then poach some numbers from the handgun category. And on and on and on." Our ruling Because the definition of "assault weapon" is subject to debate, the categorization of any given weapon is open to some interpretation. Still, while the numbers were analyzed by a group with a stake in the fight, we find the data reasonable. The data has been consistent in the five years studied, and at worst, Feinstein's figure for the most recent year, 2009, is only a few percentage points high. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Dianne Feinstein	None	None	None	2013-01-29T15:12:23	2013-01-27	['None']

"We also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears," Clinton said during the debate. "He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists."

The Twittersphere, on both the right and the left, picked up on Clinton’s statement and questioned whether she had any evidence for it. Extensive Google searches did not turn up any evidence. And the response from the Clinton campaign did not point to any specific videos. The campaign pointed to an NBC News article that quoted Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the social media activities of Islamic terrorist groups. "They love him from the sense that he is supporting their rhetoric," she said. "They follow everything Donald Trump says. When he says, 'No Muslims should be allowed in America,' they tell people, 'We told you America hates Muslims and here is proof.' " The article also quoted David Phillips, director of the Program on Peace-Building and Rights at Columbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Rights, saying that "Trump's incendiary anti-Muslim comments will surely be used by ISIS social media to demonize the United States and attract recruits to fight in Iraq and Syria." But while such quotes support the notion that ISIS could be making recruiting videos, or will do so, they do not support Clinton’s contention -- offered in the present tense -- that they are currently doing so. Vox.com tweeted at J.M. Berger, author of the book ISIS: The State of Terror, and Berger tweeted back, "I would be surprised if they had and we didn't hear about it in a big way." For now, it seems that Clinton has turned speculative left-of-center rhetoric into fact. Others have wondered if ISIS will use Trump’s statements against the United States. On Dec. 14, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told Alisyn Camerota on CNN’s New Day that "Donald Trump could be a recruitment poster for ISIS because he is fanning the flames of hate." A few days earlier, Robert Kuttner of the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, wrote a column titled, "How ISIS and Trump Enable Each Other." In it, he wrote, "Trump’s collected speeches are like an ISIS recruiting video." At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. We’ll update our fact-check in the event solid evidence emerges. But for now, that evidence does not exist. Our ruling Clinton said that ISIS is "going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists." We were unable to find any evidence to support this. The Clinton campaign did not provide any evidence that this is already happening -- only that it could be happening, or that it may in the future. If ISIS was using Trump for recruitment videos, we would expect a frenzy of media coverage over it. We rate this claim False. UPDATE, Jan. 5, 2016: About two weeks after Clinton’s comment, various news outlets reported that the terrorist group Al Shabaab had released a recruitment video that featured clips of Trump speaking shortly after the Dec. 2 terrorist shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., about his proposal for a temporary but "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S." As we noted in greater depth here, we aren’t changing our rating, because we rate statements based on evidence that was public at the time the statement was made. Before she made her comment, Clinton had no way of knowing about the Al Shabaab video. SITE Intelligence Group, which found the video, said it was distributed on Twitter on Dec. 31. In addition, Al Shabbab is not affiliated with ISIS.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-12-19T22:55:00	2015-12-19	['Islam', 'Donald_Trump']

pomt-08515	"Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost. Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/republican-party-florida/republican-party-florida-says-alex-sink-was-charge/	Update: This item has been corrected to distinguish between the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund and the Local Government Investment Pool. Both were controlled by the State Board of Administration, but they are separate funds. You should believe our attack ad, because we found a lot of newspaper stories that support our case! Okay, so campaign attack ads don't really say that. But it seems to be the unstated premise of several ads featuring newspaper headlines and quotes from stories rushing across the screen. Take the latest attack ad from the Republican Party of Florida, which is campaigning against Democrat Alex Sink for governor. Her opponent is Republican Rick Scott, a former health care executive. Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost. Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink." Meanwhile, the screen flashes quotes and dates from the St. Petersburg Times: "the state of Florida made bad investments that lost hundreds of millions" and "Florida pension fund plummets." The ad then cuts to video of Sink: "I'm the fiscal watchdog for the citizens of our state, I have to look over how our citizens money is invested." The narrator goes on: "The press says our government skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments. Auditors blamed Sink for a 'weak controls and a lack of oversight.' And now she wants a promotion?" The screen flashes more quotes from the Times: "Florida's State Board of Administration skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments," and "weak internal controls and a lack of external oversight by trustees." Three of the four quotes are from a Times story published Sept. 19, 2010: Florida's State Board of Administration skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments. The other quote is from a story published Nov. 17, 2008, Florida pension fund plummets. The Republican Party of Florida has released other ads against Sink and the state pension fund; we rated a previous ad Barely True. We wanted to see if this latest attack was more accurate. We're going to examine its claim in two parts. "Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost." The Florida Retirement System Trust Fund is a massive investment account, today worth about $117 billion and holding the retirement assets of about 1 million current and retired state employees. It is one of the largest retirement funds in the nation. When Wall Street melted down in 2008, the value of Florida's retirement fund fell, too. In Sept. 2007, the fund was at its peak at about $138.4 billion and by June 30, 2010, the value had declined to $109.34 billion, a $29 billion drop in value. Still, according to the last actuarial report completed in 2009, the fund is 88.5 percent funded -- meaning if every employee retired today, they would get 88.5 percent of their retirement benefits. A funding level of 80 percent is considered healthy. The State Board of Administration oversees the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund, as well as 33 additional public funds, including the Local Government Investment Pool. Hundreds of governments and organizations use this short-term fund like a money market fund and count on it for investments that are safe and easily converted to cash. The St. Petersburg Times story from Sept. 19, 2010, detailed the local fund's risky investments over the past few years. The investigation found that state officials aggressively sought exceptions to rules intended to stop the local fund from buying high-risk securities. From the story: "Going back at least seven years, state money managers had been trying to find a way around rules that restricted them from buying certain risky securities. Time and again they asked, time and again lawyers told them no. "But so eager were Florida's money managers for higher yields, they bought them anyway. In two months at the brink of the housing market meltdown in 2007, the state invested at least $9.5 billion in securities it was not authorized to buy, a review of confidential memos shows." The ad mixes state pension fund and the Local Government Investment Pool together. Where the SBA "skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments," according to the St. Petersburg Times was not with the pension fund, but with the Local Government Investment Pool, which had chafed under rules that prevented it from buying higher risk (and possibly higher return) investments. The losses in the pension fund are assets that have declined in value. Some previous ads have confused this issue, implying that the money lost was cash that disappeared out of bank accounts. But this ad makes pretty clear that it's talking about declines in value in investments made from pension funds, which are commonly referred to as losses. We find the claim that Florida "lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost" to be mostly accurate. "Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink." The ad then targets Sink in her role as chief financial officer, an elected position in Florida that oversees several functions, including overseeing the state's auditing and accounting functions. But the specific claims of lost pension money and bad investments is related to Sink's role as one of three members of the Board of Trustees on the State Board of Administration, or SBA, the board charged with overseeing both the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund and the Local Government Investment Pool. The other members of the board are Gov. Charlie Crist and Attorney General Bill McCollum. (Crist recently left the Republican Party to run as an independent for U.S. Senate against Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek. McCollum lost to Scott in the Republican Party primary for governor.) According to statute, the three-member board "may retain investment advisers or managers, or both, external to in-house staff, to assist the board in carrying out the power specified," and the board "shall create an audit committee to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities." So the board doesn't directly invest and administer the money but delegates the responsibility to an executive director. Ash Williams is the current executive director, and the job of investing the state's assets is divided between in-house investment managers and external investment managers. So as a member of the board, Sink is "in charge," but she's in charge along with the two other trustees. And she's not responsible for day-to-day investment decisions. Still, in April 2008, the board commissioned an audit that found many questionable purchases of securities, purchases that were riskier than what state rules should have allowed. The auditors said they were not hired to do a criminal investigation, and it was ''outside the scope" to determine if the problems were the result of fraud or illegal acts. But the audit found weak internal controls and a lack of external oversight by the trustees -- Crist, Sink and McCollum. It's a fair question to ask whether Sink, as a member of the board, asked enough questions and demanded enough answers. It is not accurate to imply, as the ad, does that she alone was in charge. The Times investigation repeatedly mentions that Sink, Crist and McCollum were the three charged with oversight of the funds and does not single out Sink for blame. Our ruling In the context of making investments, the ad rightly claims that Florida "lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost," as the St. Petersburg Times stories reported. But the ad is misleading with its implication that Alex Sink was in charge of the funds as chief financial officer. She was one of three members of an oversight panel during a historic decline in investment values, and there are other people who bear responsibility for what happened to Florida's pensions funds, including internal and external financial managers. Still, Sink was one of three members who were in charge of defending the state's interest. The newspaper stories that the ad mentions don't single out Sink as being "in charge." So we rate this statement Half True.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2010-10-06T14:16:18	2010-09-27	['Alex_Sink']

pomt-13322	As a result of Chris Sununu’s vote against a Planned Parenthood contract, "nearly 3,000 fewer" women and families statewide accessed health care for birth control, cancer screenings and annual exams.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/06/colin-van-ostern/colin-van-ostern-says-rejection-planned-parenthood/	Over the past few years, the issue of Planned Parenthood funding has turned New Hampshire’s little-known Executive Council into a lightning rod for controversy. Now that two executive councilors - Republican Chris Sununu and Democrat Colin Van Ostern - are running for governor, their votes on Planned Parenthood have become a significant issue on the campaign trail. Van Ostern has repeatedly claimed Sununu’s 2015 vote against $639,000 of state funding to Planned Parenthood of Northern New England denied health care to thousands of women and families in the state, saying nearly 3,000 fewer women and families accessed services statewide because of the defeated contract. Van Ostern has repeatedly said the lost funding has affected "thousands" of women and families. "Real damage can come from one vote on the executive council," he said during an August speech. As a result of Sununu’s vote, "nearly 1,000 fewer women and families accessed health care here for birth control and cancer screenings and annual exams in this city of Manchester and nearly 3,000 fewer did statewide," he said. Van Osten went back to the point again at a Concord Monitor/NECN debate on Oct. 5, saying as a result of Sununu’s vote, "fewer women got birth control, cancer screening and annual exams." PolitiFact decided to take a look at the numbers. There’s little question Sununu was the swing vote on Planned Parenthood funding. He had voted for similar contracts in the past, and when the funding came up in August 2015, he cited concerns about videos that purportedly showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue. In June, 2016, he changed course, and the funding was ultimately restored by a 3-2 vote. To get a scope of the numbers of women that were affected, we reached out to Van Ostern’s camp, which cited a 2015 WMUR article that quoted Planned Parenthood of Northern New England Senior Policy Advisor Jennifer Frizzell. "According to details provided by Frizzell, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England served 14,191 patients at the end of 2014, but that number dropped by 21 percent, to 11,119, by the end of 2015 as a result of the ‘lost funding,’" the article said. But numbers from Planned Parenthood show something different. The five Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw 11,078 patients in 2014; the following year, they saw about 1,000 fewer patients statewide, according to numbers provided by the organization. It turns out that the 21 percent drop the WMUR article references included patients that were lost when a West Lebanon Planned Parenthood clinic relocated to neighboring White River Junction, Vt. in 2014. Before the relocation, Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw about 14,000 patients. That number dropped to about 11,000 after the West Lebanon clinic moved. The drop of 1,000 patients between 2014 and 2015 also takes into account a 5-week closure of the Claremont Planned Parenthood clinic after it was vandalized and heavily damaged. That clinic served 948 patients in 2014, which fell 20 percent to 755 the following year, the steepest drop out of all the clinics. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England spokeswoman Victoria Bonney said the lost funding from Sununu’s 2015 Executive Council vote affected access to services including family planning, birth control, well-woman visits, cancer screenings and STI testing and treatment, but patients were never turned away. Bonney said the lost funding did not result in staff layoffs or denying patients care. Rather, it impacted scheduling and meant fewer patients were seen each day. Some health centers normally staffed with three practitioners a day had to scale back to two, according to Bonney. "During the defund, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England never turned patients away and tried to meet demand with fewer resources," Bonney said. "But when patients hear Planned Parenthood has been defunded, they put off health care. With so much media attention on Chris Sununu’s 2015 vote to defund Planned Parenthood, patients may have been uncertain if they could still access necessary services." Our ruling Democratic candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern said as a result of Chris Sununu’s vote against a Planned Parenthood contract, "nearly 3,000 fewer" women and families statewide accessed health care for birth control, cancer screenings and annual exams Sununu, a Republican, did vote against a $639,000 Planned Parenthood contract in 2015. It led to fewer shifts at clinics, but no patients were ever turned away or denied care, the organization said. The numbers cited by Van Ostern weren’t accurate. About 1,000 fewer women accessed Planned Parenthood from one year to the next. His numbers, however, failed to account for one clinic moving out of state, and another one being closed for 5 weeks following an incident of vandalism. Still, some patients may have stayed away following the publicity surrounding the vote. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06699	A new college tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota "makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/04/scott-walker/wisconsin-governor-scott-walker-says-tuition-recip/	The start of September means the start of college classes in Wisconsin and Minnesota -- two states that for more than 45 years have used tuition reciprocity agreements to make it easier for students in each state to attend school across the border. Reciprocity means a Wisconsin resident who attends a public university or technical college in Minnesota is treated as a Minnesota resident and can pay in-state tuition, rather than the higher out-of-state tuition rate. The same goes for Minnesota residents attending college in Wisconsin. The difference is significant. At the University of Minnesota, for example, in-state tuition in 2011-2012 is $13,062 and out-of-state tuition is $5,000 more, figures from the Minnesota Office of Higher Education show. When the annual renewal of the reciprocity agreement was announced on Aug. 15, 2011, an article on JSOnline.com, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, carried this headline: "Wisconsin students to pay more under new tuition pact with Minnesota." The additional cost would be about $1,400 more each year for Wisconsin residents attending the University of Minnesota and about $2,200 for those attending the University of Minnesota-Duluth, the article said. The amounts vary at other campuses. But in a news release issued the same day, Gov. Scott Walker said: "This new tuition reciprocity agreement with the State of Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents. Smaller tuition bills widen access to higher education, and that’s a win-win situation for students and Wisconsin." Wait. More affordable even as you pay more? Sounds like the new math. Let’s hit the books. Since 1965, Wisconsin has had a tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota in one form or another, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It’s the only reciprocity agreement that allows Wisconsin residents to attend public universities outside of Wisconsin and pay the lower in-state tuition rate. Other reciprocity agreements relate to community and technical colleges in Michigan, Illinois and Iowa, according to the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board. Because tuition in Minnesota is generally higher, the reciprocity agreement was amended in 2007 so that Wisconsin would make supplementary payments to Minnesota schools, according to the state fiscal bureau. Here’s an example of how the supplementary payment worked in the 2010-2011 school year: Two schools considered comparable under the reciprocity agreement are the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Minnesota, where nearly half of the Wisconsin reciprocity students studying in Minnesota attend school. In 2010-2011, tuition was $9,794 at the Twin Cities campus and $8,398 at UW-Madison, a difference of $1,396. A Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota had to pay only the $8,398; that meant the University of Minnesota was receiving $1,396 less than it received from a Minnesota resident. Through the supplementary payment, the State of Wisconsin paid the difference of $1,396 to the University of Minnesota. Under the new reciprocity agreement, the supplementary payments to Minnesota schools are eliminated. That means Wisconsin residents, starting with freshmen entering college in 2012-2013, will have to pay the full in-state tuition to attend school in Minnesota. Had the supplements been eliminated in 2010-2011, a Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota would have had to pay $1,396 more in tuition. The move is expected to save Wisconsin $2.6 million in 2012-2013 and more in subsequent years, according to the fiscal bureau. In announcing the new reciprocity agreement, Walker said more than 10,000 Wisconsin students participate in the program every year. But his news release didn’t explain his quote about how the new deal makes college more affordable for Wisconsin residents, so we asked his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, for evidence. Werwie didn’t have any. He simply pointed out that, if there were no reciprocity agreement, Wisconsin residents would have to pay the higher out-of-state tuition rate to attend school in Minnesota. But that goes without saying. What’s more, the idea of tuition reciprocity is not new. An agreement has been in place since before Walker was born. Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter. Walker said the new tuition reciprocity agreement between Wisconsin and Minnesota makes college "more affordable for Wisconsin residents." But the new agreement doesn’t make attending school in Minnesota any more affordable. In fact, it’s just the opposite. By eliminating supplementary payments from the state, the typical reciprocity student from Wisconsin will have to pay $1,400 more in tuition each year, based on 2010-2011 figures.

pomt-12433	"The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/	The blockbuster article in the Washington Post saying President Donald Trump had "revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting" didn’t just put the White House on the defensive. It also put Republican lawmakers in a tight spot. One of the members of Congress who commented after the newspaper’s revelations was Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho. According to CNN, he told reporters, "The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process." Is that accurate? Independent experts said Risch is on target concerning the legal powers of the president. Some experts added, however, that the senator’s formulation left out some context that is relevant for assessing Trump’s alleged actions. The president’s classification and declassification powers are broad Experts agreed that the president, as commander-in-chief, is ultimately responsible for classification and declassification. When someone lower in the chain of command handles classification and declassification duties -- which is usually how it’s done -- it’s because they have been delegated to do so by the president directly, or by an appointee chosen by the president. The majority ruling in the 1988 Supreme Court case Department of Navy vs. Egan -- which addressed the legal recourse of a Navy employee who had been denied a security clearance -- addresses this line of authority. "The President, after all, is the ‘Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States’" according to Article II of the Constitution, the court’s majority wrote. "His authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security ... flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President, and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant." Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, said that such authority gives the president the authority to "classify and declassify at will." In fact, Robert F. Turner, associate director of the University of Virginia's Center for National Security Law, said that "if Congress were to enact a statute seeking to limit the president’s authority to classify or declassify national security information, or to prohibit him from sharing certain kinds of information with Russia, it would raise serious separation of powers constitutional issues." The official documents governing classification and declassification stem from executive orders. But even these executive orders aren’t necessarily binding on the president. The president is not "obliged to follow any procedures other than those that he himself has prescribed," Aftergood said. "And he can change those." Indeed, the controlling executive order has been rewritten by multiple presidents. The current version of the order was issued by President Barack Obama in 2009. The national-security experts at the blog Lawfare wrote in the wake of the Post’s revelation that the "infamous comment" by President Richard Nixon -- that "when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal" -- "is actually true about some things. Classified information is one of them. The nature of the system is that the president gets to disclose what he wants." Two caveats So Risch’s comment holds water when it comes to the extent of the president’s powers. But some experts said that Risch’s formulation leaves out some notable aspects of the particular case involving Trump. The first caveat: While Trump has the power to declassify information, he doesn’t appear to have done that in this case, at least at the time the story broke. "There’s no question that the president has broad authority to declassify almost anything at any time without any process, but that’s not what happened here," said Stephen I. Vladeck, professor at the University of Texas School of Law. "He did not, in fact, declassify the information he shared with the Russians, which is why the Washington Post did not publish that information." Instead, Vladeck said, Trump "took it upon himself to authorize officials from a foreign government to receive classified national security information that was itself derived from a different foreign government’s intelligence gathering. That’s just not the same thing as what Sen. Risch described, and the law on this topic is far murkier." Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at NYU’s Brennan Center, agreed that Risch’s point speaks to general presidential authority but not what happened in this particular case. "Trump surely would not concede that the information in question is now ‘unclassified’ and available to anyone who files a FOIA request," she said. "The relevant question, therefore, is not whether the president can spontaneously declassify information, but whether the president is permitted to disclose sensitive national security information to anyone he wishes." Turner noted, however, that this isn’t necessarily a big distinction, since the president is ultimately the decider of what is classified and not. If his appointees disagree with his actions, "he can overrule their decisions," Turner said. "Within the Executive Branch the president is the boss." The second caveat: Just because something is legal doesn’t mean that it’s a smart idea. "The important caveat is that ‘legal’ and ‘sensible’ may be different things," said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org. "It may be legal, but it may fail to avoid the appearance of impropriety." Setting aside ethics, doing what Trump is alleged to have done could have negative practical consequences for the United States. "It could wreck the underlying intelligence-sharing agreement and place the U.S. at a disadvantage," Aftergood said. That said, the line between wise and unwise is a judgment call. On the one hand, Turner agreed that alienating an ally by not following their orders "could have very serious consequences." On the other hand, he said, it’s not outlandish to argue that sharing closely held information with Russia could advance, rather than hurt, national interests. Turner said it may be "in America’s interest to cooperate with Russia in the struggle against ISIS, including sharing intelligence information that may help save Russian lives and seeking information that may save American lives and those of other potential victims of ISIS attacks. Obviously, in the process we will want to safeguard sources and methods that might weaken our ability to keep track of what President Putin is up to--as he is potentially a greater threat to our security than is ISIS. But the struggle against ISIS is an area where the United States and Russia have a shared interest." In a statement to PolitiFact, Risch’s office said that criticism of the wisdom of President Trump's action would be a personal opinion, but such sentiments would not speak to "the letter of the law." "Sen. Risch can tell you that all former presidents of the United States spoke regularly with heads of states and discussed classified matter, if they determined it to be in the best interest of the American people," the statement said. Our ruling Risch said, "The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process." We found broad agreement that a president, using powers granted by the Constitution, is able to declassify essentially anything. However, experts added that Risch’s comment was not entirely on point for the particular situation involving Trump. In this case, it appears Trump didn’t actually use his declassification power before talking to the Russian officials, and just because Trump’s actions were legal doesn’t necessarily mean they were wise. These caveats add nuance to analyses of what Trump did. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10438	"More people without health care since George Bush took office; more children in poverty since George Bush took office."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/08/barack-obama/more-uninsured-but-blame-skewed/	In a recent speech, Sen. Barack Obama took a swipe at presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain, chastising McCain's characterization of economic gains during President George W. Bush's tenure. Obama talked about things that have gone amiss in the past 7 years, beginning with the rising population of uninsured Americans. "More people without health care since George Bush took office; more children in poverty since George Bush took office," Obama said during an April 18, 2008, speech in Williamsport, Pa. Obama is promoting a health plan that he contends will offer universal coverage and address the needs of individuals who do not currently have health insurance. We've already ruled that Obama's plan does not guarantee universal coverage. Obama is correct that the uninsured population has grown during this decade. An analysis of Census data by representatives of the Commonwealth Fund, a health care think tank, finds the uninsured population has risen by 8.6-million people since 2000, reaching a total 47-million in 2006, the last year for which figures are available. The primary culprit is the rapid growth in health care costs and premiums, which is leading employers — especially small companies — to pass more costs to workers or eliminate coverage altogether. Candidates have largely focused on three strategies to address the problem: offer tax incentives to buy private insurance policies (McCain's favored option), insure everyone through a government-run program like Medicare or create a hybrid group insurance market that would provide people with a choice of public or private health plans (the preferred route of Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, though we've examined the differences between their plans ). Obama's statement highlights a major social policy concern, but it's not entirely accurate to pin all the blame on President Bush. Health costs are driven in large part by increased use of sophisticated medical tests and procedures, as well as rising drug costs and falling personal incomes. The second half of Obama's statement, "more children in poverty since George Bush took office," can be interpreted in different ways. We take him to mean that more children are below the poverty level now than in 2000. Census statistics support that point, showing the population of families below the poverty level with children under the age of 18 increased from 4.9-million in 2000 to 5.8-million in 2006. Obama correctly cites the growing number of uninsured Americans, as well as children in poverty, since President Bush took office. But by making Bush's tenure the benchmark for measuring those statistics, Obama is implying a level of direct responsibility for the numbers that can't quite be established with complicated social matters. That brings us to Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-05-08T00:00:00	2008-04-18	['George_W._Bush']

pomt-04872	"One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/09/upendra-chivukula/upendra-chivukula-claims-leonard-lance-was-not-gun/	U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance was elected to Congress, then took a hard right turn on his position on gun control, according to Upendra Chivukula, a Democratic state Assemblyman who hopes to unseat Lance in November. "One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns," Chivukula said in an Aug. 5 interview with the liberal blog Blue Jersey. "Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks, which is mostly dangerous for the people who are visiting the national park." Lance, a former state senator, has faced criticism for shedding more moderate views since he was sworn in to the House of Representatives in 2009. So here, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered if Lance (R-7th Dist.) was "not for guns" in 2008 but then said, "you can carry concealed weapons in national parks." The congressman’s position on the latter half of that claim is clear: he supports it. In May 2009, Lance voted to repeal the ban on visitors possessing firearms on federal public land, as long as gun owners comply with the laws of the state where the park is located. Lance touts that vote on his campaign website in a section on Second Amendment rights. But was Lance "not for guns" just a year prior to that vote, in 2008? That’s a broad, unsupported claim that suggests Lance opposed firearms and then reversed his position. We found no evidence that Lance advocated against guns. Joey Novick, Chivukula’s campaign manager, pointed us to a survey from Project Vote Smart, a nonpartisan group that tracks where candidates stand on key issues, to support Chivukula’s claim. In 2007 -- as Lance was vying for another term in the New Jersey Senate -- he filled out the survey, which asks candidates to note which positions they would support in a number of areas if elected. In a section labeled "gun issues," Lance indicated he would "maintain and strengthen the enforcement of existing state restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns." He also noted his support to "require a license for gun possession." But that doesn’t prove Lance was "not for guns," only that he supported enforcing New Jersey’s current laws. Todd Mitchell, Lance’s chief of staff, said that Lance has always been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, pointing to a number of "pro-gun" votes during his time as a state legislator. Also, Mitchell noted that in 2007 the state chapter of the NRA endorsed Lance’s re-election bid. "This is a feeble attempt by the Chivukula campaign to distract voters from Upendra's dismal fiscal record as a member of the Democratic leadership in Trenton," Mitchell said. Novick said Chivukula’s overall point was that in "many issues––including guns and Second Amendment issues, Leonard Lance has moved to extreme positions that are more right wing." Our ruling Chivukula said "one of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks." There’s an element of truth to this claim: Lance voted to repeal a ban on carrying weapons in national parks in 2009, as long as the gun owner complies with the laws of the state where the park is located. But to suggest Lance flip-flopped in taking that position is misleading. The survey Chivukula’s campaign cited shows Lance, as a state legislator, favored enforcing New Jersey’s current laws. To say Lance was "not for guns" is wrong. We rate this statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Upendra Chivukula	None	None	None	2012-08-09T07:30:00	2012-08-05	['None']

pomt-02008	"Last year," Obama "administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping and thousands of drug-related crimes."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/10/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-claim-about-obamas-prison-break-illega/	U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, recently charged President Barack Obama with freeing thousands of convicted murderers, kidnappers, rapists and other criminals before deportation. Obama's "lax immigration policies continue to put the lives of Americans at risk," Smith said in his letter in the May 31, 2014, San Antonio Express-News. "Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions," Smith wrote. "The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping, and thousands of drug-related crimes. This would be considered the worst prison break in American history, except it was approved by the president and enabled by immigration officials." Did Obama deliver the equivalent of a giant prison break? By email, Smith spokeswoman Kim Smith Hicks told us Rep. Smith relied on a May 2014 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. The report said that from October 2012 through September 2013, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement "freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings," according to an ICE document obtained by the center. By phone, the report’s author, Jessica Vaughan, told us the document came to the center from someone she declined to identify who fielded it in connection with congressional inquiries to the agency. The center included a chart in its report showing more than 88,000 convictions including 116 homicide convictions and more than 300 sexual assault offenses. But the biggest cluster of convictions (17,000-plus) were for traffic offenses, followed by more than 15,000 drunk-driving violations. The released individuals accumulated about 9,200 "dangerous drugs" convictions, according to the chart, and 5,000 larceny offenses. The document didn’t itemize reasons for the releases. But the center’s report said individuals were subsequently subject to little to no government supervision, though an unknown number were required to check in by telephone or to wear tracking devices. The center said less than 3,000 were released due to a 2001 Supreme Court decision preventing ICE from indefinitely detaining certain individuals whose countries will not take them back. Vaughan told us all the convicts were let go from ICE-run facilities or other jails where housing had been federally paid for. Separately, a May 16, 2014, Associated Press news story pointed out the released individuals had all completed their criminal jail sentences, according to ICE. Also, the story said, nearly all the released individuals still faced deportation along with required check-ins with authorities while their cases were pending. And why were the detainees let go? The story quoted an ICE spokeswoman, Barbara Gonzalez, as saying that in many of the tallied cases, the agency was required by law to release the immigrants while their deportation cases were pending. "The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report," Gonzalez said. For example, she said, mandatory releases accounted for over 72 percent of the immigrants convicted of homicide, the AP reported. We reached out to Gonzalez, hearing back from Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, who emailed us similar information. "Convicted criminals come into the agency’s custody to undergo removal proceedings after they have already satisfied the terms of their criminal sentence," Rusnok said. "In many of the releases in 2013, ICE was required by law to release the individuals from custody, pursuant to decisions by the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Once in ICE custody, many of the individuals described in the report were released under restrictions such as GPS monitoring, telephone monitoring, supervision, or bond." Rusnok continued: "The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report. For example, mandatory releases account for over 72% of the homicides listed." He added: "Others, typically those with less serious offenses, were released as a discretionary matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding the priority of holding the individual, given ICE’s resources, and prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to public safety or national security." The Obama administration has asked Congress to fund fewer so-called detention beds in ICE facilities than before, we noted in a June 2013 fact check. An April 12, 2013, Washington Times news article summed up: "Congress fought hard during the past decade to boost the number of detentions, arguing that those who were allowed back into the general population rarely returned to be deported." That story quoted then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as saying the department believed it could keep all high-priority individuals detained with the lower number of beds, while making use of alternatives to track the other people in deportation proceedings. By email, the center’s Vaughan ultimately called Smith’s recent statement "completely factual and correct." Earlier, Vaughan told us she saw little import to the released individuals reportedly fulfilling prison sentences due to their criminal convictions before their immigration cases were taken up. No information has been released, she said, about how many of the individuals were released under personal recognizance or on bonds, both of which she described as tantamount to no post-release supervision. Reminded of ICE saying 72 percent of the individuals convicted of murder were let go under a court’s direction, Vaughan said that means 28 percent were released at the government’s discretion. Released individuals might still face deportation, Vaughan said, but she’s doubtful many will show up for final decisions. She said the center has separately calculated that some three in four ICE detainees released while their immigration cases are pending fail to show up to finish the cases. Our ruling Smith wrote: "Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping, and thousands of drug-related crime This statement has accurate figures, but fails to acknowledge that an unknown number of the releases--including nearly three in four of the individuals convicted of murder--were not at the administration’s discretion. Also missing: Most of the tallied convictions weren’t for violent offenses; each released individual didn’t skip out on prison time connected to criminal convictions; and most released individuals still faced deportation.

pomt-11594	Says one year later, "the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/trump-isis-territory-losses-near-100/	President Donald Trump spoke proudly of gains made in the fight against the Islamic State. He looked back to his pledge in 2017 to "extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth." "One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria," Trump said. According to data from IHS Markit, a private defense and security research firm, the area controlled by the Islamic State went from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 6,759 square kilometers in January 2018. That’s a 93 percent reduction in territory, which is pretty close to 100 percent. But Trump’s emphasis on the one-year time frame and territory "just recently held" by the Islamic State pushes his claim a bit. If that means since he took office, then the Islamic State’s losses are closer to 89 percent. The success Trump described built upon strategy and attacks launched under President Barack Obama. The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy over 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and November 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.) Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three fourths of the action took place during the Obama years. The Air Force reports over 104,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. About two-thirds of that came before Trump took office. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact in January that Trump devolved more authority to the tactical level on the battlefield, which sped up U.S. operations and produced "a real shift … that contributed to ISIS's precipitous collapse in mid 2017." Our ruling Trump said that after one year, coalition forces had freed almost 100 percent of the territory just recently held by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. According to data from a private defense and security group, the Islamic State controls 93 percent less terrority today than it did at the start of 2015, and 89 percent less since Trump took office. The fight against the Islamic State began two years before Trump became commander in chief, and the radical militant group saw significant territorial losses by the end of 2016. His words link the most recent gains too closely to actions taken during his time in office. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09241	"Ms. Kagan has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway."	true	/texas/statements/2010/may/10/john-cornyn/republicans-say-supreme-court-nominee-elena-kagan-/	Shortly after President Barack Obama nominated Solicitor General Elena Kagan to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court, a number of Republicans lined up to raise questions about her qualifications. Among the most common themes from Republicans was that Kagan has the resume of a legal elitist, tied primarily to academia and inside-the-Capital-Beltway jobs. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, the junior senator from Texas, urged the Senate to thoroughly review Kagan's record — and aired his trepidations about it. "There is no doubt that Ms. Kagan possesses a first-rate intellect, but she is a surprising choice from a president who has emphasized the importance of understanding 'how the world works and how ordinary people live,' " Cornyn said in a May 10, 2010, press release. "Ms. Kagan has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway. These are not places where one learns 'how ordinary people live.' " For the record, Harvard Square refers to Kagan's work at Harvard Law School and Hyde Park is the neighborhood occupied by the University of Chicago, where Kagan once taught. We should note that Obama himself attended law school at Harvard, and his private home is in Chicago's Hyde Park. And his current employment is about as inside the D.C. Beltway as one can get. Putting aside the political argument that working in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway is not a good way to learn how ordinary people live, we decided to check Kagan's resume to find out if Cornyn is correct that the entirety of Kagan's career was spent in these three places. A judiciary committee questionnaire Kagan filled out after Obama nominated her for the solicitor general position in 2009 provides an accounting of her professional career. Working our way back from the present, here's Kagan's employment history (and, in parentheses, where they fit into Cornyn's definition): March 2009-present: U.S. solicitor general (D.C. Beltway) 1999 -2009: professor and dean, Harvard Law School; 2003-2009 as dean; 2001-2009 as professor focusing on constitutional and administrative law; and 1999-2001 as visiting professor (Harvard Square) 1997-1999: deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton for domestic policy (D.C. Beltway) 1995-1996: associate counsel to President Clinton (D.C. Beltway) 1991-1994: assistant professor at University of Chicago Law School, primarily teaching constitutional law (Hyde Park) Summer 1993: special counsel, Senate Judiciary Committee, working on the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court (D.C. Beltway) 1989-1991: associate at Williams & Connolly in Washington, D.C., doing mix of commercial, First Amendment and white-collar criminal law (D.C. Beltway) 1988: staff member, Dukakis for President campaign, Boston, mostly preparing responses to attacks on Gov. Dukakis' record. 1987-1988: judicial clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall (D.C. Beltway) 1986-1987: judicial clerk for Judge Abner Mikva, U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. (D.C. Beltway) Summer 1986: research assistant for Professor Laurence Tribe at Harvard Law School (Harvard Square) Summer 1985: summer associate for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York City Summer 1984: summer associate at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson in New York City Summer 1983: paralegal at Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy in New York City Some may quibble that when Kagan worked as a staff member on the Dukakis campaign in 1988, the campaign headquarters was in Boston, not nearby Harvard Square (though one could argue that working on a presidential campaign is by definition D.C. Beltway-related) or that she worked for three summers during graduate school at New York City law firms. And White House officials argue Kagan's roots as the granddaughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, the daughter of a public school teacher and a tenant lawyer, and her career as an accomplished lawyer and well-regarded teacher solidify her "ordinary people" cred. Asked about this issue, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs cited Kagan's "diversity of experience" and noted that as solicitor general, Kagan "represents the American people before the Supreme Court." But it's fair to say that Kagan has spent the bulk of her professional career in academia at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School, and at various positions inside the Beltway. Again, whether that puts Kagan out of touch with "how ordinary people live," is a political discussion. But Cornyn's claim that Kagan "has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway" is True.

pomt-13547	On job creation numbers in the latest Start-Up NY report: "This is a significant number of overcounts in the compilation that I’ve looked at."	false	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/26/robin-schimminger/explaining-startup-ny-report/	Assemblyman Robin Schimminger, D-Kenmore, said state officials reported an incorrect number of jobs created by companies participating in Start-Up NY, one of the state’s economic development programs. A report released in July says the program created 408 jobs in its first two years, 2014 and 2015. Schimminger, who chairs the Assembly’s Economic Development Committee, said at a hearing earlier this month that Empire State Development Corp. inflated its claim of 319 jobs in 2015 by as many as 80 positions. The report puzzled Schimminger and other lawmakers because it showed more net new jobs for the companies than the number of jobs the companies said they created. "I could not figure out how that could be, until I came to the conclusion that very possibly the companies were reporting a two-year amount, the 2014 and 2015 net new jobs created and including them in their submission to the agency," Schimminger said at the hearing. "The agency then simply took that number, tallied it and reached what should be the correct tally number to include in the report. However, they were the wrong numbers from the companies. So I would submit this is not the difference of a dozen or so, this is a significant number of overcounts in the compilation that I’ve looked at." Howard Zemsky, head of the Empire State Development Corp., defended Start-Up NY before the Assembly panel. "I don’t acknowledge that there are any inaccurate numbers," Zemsky replied. Who’s right? We took a closer look. Did the Start-Up NY report inflate job claims by double counting many of the jobs? What’s a net new job? Start-Up NY offers businesses tax relief for 10 years when they locate or expand on or near a participating college campus. The state must publish an annual report on the program’s progress. This year’s report was tucked inside an omnibus report of other state incentive programs called the Business Incentives Report. The section on Start-Up NY takes less than three pages. Last year’s report was a 14-page document. This year’s report offers little guidance on how to interpret the information in the report other than a few footnotes and a set of unidentified appendices. Understanding the report requires knowing the state’s definition of a ‘net new job.’ It’s not just any job created during the year. It must be a job that did not exist before the company joined the program. It has to be full time. It has to be filled for more than six months. Empire State Development counted 319 net new jobs in the report. A separate part of the report shows jobs created at any point during the calendar year. No six-month requirement applies to this count. That means any job filled in the second half of 2015 was counted in this number - but not included in the net new job count because it did not reach the six month mark by the end of the year. By that way of counting, the state reported 332 jobs created in 2015. Counting the jobs So the 319 net new jobs in the report are jobs filled at any point during the 2014 calendar year or in the first half of 2015. The 332 jobs created are new, full-time positions companies reported creating during the entire 2015 calendar year. We reached out to Liazon Corp., which expanded in Buffalo under Start-Up NY. Liazon confirmed this is its explanation for why it reported more net new jobs than jobs created in 2015. Our ruling Schimminger said at an economic development hearing in Albany that Empire State Development reported "wrong numbers from the companies" in Start-Up NY. So the report included "a significant number of overcounts in the compilation," he said. Empire State Development did not provide guidance on how to read the report, so anyone not privy to state definitions of certain terms may have come to the same conclusion as the assembly member. Schimminger, of course, is not just anyone. Schimminger served as chairman of the Assembly's small business committee from 1985 until 1997, when he was named chairman of the Assembly Standing Committee on Economic Development, Job Creation, Commerce and Industry. A closer look at the law explains how the numbers are reported. We rate Schimminger’s claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/10730ecb-e329-40ec-8370-9bb70ece7310	None	Robin Schimminger	None	None	None	2016-08-26T15:00:11	2016-08-03	['None']

They’ve done a good of marketing it as a "death tax" -- you die and you get taxed. But the reality is, it’s a tax on the ultra-wealthy that the vast majority of people will never, ever, ever see in their life. Last year, two out of every 1,000 people paid an estate tax. So it’s not like a common tax that’s out there. With the overall reform gaining momentum from a Senate vote the day after Pocan’s claim, and a House vote a week later, let’s see if his statistic is correct. Aimed at the rich? There is debate about how the rich are treated by the reform proposal, which at this stage is considered only a framework, since it lacks details. We’ve rated as Mostly False a claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Janesville Republican who represents the congressional district that borders Pocan’s. Ryan said the framework, which he supports, is focused on tax breaks for the middle class "and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break." The framework does offer some benefits for the middle class, but what’s more clear is there are specific provisions benefiting the wealthy. As for what is conventionally known as the estate tax, the Trump administration uses the term "death tax" (as do Ryan and other Republicans) in promoting how the framework would repeal the tax. Trump himself claimed ending the tax would "protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer." But PolitiFact National’s rating was Pants on Fire: Only 5,460 estates even pay the tax each year, with only 80 being small businesses or farms. Pocan’s figure The Internal Revenue Service tells us the estate tax "is a tax on your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death" -- including cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, business interests and other assets. In 2016, the year cited in Pocan’s claim, an unmarried individual’s estate was potentially taxable only if the estate’s value exceeded $5.45 million. (The value had to exceed $10.9 million to be taxable, if there was a surviving spouse.) After deductions, such estates generally are taxed at 40 percent. IRS figures show there were 12,411 estate tax returns filed in 2016 -- but a tax was owed on only 5,219 of them. That smaller figure aligns with what PolitiFact National found. And the non-profit Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center makes a similar estimate for 2017: 5,460 estates owing a tax.) In 2016, those 5,219 estates paid a total estate tax of $18.3 billion. Since annual estate tax filings include deaths that occur in previous years, the Tax Policy Center says that each year, there are roughly 5,000 estates that pay the federal estate tax out of roughly 2.6 million deaths each year. That comes to 2 of every 1,000. Point of view on the tax While he doesn’t dispute the statistics, Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, told us there are other points to consider regarding the estate tax, saying: The estate tax affects far more people than the relatively small number who pay. Many people who own businesses and/or investments have to spend a lot of time and money on lawyers/accountants planning to avoid it. A substantial portion of the life insurance industry exists only to avoid the estate tax. And, indeed, that is an important criticism: it is one of the most inefficient taxes in the sense that the ratio of paperwork/avoidance to tax collections is very high …. The estate tax is anti-saving and anti-investment. It encourages wealthy folks to consume their wealth before death because, if the rate is high, they don’t want the government to grab it. For the rest of us, it would be better if wealthy people kept their money invested in the economy, because that spurs growth. It’s better for us if the wealthy hold large pools of savings rather than going out and buying expensive cars and yachts. A high estate tax rate encourages them to go out and buy expensive cars and yachts, which does nothing for long term economic growth. Our rating Pocan says that what Republicans call the "death tax" is the estate tax "on the ultra wealthy" which, in 2016, was paid by only "two out of every 1,000 people." Republicans who are proposing to eliminate the estate tax do use the "death tax" term. In 2016, the tax, generally 40 percent, applied only to estates worth $5.45 million or more. After deductions, the tax was paid by only about two out of every 1,000 people who died.

pomt-08587	"One of the other inaccuracies ... is that we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget. Absolutely not true. One tax increase since I’ve been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/24/susan-latvala/pinellas-county-commissioner-susan-latvala-says-sh/	Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala has been forced to defend her record on taxes as she tries to fend off attacks from challenger Bob Hackworth, who is looking to unseat her in the Nov. 2 election. At a Dunedin candidates forum on Sept. 14, Latvala contradicted Hackworth directly on her votes for property tax rate increases. "One of the other inaccuracies, and there were many and I’m not going to address all of them, is that we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget. Absolutely not true," Latvala told the crowd. "One tax increase since I’ve been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only." Hackworth has criticized Latvala for voting for tax rate increases when he didn’t as a city commissioner in Dunedin. The county took advantage of rising property values that already were increasing revenue to Pinellas, he said. We wondered: Who is right? Latvala referred to a vote for the 2002-03 budget involving the municipal services taxing unit, which is a property tax paid only by residents who live in unincorporated areas of Pinellas. In August 2002, she was part of 6-1 vote to raise the property tax rate, meeting records show. Discussion at the time focused on increasing revenue to pay for recreation and other services. Latvala misstated the size of the hike. The rate increased a half-mill, not a quarter-mill, from $1.856 per $1,000 of taxable property value to $2.356. At the same meeting in which the County Commission raised the unincorporated property tax rate, it also raised a different tax, a 5.1 percent increase of the telecommunications services tax. And a year earlier, meeting records show that Latvala voted with the majority to increase the property tax rate countywide. It was a small increase, from $6.75 per $1,000 of property to $6.801, but an increase nonetheless. She did vote to raise taxes more than once during her nearly 10 years on the commission. "I goofed," Latvala said, when confronted with the records. So we rate Latvala’s claim as False.	None	Susan Latvala	None	None	None	2010-09-24T20:03:18	2010-09-14	['None']
pomt-03562	A referendum "gives the people the chance to decide" on cutting the Milwaukee County Board budget by two-thirds	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/22/leah-vukmir/state-senator-says-referendum-county-board-broad/	After state Senate approval of a bill to greatly curtail the Milwaukee County Board, Republican backers scoffed at Democratic Party critics who said the legislation trampled on local control. One Milwaukee-area Republican, state Senator Leah Vukmir of Wauwatosa, said the accusation "couldn’t be further from the truth." "This measure is ultimately about local control and gives Milwaukee County taxpayers a choice," a Vukmir news release said May 15, 2013, a day after the 19-14 Senate vote. "We are giving the citizens of the county the voice to say exactly how the county board will operate." Specifically, Vukmir said the bill mandates an April 2014 referendum in which Milwaukee County voters will determine if the County Board’s budget is cut by two-thirds and board supervisors’ pay is cut in half. "If the referendum passes, supervisor pay would be reduced to around $24,000, health insurance and pension benefits would no longer exist and the county board budget would be reduced from $6 million to $2 million," her release said. "The referendum gives the people the chance to decide..." The referendum question on supervisors’ pay was familiar to us, but would voters also get the chance to decide whether the County Board’s budget falls by two thirds? The bill authored by Republican state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo changed as it worked its way from drafting through passage to the desk of Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive who is expected to sign it. But the fundamentals haven’t changed since Sanfelippo unveiled his first draft in January 2013. From the get-go, the West Allis representative wanted voters to decide on trimming Milwaukee County supervisors' pay. The initial proposal was a cut from $50,679 to $15,000 a year. In the bill’s final version, the April 2014 referendum still deals with supervisors’ pay, but the pay cut is smaller -- about 50%, reducing the salary to about $24,000. The precise pay is tied to per-capita income in Milwaukee County. If voters approve the pay cut, supervisors would lose health and pension benefits. But a reading of the final bill shows that county voters will not be asked whether the County Board’s budget should be cut by two-thirds under a budget-capping formula outlined in the bill. There is no referendum on the budget cap, contrary to what Vukmir’s May 15 release stated. That’s been true since Sanfelippo first went public with a draft in mid-January. A Journal Sentinel story on his announcement was headlined: "A $5 million cut to County Board budget won’t go before voters." (The cut initially was larger than in the final bill; it’s now about $4 million). Bottom line: The bulk of the hoped-for $4 million savings annually in the County Board budget would be accomplished if Walker signs the legislation -- without voters weighing in. Similarly, without requiring voters to sign off, the bill requires supervisors to stand for election every two years instead of every four, and scales back the board’s role in contracts, land sales and labor negotiations, as the Journal Sentinel reported. Vukmir aide Jason Booth blamed confusion about the contents of the bill for the error on the scope of the referendum. Proponents of the bill, including current Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele and top Milwaukee business leaders, say it would restore authority to the county executive’s office and streamline county decision-making. Sanfelippo has claimed his bill puts Milwaukee County Board spending in line with other major counties. We rated that statement Mostly True. Sanfelippo, himself a former Milwaukee County Board member, thinks supervisors should be part-time citizen legislators starting in 2016. But others see the legislation as an anti-democratic power grab that will put too much power in the executive branch. "With the long history of Milwaukee County Executives abusing their power, this bill is a dangerous step in the wrong direction, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, said upon passage. "Unfortunately, this bill flies in the face of the trust in the people of Milwaukee County and our Democratic system." Our rating Vukmir contended that Milwaukee County voters would decide whether the County Board budget takes a big cut. That’s wrong. A referendum would determine County Board supervisors’ pay, but most of the changes in the bill -- including the County Board’s budget level -- would take effect directly through the legislation, without voter approval in 2014. We rate her claim False.	None	Leah Vukmir	None	None	None	2013-05-22T09:00:00	2013-05-15	['None']
pomt-07740	Says signs posted at projects funded by the federal stimulus act has cost "20 or 40 million" dollars.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/28/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renacci-says-signs-stimulus-projects-cost-/	Signs of economic recovery can be elusive. The Federal Highway Administration tried to help, in its own way, by encouraging road signs at stimulus-funded highway projects that state: "Putting America to Work. Project Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act." As far back as July 2009, Republican legislators and some Democrats criticized the signs as wasteful. Sarah Palin, speaking at a Tea Party convention a year ago, claimed that one state alone -- Ohio -- spent $1 million on stimulus signs. PolitiFact rated that claim as Half True, finding that the figure was a suspect and almost certainly exaggerated estimate. But the issue did not go away. When Rep. Jim Renacci was asked during a recent radio interview where the federal budget could be cut, he said: "I'll give you a small item that I see on the highway every day. It's the signs that say 'This is the recovery act.' I think it was $20 or $40 million in signage." PolitiFact Ohio couldn't help being interested in an estimate with a range of 100 percent. We asked where the 16th District Republican got his figures, and did some looking of our own. The congressman's press secretary, Karin Davenport, cited a figure from Rep. Aaron Schock, an Illinois Republican. He introduced a bill last July requiring agencies to report what they already had spent on signs and prohibiting funding for more. "Reports have stated these signs can cost taxpayers up to $10,000," Schock said, "and my home state of Illinois has spent over $650,000 on these signs. That’s roughly $20 million spent nationwide, without creating one single job." Where did Schock get the number? His communications director, Steve Dutton, told us, "The number comes from several sources of information, including information reported by individual states, independent reporters (some amounts included up to $200 million) and several ranges from the White House. "The White House initially said the cost was around $5 million and then they came back with $10 million, but the accounting for the actual cost is somewhat difficult as the way the stimulus bill was written it didn't require states to have to account for the costs of the signs. Several states did account for the cost, but not all of them did. There was a CNN story on the costs of the signs in Ohio." That put us back where we started. The CNN story, from a year ago, used the $1 million Ohio figure that PolitiFact found suspect and likely exaggerated. The story also said that CNN "found most states are spending stimulus money on signs and that could cost taxpayers nationwide about $3.8 million." House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, supporting Schock's bill, said "no information exists as to how much all of these signs cost taxpayers, but reports indicate that potentially tens of millions of dollars have been spent." Schock sits on the House Subcommittee on Oversight. The full committee's ranking Republican and chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, last year called the stimulus signs "propaganda" and made them a particular target. Last June, he asked the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to investigate the total cost of recovery act signs in six agencies: the Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency and General Services Administration. The six agencies reported spending about $9 million total on signs, though they relied on only a sampling of projects for their estimates. The Department of Transportation spent the most, $8,154,000. The reported per-sign cost ranged from "negligible" (adding a recovery act logo to a sign that would have been posted anyway) to $1,950. "I can't remember this issue coming up since then," the communications director for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, Edward Pound, told us. "I think that's the extent of it." But Issa complained that the reporting was inadequate. He and Republicans on the oversight committee asked the public to "track down" and photograph "propaganda signs" (which they said cost as much as $20 million), posting them online under the banner "Signs of a failed stimulus." The website says the signs cost "potentially" and "up to" $192 million. No basis is provided for that figure. Calling it a "potential" cost makes it a theoretical high end, not an estimate. Sam Rosen-Amy, a budget and fiscal transparency policy analyst with OMB Watch, said making any estimate would be difficult because signs are not mandated on projects, some signs are used on multiple projects and the per-sign cost varies widely. The recovery board doesn't track the cost of signage. So we end where we started: Whether the signs are useful or wasteful is something for legislators and the public to decide. The $1 million figure for signs in Ohio was suspect a year ago, and it remains a big part of the foundation for later estimates. There’s an element of accuracy in Renacci’s statement. The cost of the signs nationally has run into the millions. But although some huge numbers have been cited, no one was able to document an exact figure. And when agencies putting the signs up were asked to investigate the costs, their estimates tallied up to less than half of Renacci’s figures. That’s an important detail the listener needs to put things in proper context, and on the Truth-O-Meter that means we rate the congressman’s claim as Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04547	Says "you cannot implement Paul Ryan’s plan without allowing for any increases in revenue."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/28/kasim-reed/kasim-reed-says-numbers-dont-work-paul-ryans-budge/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been racking up the frequent-flier miles lately to travel to Washington to advocate for President Barack Obama on the long-running television program "Meet the Press." During Reed’s most recent appearance, the mayor frequently criticized Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The mayor also attempted to carve up GOP running mate Paul Ryan’s proposal to cut the federal budget deficit. "[T]o get a budget deal, we have to have revenue-raising measures. You cannot implement Paul Ryan's plan while not allowing for any increases in revenue," Reed, a Democrat, said on the program Sunday. We wondered whether Reed is right. Can cuts be made to levels that Ryan has proposed without raising taxes or finding other ways to increase revenue? Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has made several proposals to curb federal spending and maintain the viability of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Ryan has said his budget could cut the deficit by as much as $5 trillion over 10 years. The mayor’s office said Reed disagrees with Ryan’s plan from a policy perspective and he doesn’t believe it will pass in Congress. Reed and nearly 150 mayors across America signed a letter dated Sept. 21 that was written to congressional leaders in both parties urging them to pass legislation as soon as possible with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases to address the nation’s budget deficit. Romney campaign officials responded to our request for comment about the Ryan plan. Romney has said he agrees with much of what Ryan has proposed, with a few tweaks. The campaign forwarded us several studies that support Romney’s argument that his plan can be done with no tax increases. "The Romney-Ryan plan would lower rates for all taxpayers while eliminating loopholes and carve-outs in the tax code," Romney spokesman Brendan Buck said. "This will bring in additional revenue through economic growth, rather than tax hikes as the president has proposed." The Romney camp pointed us to an article by Martin Feldstein, former head of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Ronald Reagan, to bolster its argument. Feldstein wrote in The Wall Street Journal in August that "it is feasible to combine tax cuts and base broadening as Gov. Romney suggests without raising the budget deficit or imposing any middle-class tax increase." David Stockman, who was a director of the Office of Management and Budget under Reagan, said the Ryan plan does not go deep enough on the spending side and does not offer enough detail about how it would broaden the tax base. "In short, Mr. Ryan’s plan is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices," Stockman wrote in The New York Times. The latest version of the Ryan plan, written March 20, would repeal the federal health care law, cut the federal workforce by 10 percent by 2015, convert the federal share of Medicaid spending into block grants, allow more private-sector competition for Medicare coverage in an effort to lower costs and employ other cost-cutting measures. To grow the economy, Ryan has proposed cutting tax rates (to 10 percent and 25 percent) and reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent to encourage investment and discretionary spending. Ryan says his plan, titled Path to Prosperity, would cut the deficit by $5 trillion over the next 10 years and balance the budget by 2050. The national debt is currently $16 trillion. Ryan says federal revenue would nearly double in 10 years, from $2.44 trillion to $4.6 trillion. Obama’s plan calls for a mix of less-intensive spending cuts and a tax increase on the wealthiest earners. Ryan mentions closing tax loopholes in his plan, but there are few specifics. Ryan has said in interviews that a Romney administration would have an open debate with Congress about loopholes. "Now the question is not necessarily what loopholes go, but who gets them?" Ryan said during an ABC News interview. "High-income earners use most of the loopholes. That means they can shelter their income from taxation." The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews fiscal plans for Congress, has examined the Ryan plan. The federal government would collect less revenue under the plan than under its baseline projections. The government, though, would spend less under the plan. The deficit would be slightly less under the plan, the CBO concluded. Still, the CBO said in a March 2012 report that projections for revenue are "highly uncertain" for many reasons. The federal Congressional Research Service published a study in September that examined whether there has been a cause and effect between lowering tax rates and economic growth. The study began by looking at tax rates since 1945 because most American families did not file a tax return before World War II. It concluded "that changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth." Reed’s office says Ryan’s plan is not feasible, citing CBO research and criticism by New York Times columnists David Brooks, a conservative, and Paul Krugman, a liberal and Nobel Prize-winning economics professor who called it "absurd" because of how it would reduce discretionary spending. "Ryan’s plan envisions cutting $6 trillion from federal spending over the next 10 years, but it would eliminate or slash so many programs that the federal government would be unrecognizable," the mayor’s office told us via email. Diane Lim Rogers, chief economist of the Virginia-based Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization created in the 1990s to alert the public about the federal deficit, said the Ryan plan lacks specifics. She cited the CRS report, saying "tax cuts are not a reliable way to raise revenue." To sum up, the mayor said, "You cannot implement Paul Ryan’s plan without allowing for any increases in revenue." Reed’s argument is strengthened by some of the nonpartisan historical research on tax cuts and its impact on the economy, as well as Ryan’s statements that he would propose ending some loopholes, which is another form of increasing revenue. But even critics of Ryan’s plan say there is a path to the deficit reduction the congressman has proposed, though Reed and others may not like cuts that would be required to line up with the revenue projections. PolitiFact Georgia thought long and hard about this one. In the end, we rate the mayor’s statement Half True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2012-09-28T06:00:00	2012-09-23	['None']

pomt-11243	"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Planet."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/03/blog-posting/no-bill-gates-did-not-outline-2018-plan-depopulate/	Bill Gates is not attempting to depopulate the planet, contrary to a false claim on a website called Mysterious Times. "Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Planet," said an April 30 post on mysterious-times.com, filed under its "Conspiracy" category. The post’s supposed evidence includes efforts by Gates and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to research, develop and deliver vaccines to help reduce child mortality. It claimed Gates "has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that ‘by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.’" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. "Make no mistake, when Gates talks about ‘making people healthier,’ what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory rollout of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents," the post said. It also claimed that vaccinations promoted in India by the Gates Foundation "were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls" and that it conducted experimental vaccine trials. But PunditFact in December 2016 debunked a post on an anti-vaccine blog claiming Gates used "30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer" and that vaccination efforts led to deaths. That Pants on Fire post was a mash-up of outdated, disproven rumors. Mysterious Times doesn’t offer many details about its website, but the About section of its Facebook page says: "Aliens UFOs, Conspiracy and Weird Stuff." Gates does not seek to "depopulate" the planet, but believes saving children’s lives can help reduce population growth. When children survive, families decide to have fewer children and that "can lead to a burst of economic growth that economists call ‘the demographic dividend,’ " Gates said in the 2018 edition of the annual letter he co-writes with his wife, Melinda. "When more children live, you get one generation that’s relatively big. Then, when families decide to have fewer children, the next generation is much smaller. Eventually, a country ends up with relatively more people in the labor force producing economically—and relatively fewer dependents (very old or very young people)," Bill Gates said in the 2018 letter. "That’s a recipe for rapid economic development, especially if countries take advantage of it by investing in health and education." We rate Mysterious Times’ post Pants on Fire!

pomt-04968	The state of Georgia has lost 200,000 total jobs and 50,000 construction jobs since May 2007.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/25/kasim-reed/The-mayor-gets-the-numbers-right-on-jobs-lost/	For the past two years, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been one of the most vocal advocates in support of a regional sales tax to pay for more than 150 transportation projects he and proponents say will ease congestion in the region. Supporters also say the 1 percent tax would jolt the region’s economy by creating jobs for people working on those transportation projects. An earlier claim by tax proponents said that the plan will "create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs." PolitiFact found that number gave an inflated impression of the plan's impact, and the jobs-creation claim earned a Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter. Critics say the tax will benefit construction companies and the well-connected, but do little to untangle the region’s transportation gridlock. Reed’s statement concerned only the number of jobs lost in the economic downturn. The mayor was very vocal about the need for more jobs during a news conference at City Hall to announce the Atlanta Business League’s support for the July 31 referendum. The sales tax could raise $8.5 billion over 10 years, after inflation. "The city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia, we’ve lost 200,000 jobs since the year 2007," Reed began. "We’ve lost 50,000 construction jobs since the year 2007." We wanted to know if hizzoner has potential as a labor economist. Or are the mayor’s numbers incorrect? PolitiFact Georgia went to the most commonly used and dependable source of labor data, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For our purposes, we focused on state employment figures. First, the overall employment numbers. In May 2012, the most recent monthly BLS data available, an estimated 3,930,000 Georgians were employed. In May 2007, the number of Georgians employed 4,139,000, the federal data shows. The difference is 209,000 people. So far, so good for the mayor. Now, what about the construction data? In May 2007, the BLS said about 222,700 Georgians were employed in the construction industry. In May 2012, the number dropped to an estimated 141,300 Georgians. The difference: 81,400. That’s actually more people who’ve lost their jobs in construction than Reed said at the City Hall event. Real estate has long been a bedrock industry in metro Atlanta with the region’s rapid population growth in recent decades. The Great Recession hurt the real estate industry tremendously. Construction levels dropped nearly 80 percent between 2006 -- its peak year -- and 2010, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2011. The federal data shows construction employment declined each month between August 2007 and September 2010. Employment rose for a few months in early 2011, but has largely declined since. As for the overall employment numbers, the decline since 2007 also has been largely blamed on the recession. The number of Georgians employed has increased by about 92,000 since May 2010, the BLS numbers show. Reed’s overall point is that the region could use the jobs that might be created by these transportation projects. And it is uncertain how many jobs the projects would create. But the jobs-loss numbers Reed used to back up his argument were correct for the number of total jobs lost since 2007. Reed actually underestimated the total of jobs lost since 2007 in the construction industry. Overall, we rate his statement as True.

pomt-06169	"After the debate that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything I said was true."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/15/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-politifact-came-out-and-said/	During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Rep. Michele Bachmann made a claim that jolted us out of our seats. "After the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true," she said. It came during an exchange between Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Bachmann was attacking Gingrich’s work after he left Congress. He has said he was a paid consultant, but critics such as Bachmann contend he was really a lobbyist. Gingrich defended his work on behalf of the government-sponsored mortgage-bundling giant Freddie Mac, arguing that government does not necessarily taint whatever enterprise it touches. He added, "I did no lobbying of any kind for any organization. That was a key part of every agreement we had." Challenged by moderator Chris Wallace for hard evidence, Bachmann said that "we know that (Gingrich) cashed paychecks from Freddie Mac. That’s the best evidence that you can have. Over $1.6 million. … The speaker had his hand out and he was taking $1.6 million to influence senior Republicans to keep the scam going in Washington, D.C. That’s absolutely wrong. We can’t have as our nominee for the Republican party someone who continues to stand for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They need to be shut down, not built up." Gingrich responded, "Well, the easiest answer is, that's just not true. What she just said is factually not true. I never lobbied under any circumstance. I never went in and suggested in any way that we do this. In fact, I tried to help defeat the housing act when the Democrats were in charge of the House. And if you go back and talk to former Congressman Rick Lazio, he'll tell you, when we were passing housing reform while I was speaker, I never at any time tried to slow down the reform effort. In fact, I helped him pass the reform bill. And I think some of those people ought to have facts before they make wild allegations." At that point, Bachmann jumped back in. "Well, after the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true. And the evidence is that Speaker Gingrich took $1.6 million. You don't need to be within the technical definition of being a lobbyist to still be influence-peddling with senior Republicans in Washington, D.C., to get them to do your bidding." Wait... what? We said that "everything" Bachmann had said was true? Actually, that's not what we said. At the Dec. 10 debate she was referring to, PolitiFact checked two claims from Bachmann and rated them Mostly True and Pants on Fire. The fact-check she may have been referencing was, "In 1993, Newt Gingrich ‘first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating’ for it." We rated that one a Mostly True. But we also rated her claim that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, "put into place socialized medicine." We found that was ridiculously false and rated it Pants on Fire. Her comment about our ratings was also a bit of a non-sequitur. Neither of the two items we checked addressed the subject at hand -- Gingrich’s work for Freddie Mac, what he thinks of Freddie Mac today, or whether Gingrich was ever a lobbyist. Maybe Bachmann was simply trying to burnish her image as a truth teller. However, using PolitiFact to back up that assertion is a bit unusual. Her PolitiFact report card shows 59 percent of her statements rated have earned either a False or Pants on Fire. She has earned five Trues, three Mostly Trues, six Half Trues, seven Mostly Falses, 19 Falses and 11 Pants on Fires. Our ruling During the Sioux City debate, Bachmann said that "after the debate that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything I said was true." That’s simply not the case. We rated two statements by Bachmann from that debate and ruled one of them Mostly True and the other one Pants on Fire. So for claiming she had a perfect record, she earns another Pants on Fire.

pomt-02170	Welcome to Wisconsin road signs have "always been made in Wisconsin," but Scott Walker "is outsourcing them" to an out-of-state company and "paying more money for them."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/30/mike-tate/scott-walker-outsourced-making-welcome-wisconsin-r/	Two weeks after taking office in January 2011, Gov. Scott Walker augmented the familiar Wisconsin-shaped signs at the state’s borders that say: "Wisconsin Welcomes You." Employing his campaign theme, Walker attached small horizontal signs that read, "Open for Business." The state paid a suburban Milwaukee company $1,495 to make the attachments to the 10-feet-tall and 11-feet-wide brown signs. Three years later, on April 18, 2014, the signs were raised by Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate, who appeared on a Madison-area radio station to comment on Walker's re-election announcement. Tate criticized the Republican's record on creating jobs, then ridiculed him. "The signs on our border that say 'Welcome to Wisconsin' -- they've always been made in Wisconsin," Tate told liberal talk show host John "Sly" Sylvester. "But now Scott Walker's DOA (Department of Administration) is outsourcing them -- I think to a company in Illinois, of all places -- and they're paying more money for them." Really? A governor who is almost certain to break his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term decides to have an out-of-state company make "Welcome to Wisconsin" signs -- at a higher price to the state? As we’ll see, Tate's statement from the beginning goes down the wrong road. Which signs? When we asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff for evidence to back Tate's claim, she said Tate "may have erred" on the type of highway sign he singled out. Indeed, Tate is simply wrong in referring to the "Wisconsin Welcomes You" signs -- those 23 signs are not being replaced. Rather, Baldauff provided a few news articles about the state Department of Transportation deciding to change vendors on a contract for maintenance of a different type of sign -- the ubiquitous and much smaller blue signs near highway and freeway exits throughout the state that alert motorists to gas stations, restaurants and other businesses. Those signs typically carry the businesses’ logos. According to the DOT, the Legislature created the so-called specific information signs program in 1990 to promote certain types of businesses within five miles of a highway. The program is designed to be self-funded -- in other words, the businesses, not taxpayers, pay the cost of building and maintaining the blue signs. That's an important point. Not only was Tate wrong in saying Walker was "outsourcing" the construction of the brown "Wisconsin Welcomes You" signs, he was wrong in suggesting that the outsourcing -- which actually refers to the maintenance of the blue roadway signs that promote businesses -- is being done at a higher cost to taxpayers. Here’s what led up to Tate’s claim: The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in February 2014 that after 28 years of Milwaukee-based Derse-Wisconsin Highway Business Signs holding the blue signs contract, DOT had decided to give its next contract to Georgia-based Interstate Logos. DOT said Interstate Logos, which is subcontracting with a Portage, Wis., firm for part of the work, scored higher in the bid process that had been set up and would provide better signs and better service. As for the costs to businesses, Derse had proposed to charge $21 a month for signs along the interstate -- a reduction from the $30 it had charged for years -- and the same $10 a month it had been charging for signs along exit ramps. Meanwhile, Interstate Logos proposed charging $46 per month for signs on the interstate, but no additional charge for signs on ramps. After DOT decided to give the contract to Interstate Logos, however, the company agreed to use $30 and $10 fees that Derse had been using. A 10-year contract was put in place to start May 1, 2014. So, businesses aren’t facing a higher price under the new contract. And none of that is paid by taxpayers. Our rating Criticizing Walker’s record on job creation, Tate said Welcome to Wisconsin road signs have "always been made in Wisconsin," but Walker "is outsourcing them" to an out-of-state company and "paying more money for them." No changes are being made to the large "Wisconsin Welcomes You" signs near the state’s borders. The state did give a sign maintenance contract to a Georgia firm, but businesses -- not state taxpayers -- pay for those small roadway signs and the prices in the contract are not increasing. We rate Tate’s statement False. Comment on this item at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Mike Tate	None	None	None	2014-04-30T05:00:00	2014-04-18	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
pomt-03311	The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is "collecting financial information, monitoring financial information of millions of Americans" without their knowledge and "storing it for up to 10 years."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/29/sean-duffy/us-agency-monitoring-millions-americans-financial-/	Seizing on revelations that the National Security Agency has been scooping up the phone and Internet communications of ordinary Americans, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., is sounding new alarms about citizen surveillance by another, relatively new government agency. In a July 17, 2013 interview on "Opinion Journal," a Wall Street Journal online show, he invoked the National Security Agency in making his attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "The CFPB is collecting financial information, monitoring financial information, of millions of Americans, and they have no clue that it’s going on. It’s again this NSA push of having more information on more Americans," Duffy said. He added: "We know in politics, oftentimes people will sample data, to see what the president’s approval rating is or disapproval rating is. The CFPB could do the same thing to find out information about financial transactions. But instead of sampling data, they’re actually collecting it and storing it for up to 10 years. This is absolutely crazy." So, Duffy’s claim is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collects and monitors financial information of millions of Americans, without their knowledge, and stores it for up to 10 years -- the implication being that bureau is keeping data on individuals’ personal accounts. Let's do some information gathering of our own. What CFPB does The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which launched in July 2011, is charged with protecting consumers from abusive practices in financial services and regulating the terms of mortgages, student loans, credit cards and other transactions. "We gather and analyze available information to better understand consumers, financial services providers and consumer financial markets," the bureau says. For example, a bureau report in June 2013 found that overdraft penalties represent well over half of banks' fees from consumer checking accounts, The law creating the bureau prohibits it from collecting data "for purposes of gathering or analyzing the personally identifiable financial information of consumers." But that doesn’t personally identifiable information isn’t being collected. A disclosure Suspicion about the bureau’s work ratcheted up in April 2013 when Bloomberg News reported it was demanding records from banks and was buying anonymous information about at least 10 million consumers from various companies. The article said the bureau was paying the Experian credit-monitoring company up to $8.4 million to provide data on 5 million to 10 million consumers. The bureau was also buying auto loan information from the company and payday loan data from another credit-reporting company, the article said. Duffy spokeswoman Cassie Smedile also pointed out that the bureau’s April 2013 strategic plan says the bureau will "acquire and maintain a credit card database at the summary and loan levels covering approximately 80 percent of the credit card marketplace." So, the first part of Duffy’s claim is accurate. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is obtaining from third parties financial data involving millions of Americans without any direct notification from the bureau to consumers. But what about the rest of Duffy’s message, which suggests the bureau keeps financial data on actual individuals, monitors it and stores it for up to 10 years? Bureau makes its case A week before Duffy made his claim, the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit held a hearing specifically to examine how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collects and uses consumer data. Duffy is a member of the committee. The bureau’s acting deputy director, Stephen Antonakes, testified that the bureau’s data collection on individuals is very limited. The bureau collects personally identifiable information only when consumers are seeking help with a complaint against a business, he said, or when "we're using our supervisory tool, conducting examinations of the banks, the credit unions and the nonbanks under our jurisdiction." When Duffy asked about news indicating the bureau was buying information about at least 10 million consumers, Antonakes replied: "Congressman, we're not monitoring any individual American. We're collecting broad data on markets to understand how varied markets work." At the same time, Antonakes said he didn’t know how many millions of Americans were involved in the data the bureau has collected. And he said the bureau needs years’ worth of complete data, not a sampling of data like pollsters might use, to do its work. Duffy’s evidence We asked Duffy’s spokeswoman for evidence that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was monitoring data on individual Americans and storing it for up to 10 years. She cited a July 2013 lawsuit filed against the bureau by a firm that says it is fighting the bureau’s demand for "thousands of personally identifiable" financial documents of individuals considering bankruptcy. The documents contain data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, amount of debt owed and creditor information, the firm alleges in a news release in which Duffy is quoted. Duffy’s spokeswoman also cited a contract -- revealed by the Judicial Watch conservative group, which litigates on public corruption and other issues -- that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has with a firm to store and analyze credit card information. The firm can get access to "non-public confidential information and personally identifiable information," the contract says, although the firm is barred from disclosing any of the data to any third party without permission from the bureau. The contract also states that "most if not all" of the data the firm will handle will be "confidential supervisory information," but that some records will contain sensitive, personally identifiable information. Judicial Watch has published documents from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau showing the bureau wants to track the financial records of 5 million Americans. The bureau acknowledged the program and said all data collected is "anonymized," according to a U.S. News & World Report article. Other evidence We put Duffy’s claim to Bradley Jansen, director of the Center for Financial Privacy and Human Rights in Washington, D.C., which says it defends privacy, civil liberties and market economics, and Florida attorney Justin Angelo, who represents banks and other businesses that are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They agreed the bureau has collected and is monitoring financial data involving millions of Americans, but that’s not the same as monitoring the financial activity of individuals. They also agreed it’s likely the bureau cannot collect all of the data it does without obtaining personally identifiable information in the process, even if the data is not being collected for that reason. How the bureau is collecting data and safeguarding it will be the focus of a government audit. On July 12, 2013, three days after the House subcommittee hearing on the bureau’s data collection practices, the U.S. Government Accountability Office agreed to review the bureau’s collection and analysis of credit records. U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who requested the review, says some of the bureau’s contracts with third-party data collectors would enable the bureau to monitor an individual consumer’s financial activity on a monthly basis. But Crapo has also said the GAO review is needed because it’s unclear what personally identifiable information is being kept by the bureau. He said: "While CFPB officials have stated the CFPB is not collecting personally identifiable information, we do not know what information it collects, on how many accounts, or how this information is being used. We also need to know whether the CFPB is truly not collecting personally identifiable information from the data it is collecting or purchasing." It’s worth noting that when Crapo raised similar concerns two months earlier, bureau director Richard Cordray responded in part by saying that while the bureau is creating a national mortgage database with "loan-level" data, and had bought 10 years of credit data representing 4 percent of Americans, none of that data contains personally identifiable information. Our rating Invoking the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency, Duffy said the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is "collecting financial information, monitoring financial information of millions of Americans" without their knowledge and "storing it for up to 10 years." The implication was that bureau is keeping data on millions of individuals’ personal accounts. The bureau is collecting information, even 10 years’ worth of some data, involving millions of Americans. That’s being done through third parties without consumers’ knowledge But even a critic who has made claims similar to Duffy’s, in asking for a review of the bureau, says he doesn’t know what information the bureau collects and whether it contains personally identifiable information. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Duffy a Half True.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2013-07-29T05:00:00	2013-07-17	['United_States']

pomt-07195	"For every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/08/tom-rooney/rooney-claims-1-spent-disaster-mitigation-saves-4-/	A day after the June 1 start of hurricane season, U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican whose Florida district includes parts of both the east and west coasts, introduced three bills related to insurance premiums or mitigation from hurricanes and other disasters. In a June 2 press release, he summarized the bills. One of them, the National Disaster Mitigation Act, would provide a tax credit up to $5,000 for homeowners who prepare their homes to reduce the risk of damage from hurricanes and other disasters. That mitigation could include roof repairs or adding shutters, for example. "Mitigation must be a priority," Rooney wrote. "Too many families and homes remain unnecessarily vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes. While mitigation will never eliminate the risk to homeowners, it could reduce loss and, in many cases, save a family’s home. For every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved. These tax credits would provide an important incentive for families to proactively protect their homes from natural disasters." For this Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to check if Rooney's figure was correct: For every $1 spent on mitigation, is $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding saved? We contacted Rooney spokesman Michael Mahaffey to ask for Rooney's source. He told us the claim came from a 2005 study by the National Institute of Building Sciences commissioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The study was conducted by the Multihazard Mitigation Council of NIBS, which aims to improve communication among entities involved in disaster mitigation and provide credible information for public policy. The goal of the study, based on the work of more than 50 national experts, was to "assess the future savings from hazard mitigation activities." The preface of the report gets to the heart of Rooney's claim: "This study shows that money spent on reducing the risk of natural hazards is a sound investment. On average a dollar spent by FEMA on hazard mitigation (actions to reduce disaster losses) provides the nation with about $4 in future benefits." But let's look a little deeper at the study. The purpose of the study was to quantify future savings from mitigation related to losses from earthquake, wind and flood through three major FEMA mitigation programs: Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Project Impact and the Flood Assistance Mitigation Program -- federally-funded programs that help mitigate future disasters after they happen or ahead of time. (The hazard mitigation and flood assistance programs still exist while Project Impact has since ended -- although FEMA now has other similar programs. For more about these programs, look at FEMA's website.) Two types of mitigations were addressed: "project" mitigations such as relocating homes and improving drainage, and "process" mitigations such as policies that reduce risk by developing strong building codes, for example. From page 115 of the full report: "The total benefits of FEMA hazard mitigation benefits between mid-1993 and mid-2003 are $14.0 billion compared with $3.5 billion in costs. This yields an average cost-benefit ratio of 4.0." The study looked at a statistically representative sample of FEMA-funded mitigation grants between 1993 and 2003 and assessed future savings from such mitigation. Benefits were defined as losses avoided, including property damage, business interruption and reduced cost of emergency services. We interviewed three experts involved in the 2005 study: chair Brent Woodworth, who at the time headed up IBM's crisis response team and is current CEO of the L.A. Emergency Preparedness Foundation; Dennis Mileti, senior research scientist at the National Hazard Center in Boulder, Colo.; and Timothy Reinhold, senior vice president of research and chief engineer at the Institute for Business and Home Safety in Tampa. All three said they believe the statistic would still hold true in 2011 -- though it's an average that could vary depending on the type of mitigation project and location. The study focuses on FEMA-funded mitigation. "The study's conclusions are for the nation as a whole and not for individual homeowners," Mileti wrote in an e-mail. "Taking all disaster events into account and all mitigation projects studied into account (some mitigation projects will not experience a disaster and others will), the benefit is 4 to 1 when extrapolated out into the future. Some individuals will reap the benefits (at a greater level than 4 to 1), others will not because they may not have a disaster and the general outcome for the nation as a whole is 4 to 1." In a telephone interview, Mileti explained: "You can't tell a person -- one homeowner in one town who spends thousands on shutters -- that they will end up saving $4 for every $1 they may spend." For starters, after the shutters are added, the house may not get hit with a hurricane. To study all mitigation projects -- including those funded by private companies, individual homeowners, states, counties and cities -- would be "very, very expensive and unrealistic," Mileti said. We ran the 1:4 ratio by hurricane or mitigation experts in Florida, and all of them said they either cite it, agree with it or thought it might even be higher. We checked with Miles Anderson, Florida's chief of mitigation; Chuck Lanza, director of the Broward County Emergency Management Division; Ricardo Alvarez, mitigation consultant based in Miami; and Sheridan "Butch" Truesdale, Senior Mitigation Planner for Palm Beach County. "I think it's that or greater, depending on the type of project or where it is," Anderson said. We also found the statistic cited in an August 2007 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. And when we asked FEMA, we received an unsigned e-mail from the agency's News Desk that the agency still "accepts this statistic." Rooney claimed that "for every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 spent on post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved." Rooney took that claim from a valid national study worked on by dozens of experts. But the ratio referred to FEMA-funded mitigation projects -- not necessarily home upgrades paid for by individual homeowners targeted in Rooney's bill. However, the ratio is widely considered to be an industry standard. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Tom Rooney	None	None	None	2011-06-08T11:23:23	2011-06-02	['None']
pomt-02388	Using a surcharge on the cigarette tax to help pay for a new downtown sports arena "is not feasible under state law."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/13/tom-barrett/mayor-tom-barrett-says-using-cigarette-tax-new-are/	The wheels are turning among Milwaukee’s civic leaders as they try to address the future of the aging BMO Harris Bradley Center. The 25-year-old facility has been described as a "senior citizen" among NBA arenas. There’s a growing sense of urgency. The lease for the Milwaukee Bucks expires in 2017, the NBA is applying pressure, and the team’s owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, is seeking additional investors in the team. Two panels of civic leaders are exploring options for the arena. So we took notice when Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett seemed to rule out one funding option -- an expansion of the cigarette tax -- that has been used in other cities to help pay for new facilities. "I don’t think that’s feasible under state law," the mayor said in a March 3, 2014 interview with Wisconsin Eye. He added: "No one has talked about that at all. I’ve never heard anybody mention that." The two panels -- a large group led by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce that's studying the region's cultural funding needs and a smaller one focused on the Bradley Center -- have just begun their work. In theory, at least, all funding options are still on the table, although some surrounding counties are on record opposing any public funding for a downtown Milwaukee arena. So is Barrett right? Does state law block an expansion of the cigarette tax? When we asked Barrett’s office for backup for his statement, spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said: "Mayor Barrett’s answer was referring to the fact that we can’t have a local cigarette tax because of state law." How it works now The state now levies a tax of $2.52 per pack of cigarettes. The tax has been around since 1939, and has been increased by the Legislature 17 times, most recently in 2009. The tax raised about $587 million in fiscal year 2011-’12, and raised as much as $644 million in fiscal year 2009-’10. (Increasing the tax, as was the case in 2009, often convinces some smokers to smoke less.) Money raised from the tax goes into general state coffers. As it stands now, Wisconsin’s cigarette tax is levied uniformly statewide. There are no local surcharges, and no means for the money to be directed to local projects. That could change, but it would take the approval of the Legislature and governor, said Sean Moran, of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Moran wrote an issue paper about the state’s alcohol and tobacco taxes last year. "There’s really no reason it couldn’t be done," he said. What has been discussed The Public Policy Forum was commissioned to study a variety of funding tools, including the cigarette tax, as part of a report that will be issued March 14, 2014. Forum president Rob Henken said in an interview that the tool was being considered because of the experience in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland. Voters there approved a 30-cent county tax on cigarettes that started in 2006 and gave it a 10-year lifespan. The tax generated about $15.6 million for local arts and culture groups. (Another 4.5 cent tax on cigarettes, part of a "sin tax" enacted in 1990 that also includes taxes on alcohol, is dedicated to funding sports facilities. Voters will decide in May whether or not to extend that tax for 20 years.) A local cigarette tax is also in place in other areas, including Cook County, Ill. Smokers there pay $2 a pack in a county tax; the city of Chicago tacks on another 68 cents. In New York state, the tax is a whopping $4.35, tops in the country. Henken said there were pluses and minuses behind using a cigarette tax for a Bradley Center replacement. On the plus side, of course, are the dollars. The report will say that if a 30-cent cigarette tax -- the same size as Cuyahoga County -- were levied in Milwaukee County, it would generate about $11.7 million a year. Obviously, that’s not enough to pay for a new stadium on its own, but it could factor into a package of revenue tools. The downside includes the argument that such a tax would penalize lower income people, because studies show they tend to smoke in greater numbers than higher income people. Also, the state’s cigarette tax is already high -- we’re No. 8 -- compared with the other 49 states, according to the Fiscal Bureau. The list is topped by New York at $4.35 a pack. Then there’s the "island" issue. Some Milwaukee County smokers would simply go elsewhere to buy their cigarettes and avoid the higher tax. In a meeting in February 2014, members of the task force looking at cultural funding needs -- not just the arena issue -- discussed the various tax options. A Journal Sentinel report on the meeting noted that panel members meeting in small groups "seemed to agree that a property-tax model or a sin tax to generate revenue would not be workable in Milwaukee County." Our rating Barrett said that using a surcharge on the cigarette tax to help pay for a new downtown sports arena "is not feasible under state law." A spokeswoman said meant that the tax wasn’t allowed under state law as it presently exists. But that doesn’t mean that state law can’t be changed. Indeed, state approval is likely going to be needed for any mix of higher taxes that could be used to fund an arena expansion or renovation. In that respect, there is nothing different about the approval required for a cigarette tax increase, a funding option that’s used in other parts of the country. Our definition for Half True is a statement that's partially accurate but leaves out important details. That fits here. Note: An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that the Public Policy Forum was leading a task force studying the area's cultural needs. The organization is only conducting research into the matter.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2014-03-13T05:00:00	2014-03-03	['None']
pomt-05321	Says Gov. Scott Walker said "no to equal pay for equal work for women."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/17/tom-barrett/wisconsin-recall-challenger-tom-barrett-says-gov-s/	We’ve rated statements by three Wisconsin politicians about a law that eliminated the right of discriminated workers to sue in state court -- and none of the three earned better than a Mostly False. Will Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett be added to the list? Barrett, the Democratic challenger to Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election, made his claim in a TV ad released May 10, 2012. In the ad, which makes several attacks on Walker, the narrator claims that Walker says "no to equal pay for equal work for women." On the screen are male and female stick figures; an equals sign with a slash through it sits between them. The words "Associated Press, 4/7/2012" also appear, indicating the ad’s source is a news article. The phrasing and the imagery in the ad suggest Walker opposes equal pay for women who are doing the same jobs as men. Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told us the ad refers to an AP article in the Wisconsin State Journal about several bills signed two days earlier by Walker that Democrats say amounts to a Walker "war on women." The new law repealed a change -- passed in June 2009 when Democrats controlled state government -- that allowed workers to pursue discrimination claims against their employers in state court. Walzak argued that Walker was saying no to equal pay for women because the new law affects women who suffer workplace discrimination, and that Walker did so "at the highest level" that a governor can, by signing a law. He also argued that the old law, by allowing state court suits, deterred employers from discriminating and penalized those that did. The state’s anti-discrimination workplace law, he said, "is only as good as its enforcement." Some employee attorneys contend the new law is a blow to equal pay because it takes away the option of a state lawsuit, which they say is easier and less expensive than one filed in federal court. Moreover, most but not all workplace discrimination claims can be filed in federal court. In the nearly three years the old law was in effect, however, no state lawsuits were filed. We cited that when we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that the law was a "gravy train" for lawyers. We also pointed out -- in rating False a claim by former Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk that women "can’t do something" about pay discrimination -- that a federal suit for damages is an option for most discriminated workers; and that all workers claiming discrimination can seek "make whole" remedies, such as back pay, through a state or federal agency. And we rated Mostly False a statement by state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, that the old law ensured women would not be paid less than men. Now it’s Barrett’s turn. Our rating Barrett said Walker says "no to equal pay for equal work for women," suggesting Walker doesn’t want women to be paid the same as men for doing the same job, or that he has taken steps to ensure unequal pay. Walker signed a law that removes one of the legal avenues women had to fight discrimination in pay. But such discrimination remains illegal and women who believe they are paid less because of their gender still have three options for pursuing their claims. We rate Barrett’s claim False.

pomt-00844	State lawmakers are spending taxpayer money for parking that billionaire Arthur Blank could build while paying some state employees so little they are on food stamps.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/23/tyrone-brooks/brooks-lacks-data-back-food-stamp-claim/	Georgia taxpayers are already on the hook for $17 million for parking improvements for the new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and that cost is expected to grow to $30 million with passage of this year’s state budget. But not everyone agrees that parking for Falcons fans should be a state budget priority when Arthur Blank, the billionaire owner of the Falcons, could pay for the improvements himself. "Our priorities are so mixed up," veteran state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, D-Atlanta, said in an interview Jan. 20. "We have state employees on food stamps who have to work two or three jobs to make ends meet." Could Brooks be right? Is the state paying millions for parking while some employees earn so little that they qualify for food stamps? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. But first a little background about the parking. Officials had long promised that the state wouldn’t have to chip in for the $1.4 billion stadium, which will be adjacent to the Georgia World Congress Center. Then suddenly last year there was a push for $17 million for the first phase of a plan to add 1,000 parking spaces, helping to offset 1,300 lost in the football stadium’s construction. World Congress Center officials didn’t formally ask for the money until the final days of the legislative session, so it saw virtually no debate among lawmakers. Most didn’t find out about it until after the final budget deal had already been struck. Gov. Nathan Deal said he was only swayed to support the project by a broader argument that it also could be used for conventions, the College Football Hall of Fame and a hotel that is envisioned for the site. This year, World Congress Center officials were more open about a request for an additional $23 million to complete the parking deck, which they aggressively cast as an economic development tool and the first phase of a broader vision for the complex. The House and Senate have signed off on budget proposals that include the $23 million, although a conference committee report settling differences in their two versions of the budget still has to be negotiated, approved and signed by the governor. But what about Brooks’ claim? As we do with all fact checks, we contacted Brooks and asked for his evidence. When we first reached out to him, he was traveling. But Brooks told us there was a report that backed up his statement. He gave us the name of one legislative colleague and two private organizations, one or more of which he said could provide us with the report. We reached out to all three, but we found no such report. We circled back to Brooks, but he did not offer any information to support his claim. The state doesn’t keep data that we could find on how many of its workers are on food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. SNAP is available to people in Georgia with a gross household income that does not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level, $1,265 a month ($15,180 a year) for one person and $2,584 a month ($31,008 a year) for a family of four. Given those thresholds, it’s more than plausible that there are state workers who are teetering near that line and could obtain food stamps. The left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute identified one of the cleanest examples last year in a report headlined "Teaching pre-k children shouldn’t require a vow of poverty." The report pointed out that a pre-k assistant teacher makes $13,300 a year. We found other examples, including at the state Department of Corrections and even in the food stamp program itself, where an entry-level case worker makes $24,322. "Given many of our employees are single parents earning entry-level salaries, there's no question we have a percentage of staff who turn to SNAP benefits to support their family" said Susan Boatwright, spokeswoman for the state Division of Family and Children Services. Last year, a state audit showed the starting pay for a state corrections officer was $24,322, lower than in any bordering state except South Carolina. Based on SNAP criteria, an assistant pre-k teacher who is single could qualify for food stamps and so could a starting corrections officer who is married and the sole support for a wife and two children. With more than 100,000 people in the state government’s employment, there’s likely no doubt at least some would be part of the 840,815 households -- including about 92,000 in Fulton County and 72,000 in DeKalb County -- that received food stamps in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Our conclusion: It’s legitimate to question the use of taxpayer money for a project driven largely by a push for a new football stadium. And that debate will likely continue. But Brooks questioned whether a parking deck should be a state priority when there are state employees on food stamps and working two jobs. We found anecdotal evidence to suggest he could be right. But he did not produce evidence to back up his claim. Therefore, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Tyrone Brooks	None	None	None	2015-03-23T00:00:00	2015-01-20	['Arthur_Blank']
pomt-14267	"Because of (the 1994 crime bill), we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this, because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/08/bill-clinton/fact-checking-bill-clintons-philly-defense-his-con/	Bill Clinton’s now-controversial 1994 crime bill was at the center of a clash Thursday between the former president and protesters in Philadelphia in which Clinton defended the bill, saying it was the reason behind huge drops in crime rates by the end of his presidency. "Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this," Clinton responded Thursday, "because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence. And how do you think those lives were, that mattered? Whose lives were saved, that mattered?" But can the decreases in crime since the late 1980s really be attributed to Clinton’s signature legislation? Here’s what we found. During Bill Clinton’s campaign stop for his wife in Philadelphia on April 7, a protester with the Philadelphia Coalition for Real Justice yelled questions at the former president while another held a sign that read "Clinton crime bill destroyed our community." The protester, later identified as Erica Mines, criticized the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that provided for higher federal funding for prison facilities that some say ushered in mass incarceration in America. The former president continued defending the bill, asking the protesters whether they were really defending criminals. "I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the street to murder other African American children," he told the protesters. "Maybe you thought they were good citizens — [Hillary Clinton] didn’t." At a campaign stop the next day in Erie, Pa., Bill Clinton issued an apology of sorts, saying he "rather vigorously defended" his wife. "I did something yesterday in Philadelphia," he said, according to MSNBC. "I almost want to apologize for it, but I want to use it as an example of the danger threatening our country." In addition to prison funding, the crime bill also expanded the use of the death penalty, provided states with incentives to implement harsher sentences on criminals and established the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which provided grants to fund up to 75 percent of new police hires for three years. As Bill Clinton said, the crime rate at the end of his presidency was the lowest in two decades and statistics published in a 2000 report on homicide trends from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show the murder rate had "declined to levels last seen in the late 1960s." But experts say the decline in crime during Clinton’s time in the White House can’t all be attributed to the 1994 crime bill. Crime rates nationally began to drop just before the passage of the crime bill, in 1992. Multiple academic reports on the topic begin with 1991 to trace when recorded incidents began to slip. There are several factors, researchers find, that could have caused this fall in crime. In fact, researchers don’t entirely agree on which factors had the greatest impact. Our analysis can find this consensus: the drop cannot be solely attributed to the crime bill, and the size of the crime bill’s contribution, while arguable, may not be higher than a third, according to more favorable analyses, if not marginal overall, per more conservative accounts. For starters, here are some other debated but commonly acknowledged factors. Through 1991 to 1993, the ‘90s boom began, creating more job opportunities in the low-wage sector. The impact of the the crack epidemic entering its death knell has also been cited. The crime bill created 100,000 new jobs for cops, but the number of police officers in the U.S. rose by 50,000 to 60,000 per capita over the decade, a 14 percent increase. By the end of Clinton’s time in the White House, the number of incarcerated Americans rose by nearly 60 percent, according to figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. A 2015 study by NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice found that "increased incarceration at today’s levels has a negligible crime control benefit." According to the researchers, increased incarceration accounted for about 6 percent of the drop in property crime in the 1990s and had little impact on nationwide decreases in violent crime. Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, said the crime bill’s investment in local police forces did contribute to a decrease in crime rates, but mass incarceration played a smaller role in driving decreases in crime. She suggested the the drops could also be attributed to improved technology in policing techniques and changes in social and economic factors like an aging population and a decrease in alcohol consumption. Other studies also suggest mass incarceration leads to "diminishing returns," meaning the practice may have had a larger impact on decreasing crime rates when it was first implemented, but those results slowly decrease over time. A 2014 study from the Hamilton Project, an offshoot of the Brookings Institution, called mass incarceration and crime control "a classic case of diminishing marginal returns." Marc Lamont Hill, a political commentator and professor of African American studies at Morehouse College, told CNN Thursday "there's absolutely no empirical evidence to suggest that crime bill was the causal factor that made crime go down." "You can cherry pick anecdotes, a bunch of anecdotes together and it doesn't make it data," Hill said. "The data does not bear out." Hillary Clinton has somewhat separated herself from her husband’s legislation. "It's time to change our approach," she said during a talk on criminal justice last year. "It's time to end the era of mass incarceration. We need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe." Bill Clinton’s defense of the crime bill comes less than a year after he appeared at a national convention for the NAACP when he issued a mea culpa of sorts over his own bill. "I signed a bill that made the problem worse," he said in July 2015 in Philadelphia. "And I want to admit that." Our ruling In a heated exchange with protesters in Philadelphia, Bill Clinton defended his 1994 crime bill saying "because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this, because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence." Experts and studies haven’t reached consensus on what caused the historic drops in crime. But they do roundly agree that it can’t all be attributed to Clinton’s 1994 crime bill. In fact, most suggest the crime bill’s role in the drop was negligible. We rule the claim Mostly False.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-08T14:38:19	2016-04-07	['None']

pomt-13310	"Kelly Ayotte voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/07/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/ad-claims-kelly-ayotte-voted-billion-dollar-tax-br/	As the U.S. Senate race heats up, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took out an ad bashing Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte’s record on climate. The 30-second spot takes aim at Ayotte’s ties to "big oil." "Kelly Ayotte voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks, and they gave her campaign contributions," the narrator says. PolitiFact decided to see if there was any truth to the claim. Let’s look at Ayotte’s votes first. Politifact has looked at similar claims, like when the Senate Majority PAC said former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown "voted to give oil companies big tax breaks." PolitiFact found that claim Mostly True. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Ayotte’s votes. We’ll tackle campaign contributions separately. The DSCC pointed us to Ayotte’s votes in 2011 and 2012 against measures that would have stripped existing tax breaks from the "big five" oil companies: Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips. The 2011 Democratic-backed proposal would have eliminated five tax breaks for the companies and generated an estimated $21 billion over a decade, according to the New York Times. The bill that came a year later would have eliminated $24 billion in tax subsidies from the five oil companies, according to the Boston Globe. Specifically, the measures would have kept those five multinational oil companies from using these existing tax breaks: • Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments • Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs • Deductions for intangible drilling costs • Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells • Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses Three of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the "big five" oil firms. In each of the two years, the proposal failed to advance in the U.S. Senate by margins of 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. The bills needed 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote. Ayotte joined most Republicans and a handful of Democrats from oil states to oppose the measure both times it hit the Senate floor. The bill’s opponents sometimes cited a March 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump. In general the ad is correct that Ayotte sided with the position of "big oil" when she voted against advancing the bills. But the ad’s wording is misleading. It states Ayotte "voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks." Ayotte really voted against stripping the companies of tax breaks they already enjoyed. Meanwhile, Ayotte’s campaign pointed to several votes she has taken opposing tax credits for the oil and gas industry. One amendment, to a highway bill, would have repealed more than a dozen various tax credits including those for alternative fuel mixtures, certain plug-in vehicles, biodiesel and renewable diesel used as fuel and electricity produced from certain renewable resources. The amendment did not propose to repeal any of the tax breaks for the "big five" oil companies mentioned above, but it did target two credits dealing with oil -- one for producing oil and gas from marginal wells, and another for enhanced oil recovery. Neither was in effect when the amendment was offered and the marginal well credit hasn’t been used since its creation in 2004, according to a 2013 article from lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Ayotte was one of 26 senators who voted for the amendment. It was opposed by a bipartisan group of 76 senators, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. Ayotte’s campaign also pointed to a February amendment that would have phased out tax credits for fossil fuels on the same schedule as those for wind farms. The proposal, offered by Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, targeted many of the same existing tax breaks for "big oil" as the bills from 2011 and 2012. For example, it would have phased out deductions for intangible drilling costs and deductions on domestic manufacturing costs, among others. Ayotte joined most Democrats to vote for the amendment, which was defeated 50 to 45. Our Ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Kelly Ayotte "voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks." In 2011 and 2012, Ayotte did indeed vote against measures that would have barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed, which added up to more than $20 billion. But that’s slightly different than what the ad says. Rather than vote to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Ayotte voted to support the status quo. Ayotte’s record is more complex, however, and she cast more recent votes that would have repealed some tax breaks for big oil. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.	None	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2016-10-07T11:45:49	2016-09-06	['None']
pomt-10209	Obama's one education accomplishment was "legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/11/john-mccain/an-absurd-claim-about-a-bill-that-never-passed/	(Published Sept. 11, 2008) John McCain released an ad this week making the accusation that Barack Obama supports sex education for five-year-olds. Here's what the ad says: " Education Week says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' that he's 'elusive' on accountability, a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.' "Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners. "Learning about sex before learning to read? Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family." Here, we'll check the claim that Obama wants five-year-olds to learn about sex. We've checked what Education Week said in a separate item and found it Barely True . The origins of this claim go back to Obama's days as a state senator in the Illinois General Assembly. In 2003, the Assembly considered a bill to expand sex education directives from grades 6 through 12 to grades K through 12. The legislation required the curriculum to be medically accurate and include information on the prevention of HIV and contraceptives. It also said abstinence must be taught and that students "shall be encouraged to base their actions on reasoning, self-discipline, sense of responsibility, self-control, and ethical considerations, such as respect for oneself and others." Most pertinent to the kindergarten allegation, the legislation states that "course material and instruction shall be age and developmentally appropriate." Carol Ronen, the now-retired state senator who sponsored the bill, said its main intent was to make sure that teenagers got information that was "medically accurate," a requirement that wasn't then part of the school code. A secondary effect was to expand age-appropriate sex education down to lower grades, to allow things like teaching school children to avoid sex predators, Ronen said. "Barack never had anything to do with it," she said. "This is a lot of hoopla." Obama voted for the legislation in committee on a party-line vote. He was not a sponsor nor a co-sponsor, and the legislation never made it to a full Senate vote. So calling it one of his accomplishments is wrong, since it never became law and it wasn't his bill anyway. This isn't the first time Obama has faced the "sex ed for kindergartners" charge. When Obama ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, his opponent Alan Keyes used it. "Nobody's suggesting that kindergartners are going to be getting information about sex in the way that we think about it," Obama said at a campaign event in 2004. "If they ask a teacher 'where do babies come from,' that providing information that the fact is that it's not a stork is probably not an unhealthy thing. Although again, that's going to be determined on a case-by-case basis by local communities and local school boards." Obama said that he did not support telling youngsters about explicit information about sex. The bill specifically mentions that instructional material must be age appropriate. It specifically mentions teaching children how to "say no to unwanted sexual advances" and "nonconsensual physical sexual contact." The legislation was not sponsored by Obama and it didn't pass, so calling it one of his "accomplishments" is absurd. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-10210	Says Obama called Sarah Palin a pig.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/10/john-mccain/if-theres-lipstick-on-a-pig-its-this-mccain-ad/	(Published Sept. 10, 2008) The story begins, like so many these days, with Gov. Sarah Palin’s speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Having stirred the crowd to its feet more than once, Palin delivered a knockout line when she deadpanned: “I love those hockey moms. You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.” The line drew cheerful applause and has echoed ever since, which seems to explain how Sen. Barack Obama found himself in the middle of an uproar when he uttered a time-worn phrase to denigrate Sen. John McCain’s proclaimed agenda for “change” in Washington. "John McCain says he's about change, too," Obama said. "And so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out, George Bush! Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington.'" "That's not change," Obama said. "That's just calling something the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it’s still going to stink after eight years. We’ve had enough of the same old thing." Gasp! He just said lipstick! Did he just call Sarah Palin a pig??!!! That’s the charge. Later that day, the McCain campaign arranged a conference call for reporters with Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts. She said that when you add up Obama’s comments and Palin’s comments, you get Obama calling Palin a pig. Swift said Obama should apologize. “Calling a very prominent female governor of one of our states a ‘pig’ is not exactly what we want to see,” Swift said. The issue has dominated the presidential campaign for two days, with the McCain campaign stirring a controversy by having local lawmakers call for Obama to apologize, and the Obama campaign responding with examples of how often he and others have used the phrase. The next day, Obama called the McCain’s campaign tactics “lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics.” On Wednesday, the McCain campaign released a Web ad called “Lipstick.” It begins with a clip of Palin delivering her lipstick line, then text flashes on the screen saying “Barack Obama on: Sarah Palin.” A moment later, the ad plays a small portion of Obama’s “lipstick on a pig” remark, but not enough of his quotation to make clear what he was talking about. The ad concludes with a clip of CBS anchor Katie Couric soberly remarking on sexism on the campaign trail. The ad has two big problems, as does the complaint of former Gov. Swift. First, in the full text of the remarks it’s clear that Obama isn’t talking about Sarah Palin. He’s talking about McCain’s argument that he represents change. Second, “putting lipstick on a pig” is a popular put-down, especially among politicians. It generally means taking a bad or unattractive idea and trying to dress it up. We weren’t able to pin down the origins of this folksy expression, but we found tons of instances of people using it. The political newspaper The Hill labeled the phrase “Congress Speak” back in June, and gave it an official definition: “an expression used to illustrate that something unattractive cannot be beautified or otherwise positively changed by any amount of makeup or other exterior alterations.” In 1986, Texas Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower used the phrase to criticize Ronald Reagan’s farm policy. During the 2004 presidential campaign, both Dick Cheney and John Edwards used it to attack the other guy’s running mate. Earlier this year, Democratic Congresswoman Linda Sanchez of California gave a speech on trade policy. “You know the old saying about putting lipstick on a pig? Well, I smell bacon,” she groused. Obama and McCain both have used the expression. In September 2007, Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson quoted Obama using the phrase to discuss Iraq policy: “I think that both Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,” Obama said. “George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.” In Iowa on Oct. 11, 2007, McCain panned Sen. Hillary Clinton’s health care plan, calling it “eerily reminiscent” of the plan that failed during Bill Clinton’s administration, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune. “I think they put some lipstick on a pig,” McCain said, “but it’s still a pig.” On Feb. 1, 2007, McCain blasted a Senate resolution that would have criticized President Bush’s strategy in Iraq. Some had praised the resolution as a compromise measure, but McCain disagreed. “It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don’t,” McCain said. “You can put lipstick on a pig, [but] it’s still a pig, in my view.” It is simply impossible to view the complete remarks by Obama and conclude that he’s making a veiled and unsavory reference to Palin. Her name never is used in the preceding sentence. In fact, it’s hard to see how one could interpret Obama’s lipstick-on-a-pig remark as referring directly to McCain, either. We think it’s very clear that Obama was saying McCain’s effort to call himself the “candidate of change” is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better. Agree or disagree with Obama’s point, but his remark wasn’t the smear that McCain’s people have tried to make it. If anyone’s doing any smearing, it’s the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts. Did Obama call Palin a pig? No, and saying so is Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-11358	"It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process."	false	/florida/statements/2018/apr/04/free-thought-project/did-florida-police-seize-mans-gun-out-due-process-/	After the Parkland school shooting, Florida lawmakers passed a so-called "red flag" law that aims to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed to be a threat to others or themselves. The new law went into effect March 9, quickly stoking concern among people about lost freedom. A March 18 headline posted on the Free Thought Project said, "It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process." The post went on to say a man in Lighthouse Point — in Broward County, like Parkland — had his guns taken away before he was determined to be mentally unfit and before he was accused of a crime, making him the first person in the state to "have his due process removed." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post makes it seem like a man’s guns were taken without reason or cause, but that leaves out important nuance about the situation. Authorities said the man voluntarily surrendered his weapons and never contested the temporary risk protection order barring him from his guns for up to a year. Florida’s "risk protection law" Florida legislators moved quickly to pass SB 7026, allowing law enforcement to seek a risk protection order from a judge that would temporarily remove a person’s firearm(s) for up to a year. It also bars those individuals from buying guns during that time. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri took issue with the way the law has been portrayed in headlines. He said if a person doesn’t comply with a risk protection order, then police have to file a warrant and establish probable cause to obtain the weapon. "There is no seizure authority," Gualtieri said. "You can ask them to comply with the risk protection order, but you can’t seize a person’s guns." The law slightly amended the Baker Act, under which law enforcement officials can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others. Authorities can confiscate a person’s guns if they pose a potential danger to themselves or have made a credible threat of violence against another person. Before this change, the Baker Act didn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. In practice, officers would often — but not always — temporarily confiscate guns if the firearms were on the person or in plain sight during the Baker Act "episode," said Martha Lenderman, an expert on the Baker Act. More states added similar "red flag" laws this year including Washington. Matt Agorist, who wrote the Free Thought Project article, argued that Florida’s new law allows law enforcement officers to retain guns without due process. "When a person is stripped of their constitutional rights, albeit temporarily, without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations, this is the removal of due process," Agorist said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. However, this neglects the fact that the person in question allowed police to retain his guns at the time he was taken into custody under the Baker Act. After this, Lighthouse Point police took the necessary steps to obtain a temporary risk protection order, which a judge reviewed and signed. Details about the Florida police seizing a man’s handgun PolitiFact Florida interviewed Lighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata and Broward County’s chief judge to get an understanding of the incident that led to a 56-year-old man losing his weapons. Licata said officers have had interactions with the man for years, but it wasn’t until early March that his actions warranted action. (PolitiFact Florida is not naming the man because of his condition.) On March 7, Lighthouse Point Police checked on the man at his condo after an anonymous person filed a complaint that he was acting strangely. According to court records, the person said the man had been seen around the community "clutching his face and hair while arguing with himself." The complainant also said the man had admitted to turning off the main electrical breakers to the condo building "to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him." Licata said that this was causing a safety issue for other residents who depend on oxygen. During the police welfare check, the man said he was being targeted by one of his neighbors, who he said shape-shifts and looks like Osama bin Laden. The man was carrying a firearm in the outer pocket of his cargo pants, according to court records. The man voluntarily surrendered his weapons during the welfare check, said Broward’s chief administrative judge, Circuit Judge Jack Tuter. After that, police determined the man was a risk to himself and others and took him into custody under the Baker Act. Licata said the subject was not released from the medical center until March 21. Before he was released, police petitioned the court to get a temporary ex parte order and a permanent risk protection order March 14 to retain the man’s guns. (An ex parte orders allows the court to proceed temporarily without both parties present for a hearing. In this case, the man was still being held at a medical facility.) Law enforcement met with the man at his condo March 21 to remove additional ammunition. One week after his release, there was a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year. The man was there. He did not contest the one-year risk protection order requested by police. Tuter signed the order preventing him from owning or purchasing guns. Our ruling A headline on the Free Thought Project said, "Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process." The headline and the story make it appear that Florida police arbitrarily took away a man’s guns, and that’s not the case. The man in question voluntarily gave his weapons to police before he was taken into custody under the Baker Act, a judge said. While the man was being treated, Lighthouse Point police followed the protocol for obtaining a temporary risk protection order, and the man did not contest the order at any point during the court proceedings. With everything considered, we rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Free Thought Project	None	None	None	2018-04-04T09:00:00	2018-04-18	['None']
pomt-12503	Treasury Department's inspector general found "there's $4 billion a year in excess payments" going to people that shouldn’t get them. "These are mostly Mexicans."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-4-billion-tax-credits-go-mostly-mexi/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions is optimistic that funds for President Donald Trump’s border wall will come through. One way could be with savings from money that’s inappropriately going to immigrants, he said. Sessions talked about paying for the wall on ABC’s This Week after host George Stephanopoulos asked if Mexico would pay for the wall, as Trump has promised. "Well, we're going to get paid for it one way or the other. I know there's $4 billion a year in excess payments, according to the Department of the Treasury's own inspector general several years ago, that are going to payments to people -- tax credits that they shouldn't get," Sessions said April 23. "These are mostly Mexicans. And those kind of things add up -- $4 billion a year for 10 years is $40 billion. There are a lot of ways we can find money to help pay for this." Sessions left us wondering if $4 billion a year in tax credits are going to people who are not supposed to get them, and if they are mostly Mexicans. There’s some truth to Sessions’ claim, but it also leaves out some critical details. Treasury Department report Anyone who earns an income in the United States is required to pay taxes, whether they live here legally or illegally. Generally, people who are authorized to work in the United States use a Social Security Number to report income and pay taxes on them. Individuals who don’t have employment authorization can file their taxes using a nine-digit Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). Experts say the majority of ITIN filers likely are individuals who are living in the country illegally, but an ITIN can also be issued to people here legally, such as foreign workers. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration issued an audit in 2011 that said $4.2 billion in refundable credits were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. These funds were claimed in the 2010 tax processing year by a total 2.3 million ITIN filers. $4.2 billion tax credits The Treasury audit focused on refunds through the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), available to individuals who owed less in taxes than deductions for the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child). A child must be a U.S. citizen or resident in order for a parent to claim the credit. A law passed in 1996 denied another credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to individuals who file taxes without a Social Security Number that authorizes employment. ITIN filers are also not eligible for Social Security benefits. But as we’ve reported in a similar claim, Congress has not written a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the ACTC. The audit cited by Sessions said "clarification to the law is needed to address whether or not refundable tax credits such as the ACTC may be paid to those who are not authorized to work in the United States." In response to a draft of the audit, the Internal Revenue Service said: "The law does not require the taxpayer or eligible child to have a Social Security number in order to receive the (Child Tax Credit) or the ACTC. The IRS is administering the law accordingly. Legislative changes would be required to deny many of the claims discussed in the report." Regarding the $4.2 billion for processing year 2010, a Congressional Research Service report in 2016 noted that the figure did not necessarily represent the annual revenue losses, since about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years. The audit said the returns filed for multiple years resulted in claims of more than $1 billion, but not all claims were refunded due to statute of limitations. Point being, the report doesn't show the availability of $4 billion a year, as Sessions said. And while parents may not be working legally in the United States, in some cases their children are U.S. citizens. "Under what Mr. Sessions is suggesting, it wouldn’t be Mexico that pays for the border wall, but rather low-income children — most of them U.S. citizens and part of the future U.S. workforce — and their families," said Bob Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ‘Mostly Mexicans’? The 2011 audit did not list nationalities of ITIN filers claiming the credit. Sessions’ office referred us to a Department of Homeland Security report on the estimates of the unauthorized population as of January 2012, around the time of the audit’s analysis. The DHS report said that of the estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants, 6.7 million were from Mexico. While the majority of ITIN filers are likely illegally in the country, Greenstein told us there is no data to precisely determine how many Mexican ITIN filers are claiming the ACTC. Though a report from the IRS’ Taxpayer Advocate office found that about half of people applying for ITINs in 2014 were Mexican. That report also found that in 2015, 4.4 million ITIN filers paid more than $5.5 billion in payroll and Medicare taxes and $23.6 billion in total taxes. Our ruling Sessions said, the Treasury Department's inspector general found "there's $4 billion a year in excess payments" going to people that shouldn’t get them. "These are mostly Mexicans." An audit did find $4.2 billion in refundable credits for child care were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. Those $4.2 billion were claimed in tax processing year 2010, but about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years, meaning that amount wouldn't necessarily be available annually. Sessions says these people "shouldn’t" get the tax credit. That may be his opinion, but there’s nothing in the law now saying they can’t claim the credits. The audit didn’t have anything to say about the nationality of those who claimed the credits, though other evidence suggests it’s likely that about half could be Mexican. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00909	"I never said I was on the Falkland Islands."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/03/bill-oreilly/oreilly-i-never-said-i-was-falkland-islands/	Bill O’Reilly’s accounts of his early years as a reporter have garnered a lot of attention lately, especially his experiences in the 1980s during the Falklands War. For those who might not remember, a full-blown battle broke out in 1982 when Argentina sought to claim the islands that had long been held by the United Kingdom. The scrutiny of the iconic Fox News host began with a Mother Jones article by David Corn and Daniel Schulman. It asserted, "For years, O'Reilly has recounted dramatic stories about his own war reporting that don't withstand scrutiny — even claiming he acted heroically in a war zone that he apparently never set foot in." O’Reilly has aggressively defended his reputation. "David Corn, a liar, says that I exaggerated situations in the Falklands War and Salvadoran War," O’Reilly said on his Feb. 20, 2015, show. "I never said I was on the Falkland Islands, as Corn purports. I said I covered the Falklands War, which I did." The full scope of the dispute over O’Reilly’s past actions is larger than a single fact-check, but here we will attempt to address O’Reilly’s statement that "I never said I was on the Falklands Islands." The Falklands War -- a primer The Falkland Islands lie about 400 miles off the southern coast of Argentina. There are two main islands and hundreds of smaller ones. Today, there about 3,000 residents and around half a million sheep. Britain claimed the islands in 1765. By the 1960s, Argentina was pushing hard to assert its own rights to the territory, which it called the Malvinas. The argument simmered until April 1982 when Argentine troops landed on the islands. Britain sent 100 war ships, fighter jets and infantry to repulse them. Britain sank an Argentine cruiser. Argentina bombed British landing craft. The fighting lasted about two and a half months until Argentina surrendered. By that point, it had lost about 650 men; about 250 British soldiers had died. During all this time, no American journalists were on the ground on the islands themselves. Most of the coverage originated from Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, over 1,000 miles from the fighting. When the British forces won, huge riots broke out around the presidential palace. Thousands took to the streets in frustration over the lost war. There was violence, tear gas, rock-throwing and rubber bullets fired. There were injuries and property damage, but to the best of anyone’s knowledge, no one died. Bill O’Reilly -- a primer Everyone knows O’Reilly as the brash, "no-spin zone" Fox News host, but before taking up with Fox in 1996, O’Reilly had spent many years working his way up through network television. He had reporting jobs in cities including Dallas, Denver and Portland, Ore. His big break came in 1982 when he became a correspondent for CBS News. While at CBS, he was sent to Buenos Aires to cover the Falklands War. It was there that he saw the riots that he has referred to as a war zone. In fact, O’Reilly felt CBS never gave him the credit he deserved for the reporting he did when the rioting was most intense. O’Reilly moved to ABC News in 1986, and then left to become the host of a news and entertainment show called Inside Edition. He stayed in that slot until 1995 when he went to Harvard’s Kennedy School to get a degree in public policy. The Fox News network was just getting started when O’Reilly graduated and he became host of the show that soon became known as The O’Reilly Factor. O’Reilly and the Falklands O’Reilly’s accounts of his time in Argentina go into most detail when he describes helping a cameraman who was knocked down and cut his ear, and about soldiers firing on protesters. The rest of the time, his references to the war have been more in passing. The Mother Jones article included several instances when O’Reilly talked or wrote about the Falklands. For example, it cited a line from O’Reilly’s book The No Spin Zone: Confrontations With the Powerful and Famous in America, that said, "I've reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands." There are also two video clips of O’Reilly referring to his Falklands experiences. In one, O’Reilly chides journalist Bill Moyers, saying, "I missed Moyers in the war zones of the Falkland conflict in Argentina, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. I looked for Bill, but I didn't see him." Our search of the Nexis database unearthed an instance on Feb. 13, 2007, when O’Reilly talked on his show about the Falklands. He was interviewing two reporters who had covered the Iraq War. One of them, Mark Kukis with Time magazine, described what it was like to interview soldiers. Kukis: "The soldiers that I was in combat with in those moments, they get really psyched up and they're excited, particularly the Marines in Ramadi. It's not a bad time to talk to them about what they're doing. It's probably the best time if you want to get a positive response from them." O'Reilly: "Okay. See, my experience in El Salvador, in the Falklands War was let them calm down. Because ... when all hell breaks loose, you know, you're not thinking clearly. You're reacting." While there’s some wiggle room for interpretation, a reasonable person would think that O’Reilly had been with soldiers in combat in the Falklands. In another video clip used by Mother Jones, O’Reilly was a little more ambiguous. "I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete." Interpreting O’Reilly’s statements Ultimately, this fact-check is an exercise in the art of language. Namely, did O’Reilly never say he was on the Falklands islands? Two media critics, one from Fox News and one from Politico said this is a dispute over semantics. Fox News said in a statement that "This is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates Mother Jones and Media Matters." Lawyers and logicians remind us that it’s impossible to prove the negative, but the evidence we’ve seen shows that O’Reilly used the preposition "in" to describe his Falklands experience. He said "in the war zones of the Falkland conflict in Argentina." And he said "in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands." Under some circumstances, "in" can mean "during," as in "What did you do in the war, Daddy?" Daddy might have slogged through the swamps of Vietnam or he might have worked a desk in a Pentagon office. On the other hand, it’s not much of a stretch for a listener to conclude that O’Reilly’s statements meant that he had been on the same ground where the actual fighting took place. Certainly during his interview with war reporters, O’Reilly strongly implied that he had been with soldiers in combat "in the Falklands War." Even experienced listeners have stumbled over his meaning. Our ruling O’Reilly said, "I never said I was on the Falkland Islands." The central word here is "on." O’Reilly has a point that — at least so far as we can tell — he’s always said he was "in" the Falklands conflict rather than "on" the islands. At the very least, we can say that when O’Reilly talked about the Falklands in the past, his phrasing was ambiguous — to the extent that reasonable people could understand him to mean he’d set foot in a place where military combat was taking place, not reporting from 1,000 miles away. Also, O’Reilly offered his statement as proof that he never had falsely claimed that he was in the thick of the fighting. But you can suggest you were there without specifying that you were on the islands. The English language is plenty flexible enough to convey the same meaning using a different word, such as "in." O’Reilly’s statement is accurate but omits important context, so we rate this claim Half True. Correction: British forces sank an Argentine cruiser. An earlier version of this fact-check misidentified the type of vessel.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2015-03-03T11:15:51	2015-02-20	['None']

pomt-00684	"A sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/06/danny-porter/gwinnett-da-over-reaches-sheriff-hill-shooting-sta/	Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill made national headlines running for a second term while facing multiple felony charges such as racketeering and giving false statements. He said the charges were politically motivated, and he kept a relatively low profile after being acquitted on a whittled-down list of charges in 2013. But he was thrust back into the spotlight Sunday. Police said he telephoned 911 to report that he had shot a female acquaintance in a model home near Lawrenceville. Gwenevere McCord, 43, was rushed to the hospital in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. McCord’s family said she and Hill are longtime acquaintances. There was some confusion Sunday about whether police could arrest Hill if they felt charges were warranted. Georgia law says "a sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge," Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter told AM750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB, a news partner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, during an interview Monday morning. Porter later said that, after further research, he determined the state law only applies in cases where a sheriff is on official duty when he or she allegedly commits a crime. Hill was in Gwinnett on Sunday for what "appears to be a completely personal errand," Porter said. PolitiFact Georgia was intrigued. Does Georgia give special or different treatment to sheriffs who are suspected of a crime? We’ll look deeper at the law, which Terry Norris, the executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association, was quick to tell us applies to far more people than just sheriffs. It covers all peace officers, including sheriff’s deputies and police chiefs, as well as teachers and school administrators, Norris said. It states: "Any warrant for the arrest of a peace officer, law enforcement officer, teacher, or school administrator for any offense alleged to have been committed while in the performance of his or her duties may be issued only by a judge of a superior court, a judge of a state court, or a judge of a probate court." Norris said he believes the law, which we found dates to the 1860s, was designed to prevent private citizens from obtaining criminal warrants against sheriffs and teachers just because they were mad at them for doing their jobs. Magistrates and municipal judges can issue most warrants. But under these circumstances, the law requires requests for warrants be handled by higher-level probate, state or Superior Court judges, he said. Porter said Tuesday that he purposely proceeded cautiously. "I was not sure enough of the procedure that was required to arrest the sheriff. I was afraid I would make a procedural error in the case," he said. Porter said Gwinnett County has six state court judges and one probate judge, but he would have only considered going to one of the 10 Superior Court judges on Sunday night had he decided then to pursue a warrant against Hill. "I don’t have a relationship with them (the other judges)," Porter said, ‘that I could call them on a Sunday night and bring a police officer to their house." He said he also wasn’t certain whether Hill might claim to be on duty Sunday. "Police officers make the argument they’re always on duty,’ Porter said. "The sheriff is elected. I didn’t know if it made a difference. If he is arrested, he’ll probably make the argument that he was in performance of his duties." The Camaro that Hill was in had police lights and other equipment, Porter said. Professor Ronald Carlson at the University of Georgia School of Law said Porter’s actions made sense, given the statute. There are no Supreme Court rulings on the protections afforded law enforcement and other public officials in the code, Carlson said, leaving it to be followed as purely as possible. "With a high profile sort of case, and with a high-profile person who may be charged or not, it’s good to go to probably to the highest court listed in statute, and that’s the Superior Court judge," Carlson said. "I think he has the right idea.". Yet the question remained how Hill, as a sheriff, was allowed to leave the scene Sunday night. "How do you walk away from a shooting without saying anything? A lot of us in former law enforcement are scratching our heads," Former DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan told the AJC. "I don’t think you and I could have walked away from something like that." Jill Polster, an Atlanta criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor, said it is not unusual for police to not make an arrest until a thorough investigation is done when there is possibility of what attorneys call an "affirmative" defense. Those defenses pop up in situations such as the Hill shooting, or in home invasions, when the claim of accidental shootings or self-defense can delay or lengthen investigations as law enforcement conducts interviews to reconstruct what happened. For instance, former Peachtree City Police Chief William McCollom was indicted April 15 on reckless conduct charges from the New Year’s Day shooting that left his former wife paralyzed. McCollom told investigators he had fallen asleep with his gun in the bed when he accidentally shot Maggie McCollom in the back. In the Hill case, there is a living victim, too. Police are likely waiting to talk to her before moving too quickly to determine what happened in a case that includes at least two other eyewitnesses, Polster said. "In many stand-your-ground cases, or in the Peachtree City case, they take their time because there are a lot of possibilities to investigate," Polster said. Porter dismissed any suggestion that Hill’s position and reputation would likewise affect the outcome, saying, "Sometimes it’s better off to get it right than to get it fast." In fact, Polster said, Hill’s being sheriff may mean officers are more comfortable letting him leave a scene than they would someone who could fade away as they conducted their investigation. "Victor Hill is not going anywhere," Polster said. "He’s a public figure and he’s not going to flee, so they can take their time and complete a full investigation." Our conclusion: Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter said " A sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge." He later said he had researched the law and determined that it only applied if the alleged crime occurred during the official performance of duty. Porter’s overarching point is that under Georgia law sheriffs are treated differently when they may have broken the laws they’re supposed to uphold. On that point, Porter is correct. But on the specifics, he’s off base. He had other options. Warrants can be issued against sheriffs by the state court and probate courts judges. PolitiFact defines a statement as Half True when it’s at least partially accurate but missing enough context to be misleading to the average reader. Porter’s statement fits that bill. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Danny Porter	None	None	None	2015-05-06T00:00:00	2015-05-04	['None']

pomt-04201	Public employees receive "something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/06/mark-zaccaria/ri-gop-chairman-mark-zaccaria-says-public-employee/	Mark Zaccaria, the outgoing chairman of Rhode Island’s Republican Party, was on WJAR-Channel 10’s "News Conference" program recently, commenting on the hard time the state party had in legislative races this year. Though Republicans recently have had a strong record of success in winning the governor’s office -- the Democrats have held it for just 4 of the last 28 years -- the Grand Old Party took a beating in state House and Senate races in November, dropping from 18 Republicans out of a 113-member General Assembly in 2010 to 11 in the session that will begin in January. Zaccaria said the party’s poor showing was due in part to structural advantages he said the Rhode Island Democratic Party has developed over the years, particularly support from state and local government employees and their unions. "If you add the members of the teachers unions, if you add the other public service employees all around the state that are municipally based," he said, "it comes to something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island." Now, we can’t determine whether drawing a state or local government paycheck guarantees how someone might vote. But we did wonder whether Zaccaria’s calculation was correct. When we asked him for his source, Zaccaria said he’d been using the 25-percent estimate since he ran for Congress in 2010. He said he’d done research to justify the figure, but after two years couldn’t recall the specific source of the statistic. So we went to the website of the Department of Labor and Training, which tracks the number of jobs in the state month by month and year by year. According to its October 2012 report, the most recent, Rhode Island had 463,300 non-farm jobs. The department breaks down those jobs into more than two dozen categories, including federal, state and local government workers. The local government category includes public school teachers. If you combine the local and state government numbers for October 2012, you get about 50,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of that 463,300 statewide job total -- less than half of Zaccaria’s estimate. Even if you add in the 10,000 federal government employees in the state, that would bring the number up to about 60,000, or about 13 percent of the state’s work force. Because Zaccaria said he’s been using his 25-percent figure since 2010, we went back to the 2010 numbers to see whether things were different then. They weren’t. The closest he would have come was January 2010, the month when the number of total jobs was lowest. Combined state and local government employees were counted at about 52,000 that month, 11.7 percent of that month’s 444,500 statewide jobs. Including 10,200 federal jobs that month would have bumped the public employee sector share to 14 percent, still short of 25 percent. Our ruling Rhode Island State Republican Chairman Mark Zaccaria said that 25 percent -- one in four -- of paychecks in the state of Rhode Island go to state workers, municipal workers and public school teachers. But state labor statistics show the figure is closer to 11 percent, or about 1 in 9. We rule his claim False.

pomt-04493	"Pre-existing conditions are covered under my (health care) plan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-his-health-care-plan-covers-pre-e/	If there’s one thing people tell pollsters they like about "Obamacare," it’s the rule that says health insurance companies can no longer reject people for having pre-existing conditions. Republican nominee Mitt Romney said it’s an aspect of the health care law he wants to keep if elected president. "Pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan," Romney noted at the debate in Denver on Oct. 3. President Barack Obama challenged Romney on that point. "Well, actually, governor, that isn't what your plan does," Obama said. "What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if it's been under 90 days. But that's already the law, and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with pre-existing conditions." Romney responded by simply repeating his earlier point: "In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care plan." So what’s the truth? Does Romney have a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions? ‘Obamacare’ vs. the Romney plan The real name of the current health care law is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. At the debate, Romney called "Obamacare," and Obama replied that he didn’t mind the term and had actually "become fond" of it. Under "Obamacare," which goes into effect fully in 2014, insurers can’t reject people for having pre-existing conditions. During the drafting of the law, insurers warned that the provision could drive them out of business if people can wait until they get sick to buy insurance. So to address that concern, the law requires everyone to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. That penalty clause is called "the individual mandate," and the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional this summer. Romney opposes that mandate, and has consistently said the health law should be repealed and replaced. But his health care plan doesn’t pack a lot of details. His website, though, says people "should be guaranteed the ability to retain coverage" if they have "maintained continuous health insurance coverage." That means if you already have health insurance, other insurers can’t deny you if you have pre-existing conditions. (After the debate, his spokesman confirmed this was still his position.) But people who’ve lost coverage for an extended period of time don’t get the same guarantee. How many people would that be? The Obama campaign has said it could be as many as 89 million, a claim we rated Half True. That number is inflated — it counts people who would qualify for public insurance programs, for example. Still, anyone who does go without coverage for an extended period of time and then needs to buy their own insurance could be rejected by private insurers under Romney’s plan. Obama said during the debate existing law already has protections similar as to what Romney has proposed, and he’s right about that. If the 2010 health law disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act established that time frame, and it only allows insurers to look back 18 months for coverage gaps of 63 days or more. Health experts we talked to assume Romney would basically firm up the requirements of that law — which applies primarily to people with employer-based coverage, not less common individual policies — and strengthen it so it also applied to the individual market. It’s also possible under Romney’s plan that some people rejected for coverage for pre-existing conditions would qualify for insurance through state-run "high-risk pools," an idea Romney includes in his health care proposals. Romney encourages states to design their own programs, according to a statement from policy director Lanhee Chen that the Romney campaign sent us. Conservative health experts say Romney’s reforms focus on separating health insurance from employment, and that will cut down on gaps in health coverage. "The idea is that you create a new system in which it's much easier to get insurance yourself, give people a window (a kind of open season) to get insured in that system if they're not already insured, and then after that protect those who are from then on continuously insured," said Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and founding editor of conservative magazine National Review. Our ruling Romney said his health care proposals include protections for pre-existing conditions What he didn’t say at the debate -- but which his website states and advisers confirmed after the debate -- is that people would be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured. The health care law, though, offers protections whether people have current coverage or not, so it offers more robust protection. The law also includes a requirement that everyone have insurance or pay a tax penalty. Romney’s plan doesn’t have that requirement. Romney did not mention the qualifier that people have to stay insured to get the protection. That’s a significant omission. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-05294	National debt plus unfunded liabilities adds up to $520,000 per American household.	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/may/22/mitt-romney/romney-says-debt-plus-unfunded-liabilities-equals-/	When Mitt Romney traveled around the country campaigning recently, he brought a debt clock with him showing the rising national debt. The total is a mind-boggling, massive number. In St. Petersburg, Fla., on May 16, 2012, Romney explained what the debt and "unfunded liabilities" means for every household. Romney said unfunded liabilities "means promises made by the federal government where there is no money behind it to pay it. … So it's the liabilities (that) add up to, think about this, $520,000 per household. …And this president hasn’t stopped it; he has added to it." Wow -- every family owes more than a half-million? Forget about ever paying that off -- right? We wanted to check if Romney, the presumed Republican nominee for president, was correct that the amount of debt plus unfunded liabilities equals about $520,000 per household. We’re not going to consider responsibility for the debt in this report; both Republicans and Democrats have been responsible over the years. Here, we want to look at whether the number is an accurate reflection of how much debt we have. Romney’s explanation The Romney campaign pointed us to a 2011 news analysis in USA Today. "The $61.6 trillion in unfunded obligations amounts to $528,000 per household," it said. "That's more than five times what Americans have borrowed for everything else — mortgages, car loans and other debt. It reflects the challenge as the number of retirees soars over the next 20 years and seniors try to collect on those spending promises." USA Today provided a breakdown of money owed, based on 2010 figures. • Medicare: $24.8 trillion. "This demographic burst — combined with the addition of a prescription drug benefit in 2006 and rising health care costs generally — has created an unfunded liability of nearly $25 trillion over the lifetime of those now in the program as workers and retirees." • Social Security: $21.4 trillion. "Social Security's long-term shortfall grows about $1.2 trillion annually — a sign of an imbalance between the number of young workers and older beneficiaries, according to the Social Security trustees' annual reports. The $21.4 trillion unfunded liability represents the difference between all taxes that will be paid and all benefits received over the lifetimes of everyone in the system now — workers and beneficiaries alike." • Federal debt: $9.4 trillion. This has grown since the USA Today report. The U.S. Treasury put the debt at about $15.677 trillion as of May 14. Defining an unfunded liability Our main concern with Romney’s statement is that it counts obligations to be paid in the future as debt for today’s families. This might sound reasonable, but thinking of debt this way presents some tricky issues. What Romney did was take the amount predicted that we will owe over the next 75 years for Social Security and Medicare, subtracted what we will take in to fund them, and then divided that sum by the current total of households. Technically, though, shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare aren’t unfunded liabilities, said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. "Legally, they are not liabilities. They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations." (He spoke with our sister site PolitiFact Virginia last year on the same topic.) Foster said the benefits do not qualify as liabilities because Congress can change the terms of Medicare and Social Security at any time. Foster told us in an email for this article that Romney’s calculation is valid. However, the figures for unfunded promises differ from common debt. Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution, also pointed out that future benefits for entitlements are not "owed" to seniors in the same way that the public debt is owed to the people and institutions who purchased U.S. government debt. "Congress can and almost certainly will reduce the future benefits promised to people who will receive Medicare and Social Security in the future," Burtless said via email. "Moreover, even if Congress does NOT act before the Trust Funds are depleted, under current law Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries would receive less than the amount of benefits provided to current beneficiaries. "Why? Because the Secretary of the Treasury can only pay for those benefits out of the Trust Funds, and if the Trust Funds are depleted of cash, the rate of spending out of it will be limited to rate at which the Trust Funds are replenished with tax revenues flowing in under the current tax schedule." Michael Linden, of the liberal Center for American Progress, said it’s silly to divide our current debt by the number of households because no one suggests that we equally apportion the debt and pay it all off tomorrow. "How does it make sense to apply potential debt borrowed in 2085 to families today?" he asked. Linden also said that while it’s true that revenues for Social Security and Medicare are projected to fall short of meeting needs over the next several decades, the U.S. will also face the obligation to pay for trillions of dollars on defense over the next 75 years. "That’s because the real worry is not the gap between spending and revenue in any given program (even those that are supposed to have dedicated revenue streams), but the gap between overall spending and overall revenues," Linden said via email. "So my bottom line is that, while Mitt Romney’s math may be right, his implication is wrong, and his number is devoid of any actual meaning." Still, Romney’s underlying point that there is a fiscal imbalance is sound. Alan Auerbach, an economist at Berkeley and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, said that by the numbers, Romney’s calculation is pretty much on target based on the government’s own projections. Auerbach said he has done similar calculations. "I would and do call these unfunded liabilities," he wrote in an email. "They differ from our explicit national debt liabilities in that we can reduce them by undertaking policy reforms, but under current policy they are indeed unfunded commitments. That is, they are obligations in excess of their dedicated funding sources (payroll taxes, premiums paid by Medicare enrollees, etc.)." Our ruling Romney said that the debt and unfunded liabilities of the federal government adds up to $520,000 per household. Romney relied on a 2011 article in USA Today that added up the debt at that time and the amount owed for entitlements -- the largest one was the amount owed for Medicare. Most economists we spoke with disagree with calling the amount we will owe in the future for entitlements "unfunded liabilities," because the government has the power to change the programs, either by reducing spending or increasing taxes. Those obligations are different than our current debt. But Romney’s underlying point is true: Without significant changes, we are on track to owe a mind-boggling sum if we spend large sums without sufficient revenues. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10878	"... study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/21/fred-thompson/thompson-ignores-contrary-death-penalty-research/	The deterrent effect of execution on murders has long been debated, but Thompson suggests the matter has been resolved. Not so. Here is the full assertion from Thompson's broadcast on ABC radio June 27: "...study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders. Some studies show really dramatic effects, with each execution of a murderer deterring as many as 18 or more murders. That's according to Emory University professors, who found as well that delaying execution also leads to further murders. Most studies have concluded that some number of murders between three and 18 are prevented for every application of capital punishment." A dozen research papers in the last six years support Thompson's assertion that capital punishment prevents murders, according to the Associated Press. Three studies get the most attention: a 2006 report by two economists and statistical papers in 2003 and 2006 from the Emory researchers. The Law & Order star accurately quotes the Emory study, but his generalizations about "most studies" ignore significant contrary research. A handful of studies directly challenge pro-deterrence findings by highlighting various missteps in methodology. "These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims, standards such as replication and basic comparisons with other scenarios," said Jeffery Fagan of the Columbia Law School during testimony before a New York legislative panel. Most notable is a paper by two National Bureau of Economic Research fellows who concluded "that execution policy drives little of the year-to-year variation in homicide rates. As to whether executions rise or lower the homicide rate, we remain profoundly uncertain."	None	Fred Thompson	None	None	None	2007-08-21T00:00:00	2007-08-20	['None']

pomt-07198	Accuses President Barack Obama of making contradictory claims about efforts to kill Osama bin Laden in 2008 and 2011.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/07/chain-email/chain-e-mail-accuses-barack-obama-hypocrisy-raid-o/	A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail that’s been making the rounds, accusing President Barack Obama of hypocrisy over the raid that resulted in the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. A Google search also indicated that the text of the e-mail has been popping up widely in blogs and comment threads. Here’s the full text of the version we received: "Here are the facts, you be the judge. These words were spoken by the same man in 2008 and then again in 2011. "Short and sweet… "OBAMA'S OWN WORDS TRAP HIM: "2008: ‘Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.’ "2011: ‘I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.’ "2008: ‘Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty, and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.’ "2011: ‘I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.’ "2008: ‘Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.’ "2011: ‘Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.’ "I HOPE THIS GETS SENT AROUND TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH!" We thought we’d look into whether the quotations in the e-mail were accurate. We did extensive searches on Google, in the Lexis-Nexis news database and the White House’s own website, as well as checking with a few experts. The White House did not respond to our query. While it’s impossible to prove a negative, we found no evidence to support the notion that Obama said any of these things. In fact, several of the statements are directly contradicted by the evidence we found. We’ll take the quotes one by one. 2008: "Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team." We found occasional references in the media to "assassination teams" that were answerable to Vice President Dick Cheney, but no evidence that Obama ever said anything of the sort. In a March 11, 2009, speech at the University of Minnesota, veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh referred to the Joint Special Operations Command -- a "special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently," as he put it. "They do not report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office. ... Congress has no oversight of it. It’s an executive assassination ring essentially...." Later, during the July 15, 2009, edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- a now-defunct nightly show on MSNBC -- the liberal host introduced a segment by saying that it was "time to look at what we know about the Bush-Cheney assassination teams." The segment addressed purported assassination efforts under both the CIA and the Pentagon. The latter "sent killing teams into the field, where they actually killed people," including those affiliated with al-Qaida, Olbermann said. Almost two years later, such comments became somewhat prescient, when details of the bin Laden raid became known. The counter-terrorist team that carried out the raid was the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DevGru for short. (The team is popularly, though incorrectly, known by one of its several former names, SEAL Team Six.") DevGru has been around since the early 1980s, usually shrouded in secrecy given its sensitive work. According to globalsecurity.org, it is a "component" of the Joint Special Operations Command. From what’s been reported, it’s unclear whether DevGru truly was answerable to Cheney during his two terms as vice president. But the group existed, and the bin Laden raid certainly suggests that it has the ability -- at least in some cases -- to act as an "assassination team." Still, the e-mail is wrong to suggest that Obama ever said or wrote that "Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team" before he became president (or, for that matter, after). 2011: "I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden." During his May 1, 2011, announcement of bin Laden’s death, Obama detailed his role in ordering the bin Laden raid. But he never claimed that he had created the unit that carried out the raid (which he didn’t, in any case). Obama said in his announcement that shortly after he took office, "I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al-Qaida, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network. … Last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice. "Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body." In a lengthy interview conducted on May 4, 2011, Obama sounded a similar note. "Obviously we have extraordinary guys," Obama told Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes. "Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they'd bring back to me. Make a full presentation. We would ask questions. We had multiple meetings in the Situation Room in which we would map out -- and we would actually have a model of the compound and discuss how this operation might proceed, and what various options there were because there was more than one way in which we might go about this." We did not find any evidence that Obama had claimed to have created the special forces team that carried out the raid. 2008: "Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty and must be captured alive and given a fair trial." Obama never said this. In fact, he took the opposite stance in one of the presidential debates in 2008. "If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act, and we will take them out," Obama said. "We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority." After the raid, we rated his promise to "kill bin Laden" as a Promise Kept. The closest we could find was a comment -- quickly retracted -- that was made in 2003 by Howard Dean. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time. In December 2003, Dean told the Concord Monitor that he had "resisted pronouncing a sentence (on bin Laden) before guilt is found. I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials." After a flurry of condemnations, Dean reversed course just a few hours later. He told the Associated Press that, "as an American, I want to make sure he gets the death penalty he deserves." He also issued a statement that said in part, "Bin Laden has admitted that he is responsible for killing 3,000 Americans as well as scores of men, women and children around the world. This is exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for." 2011: "I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden." Obama didn’t use the phrasing cited in the chain e-mail, but as we indicated earlier, there’s no question that he took responsibility for ordering the raid. There is evidence that U.S. forces would have accepted a surrender by bin Laden, rather than killing him, under certain circumstances. After the raid, according to ABC News, State Department legal adviser Harold Koh wrote in a blog post that forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had "surrendered in a way that they could safely accept" in accordance with the laws of armed conflict which require the acceptance of a "genuine offer" of surrender, "clearly communicated by the surrendering party" under circumstances where it would be feasible for the forces to accept the offer of surrender. Still, Koh wrote that bin Laden was a lawful target under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001. It allows military force against those that have "planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks" of Sept. 11, 2001. 2008: "Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated." This statement has a grain of truth, but it is exaggerated. During the campaign, Obama made no secret of his disagreement with elements of the Bush Administration’s national security policy. He promised to "close the detention facility at Guantanamo" (which we have rated a Promise Broken) and to "end the use of torture without exception" (which we have rated In the Works). Obama’s desire to close Guantanamo could be construed as him believing that the facility is "entirely unnecessary," but it’s wrong to say that he believed that detainees shouldn’t be interrogated. Interrogation is a standard procedure in law enforcement and intelligence. Obama wanted to end the use of torture. We also found no evidence that Obama uttered these words. 2011: "Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden." Some, including Cheney, have suggested that the Bin Laden raid benefited from intelligence gained through interrogation techniques that Obama has criticized as torture. This question has not been definitively settled, although the White House downplayed the possibility. "Reporting from detainees was just a slice of the information that has been gathered by incredibly diligent professionals over the years in the intelligence community," White House spokesman Jay Carney said on May 3, 2011. "And it simply strains credulity to suggest that a piece of information that may or may not have been gathered in -- eight years ago somehow directly led to a successful mission on Sunday. That's just not the case." John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that the words attributed to Obama on Guantanamo "are ludicrous. It is not something he would have said, and there is no evidence that it is something that he did say." And in this case too, we found no evidence that Obama uttered the words attributed to him. "As you may know I have been critical of Obama's national security policies," said Professor Jeff Addicott, director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University School of Law. "That said, I have never heard him make the 2008 remarks, and I follow him very closely. Our ruling A few of the sentiments have some link to reality – Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications. Once again a widely circulated chain e-mail is spreading ridiculous falsehoods about Obama. We rate this e-mail Pants on Fire.

pomt-02262	"Young women today in metropolitan areas" who are childless and single are out-earning childless, single young males.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/09/genevieve-wood/what-pay-gap-young-women-out-earn-men-cities-gop-p/	Why is it that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns? You likely heard the statistic, which was slapped all over the cable news networks Tuesday to mark "Equal Pay Day." To many Democrats, it symbolizes an unfairness in the pay structures of jobs all across America. But conservatives say the situation is more complex, and as much about life choices as some fundamental inequality. We watched the debate play out between conservative pundit Sabrina Schaeffer and liberal pundit Elizabeth Plank on MSNBC’s The Reid Report, and again later between former White House adviser Anita Dunn and conservative pundit Genevieve Wood on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper. "If you compare women to men in the same job with similar background, similar experiences that they bring to the table, the wage gap all but disappears," Wood said. "Women have made great strides. Instead of celebrating that, this is a political year, the White House wants to portray this war on women." "Not only are the numbers wrong -- young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country." Dunn pushed back. "I'm going to jump in a little on that because I think that it's true that women are making enormous progress, but you know, as well as I do, that as they get older in the workforce, that those disparities start to grow and there are all kinds of reasons that that happens and an important discussion across the board is how do we continue to make sure that the progress continues," she said. PolitiFact has given you the nuts and bolts about the 77 cents statistic -- you can read the two most important works in this area here and here. Basically, there is a wage gap, but it tends to disappear when you compare women and men in the exact same jobs who have the same levels of experience and education. We at PunditFact want to look at the argument being offered by conservatives. In this case, we are checking Wood -- a conservative pundit with the Heritage Foundation -- who said, "Young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, who are childless, single young women are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country." Basis of the claim Wood directed us to a 2012 U.S. News and World Report article that was reposted on the website of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The article includes the following line: "Census data from 2008 show that single, childless women in their 20s now earn 8 percent more on average than their male counterparts in metropolitan areas." That matches up to what Wood said on CNN. Drilling down further, the reference comes more directly from an analysis of Census Bureau data performed by James Chung of Reach Advisors. Reach Advisors is a private research firm based in New York. Chung spent about a year analyzing 2008 data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, looking at the earnings of men and women in metropolitan areas. The actual study was never released, just some of the findings, Chung told PunditFact this week. Among what was released in September 2010 was this: The median full-time salaries of young women in America’s metropolitan areas are 8 percent higher than those of the guys in their peer group. A breakdown provided for Time magazine included a look at specific cities. In Atlanta, young unmarried childless women made 21 percent more than men, Chung found. In Los Angeles, young women made 12 percent more than their cohorts. The news also was reported by NPR and CBS News. The American Enterprise Institute converted specific numbers into this graphic to show how women are out-earning men in some cases: Chung said he has not updated his analysis to how the figures have changed since 2008 and "no longer circulate (the analysis) as current since it's now four years out of date." No one else, that we’re aware of, has attempted to recreate Chung’s specific analysis, and we found no criticism of Chung’s methodology. We did come across an analysis by Pew Research, which looked earnings trends for all women between 25 and 34 (a broader and older group). Compared to all men of the same age, Pew Research found women earn 93 percent of what a man earns. That's a smaller gap than when considering all women and all men, Pew found. Analyzing Wood’s statement We sent Wood’s statement to Chung and asked for his take. While Wood is careful to note that she was talking about "childless, single young women" in metropolitan areas, Chung said that Wood failed to note that the analysis concerned median incomes between men and women. Why is that important? Median income figures look at earnings in the aggregate, rather than compare like jobs or professions. That leaves the claim open to the same criticism Republicans levy against Democrats when they claim women earn 77 cents for every $1 a man does. (Namely, that the statistic isn’t a true apple-to-apples comparison.) In the case of Chung’s findings, the reason why young women in metropolitan areas earn more than young men is that they are 50 percent more likely to graduate from college. "As a result, they populate more of the entry-level knowledge-based economy jobs than young men," Chung said. Chung said it "would be totally incorrect to imply that these women outearn men with similar jobs or similar educations." "The bottom line is that in a world where most players are looking for a sound bite to support a specific position, this is actually a rather complex issue," Chung said. "Things aren't exactly as equal as some people say, but it's not always as dire as others say." Our ruling Wood said, "Young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, who are childless, single young women are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country." The statement tracks back to a credible analysis of 2008 Census Bureau data that looks at median incomes in metropolitan areas -- a fact that Wood ignores. But she gets most of the other details correct, and while the information is now six years old, we were unable to track down more recent research to confirm or disprove the point. Finally, we should note that this comparison holds true because childless, single young women tend to have more education and qualify for higher paying jobs. Wood’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Genevieve Wood	None	None	None	2014-04-09T15:43:06	2014-04-08	['None']

pomt-09093	The U.S. spends $4 billion on research and development for energy, while spending $350 billion on oil from foreign countries, "many of whom are our enemies."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/23/jeff-greene/oil-imports-energy-and-enemies-part-its-right/	While much of Florida's attention has been focused on Republican Marco Rubio and former Republican Charlie Crist in the U.S. Senate race, there's also a vigorous contest on the Democratic side. Congressman Kendrick Meek of Miami has been challenged by Jeff Greene, a billionaire real estate investor from Palm Beach, and the two faced off in a debate in West Palm Beach on June 22, 2010. Being dutiful fact-checkers, we tuned in to see what was said. One of the topics was the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and what it means for national energy policy. "This situation never should have happened, it's a big failure of the career politicians like Kendrick Meek who have been sitting in Washington and not creating an energy policy," Greene said. "You know that we only spend $4 billion, this is what the Congress spends, on research and development for energy when we're sending $350 billion abroad to enemies, I mean, in some countries, so many of whom are enemies. We need to increase research and development." Greene's a political newcomer, but he slung the facts like an experienced political player. We decided to check Greene's facts on energy R&D and oil imports. We'll take it step by step. First, Greene said that Congress spends $4 billion on research and development for energy. We checked the last budget for the U.S. Department of Energy, for fiscal year 2010, and found that Greene was relatively close. Congress appropriated $4.9 billion in 2010 for basic science through the Energy Department. The department asked for a little more for next year, at $5.1 billion. The economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, sent some money -- about $1.6 billion -- to basic research. But the bulk of the stimulus money went to applied energy projects like weatherizing buildings, cleaning up nuclear sites, and electrical grid improvement. Next, we wanted to check whether we're spending $350 billion on foreign oil. This was a little trickier. An independent government agency, the Energy Information Administration, publishes regular information on how much oil we import in barrels. The agency also publishes average prices of crude oil. It does not, however, publish a number on annual spending on foreign oil. T. Boone Pickens, however, takes those numbers and combines them to calculate how much the U.S. spends on foreign oil on a monthly and annual basis. Pickens is an oil tycoon who advocates for energy independence through his website, The Pickens Plan. Keep in mind these numbers are an approximation based on average price, not actual spending. For the last 12 months, from April 2009 to May 2010, the U.S. spent about $314 billion on foreign oil, according to the Pickens numbers. The cost of imported oil has been even more in the past, when the price and consumption were higher. We were more concerned with Greene's statement that we were sending money to countries that are our "enemies." The U.S. doesn't have an "enemies" list, but we have to note the U.S. does not buy imported oil from Iran or North Korea, two countries with whom we have chilly relations. (In fact, oil imports from Iran are banned by the U.S. government.) The country we imported the most oil from in 2009 was Canada, followed by Mexico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Russia, Algeria, Angola, Iraq, Brazil, Colombia, the Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Ecuador, the Netherlands, Norway, Equitorial Guinea, and others. (See the complete list.) Which of these countries are our "enemies"? We asked the Greene campaign for a response. Paul Blank, an adviser to the Greene campaign, said that Greene was speaking of individual Islamic extremists in the Middle East, not governments. The money the U.S. sends to the Middle East to buy oil can make its way into the pockets of terrorists indirectly, Blank said. We understand the point, but we're not going to delve into terror financing here, because it's not what Greene said. In fact, he said twice during the debate that we're sending money to countries that are our enemies. He said at another point, "We're sending $350 billion a year now to foreign countries to buy oil, many of whom are our enemies. And you know what, that shouldn't be happening." We're ruling here on Greene's statement that we're spending $4 billion on research and development for energy while spending $350 billion on foreign oil, which goes to some countries that are "our enemies." His numbers are close on how much we spend, but he's off about the countries being enemies. Canada and Mexico are friendly with the U.S. We may not always have the best relations with a few of the other countries on the list -- Venezuela comes to mind -- but we have a hard time seeing how any of them rise to the level of "enemy." So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Jeff Greene	None	None	None	2010-06-23T17:54:30	2010-06-22	['United_States']
pomt-06364	"Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/03/barack-obama/obama-says-health-law-will-kick-millions-next-year/	In a television interview with the Tampa Fox affiliate, President Barack Obama discussed last year’s sweeping health care legislation, a centerpiece of his re-election campaign and a favorite point of attack by his challengers. The law is designed to provide health insurance to nearly every American by creating insurance exchanges for people to purchase plans and expanding Medicaid for the poor. It includes an individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage in order to spread risk and costs across the population. That provision in particular is the subject of numerous court challenges and is the least popular aspect of the law. Interviewer Mark Wilson pointed to that fact in the Nov. 1, 2011, interview, noting "54 percent of Americans favor repealing some version some part of that law. As you know, Florida leads the way in repealing it. What would you do differently now with regards to health care reform, knowing what we know now?" Obama responded by touting some of the law’s benefits. "Well, look, keep in mind a million young people around the country have health care that didn't have it before because they can stay on their parents’ health care plan. Millions of families all across the country benefited from additional drug benefits as a consequence of that health care plan," the president said. "Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get health care next year because of that law." The "next year" part of that struck us as suspect, so we decided to check it out. The law and its many provisions are designed to take effect in steps over a period of years. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a timeline posted on its website explaining the phase-in. The changes set to take effect in 2012 mainly involve payments to Medicare. The individual mandate, along with Medicaid expansion and establishment of the insurance exchanges, doesn't kick in until 2014. Those are the provisions of the law expected to give millions of Americans access to health insurance, and thus health care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that next year only about 1 million more Americans will gain health insurance. The figure balloons to 19 million in 2014, and 30 million in 2016 when those concrete changes are fully implemented. Parts of the law already up and running -- which have chipped away at the number of uninsured Americans -- include policies for people with pre-existing conditions and an allowance for young adults to remain on their parents’ health plans up to age 26. We asked the White House what Obama’s "next year" claim was based on but did not hear back. In addition, as we’ve noted before, the individual mandate faces a significant battle in the courts and is likely to end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. If it is ruled unconstitutional, the CBO projects that 16 million fewer people will become insured. Other studies put that reduction at between 8 million and 24 million. Our ruling Obama said "Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law." The CBO, a nonpartisan source, predicts only 1 million people will benefit in 2012, with the significant increases coming in 2014 and 2016. Plus, the law’s future is uncertain. The president is understandably enthusiastic about seeing his signature legislation take effect. But he misstated the timing of how many people will gain health insurance and when. It’s not happening next year. We rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-11-03T17:35:54	2011-11-01	['United_States', 'Florida']

pomt-00066	Says Maine Democrat Jared Golden "supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/02/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-way-saying-jared-golden-wants-take-away-so/	Just days before voters head to the polls, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a new ad blasting Jared Golden, the Democratic candidate running for the U.S. House seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. The "Golden Years" ad targets senior voters by claiming that Golden will "steal" their golden years to "pay for his reckless agenda." Here's the NRCC ad in full: "They call them the golden years, when you’re supposed to enjoy the life you worked so hard to build. But politician Jared Golden wants to turn your golden years into his. Golden supports a reckless bill to end Medicare as we know it. And he supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs. Jared Golden would steal your golden years to pay for his reckless agenda. Maine seniors can’t afford that risk." The "reckless" bill the ad refers to is Sen. Bernie Sanders’ "Medicare for All" proposal, which Golden has said he supports, following improvements to the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives have continuously said that such a system would end Medicare "as we know it" by creating a new program funded by the government and open to everyone, not just those 65 and older. (See this fact-check.) Here, we are going to focus on the accusation that Golden "supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs." The claim is based on Golden’s one-time support of a statewide referendum, often referred to as "Homecare for All," that will appear on the ballot in Maine on Nov. 6. The initiative would raise taxes on wealthier Mainers to help pay for a universal home care program. While there is debate over who the tax will affect, it has no direct ties to Social Security, would not cause people to lose their benefits and Golden does not support it in its current form. The Maine referendum in question The citizen-initiated referendum would fund a home care program for elderly and disabled Mainers by implementing a tax on higher incomes in the state. It would also create a government board to administer the funds. The ballot question seeks to fund the system by adding a 3.8 percent surtax on incomes of more than $128,400. The Maine home care program would be paid for by collected on households earning income above $128,400. Funds would be managed by a board made up of industry representatives and home care recipients. The effort intends to solve a long-term problem in Maine’s home health care system, where aides make an average hourly age of $12.41, according to the Maine Labor Department. It is worth noting, too, that Maine holds the top spot as the oldest state in the country, according to a 2017 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which found the median age in Maine was 44.6, essentially unchanged from 2016. So how would this affect Social Security? It wouldn’t. The closest connection is the threshold in which the Maine home care tax would kick in, on incomes more than $128,400. That’s because the government funds Social Security by taxing incomes up to $128,400. The NRCC cites Golden’s one-time support of the initiative as an attempt to erode seniors’ Social Security to pay for the program. The group pointed to a May 2018 op-ed Golden penned in the Portland Press Herald. "If you’re like more than 98 percent of people in this state, you already pay a tax on all of the income you earn in order to fund Social Security, and your employer does the same," Golden wrote in the op-ed. "Individuals who are paid more than $128,400 a year, however, currently do not pay any Social Security tax on income greater than that amount. The referendum would ask them to pay a bit more of their fair share on all of their income, like the rest of us already do." But Golden’s campaign said he wrote that before language changed in the final wording of the bill. Golden actually no longer supports the bill, because it could apply to families earning more than $128,400 a year as opposed to individuals. Golden’s campaign manager Jon Breed told us that while Golden believes there is a growing problem in Maine's home health care system, he "does not agree that families with incomes over $128,000 should face a 3.8 percent tax increase." Since the bill’s language was altered, several analyses have concluded the measure would include married couples filing jointly. The NRCC also pointed us to a report on the proposal by the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a left-leaning research and policy organization. At one point in the analysis, it says that "Mainers will be asked whether to partially close the Social Security tax loophole to fund a universal home care program." The report says the initiative would be the first of its kind in the country, and creates a new tax structure for high income earners that picks up where Social Security taxes leaves off. The tax also applies to non-wage income, which is currently untaxed by payroll-type taxes. What does that all mean for Social Security? Not much, as the threshold is the referendum’s only link to Social Security. The home care program would be funded through a new tax on high earners, not Social Security. Our ruling The National Republican Campaign Committee said Golden "supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs." The group is referring to Golden’s previous support of a state referendum that will appear on the ballot in Maine and would implement a tax on wealthier Mainers to fund a home care program. (Golden’s campaign says he no longer supports it after a recent change.) The program would not result in cuts to Social Security. The NRCC distorted a thin link, as the Maine tax would be levied above the current Social Security cut-off of $128,400. Again, it would not result in a decrease of senior’s Social Security benefits.

pomt-05362	"The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-government-job-losses-his-watch-/	In a May 8, 2012, speech on the economy in Albany, N.Y., President Barack Obama sought to put the nation’s economic challenges on his watch in historical context. He especially sought to explain how hard it’s been to increase the national employment level when governments have been hemorrhaging jobs. These job losses, he suggested, have weighed down the comparatively healthy private-sector job-creation statistics. "It's worth noting, by the way -- this is just a little aside -- after there was a recession under Ronald Reagan, government employment went way up," Obama said. "It went up after the recessions under the first George Bush and the second George Bush. So each time there was a recession with a Republican president … we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment. The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me." That paragraph includes a lot of claims, but for this item, we’ll pare it down to one sentence: "The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me." To check this, we turned to employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We’ve defined "government employment" in the most expansive way -- a combination of federal, state and local government employment -- since Obama didn’t specify a particular level of government. (His press office did not return our inquiry for this story.) As we’ll see, the most difficult part of analyzing this claim is figuring out what time frame to use; using different periods can lead to different conclusions. So we’ll look at a few scenarios. Has government employment ever gone down previously "during a recession"? If you look at the double-dip recession that lasted from January 1980 to November 1982, government employment did go down during the recession. (Officially, these were two recessions during that stretch. However, they were so closely spaced, and with such a short "recovery" in between, that the statistics are a lot less messy if you consider them to be one long recession.) During the official period of this double-dip recession, government employment fell by 224,000 workers, or about 1.3 percent. The decline was even steeper if you start counting from the peak of government employment, which came four months into the recession, and if you stop at the low point for government employment, which came five months before the end of the recession. The decline over this period was 693,000 jobs, or 4.1 percent. Either of these two declines was steeper than what Obama has faced. In fact, between the most recent recession’s start (which occurred on President George W. Bush’s watch in December 2007) and its official end (under Obama in June 2009) government employment actually increased by 194,000 jobs, or a little under 1 percent. So Obama's claim is way off. Not only did another president experience a decline in government jobs during a recession, but even Obama himself experienced an increase during the recession he inherited. There is another way of looking at it, though. Has government employment ever gone down previously during a combined recession and recovery? You can also look at the combination of the recession and the recovery. April 2012, the latest month for which BLS data is available, represents the 52nd month after the starting date of the last recession, December 2007. In that time span, government payrolls have declined by 407,000, or about 1.8 percent. The equivalent month after the start of the 1980 recession is May 1984. Between January 1980 and May 1984, government payrolls fell by 98,000, or 0.6 percent. So counting both the recession itself as well as the length of the current recovery, government jobs did fall in the 1980-1982 recession. While the recession that started in 2007 has been more severe, the recession and recovery in 1980-1982 did in fact result in lost jobs. This further undercuts the accuracy of Obama’s statement. Has government employment ever gone down previously during a recovery? You can also look at recoveries by themselves, ignoring what happened with government jobs when the recession was officially under way. If you start counting with the final month of the 1980-1982 recession (November 1982) the numbers of government jobs essentially stagnated for more than a year. In November 1982, the number stood at 15,977,000. Fourteen months later, in January 1984, it had only increased by 33,000, a jump of two-tenths of 1 percent. In fact, it took until August 1984 -- 21 months after the end of the recession -- for government employment to once again reach its initial pre-recession level. And it took an additional 11 months for government employment to reach its recession-era peak. This means that government employment finally crawled out of its recession-era hole 32 months after the end of the recession, and a whopping 67 months -- that’s five and a half years -- after the recession began. By then, the economy had improved enough to carry Reagan to a landslide re-election victory. By contrast, private-sector jobs began a consistent and years-long rise almost exactly as the recession ended in November 1982 -- more than a year before government jobs began to recover. In other words, when Obama says that "each time there was a recession with a Republican president … we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment," he’s not accurate. Reagan hardly rode robust government job growth to a national economic recovery. Quite the contrary: Under Reagan, a huge number of government jobs were lost during the recession, and it took more than a year after the recovery began to even begin making a dent in the government-job deficit from the recession. Where Obama has a point Obama is correct that government employment did go up under Reagan -- eventually. It just took a while before this expansion gathered steam. In the three years between January 1984 and January 1987, when the broader recovery was already well under way, government employment soared by about 6.4 percent, with consistent month-to-month gains. That’s very healthy growth, but it’s important to note that those government job increases came after the larger economy was back humming along. Obama, by contrast, has experienced nothing like that. Government employment did rise modestly during the official recessionary period, government employment peaked in April 2009 (not counting a stretch in mid-2010 when the Census Bureau made a lot of temporary hires). But then it began falling -- severely. Since April 2009, the number of government jobs at all levels has fallen by 706,000, or 3 percent. While that’s proportionately smaller than the peak-to-trough decline in government employment in the 1980-1982 recession, government employment in the current recovery shows no signs of starting a sustained increase. At the equivalent point in the recovery from the 1980-1982 recession, government employment had already rebounded by 4 percent. Obama can only dream of such numbers. Our ruling Obama is wrong when he suggests that "the only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me." It's not true if you just look at the recessionary period itself, and it's not true if you look at a combination of the recession and the recovery -- in both cases, it happened during the 1980-1982 recession. And while government employment did eventually go up following the Reagan-era recession, the rise began more than a year after private-sector employment picked up, which negates Obama's argument that his predecessors were able to compensate for weak private-sector job creation with accelerated government hiring.

pomt-07212	"Every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/jun/05/don-zimmerman/gop-activist-says-federal-government-runs-backgrou/	Urging state lawmakers to revive a proposal barring airport security personnel in Texas from touching passengers’ private parts, an Austin member of the State Republican Executive Committee said federal authorities already know plenty about those who fly. "The fact is, every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you," Don Zimmerman said in a May 31 press release from the Texas Republican Freedom Coalition. "They know who you are before you board the plane." Pre-flight background checks on me, you and even Mrs. Olsen down the street? After asking Zimmerman for his backup information, we turned to the agency that oversees the security checks of air passengers, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. Online, we found a November 2010 TSA press release in which Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Homeland Security, announced that passengers on flights within or bound for the United States were now being checked against government watch lists, in keeping with "a key 9/11 Commission recommendation." The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required Homeland Security to compare passenger information to watch lists kept by the government, according to an administration web post. That job, previously handled by airlines, was fully implemented by late November 2010. The agency’s program, Secure Flight, checks each potential passenger’s name, birth date and gender against terrorist watch lists, the release says, before passengers receive boarding passes. According to information on another administration web site, TSA matches the name, gender and birth date submissions by passengers against government watch lists to identify known and suspected terrorists; prevent individuals on the government’s "No Fly List" from boarding and Identify individuals on the "Selectee List" for enhanced screening. According to an undated post on the agency’s site, fewer than 50,000 people are on the lists, which consist of individuals "identified by law enforcement and intelligence entities as legitimate threats to transportation who require either additional screening or are prohibited from boarding an aircraft." Separately, Fox News in December 2009 quoted an unidentified senior administration official saying more than 400,000 individuals are in the Terrorist Screening Data Base (TSDB), which Fox called the main identities database within the government for international terrorism. Those names are taken from the list of 550,000 individuals in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), described in the news report as the intelligence community’s central repository of information on known and suspected international terrorists. Fox News said less than 4,000 of the names in the TSDB are on the "No Fly" list and another 14,000 names are on the "Selectee" list, which mandates calls for mandatory secondary screening. The agency says the lists are kept by an FBI entity, the Terrorist Screening Center, which quotes a Homeland Security directive stating that "only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism" are supposed to be on the watch lists. U.S. citizens are included on the list, it says, if there is a reasonable suspicion that they are known or reasonably suspected of terrorism. However, the center says in another online post that 95 percent of the individuals on the watch list are not U.S. citizens or legal residents and the "vast majority" are not even in the U.S." The release says that under Secure Flight, "99 percent of passengers are cleared to print boarding passes at home or at a self-serve kiosk." Individuals "found to match watch list parameters will be subject to secondary screening, a law enforcement interview or prohibition from boarding an aircraft, depending on the specific case." Is checking watch lists equivalent to doing background checks? Nope, said Dallas-based TSA spokesman Luis Casanova. "Bottom line," Casanova told us by email, "we compare against watch lists, we do not conduct background checks (unless you are coming to work with us)." Zimmerman guided us to the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center, whose executive director, Marc Rotenberg, said in an interview that after 9/11, the government sought to require full-fledged checks of passengers, but those plans were cancelled in 2004. He called the current comparison of passenger information to names on watch lists "streamlined background checks." Law professors with expertise in this area said the use of watch lists isn’t the same as background checks. Matthew Finkin of the University of Illinois, who specialties include privacy issues, said background checks, most often invoked by prospective employers, commonly consider someone’s credit worthiness, outstanding criminal charges and civil litigation, bankruptcies, driving and marital records -- even their use of social networking. He said he’s not heard of airlines running background checks of all passengers: "The airlines are not going to spend that kind of money. Why would they care if you have a speeding ticket?" Counter-terrorism legal expert Gregory Maggs of the George Washington University Law School similarly said background checks occur when individuals apply for government jobs or seek a security clearance. Doing them for every airline passenger would be unmanageable, he said: "Too many people buying airline tickets." Zimmerman said by email that the FBI and TSA are "large, powerful bureaucratic organizations with very significant resources to check on travelers. It would also make sense that they would not divulge all the depth of details of what they do." Upshot: Every airline passenger must hurdle a check of basic personal information against a federal database before stepping onto a commercial flight.

pomt-03363	Says that in Curry County, "if you make a 911 call you’re likely to wait for an hour for a response."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/jul/13/jeff-kruse/likely-911-response-time-curry-county-one-hour/	On the final day of the 2013 Oregon Legislature, lawmakers approved a bill that will allow Gov. John Kitzhaber and leaders to declare a public safety state of emergency in certain rural counties hit hard by the expiration of federal timber payments. A state takeover is certainly a radical idea. A state takeover that also imposes temporary taxes to help pay for the state takeover is a radical and horrifying idea for voters of this tax-shy county. The governor stepped up his efforts to pass House Bill 3453 after voters in Curry and Josephine counties rejected tax measures in May. Sen. Jeff Kruse, R-Roseburg, dislikes the bill but voted for it, noting on the Senate floor that the situation is dire in Curry County. "Currently if you make a 911 call you’re likely to wait for an hour for a response. That’s the reality," he said. Is that true? Is that the wait time for a response to a 911 call in Curry County? We called the Curry County Sheriff’s Office, figuring Sheriff John Bishop would know. The executive assistant, Lisa Combs, said that an hour wait is not the norm. But they’re down to four road deputies -- plus two deputies dedicated to marine calls -- to cover 1,648 square miles. "Cold calls sometimes do take a long time," Combs said. "We try to respond to high priority in-progress type calls but again, they’re not on 24-7. If we have to call someone in the middle of the night, it takes time." "Some calls, we’re there in two minutes or in five minutes, but if we only have four deputies and I’ve got one on and" he’s in one side of the county and the call’s from the other side, it will take awhile, she said. In May, Curry voters rejected a $4.5 million five-year property tax increase that would have boosted the numbers from four deputies to 12, allowing them to be positioned at both ends of the county. Curry residents pay the second lowest effective tax rate in Oregon, according to 2012-13 state figures and the second lowest permanent tax rate as of 2010-11. David Brock Smith, chairman of the Curry County Board of Commissioners, said the county had more than a dozen deputies on patrol a decade or so ago. The failed tax increase would have paid for two deputies to be on patrol 24 hours a day, seven days a week, he said. "So in any given time the maximum would be less than 30 minutes" response time, he said. Cities within the county have police but they are limited to calls within city limits, and they don’t provide around the clock patrol either. Nearby Josephine County has it bad as well. In May, National Public Radio aired a story about a woman’s harrowing 911 call to Josephine County dispatchers, in August 2012. The terrified woman reported that her ex-boyfriend was trying to break into her house. He had put her in the hospital before. But it was 5 a.m. Saturday, and deputies were not available. The call transferred to Oregon State Police, also unavailable. The ex-boyfriend pried open the front door and attacked the caller. We checked in with Kruse. He said it was not his intent to convey that an hour wait is the norm in Curry County. "It’s not always the case, but potentially, it could be," he said. "There are times when there’s nobody on patrol. They just don’t have the manpower." The drive between Brookings in the south and Port Orford in the north takes about an hour, according to Mapquest. If a deputy is occupied in the south and a call comes in from the north, yes, the response time could take an hour, or more. We did circle back to the Curry County Sheriff’s Office to ask if there are average response times for when a deputy is dispatched. "I couldn’t even begin to tell you," Combs said. So, we don’t have a breakdown of response times for 911 calls, which means we can’t tell you how the hour wait compares with any sort of norm. Kruse’s use of the word "likely" could be taken by some listeners to mean "more likely than not," and there’s no evidence to suggest that is the case. Sometimes the response time in Curry County is better and sometimes it is worse, making the statement partially accurate. Response times can range from mere minutes to the next day of business, depending on the details of the call. We find his statement is missing important details and rate it Half True.

pomt-09591	“The largest tax increase that we have ever had in our state is yours – it is the business margins tax that you signed, governor.”	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/21/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-revised-business-tax-created-states/	The revamped business tax was a point of contention between Gov. Rick Perry and Republican opponent Kay Bailey Hutchison, a U.S. senator from Texas, during the first GOP gubernatorial debate. Portraying Perry as an enemy of business, Hutchison lashed out at him for signing legislation in 2006 that restructured the state’s franchise tax as part of a tax swap intended to reduce school property taxes. “The largest tax increase that we have ever had in our state is yours – it is the business margins tax that you signed, governor,” Hutchison said. Perry rebutted later in the debate that he has in fact cut the business tax — a claim we'll address at a later date. (When it comes to tax matters, it's dangerous for truth-testers as well as politicians to bite off more than they can chew.) For now, we'll gnaw on Hutchison's claim: Did the revised franchise tax, often called the margins tax, amount to the biggest tax increase in Texas history? For most qualifying businesses, the franchise tax is 1 percent of their total annual revenue minus one of three options: the cost of goods sold, employee compensation or 30 percent of total revenue. In support for its claim that the revised tax was indeed historic, the Hutchison camp offered a background paper citing several news articles and government documents. Among the citations was an item from the Dallas Morning News Trail Blazers campaign blog, also mentioned by Hutchison in the debate, stating that the "largest tax increase in Texas" occurred under Perry's leadership. But the newspaper made an important distinction that Hutchison omitted in the debate: The article included both a tobacco tax and the franchise tax as the sources of that increase. In the information that it provided after the debate, the Hutchison campaign said that "Perry's new margin tax cost taxpayers $8.8 billion" over the 2008-09 biennium and compared that figure with the estimated $5.7 billion tax package signed into law in 1987 by Gov. Bill Clements. At the time, the 1987 legislation was widely reported to be the largest tax hike in the state’s history. But it turns out there are fatal flaws in the Hutchison campaign's math. For instance, the $8.8 billion figure is the total amount generated by the franchise tax, not the net increase resulting from the revision that became law under Perry. So it's misleading for the campaign to cite that number when discussing tax increases. The actual increase — revenue above what the old franchise tax would have brought in — was about $3 billion, significantly less than what had been projected. Let's compare that with the largest single piece of the Clements-era tax package: a hike in the sales tax. After it was enacted, sales tax revenues went up $4.2 billion during 1988-89 compared with the previous biennium. If you're keeping track, that's significantly more than the $3 billion wrought by changes in the franchise tax. However, the Texas state comptroller's office says that it cannot say with certainty how much of that 1988-89 sales tax revenue increase can be attributed to the legislation per se and how much is due to other factors, such as increased consumer spending. As we evaluated Hutchison's claim, we also learned that the broadening of the franchise tax did not necessarily mean that businesses paid more taxes overall after the 2006 changes. Some companies actually wound up paying less, thanks to the reduction in school property taxes that was part of the deal. According to experts, there are several ways to try to determine which was the state's largest tax increase in history. We used the simplest, looking at total dollars brought in. Another way would be to calculate the percentage increase of franchise tax revenue and compare that to percentage increases in other state taxes. Taking the percentage approach, we found that the 51 percent increase in franchise tax revenue for 2008-09, compared with the previous biennium, was not the largest for that tax. After the Legislature revamped the franchise tax in 1991, revenue grew 92 percent over the next two years. Hutchison's campaign took the dollar approach to the franchise tax instead of percentages. But on either basis, her claim is flawed. First, the franchise tax that Perry signed did not result in an $8.8 billion increase in tax revenue. Second, it appears that previous revisions of the sales tax have resulted in larger revenue increases. Third, examined on a percentage basis, the new franchise tax didn't set a revenue record. Hutchison bit off more than she could chew with her campaign rhetoric. Her claim that the expansion of the business franchise tax represents the largest increase in state history is False.

pomt-08394	Says John Kitzhaber wants a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/23/chris-dudley/chris-dudley-says-john-kitzhaber-wants-sales-tax-s/	Sometimes, a claim comes along that’s so juicy it makes PolitiFact Oregon salivate. This is one: Republican Chris Dudley charges that his opponent in Oregon’s race for governor, Democrat John Kitzhaber, wants a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes. He makes the claim in a new television ad, "Again," which has audio and video footage of Kitzhaber from various events, including the Portland City Club in 2000 and a KGW/The Oregonian debate in April. Here’s the full text: Voiceover (VO): Kitzhaber failed Oregon because his answer is always the same. John Kitzhaber: I have probably had more tax increases attached to my name -- proposals I oughta say -- than any other governor. VO: Now he’s at it again. John Kitzhaber: Obviously, a retail sales tax is one of the options. VO: Even worse, Kitzhaber says we need a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes. VO: Taxing the unemployed? We need jobs, not more taxes. VO: John Kitzhaber, even his new ideas are old. It’s time for a new direction. In the ad, the Dudley campaign pulls this from an Oct. 8 Portland Tribune article: "Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the ‘sales tax’ term.... As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income ...." (Dudley emphasis) Squeezing taxes from the unemployed to prop up state spending? How mean! But take a look at the words from the story left out of the ad: "Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the "sales tax" term, though he said it’s just one of the options that should be under discussion so the state is not so reliant on income taxes. As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income taxes to pay for the bulk of its general fund budget." (our emphasis) Very sneaky. Kitzhaber has long advocated for a sales tax to help stabilize Oregon’s roller-coaster reliance on personal and corporate income taxes. The Portland Tribune article clearly shows that Kitzhaber was not advocating a sales tax as a means to get more money out of the out-of-work, but to increase the diversity of Oregon’s tax base. An August 2010 study by The Tax Foundation confirmed Oregon’s heavy reliance on individual income taxes, ranking the state No. 2, just after Maryland. But before handing down a ruling, PolitiFact Oregon wanted to check out tax burdens in Washington and in Oregon, just to see how a sales tax would affect the poor, which presumably includes many folks out of work. Oregon taxes income -- including unemployment compensation, as does the federal government -- but not sales. Washington does not tax income, but assesses a base 6.5 percent tax on goods. In Seattle, the sales tax is 9.5 percent. We found an interesting study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank out of Washington, D.C. Its November 2009 report found that Washington was the most regressive state in the country, where households in the lowest 20 percent spend about 17.3 percent of their income on taxes. In Oregon, the figure for that income group is 8.7 percent. The average among states is 10.9 percent. Clearly, it’s a burden to be poor in Washington. Kitzhaber never said anything about implementing a sales tax to make sure the unemployed pay into Oregon’s tax base. We rate this Pants on Fire: The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Comment on this item.	None	Chris Dudley	None	None	None	2010-10-23T06:00:00	2010-10-14	['None']

pomt-12001	DACA was "a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/22/roy-moore/debate-roy-moore-claims-daca-immigration-rules-vio/	During a debate for Alabama’s open U.S. Senate seat, former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore blasted a controversial immigration policy recently ended by President Donald Trump as being illegal. Republican Roy Moore squared off in Montgomery on Sept. 21, 2017, against U.S. Sen. Luther Strange, who replaced Jeff Sessions when Sessions became attorney general. The winner of the GOP runoff on Sept. 26 faces Democrat Doug Jones on Dec. 12. Moore, who was removed from the court in 2003 after refusing a federal order to take down a monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building, attacked Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The program protected from deportation immigrants who came to the United States as children and lived here illegally, known as Dreamers. Sessions, calling the situation a "failure to enforce immigration laws," announced a phaseout of DACA on Sept. 5. (Renewal applications can be submitted until Oct. 5.) The Trump administration said no current beneficiaries will be affected before March 5, 2018, giving Congress time to act. "Obviously, Congress did not do their duty on DACA, which was a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws," Moore said. He said he didn’t consider the policy valid, preferring action from lawmakers. Congress hasn’t passed any laws concerning Dreamers, but does that mean DACA violated current law? It’s certainly been a contentious policy that has caused a lot of debate, but there is no court ruling directly tied to the program’s constitutionality. No DACA decision DACA is a policy, not a law, and is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Her memo outlined prosecutorial discretion to focus resources on removing immigrants who met the department’s priorities while protecting Dreamers from deportation. It does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people approved for DACA, but it does give a temporary reprieve from deportation. Immigration laws were "not designed to be blindly enforced" without considering individual cases and circumstances, Napolitano wrote. "Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here." DACA’s critics say that protecting Dreamers through the executive branch, as Napolitano did, instead of through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power. But the judicial branch hasn’t weighed in on the issue. "There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional," Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University, previously told PolitiFact. A lawsuit challenging the program was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. "So there was never any adjudication on the merits," he said. Following a lawsuit from Texas and 25 other states, a federal district judge did block an expanded version of DACA and another program that offered a reprieve from deportation, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving the lower court’s ruling in place. The DACA expansion and DAPA were not halted based on their constitutionality, however, but rather that the federal government hadn’t met some technical requirements. Those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, Kalhan said, "based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued." A final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said. "And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality — it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing," Kalhan said. Our ruling Moore said DACA was "a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws." The DACA program was part of a 2012 Homeland Security memo that said Dreamers would not be the focus of deportation efforts. It didn’t grant Dreamers legal status and only gave them temporary protection from deportation. While critics have called the guidance executive overreach and argued it is illegal, there has been no court ruling calling the policy unconstitutional. It remained in place until the Trump administration announced its end. Moore may feel DACA violated law, and the program has faced legal challenges, but he can’t make that claim as a definitive statement of fact. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05163	"Romneycare covers abortion, illegal immigrants and has a public option. Obamacare does not."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-compares-elements-romneycare-obamaca/	The health care debate has landed on the virtual battleground of Facebook, with comparisons being made between President Barack Obama’s 2010 law and the bill that Republican Mitt Romney signed in Massachusetts. A reader asked us to check this graphic that claims "Romneycare covers abortion, illegal immigrants and has a public option. Obamacare does not." We’ve also seen that statement repeated on Twitter. Obamacare, of course, is the familiar name for the Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in 2010 and signed by Obama. It seeks health coverage for every American by requiring most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine. To help people meet that requirement, it expands Medicaid for the poor, provides subsidies for people of modest means to buy insurance, and sets up fines that have the effect of encouraging large employers to provide insurance for their employees. It also sets up insurance exchanges where individuals and businesses can purchase private insurance. Those elements are also the backbone of the health care reform Romney signed in Massachusetts in 2006. Architects of both plans acknowledge that the Massachusetts law served as the model for the national plan. As for the specific comparisons between the two, we’ll take them one by one. Romneycare vs. Obamacare on abortion PolitiFact looked at the abortion issue when Romney’s Republican primary challengers accused him of enacting taxpayer-funded abortions in Massachusetts. The state law itself does not specify what services are covered and what aren’t. Search the text of it, and "abortion" is nowhere to be found. But because of a 1981 Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts, the cost of abortions must be included in publicly subsidized plans. Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. That includes coverage for Massachusetts residents enrolled in Medicaid. So it’s true that the plan makes abortion accessible through private insurance plans subsidized by the state. But that’s dictated by a court ruling that long predated Romney’s term as governor. On the federal level, coverage of abortion is a bit more complicated. Here’s how we’ve explained a similar claim: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided by Medicaid or in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care exchanges established by the law raised the question of whether private companies should be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do) when operating through the exchanges. And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? What resulted was essentially a compromise. When the exchanges begin operating in 2014, some states will ban all abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on that state’s exchange. Doing so is allowed by a state "opt-out" clause that is part of the health care law. Beyond that, every state must offer at least one plan on its exchange that doesn’t cover abortion. In addition, no private insurer will be forced to cover abortion. Unless a state exercises the opt-out clause, insurers will be allowed to sell policies on the exchanges that include abortion coverage. To allow this, yet still abide by the Hyde Amendment, sponsors of the bill drafted a procedure to differentiate between dollars spent on abortion coverage and dollars spent for everything else. (Anti-abortion advocates have consistently argued that the approach doesn’t offer strong enough protections to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion.) The complex funding mechanisms make the question of whether Obamacare covers abortion a little fuzzy. But clearly the law provides some access to the service. Romneycare vs. Obamacare on illegal immigrants Immigration is another complicated area for the two health care laws. Before the Massachusetts law was enacted, the state had a program on the books called the Uncompensated Care Pool, which dates to the mid-1980s. When Romney’s health law passed, the name changed but the eligibility didn’t, said Brian Rosman, research director for the Massachusetts nonprofit group Health Care for All. Now known as the Health Safety Net, it reimburses hospitals and health care centers that provide care for the poor and uninsured. Who can get the care? We found the answer on the Health Safety Net website: "Am I Eligible? The Health Safety Net (Free Care) is for uninsured or underinsured Massachusetts residents who do not have access to affordable health coverage. People of any income with large medical bills that they cannot pay are also eligible. Your citizenship or immigration status does not affect your eligibility." Said Rosman: "People don’t enroll in the program. They don’t get cards. Their benefits are just through the reimbursement to the health provider." That differs from other benefits outlined in the Massachusetts law, which specifies that only people there legally can receive Medicaid benefits or government subsidies to buy health insurance. The Health Safety Net has no such restriction, although any benefit to illegal immigrants is indirect, since the money reimburses health providers, not individuals. "It’s a state-administered program that essentially shares the cost of financing the care for uninsured and underinsured residents of the state across the whole health care system," said Sarah Iselin, former commissioner of the state agency that administers the Health Safety Net. She pointed out that the 2006 law expanded coverage for people who qualify for programs specifically off limits to illegal residents. The Health Safety Net only applies to people who have been determined to be ineligible for those programs. Similar to the Massachusetts program, Obamacare could benefit illegal immigrants only in a very indirect way. First, what it doesn’t do: The law does not make people who are in the country illegally eligible for health insurance through the exchanges -- in fact it specifically bars them; it doesn’t allow them to get tax credits for purchasing insurance, and it doesn’t allow them to receive Medicaid benefits. What it does do: The law provides grants to community health care centers for construction and expansion. The National Association of Community Health Centers noted in 2010 that such centers "make up the largest national network of primary care providers. Most health center patients have low incomes, are uninsured or publicly insured, and are members of racial/ethnic minority groups." "The community health centers serve anybody who needs health care, and I’m sure that will include undocumented people," said Rosman. The Facebook post said Obamacare doesn’t "cover" illegal immigrants. It’s correct there are no coverage benefits for which undocumented people could be eligible, such as Medicaid or tax credits. The law did provide $11 billion over the first five years for community health centers, which treat people regardless of immigration status. That expands access to care at places where poor, undocumented people would have gone for care prior to the law, but it’s not the same as coverage. Romneycare vs. Obamacare on a public option This part isn’t complicated at all: Neither plan has a public option. In Massachusetts a public option would be a program in which the state is the insurer, and Massachusetts has no such plan. The state oversees the health care exchange, but the plans offered there are all private. The reform law expanded Medicaid in Massachusetts, but that’s a program only for people who cannot afford to purchase insurance. We checked with Rosman on this too. "There’s nothing even close to (a public option)," he said, adding that it was never considered in the debate about the law. Early versions of the national health bill included a public option, with the idea that a government plan might be cheaper than private plans, making insurance available to the very poor. But the public option had many opponents in Congress and did not make it into the final law. All together now The Facebook post boils down complicated pieces of legislation to a few simple points. But its summary is short on accuracy. Here’s what we found: Abortion: Romneycare enables people to purchase plans that include abortion coverage. Obamacare does as well, but it also lets states opt out and lets individuals buy plans that don’t cover the procedure. Illegal immigrants: Romneycare’s Health Safety Net reimburses health providers who care for the poor, regardless of whether they’re in the country legally. Obamacare provides grants to community health centers, which also treat anyone who can’t afford to pay for health care. Neither law provides any form of insurance coverage to undocumented people. Public option: Neither plan has a public option in which the government acts as the insurer. The Facebook post got a few things right but most things wrong, particularly about Romney’s plan.

pomt-09326	"Cell phone numbers go public this month."	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/14/ken-legler/rep-ken-legler-said-cell-phone-numbers-will-be-rel/	Fact or fiction: Your cell phone number will soon be released to telemarketing companies and — the kicker — your provider also will charge you for incoming sales calls. That's what state Rep. Ken Legler, R-Pasadena, said this week via his Twitter account. His Monday warning: "Cell phone numbers go public this month." His message linked to a note published on his Facebook page the same day: "REMINDER..... all cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketing companies and you will start to receive sales calls. YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE CALLS." To prevent this, Legler instructed, people should call "888-382-1222, the number for the National DO NOT CALL list... It blocks your number for five (5) years. You must call from the cell phone number you want to have blocked. You cannot call from a different phone number. HELP OTHERS BY PASSING THIS ON." That breathless alert caught our eye. Yet by the time we looked into Legler's Facebook post, it'd been yanked. Legler told us Tuesday that his campaign "fell victim to urban legend and we put it out there and I take full responsibility... we shouldn't have put it out there." After our inquiry, Legler posted a retraction on his Facebook explaining that a volunteer campaign staff member had received the e-mail warning from "what we considered a reliable source" and "felt it was important to keep the public up to date." Legler explained to us that his aides will post notes like press releases from state agencies on his Facebook and Twitter account while he is responsible for the personal messages on both sites. Brad Tegeler, Legler's chief of staff, said he recognized the e-mail as one that had landed in his inbox in the past, and checked to see it if it was true. When he realized it wasn't, Legler's office pulled the Facebook note down "not more than half a day" later. Meanwhile, Legler's Twitter message remained online for the more than 3,000 people who follow his feed to see as we finished this article. (Nearly 1,100 friends could have seen his Facebook post.) Next, we called the National Do Not Call Registry listed in Legler's note to to check on what happens when individuals phone in. A recording by the Federal Trade Commission, which operates the registry, tells callers that anyone can register their home or cell phone number to permanently stop receiving telemarketing calls. It's not just a five-year reprieve, as Legler's note puts it. This gaffe isn't new; a Google search for the same text as Legler's Facebook entry shows similar incorrect warnings — apparently linked to rumors about a national cell-phone directory — posted on blogs starting in 2004. Mitch Katz, a public affairs specialist at the FTC, said this "rumor has been going around for five years and there have been attempts to (create a cell phone directory) but they've all fallen apart." If a cell phone directory is ever created, Katz said, it's likely to work differently: People would have to opt in to get their number listed. The FTC also has debunked the incorrect message on its Web site, which states: "You may have received an e-mail telling you that your cell phone is about to be assaulted by telemarketing calls as a result of a new cell phone number database; however, that is not the case. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers. Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers don’t call consumers on their cell phones without their consent." We rate Legler's yanked statement as False.

pomt-05674	"This (Independent Payment Advisory Board) board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/mar/15/pat-boone/pat-boone-says-ipab-rations-care-pay-wasteful-spen/	Pat Boone is best known for his hits of the 1950s like "Love Letters in the Sand" and "I Almost Lost My Mind." But the song he’s been singing lately about Medicare is turning into a moldy oldie. Granted, Boone doesn’t literally sing in the ads he’s done as national spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, a conservative political group that focuses on older Americans. But he’s got distortions of the 2010 health care law on high rotation. The latest ads feature Boone criticizing prominent Democrats who supported the health care law, including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. Here’s part of Boone’s criticism; it focuses on the law’s Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB: "This IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending. Your choices could be limited and you may not be able to keep your own doctor. ... Washington politicians, like Bill Nelson, are ignoring the problem, putting their own re-elections first. Call Sen. Nelson. Urge him to support real Medicare reform and protect our seniors." The ad makes several claims, but here, we’re going to specifically fact-check Boone’s claim that the IPAB "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending." The 2010 health care law created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unwilling or unable to slow the increasing costs of Medicare, the federal program that pays for seniors’ health care. In years past, growing Medicare spending has been an ongoing concern of the federal government, as well as analysts on the left and the right. Under the health care reform law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed pre-set targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendations within a set time, IPAB’s recommendations automatically go into effect. (For a more detailed explanation of how this would work, we recommend this April 2011 report from the independent Kaiser Family Foundation.) We should emphasize here that IPAB recommendations would not apply to any particular individual, but would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program. Given Boone’s rhetoric, some people could get the wrong impression that the board would review individual patient treatments and deny care. That’s not the case. Still, the IPAB has become one of the more contentious points of the health care law; even some members of Congress who voted for the overall health care law don’t like the IPAB. Recently, Congress held hearings on repealing the board. The hearings were organized by opponents of the IPAB, but people who testified raised concerns that IPAB’s powers are so limited that it’s only real recourse is to reduce payments for doctors and other health care providers, and that could up putting pressure on patient care. We should note that these concerns are also present under the current system, in which Congress takes a more active role. Boone calls the members of the IPAB "15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats." Rather than career government workers, the law says IPAB members shall include people with national recognition for health care expertise, including "different professionals, broad geographic representation, and a balance between urban and rural representatives." (Board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.) On the point of accountability, we’ll just repeat that Congress retains the power to overrule any IPAB recommendations, though there are special rules in place so that the recommendations cannot be filibustered or otherwise delayed. The IPAB has restrictions on what it can recommend in the name of cost savings. It can’t raise rates, drop beneficiaries or ration care. Here’s the exact language from the law itself: "The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria." Boone says the IPAB seeks to reduce Medicare spending so the government can spend money on other "wasteful" things. But the IPAB is intended to slow Medicare spending if its growth exceeds pre-defined targets. It’s also capped on how much it can reduce spending: It can recommend measures to bring Medicare within specific cost-savings targets and no more. The board was created to address rapid health care inflation. Both Democrats and Republicans recognize that as a problem. Conservatives have their own plans to limit Medicare costs, primarily by moving Medicare to private insurance companies and giving seniors voucher-like premium support to help buy health coverage. We’ve debunked attacks on their ideas, too. When we asked for back-up for the ad’s claims, a public relations firm for the 60 Plus Association sent us links to generic news coverage that didn’t prove the ad’s claims. We also asked the ad’s target for comment; a spokesman for Nelson made the point that the IPAB claims have been widely debunked. We’ll strike up the band here to play our favorite song: Be very cautious when you hear political ads with scare tactics concerning Medicare. The distortions abound on all sides. Our ruling Boone said, "This IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending." Actually, the law specifically states that the board cannot ration care. The board doesn’t look at individual patients or deny individual treatments. Instead, it makes system-wide recommendations to rein in the future growth of Medicare spending, and it makes those recommendations within limited parameters. It also was created to stop runaway spending growth within the Medicare program itself, not to divert money to other budget items. We rate Boone’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05051	Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is "the largest recipient of lobbyist money."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/10/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-says-jon-tester-ranked-first-/	A new TV ad shows big Montana skies and a succession of people saying Democratic Sen. Jon Tester isn’t representing the people the way he used to. The ad is from Americans for Prosperity, a pro-free-market group. It released the ad in June. Tester is in a tight race against GOP Rep. Dennis Rehberg -- Tester’s first reelection bid since winning his initial six-year term in 2006. The ad’s narration says, in part, "In the past, (Tester has) made a lot of promises, but when he got to D.C., that all changed." Among the examples provided by the ad is that "he’s the largest recipient of lobbyist money." The ad urges voters to "tell" Tester to "stop supporting President Barack Obama’s interests and start supporting Montana’s." The mention of lobbyist donations caught our attention, since Tester -- a first-term senator with low seniority, no chairmanship and no position in his party’s leadership -- wouldn’t seem to be the most obvious candidate to lead his chamber in lobbyist donations. We checked with Americans for Prosperity, which pointed us to a chart from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for campaign finance information. The chart, labeled "Lobbyists: Top Recipients," shows Tester leading the pack with $348,031. This seemed pretty persuasive, until we spot-checked some of the most influential Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to see whether Tester really outraised them. It turns out he didn’t. For instance, CRP lists Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., as receiving $1,125,051 from lobbyists. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took in $625,190 from lobbyists. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., received $579,963. Tester’s fellow Montana senator -- Max Baucus, who chairs the influential Finance Committee -- received $513,169. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., received $379,730. To clarify matters, we checked with the Center for Responsive Politics. It turns out that the top-20 list that Tester headed only includes donations by registered lobbyists made to candidates’ campaign committees during the 2011-2012 period -- the period in which Tester, and everyone else on that list, is up for reelection. Since donors typically give to campaign committees most heavily during the two-year cycle when a candidate is actually up for reelection, Tester was, in effect, only No. 1 in the chamber when compared to candidates currently running for reelection -- not against the entire Senate. None of the five senators we listed above who have higher totals are up for reelection this year. Consequently, none of them has made it onto the top-20 list for 2011-2012. If you equalize the playing field by looking at a full six-year senatorial term, Tester is no longer No. 1 in lobbyist donations, though because of how the Senate staggers the reelection years of its six-year terms, there’s not a complete ranking of all 100 senators. (In a CRP's all-inclusive list of senators who have served since 1989, Tester barely cracks the top 50 in lobbyist donations. The upper levels of this list include many one-time senators who have been out of office for years, such as Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.) Still, it’s somewhat misleading for the ad to say, without further qualification, that Tester is "the largest recipient of lobbyist money" among senators. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity claimed that Tester is "the largest recipient of lobbyist money" in the Senate, and it provided as backup a chart from a credible, independent organization showing Tester topping the list. However, the ad doesn’t clarify an important quirk in how CRP puts together its rankings: The ranking is based only on donations made this election cycle. That makes the ad’s phrasing somewhat misleading, because donations tend to spike during a senator's re-election cycle, and looking just one cycle essentially excludes other senators who have accepted more money than Tester if the comparison had been made on an apples-to-apples basis. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2012-07-10T15:59:09	2012-06-18	['Jon_Tester', 'Montana']
pomt-03402	"Nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid" in fiscal year 2014.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/02/todd-young/rep-todd-young-says-social-security-medicare-medic/	Recently, a reader sent us a letter they received from their local congressman, Indiana Republican Todd Young. The reader was surprised at one of the claims. It said "nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid" in fiscal year 2014. The reader wondered whether that was true, and so did we. So we turned to the most recent budgetary estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. If you add together the costs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for fiscal year 2014, and then subtract the offsetting receipts for those programs, you come up with 45 percent of all federal spending. That’s far lower than "nearly 70 percent." However, if you broaden the definition to include all forms of mandatory spending (or "entitlements") rather than just Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the percentage gets larger. These additional entitlements include many different programs: food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, unemployment compensation, the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, child nutrition programs, federal civilian and military retirement payments, and veterans' benefits. Adding together all forms of entitlements gets the share up to 61 percent. And if you add in a separate category of mandatory spending -- net interest on the national debt -- the number rises to 68 percent. That’s very close to 70 percent. When we presented our research to Young’s office, a spokesman acknowledged the error. "You hit the nail on the head," said spokesman Trevor Foughty. "The letter should have referred to all mandatory spending, including interest, with the those programs (Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid) being the most recognizable. We will make sure to update the letter with more clarity." Our ruling Young’s letter said that "nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid" in fiscal year 2014, and that’s not even close -- the real share is 45 percent. Young’s office acknowledged that they should have clarified that they were including all types of entitlements plus net interest, rather than just those three programs. They said they would correct the statement in the future. However, our policy is to rate the original statement, and in this case, we conclude that it is False.

pomt-02514	Says Rep. Renee Ellmers voted for the government shutdown 21 times.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/12/clay-aiken/clay-aiken-says-gop-legislator-voted-21-times-shut/	Even though Clay Aiken has never run for public office before, he’s no stranger to getting a lot of votes. Now, after announcing his run for a U.S. House seat in North Carolina, the Democrat will have to hope supporters are as eager to flock to the polls as they were to text in their American Idol votes a decade ago. It won’t be an easy road to Washington for Aiken, who will face a Democratic primary. In his YouTube campaign kickoff, which Simon Cowell would probably call "pitchy," Aiken criticized his would-be general election opponent, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C. "The district where I’m running is represented by a congresswoman who I believe went to Washington with good intentions. I’d like to think that people don’t go there with anything else," Aiken said. "When her party leaders told her to vote for the government shutdown, she did. Twenty-one times. Even though she said herself it would be a disaster for the economy." We can’t know what party leaders told her about how to vote. But we wanted to know if Ellmers voted 21 times to shut down the government, as Aiken claimed. Aiken’s office sent us a list of the 21 votes they counted. By contrast, Ellmers’ staff gave us a list of 24 votes she gave "to keep the federal government open." Interestingly, there was significant overlap. How the votes stack up We combed through congressional votes during the fall of 2013 and came up with our own list of 26 votes in the battle over funding President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, and how it related to the government shutdown. To be clear, there was never a measure that was a straight up-or-down vote to dirctly shut down the government. Rather, it was a series of votes on measures that the House supported but that the Senate and President Obama opposed, that had the predictable effect of shutting down the government. In the House, Republicans controlled which measures get brought to the floor for a vote. Here’s a breakdown of House votes from that time period: Pre-shutdown, votes 478, 497, 498 and 504: These votes took place on the budget in late September and were in support of the House Republican budget, which fully funded the government but defunded Obamacare or delayed its individual mandate. While Ellmers’ votes were in favor of GOP budget proposals, they were made knowing that Obama had said he would veto the legislation if it hit his desk, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. Rule changes, vote 505: In the early hours of Oct. 1, as the shutdown began, House Republicans voted to alter the rules to make it impossible for an individual legislator to force a vote on reopening the government. Piecemeal appropriations during shutdown, votes 506, 507, 508, 510, 513, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 528, 530, 532, 537, 540, 542, 544 and 548: Ellmers and Republicans voted in favor of these measures during the shutdown to fund different parts of the government individually. That included everything from re-opening federal museums to funding Head Start to funding cancer research. This was a tactical move on both sides of the aisle. Most Democrats opposed these measures in order to continue their push to fund the government in its entirety. Meanwhile, the Republicans used these votes as leverage against the Democrats, saying the Democrats refused to fund a laundry list of federal programs. Forming a working group, vote 534: Mid-shutdown, Ellmers and other House Republicans voted to form a bipartisan working group of senators and representatives to work out economic policy differences and reopen the government. But party leaders made it clear they didn’t want to compromise on a delay of Obamacare’s individual mandate, which was a sticking point for the Democrats. Ending the shutdown, vote 550: Ellmers voted against this, along with a majority of House Republicans. It passed with support from Democrats and a block of 87 Republicans, including Speaker of the House John Boehner. Once Obama signed off on it Oct. 17, this bill ended the shutdown and funded the government through Jan. 15 in place of an annual budget. Ellmers’ record By pointing out how Ellmers and other House Republicans voted in September and October, we’re not trying to absolve the Democrats of any responsibility for the government shutdown. To be sure, both parties shoulder responsibility for building up partisan gridlock. Here, though, we wanted to take a close look at how Ellmers voted during the shutdown. Her record shows she voted with other Republicans to take a hard line on withholding funding for the health care law, even to the point of shutting down the government, and she also voted against the final deal that re-opened the government. Her remarks on the subject contradict those votes. Back in August, she said the shutdown wasn’t the right strategy. After it ended, she said, "I’m happy we are out of the government shutdown," even though she didn’t vote in favor of ending it. It’s also worth noting that Republicans have maintained that their votes for piecemeal appropriations are easily framed as votes to fund the government. Our ruling Aiken said Ellmers "voted for the government shutdown" 21 times. After reviewing the legislation, we found 26 votes from before and during the shutdown that were related. Ellmers consistently voted with Republicans, who wanted to defund Obamacare even at the cost of not funding other government functions. But not all of the votes contributed directly to a shutdown, and Aiken's 21-vote tally is inflated. The bulk of these votes are piecemeal appropriations votes, which were tactical maneuvers by Republicans to try to restart the more popular government functions without funding the health care law. Overall, Aiken has a point that Ellmers repeatedly voted with those who took positions against compromise. Most significantly, she voted for budget measures that precipitated a shutdown and also against the final compromise measure that re-started the federal government. But to say she voted 21 times for a shutdown is an exaggerated number. So we rate Aiken’s claim Half True.	None	Clay Aiken	None	None	None	2014-02-12T11:18:08	2014-02-05	['None']
pomt-02884	Finance experts estimate that paying in cash for the $2.5 billion in projects funded by the sales tax saved Gwinnett County more than $1 billion in interest payments.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/11/charlotte-nash/gwinnett-chairwomans-splost-savings-claim-makes-se/	The election results are in, but we still had a question concerning a particular item on the ballot in Georgia’s second-largest county that seemed worthy for a fact check. Gwinnett County officials had an interesting sales pitch to voters about the merits of continuing a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax to pay for various projects. It would cost the county more money if they had to borrow the cash instead of collecting it in sales taxes. How much more? One billion dollars. Here’s a passage about it from an interview with Gwinnett Commission Chairwoman Charlotte Nash in the Gwinnett Daily Post: "SPLOST is the best tool that the Legislature has ever given local government," Nash said, adding that finance experts estimate that paying in cash for the $2.5 billion in projects funded by the sales tax saved the county more than $1 billion in interest payments that would have been owed if debt had been issued. "It allowed us to work on those quality of life things, and we were able to do it without debt." PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Gwinnett would have spent $1 billion in interest payments had the county borrowed the money for the projects as opposed to collecting revenue from the sales tax. Gwinnett voters passed the county’s first SPLOST program in June 1985. They’ve approved SPLOST referendums in 1987, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008. Since 1985, Gwinnett officials say they’ve collected about $2.5 billion in SPLOST revenue. On Nov. 5, Gwinnett voters approved the latest SPLOST referendum by a 58-42 percent margin. The sales tax would raise $498 million over the next three years. More than two-thirds of the money will be spent on roads, bridges, drainage, sidewalks, intersection improvements and other transportation projects. The county’s 16 cities will collect about $100 million. The rest will be spent on public safety equipment; parks; library and senior citizen facilities; water and sewer improvements; and parking. Gwinnett officials told PolitiFact Georgia they calculated the potential interest rates by using a municipal index scale for counties with AAA bond ratings. Gwinnett gave us the average interest rates for a 20-year deal originated at the beginning of the year for each time period. The interest rates ranged from 8.9 percent in 1985 and gradually declined to 3.85 percent for the SPLOST passed in 2004. The interest rate for the SPLOST referendum passed in 2008 was not included in the county’s calculations. Several experts we spoke with said the county’s methodology appeared sound. "In order for the county to have accomplished the capital outlay projects funded by the SPLOSTs, it would have either had to impose massive property tax increases to fund the projects or borrow money to finance the projects. Borrowing money to finance the projects would have been less painful for the property taxpayers than imposing millage rate increases to fund the projects, because debt can be paid off over 20-30 years," said Earle Taylor III, who has spent about three decades working on public financing projects and is a partner at the law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge. Ray Hill, who teaches managerial economics and finance at Emory University, said the county’s claim is based on the assumption that Gwinnett would have borrowed that much money. Hill and Taylor didn’t see any glaring holes in the county’s calculations. "If the assumption was that, in any event, the county was going to spend an amount of money equal to the SPLOST revenues, it would be easy to get to an interest ‘saving’ figure of $1 billion," said Hill, who is an expert in financing large projects. "The potential interest rates look reasonable. If you assumed they issued a 20-year bond at the amounts listed, you could easily get interest payments that total $1 billion." To sum up, Nash said Gwinnett County would have spent $1 billion in interest payments had the county borrowed the money for the projects as opposed to collecting revenue from the sales tax. Experts we interviewed agreed with the county’s methodology and math. We did our own calculations, and it appeared to us that they would have paid more than $1 billion in interest had they borrowed $2.5 billion. We rate Nash’s claim as True.

pomt-02536	The cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/07/facebook-posts/spending-all-time-high/	Could Congress be on a roll? It has passed two major spending bills in recent months, most recently the so-called farm bill. Many conservatives were rejoicing that the federal crop subsidy program contained cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the food stamp program. Too much money is being spent on that program, they argued. "The cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high," we saw on the Facebook pages of some conservatives. One person had a chart showing the annual totals. The highest number was for the 12-month fiscal year period that ended Sept. 30, at nearly $80 billion. We wondered if this chart is correct and about the claim that spending for the program is at an all-time high. SNAP is administered by the federal Agriculture Department. Recipients must meet various income eligibility requirements to join the program. In Georgia, the state’s Human Services Department helps determine whether someone is eligible to get assistance. An estimated 2 million Georgians were receiving SNAP assistance at some point last year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. More than 47 million Americans -- nearly one in seven men, women and children -- receive assistance from the program. Congress cut food stamp spending by $8.6 billion over the next 10 years. President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill Friday. The U.S. Agriculture Department keeps data on annual SNAP spending on its website. SNAP spending has risen in recent years like fly balls used to do on summer nights in the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. In fiscal year 2008, the SNAP spending totaled about $53.6 billion. Five years later, it was $79.64 billion. The fiscal year 2013 total of approximately $80 billion was the highest annual total since the program started in 1969. Adjusted for inflation, the 2013 total is higher than any other fiscal year. Once you adjusted for inflation, the prior fiscal year came the closest to 2013, at $79.59 billion. SNAP spending, adjusted for inflation, has increased all but one fiscal year since 2000. The only fiscal year there was not an increase was 2007. We also decided to check whether the amount of money spent per recipient was at its zenith. Close, but not the highest, we found. The department’s chart shows the monthly allotment for each person in a household receiving benefits was at its highest in fiscal year 2011, at $133.85. The 2013 fiscal year total was $133.07. Federal officials said that SNAP spending and the number of recipients are designed to expand during periods of economic upheaval. The Agriculture Department noted in a statement that the number of recipients declined by 500,000 between June and September 2013. The department expects the number of recipients to continue to decrease as the economy improves. Perhaps. Back to the claim we were trying to check. Some Facebook users are posting claims that the cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high. Indeed, the most recent total fiscal year budget has never been higher.

pomt-07397	"We just fought a Republican budget that ends Medicare as we know it."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/01/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-he-fought-republican-budget-ends-me/	Nearly six months after being elected to Congress, David Cicilline is running hard for reelection. On WPRI's "Newsmakers" program, which aired April 24, the freshman congressman was asked about a potential opponent. Cicilline immediately switched to one of his talking points. "The election is two years away. What voters are going to focus on is who's in Washington fighting and standing up for them. We're in the middle of a big battle about what this country is going to be like in terms of our priorities and our values. We just fought a Republican budget that ends Medicare as we know it." The claim that Republicans want to end the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older is being widely used by Democrats as they attack Republican proposals to cut the budget. Cicilline has raised the theme repeatedly in recent new releases, YouTube videos and speeches on the floor of the House. He’s also launched a series of visits to senior citizen to discuss "the effects of the Republican budget on Medicare and Medicaid." PolitiFact National addressed one element of the controversy April 20 when it gave a Pants On Fire ruling to the assertion by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that "Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare." (Details on that ruling can be found at PolitiFact.com.) A few points are relevant to Cicilline's assertion. First, there is no Republican budget. At issue is a budget resolution proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, who proposes eventually replacing Medicare with subsidies that older people would use to "buy" private insurance, although the elderly would never see the money -- it would be paid by the government to insurance companies. The resolution was approved by 235 of the 240 Republicans in the House. Every Democrat, including Cicilline, voted no. It has no chance in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Such resolutions are, as PolitiFact National noted, nonbinding documents that state policy preferences and cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. Second, the GOP proposal does not "end Medicare as we know it." It wouldn't even begin to change Medicare as we know it for another 12 years. Under the Republican plan, developed because the GOP and other critics regard the costs of the current program as unsustainable, Medicare would continue in its present form for people who already receive it. In addition, those 55 or older would be covered by the program once they hit their 65th birthday. So even 12 years from now, part of today's Medicare would remain in place until every recipient covered under the existing rules has died. The claim would be true for younger people, because the version of Medicare they would see when they retire would be very different. For example, they would have to buy health plans from private insurance companies, with financial assistance and regulation from the government -- akin in some ways to President Obama’s health-care plan that so many Republicans object to. In addition, the eligibility age would gradually rise to 67. In short, Cicilline, has pushed back against the Republican proposal to change Medicare. But he has mischaracterized a nonbinding budget resolution as a budget. More significantly, he exaggerated the impact of a Republican Medicare proposal to imply that everyone would be affected, while the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over. If he had added those qualifiers, his statement would have been closer to accurate. But he didn’t. We rate his statement Barely True. (To comment or offer your own ruling, visit us on Facebook.) Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04978	"I used my line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year ... is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/23/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-cut-361-million-state-leg/	Gov. Chris Christie sliced spending from the state budget, but the cuts are not as deep as he claimed recently. In a speech at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C., Christie said he recently signed his third budget, which he said increased spending on education, while bolstering support for the state’s most vulnerable citizens and making a "significant down payment on our pension obligation." "At the same time, I used my line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year, in fiscal year 2013, which has just begun, is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor, Governor Corzine," Christie said during the July 9 address. In fact, Christie sliced about $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the state budget using line-item vetoes, a process that allows the governor to eliminate or reduce particular appropriations in the budget. Reductions in funds for pension contributions made up a large portion of the cuts. Christie also reduced funding for transitional aid to towns, nursing homes and medical day care services, among other areas. So Christie is wrong on the size of the cuts. He’s also wrong to claim those cuts had an impact on trimming the spending plan to below the size of the 2008 and 2009 budgets. The Legislature had passed and delivered a budget to Christie that was already smaller than those two budget bills. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for clarification on how Christie reached his total of $360 million in cuts, but his office has cited the figure before. A news release from June 29 -- the day Christie signed the budget -- said that the governor "put Corzine Democrats on their heels by vetoing $361 million in unnecessary or unsupported spending." Attached to that release were several vetoes of other bills the Legislature sent to the governor’s desk. Christie claims in his veto messages that seven of those bills would have increased government spending by more than $275 million. Adding that amount to the line-item vetoes pushes Christie’s total cuts to more than $361 million. Christie says in the veto documents that separating the bills from the budget is "little more than a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the tough choices required to meet the constitutional obligation of passing a balanced budget." "Taken together," Christie claims the bills "would add more than $275 million of government spending for the coming fiscal year." Several of the bills clearly authorize additional appropriations, such as a bill that increased the amount of aid municipalities receive from the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund, starting with a $66 million bump in fiscal year 2013. But others don’t. One bill Christie vetoed would have provided towns more time to spend affordable housing funds before turning the money over to the state. And other bills, like a piece of legislation that would have required municipalities to submit economic growth plans to keep participating in the state’s urban enterprise zone program, lacked a firm estimate of potential fiscal impact. Still, all of the bills were vetoed outright by the governor and were not part of the state budget he signed. Christie used his line-item veto authority to cut more than $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the Legislature’s budget. Our ruling Christie said he used his "line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year ... is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor." Only one fourth of that figure -- about $86 million -- represents appropriations in the budget reduced by Christie’s line-item veto. And Christie’s point that those cuts reduced the size of the budget to below 2008 and 2009 levels is wrong. The budget the Legislature passed was already smaller than those two budgets.

pomt-12146	Says Scott Walker "has taken money away from internet expansion in our state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/10/andy-gronik/testing-democratic-challenger-claim-scott-walker-t/	In statewide elections, Democrats tend to rely on an urban base. But in a July 14, 2017, interview on WisconsinEye, gubernatorial hopeful Andy Gronik criticized Gov. Scott Walker for a lack of progress in plans for rural development in the state. "To suggest to our rural areas in Wisconsin that Governor Walker has a real plan and that he really cares about economic development in those areas -- come on," Gronik said, later adding: "The fact that Governor Walker has taken money away from internet expansion around our state is ludicrous." The notion that Walker has taken money from internet expansion comes from a controversial move in 2011, when state officials returned nearly $23 million in federal stimulus money from the National Telecommunications & Information Administration. The grant would have "boosted broadband connections in 380 Wisconsin communities, including 385 libraries and 82 schools," the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2011. The Gronik campaign cited the piece as its initial backing for the statement. But is Gronik’s claim accurate today? We took a look at the circumstances of 2011 -- and at what's happened since. The 2011 picture The $23 million grant was returned a year after it was awarded. The money was provided through the federal Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, which aimed to expand broadband access to underserved rural areas across the country. Walker’s decision was a source of disappointment for school and library associations, and viewed with skepticism by Democrats such as Mark Pocan, then a state lawmaker, who argued the decision was in the interest of Walker’s "big telecommunications campaign donors." AT&T employees and the company’s political action committee donated more than $20,000 to Walker’s 2010 campaign. AT&T contracts with the state to manage and maintain the infrastructure that forms the BadgerNet Converged Network, the public network that was to receive the federal funds. Ironically, that public/private partnership made it difficult for the state to meet the grant requirements. And giving back the money was something many agreed with at the time. "After months of negotiations that spanned administrations, it was clear the unique nature of Wisconsin’s Badger Network was not compatible with the technical requirements of the NTIA," said David Cagigal, chief information officer of the state’s Department of Enterprise Technology in a statement to Politifact Wisconsin. "In fact, the Badger Network we have in the state was able to accomplish the same goals of the NTIA funding by 2014." Barry Orton, a retired University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications policy professor, said the public/private partnership made meeting federal requirements difficult. "Other states and the feds said, ‘Well, this money shouldn’t go right to the carriers, it should go to local governments, to non-profits, to co-ops. We want to see that the money is spent for actual new broadband rather than increasing the capital budgets of existing carriers,’ " he said. Others noted taking the grant without meeting the requirements would have left Wisconsin taxpayers with a $23 million bill. Tony Varda, who has spent 11 years as the chair of the board for the Town of Berry, still supports the decision, despite his town’s need for better broadband connections. "You gotta think about it a little before you look the gift horse in the mouth," he said. "But when we looked in the mouth here, it wasn’t pretty." So, Walker clearly turned back money for internet expansion -- but the picture is much more blurry, as the state’s existing set-up created complications in accepting it. The picture since Since 2011, the state’s efforts to expand internet access -- especially rural areas -- have grown. In an analysis of NTIA and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) data, the Public Service Commission (PSC) of Wisconsin and the state-level Wisconsin Broadband Office found coverage expansion in "practically every county," including 20,000 households with improved connections. Over the last five years, the PSC gave out $5.5 million in grant funding to underserved areas of the state. In Walker’s current two-year budget request, he asked lawmakers to approve $15 million in grant money. He also requested more than $25 million for the TEACH program, which provides infrastructure and teacher training grants for schools. Though the budget is stalled before the Legislature, the outlook for including the internet money is promising, said Elise Nelson, spokeswoman for the PSC. Those who work with public schools and libraries said things are on the upswing. "Schools are in a much better position now," said Dan Rossmiller, director of government relations at the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. "They have much better bandwidth at much lower cost than they did then." Nevertheless, the internet challenges in rural Wisconsin are far from solved. Walker’s $15 million request over two years is less than the $20 million allocated this year alone in Minnesota’s development grant program, Border to Border. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitors the percentage of people who lack broadband connectivity each year in 56 states and territories. The 2016 average for the 50 states and Washington, D.C., was 13% -- the same as the portion of Wisconsinites who lack coverage. In rural areas, the national number jumps to 38%. Wisconsin comes in at 43%, roughly equal with Minnesota. Our rating Gronik says Scott Walker "has taken money away from internet expansion in our state." In 2011, Walker’s first year in office, the state returned $23 million to the federal government -- though the decision is not as simple as Gronik portrays it. Since then, Walker’s office has increased funding for broadband development grants. Price tags aside, the data available on rural coverage put the state’s reach on par with Minnesota -- which spent tens of millions more in the same time frame -- and in the middle of the pack of neighbors Illinois, Iowa and Michigan.

pomt-06803	"President Obama and Democrats' spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions, maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the Democrat Downgrade of our country's AAA credit rating."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/12/kevin-dewine/ohio-gop-chairman-kevin-dewine-blames-democrats-dr/	Even before financial markets had a chance to react, the blame game started over Standard and Poor's decision to lower the credit rating of the United States government from AAA status to AA-plus. The Obama administration reacted to the downgrade with indignation, finding flaws in S&P's calculations and analysis. Democrats and Republicans began finger-pointing that was not limited to Washington. Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine issued a statement blaming Obama for what he called a "Democrat downgrade." "President Obama and Democrats' spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions, maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the Democrat Downgrade of our country's AAA credit rating," he said. PolitiFact has repeatedly checked statements in recent months about "maxing out the U.S. credit card," and found significant exaggeration. Although Democrats shoulder a fair amount of blame for the nation's fiscal woes, so do Republicans because they voted for tax cuts and additional spending that also contributed to the large deficits. What is new in DeWine's statement is what attracted our attention: the label of "Democrat downgrade" on S&P's rating. We asked the Ohio GOP how it backed up the claim, and it cited about two dozen sources. One was a PolitiFact story that referred to Obama as "the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents." (Which, the story went on to say, "goes to show that statistics can be used -- and misused -- to bolster almost any argument.") The other sources, mostly commentaries, fault Obama's leadership on the economy, tie Democrats to spending or speculate on the political damage to Obama and Democrats from the downgrade. One citation is a story from Politico saying that Obama "is now firmly part of the landscape that S&P trashed" -- after the story says he was "dragged by Hill Republicans into the endless fiscal and personal nightmare that was the debt ceiling debate." We think the best way to determine what's in the S&P report is to read it. It's available to anyone online. "We lowered our long-term rating on the U.S.," the report says, "because we believe that the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate indicate that further near-term progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on raising revenues is less likely than we previously assumed and will remain a contentious and fitful process." In other words -- though S&P says it "takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures" that would put the country's finances on more stable footing -- the firm looked for spending to be better contained and for revenues to increase. New revenues might have helped head off a downgrade, but "the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues," the report says. S&P faults "the political brinksmanship of recent months" for making America's governance and policymaking "less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed." The firm complains that the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default "have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy" and that "the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge." In our reading -- and in the words of the very Politico story that the GOP cites as a source -- "S&P suggested that the Democrats are just as much a part of the problem as the Republicans." We repeat: Just as much. Democrats and Republicans both. That means the one-sided label of "Democrat downgrade" has some element of truth -- but it ignores so much critical information that it gets a Truth-O-Meter rating of Mostly False.

abbc-00010	A war of words has broken out in Tasmania over how many jobs would be lost if poker machines are stripped from pubs and clubs — a promise made by Labor ahead of the state election on March 3.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-23/fact-check-gambling-jobs-tasmania/9454362	Mr Gutwein is wrong. Tasmania's gaming industry did not say thousands of jobs would be lost. The Treasurer relied on a gaming industry survey, which predicted 1,038 jobs would be lost. He also relied on the gaming industry's rough calculation that, in total, 5,100 jobs would be "affected" — meaning jobs would be impacted through reduced hours, changed duties or lost altogether. Experts have called into question the methodology of the gaming industry's survey. And, in an unusual admission, a gaming industry representative told Fact Check the industry was aware that some people engaged in public debate had misinterpreted the numbers — wrongly believing that about 5,100 jobs would be lost, when in fact the survey had indicated only 1,038 would go. He acknowledged the misrepresentation had not been corrected on the public record. A report commissioned by the Tasmanian Department of Treasury and Finance says reliable data on employment in the gambling industry are not collected by governments or industry. These numbers indicate gaming-related employment levels in pubs and clubs run in the hundreds of jobs rather than thousands. The Treasury report refers to a number of other studies that have examined the extent of employment in Tasmania's gambling industry, either calculating job numbers or full-time equivalents. Such calculations take into account the numbers of full-time jobs and part-time jobs. These studies also indicate that employment in the gaming industry totals hundreds of jobs rather than thousands.

pomt-01936	"Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/25/republican-party-florida/cost-prepaid-college-tuition-nosedived-under-scott/	Students, teachers and a mom praise Gov. Rick Scott’s record on higher education and bash that of Democratic front-runner Charlie Crist in a new TV ad released June 17, 2014, from the Republican Party of Florida. "You know college has become so expensive. Gov. Crist was a governor that was not looking out for Florida. Tuition skyrocketed. You know Charlie Crist made college cost more. Charlie Crist did not make education a priority," states the ad, as a 2009 Tampa Bay Times headline flashes on the screen citing a tuition increase of up to 15 percent. "Rick Scott has put a lot of money back into education," the ad continues. "Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000. A lot of my students now see hope. Rick Scott has made college more affordable." We previously fact-checked a claim by Scott that Crist "allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year" and rated that Mostly True. (And we have fact-checked other claims in the race about higher education cuts.) Here we will fact-check the Republicans’ claim that Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000. Florida prepaid college tuition program The Florida Legislature created the Stanley G. Tate Prepaid College Program in 1987. Here’s how it works: Families set up an advanced payment contract, typically paying a monthly fee. That allows families to lock in many of the costs associated with college and apply it when their child heads off to college. For example, someone who purchased a contract earlier this year for a newborn would lock in to pay $350 a month, which would generate enough money to cover college when their child enrolls in 2032. (Parents can also sign up children in later years, too, though that increases the monthly cost.) While the plans are designed to cover tuition at Florida schools and universities, the money can be applied to schools in other states. We should note that setting aside the money isn’t a guarantee that a child will get into college; they still have to apply and be accepted. About 80 percent of families choose the monthly option which includes interest so it adds up to paying more over 18 years than those who pay the lump sum up front. (It operates much like a mortgage -- homeowners pay less over the term of a mortgage if they pay it more quickly.) More than 1.6 million prepaid plans have been purchased and nearly 350,000 students have attended college using these plans. The program is popular, but the amount for new plans skyrocketed in 2008 and again in 2010 -- for example the lump sum payment rose from about $22,000 in 2009 to $40,000 in 2010. The hikes were as a result of the Legislature approving the "tuition differential" that allowed universities to tack on an extra increase in tuition up to 15 percent. (First the hike was reserved for University of Florida and Florida State University, but later additional universities were added.) The prepaid college board assumed that universities would use that maximum amount, sending the costs into an upward spiral. This year, the Legislature passed House Bill 851, which will cause the prepaid program to drop in cost starting with the enrollment period that begins Oct. 15. The bill lowers tuition costs because it: • eliminates automatic annual rate-of-inflation increase for all universities; • gets rid of tuition differential for all but two universities (UF and FSU); • for UF and FSU, the tuition differential drops from an annual maximum of 15 percent to 6 percent. The bill passed the House 84-32 and the Senate 26-13 and Scott signed it June 9. (The bill also established in-state tuition for certain illegal immigrants who arrived here as children.) For the prepaid plans, the price of the four-year university plan would be reduced by "at least $10,000" for future participants, according to a House staff analysis of the bill. Additionally, thousands of families already participating in prepaid plans will get refunds or reductions, depending on the plan. The Florida Prepaid College Board cites an even bigger savings on its website: the lump sum price of the Four-Year Florida University Plan for newborns is anticipated to drop nearly $20,000 from its current price of $54,000 to $35,000 or less. For those who choose the monthly payments for the same plan, the board anticipates the monthly payments will drop at least $100, from $350 to $250 or less. Over the life of a plan, that could add up to about $22,000 less than before the Legislature passed this bill, a spokeswoman for the prepaid board told PolitiFact Florida. More precise figures under both scenarios will emerge in September when the board sets costs for the new enrollment period. We asked Ryan Duffy, a spokesman for Florida House speaker Will Weatherford, why the House staff analysis cited a savings of "at least $10,000" while the prepaid board said savings would add up to "nearly $20,000." The $10,000 figure was a conservative estimate provided by the prepaid college board in February based on an earlier version of the bill, Duffy said. That lower figure did not include the changes to tuition differential. Our ruling A TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida stated "Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000." That figure comes from a projection by the prepaid college tuition board which anticipates that a newborn’s lump-sum plan will decline by that amount. An earlier analysis of the bill placed a more conservative estimate of "at least $10,000" but that did not fully reflect the changes approved by the Legislature to lower the costs. The main caveat here is that Scott doesn’t get full credit: the Legislature signed off on the bill, too. We rate this claim Mostly True.

But Fox News’ Bob Beckel took a shot at doing this on The Five, during a discussion of corporate taxes with co-host Eric Bolling. "We have a high corporate tax rate," said Beckel, but "we also have the most number of deductions available to corporations. They pay lower taxes than an awful lot of European countries do." Bolling countered that the United States has "the highest corporate tax rate in the free world," which he said is why companies like Pfizer and Burger King "jumped ship" by relocating their corporate headquarters outside of the United States. Beckel, however, stuck to his guns, repeating that the United States has "the highest number of deductions" and adding that companies leave the United States for cheap labor, not to evade taxes. We checked Bolling’s claim separately. In this check, we will look at whether Beckel is correct that the U.S. tax code has the highest number of deductions. The uncountable The bad news for Beckel: Experts told us it’s neither practical nor useful to tally the number of deductions in the tax code, and that they hadn’t seen any study that tried. PolitiFact, our sister site, checked a claim in 2013 that "there have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986." Based on the best estimates available, we ruled that True, but that’s a much more limited claim than the one Beckel made. Deductions constitute a broader category of tax provisions, making Beckel’s claim even harder to check. "Some Internal Revenue code sections might have 10 or more deductions" by themselves, said David Kautter, managing director of the Kogod Tax Center at American University. The Treasury Department has issued estimates of the number of "tax expenditures," but those are only a "subset of tax deductions," said Kautter. "Many deductions are not tax expenditures," such as "wages, office rent, pencils, writing pads, etc." Since tax experts can’t even really count the number of deductions in the United States, an international comparison is more or less impossible. In any case, experts told us that the more relevant figure is the size of deductions. Governments use what’s called a statutory rate -- 39.1 percent in the United States, the highest in the developed world -- which is levied on the businesses’ taxable base. The taxable base starts out as the corporation’s profits, but the tax code allows them to deduct certain expenditures from that base, like wages, health insurance, and investments in infrastructure. Once you account for deductions, the actual proportion of their profits that businesses fork over to the government is a lot lower. This is called the effective rate. Experts suggested we determine the difference between countries’ effective rates and their statutory rates as a way of measuring the scope of deductions. If the United States were to lead in that measure, then Beckel might have had a point, even if his literal claim didn’t hold water. Sizing up deductions Even this is difficult, experts say. William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, noted that credits and exemptions also help shape the effective rate, so the simple difference between effective and statutory rates can’t be chalked up to tax deductions alone. Still, since we figured that Beckel cared more about the difference between effective and statutory rates than about distinguishing between deductions and exemptions, we ran the numbers anyway, using the World Bank’s estimates for countries’ 2014 effective rates and the Tax Foundation’s tabulations of their statutory rates. Those figures showed that the United States has an effective rate of 27.9 percent, meaning the gap was 11.2 points. That difference ranked 16th out of the 34 advanced, industrialized nations that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Iceland had the widest ratio between its statutory and effective rates (20 percent versus 3 percent), while Belgium had the largest percentage-point drop (from 34 percent to 6.4 percent). In both difference and ratio, the United States was roughly in the middle of the pack. Our ruling Beckel said the United States has "the highest number of deductions available to corporations." Counting and comparing deductions internationally isn’t practical, and the only plausible alternative -- estimating the gap between the nations’ statutory and effective tax rates -- shows that the gap in the United States is about average among advanced, industrialized countries. We rate Beckel’s claim False.	None	Bob Beckel	None	None	None	2014-09-09T11:01:31	2014-09-01	['United_States']

pomt-09227	"She (Kagan) took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/14/michael-savage/michael-savage-says-kagan-took-money-goldman-sachs/	Never once to mince words, radio talk show host Michael Savage offered a blistering assessment of Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on the conservative World Net Daily website. Savage said one of the knocks on Kagan is that she was paid by Goldman Sachs, the investment bank under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud related to its dealings in the subprime mortgage market. "She took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama," Savage wrote. According to a Judiciary Committee questionnaire Kagan filled out when she was tapped by President Barack Obama to be solicitor general in 2009, Kagan was a member of the advisory council for the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She served on the panel from 2005 to 2008 while she was dean at Harvard Law School. And in 2008, according to financial disclosure forms filed with the Senate committee, she was paid a stipend of $10,000 for her services. According to its website, the Global Markets Institute at Goldman Sachs "provides research and high-level advisory services to policymakers, regulators and investors around the world." Kagan participated for several years in an annual, daylong conference for the company. "This advisory group was comprised of leaders from various sectors including academia, the media, business, and other industry," Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler told media outlets that inquired about Kagan's role with the board. "They met once a year for a daylong conference organized around public policy matters. The group was not involved in making any investment decisions for the company." Asked about Kagan's involvement with Goldman Sachs on the day before her nomination, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the panel "had absolutely nothing to do with decisions Goldman is being investigated for." The Huffington Post posted two reports the advisory council completed in 2005 and 2008. Among other things, they assess various risks faced by the world economy (and as the HuffPo article notes, they weren't exactly prescient). While it certainly doesn't do any political good to be associated in any way with Goldman Sachs right now, we could find no evidence that Kagan's role is tied to any alleged wrongdoing at Goldman Sachs. We also think it's a stretch for some critics to embellish her limited one-day-a-year position into a broad characterization that she "worked for" Goldman Sachs. But that's not what Savage said. He said Kagan took money from Goldman Sachs, and she did -- at least $10,000 in 2008. The second part of Savage's claim -- the "just like her boss, Obama" part -- is a bit of a stretch, though. Obama has never drawn a paycheck from Goldman Sachs and federal law prohibits corporations from making direct campaign contributions. So neither Obama nor his campaign got any money from Goldman Sachs, the corporate entity. And during the presidential election, his campaign didn't accept money from federal political action committees. But he did accept considerable campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data, Goldman Sachs employees gave the Obama campaign $994,795. That put Goldman Sachs employees No. 2 on Obama's top donors list. But again, getting a check from Goldman Sachs for services rendered (as Kagan did, albeit a small one) is far different than accepting campaign contributions from the company's employees. By that measure, Obama's Republican opponent Sen. John McCain took money from Goldman Sachs too -- $230,000 in campaign contributions from its employees. So we find Savage's claim to be Half True.

pomt-10298	On a timetable to withdraw from Iraq.	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/12/barack-obama/obama-sticks-to-his-iraq-plan/	The day before the Fourth of July weekend, Sen. Barack Obama talked about the likelihood that he will soon travel to Iraq and what it means for his foreign policy. "I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability. That assessment has not changed," he said. "And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies." Sen. John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee pounced on those comments, charging Obama with flip-flopping. "Since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of Barack Obama's candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately," said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. "Today, Barack Obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. He has now adopted John McCain's position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in Iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground." "There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience," said Alex Conant, a spokesman for the national Republican Party. "Obama's Iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician." We reviewed Obama's statements on Iraq from the campaign to try to uncover whether he was backtracking on earlier promises. Iraq was one of the most pressing issues of the Democratic primary campaign, discussed and dissected during more than 20 debates. We found that Obama has made a few points about Iraq over and over again: that he opposed the war "from the start"; that U.S. troops should leave Iraq quickly and in an orderly fashion ("as careful getting out as we were careless getting in"); and that the United States should not have permanent bases inside Iraq. How quickly should troops leave? His campaign Web site says: "Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al-Qaida attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al-Qaida." The McCain campaign and the RNC have pointed to the "16 months" statement as an indication that Obama favors a "precipitous withdrawal," presumably as early as the middle of 2010. (We checked that claim earlier here and found it Half True.) They also point to a March 2007 statement from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe. "On Iraq, he has been very clear," Plouffe said. "He offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago. It's essential to his candidacy and a rock-solid commitment. ... It will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops." Plouffe's statement appears to be the best evidence to support the McCain campaign's argument. Plouffe was responding to comments from former Obama adviser Samantha Power, who had said the 16-month timeframe was a "best-case scenario" that Obama wouldn't necessarily follow once he was in office. Power was forced to resign after calling Sen. Hillary Clinton a "monster." But does this mean a 16-month clock starts ticking the moment Obama enters office? We could not find a direct statement from Obama saying that, and found statements he made throughout the campaign that contradicted that. For example: • At a Democratic debate in Hanover, N.H., on Sept. 26, 2007, the late Tim Russert pressed Obama as to whether he would have all troops out by the end of his first term. "I think it's hard to project four years from now, and I think it would be irresponsible. We don't know what contingency will be out there," Obama said. "I will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy, protecting our civilians and making sure that we're carrying out counterterrorism activities there. I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out." • At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, Obama said, "As soon as I take office, I will call in the joint chiefs of staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed." • At a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said, "Now, I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics. Once I've given them a new mission, that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out, we will not have permanent bases there, once I've provided that mission, if they come to me and want to adjust tactics, then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief." • On Meet the Press on May 4, 2008, Russert asked Obama what he would do if advisers thought "a quick withdrawal" from Iraq would result in genocide. Obama replied, "Of course, I would factor in the possibilities of genocide, and I factored it in when I said that I would begin a phased withdrawal. What we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal — one to two brigades per month. At that pace, it would take about 16 months, assuming that George Bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office. We are talking about, potentially, two years away. At that point, we will have been in Iraq seven years. If we cannot get the Iraqis to stand up in seven years, we're not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years." Taken in their entirety, Obama's comments reflect a philosophy of "about 16 months" for withdrawal. He also appears to be willing to take advice from commanders on the ground that might affect the general pace, but not the overall goal of withdrawal. Yet Obama has been artful in his rhetoric. His campaign has clearly emphasized "16 months" when speaking to antiwar audiences and " about 16 months" when answering questions from withdrawal skeptics. But Obama never urged a "precipitous" withdrawal; even a bill he offered in January 2007 that set a deadline for getting out of Iraq contained an exemption for national security. The Plouffe statement, however, is troubling. Plouffe said the 16-month time frame was a "rock-solid commitment." But it's the only statement we found that supports the idea of withdrawal with no allowances made for circumstances on the ground, and it appears to be contradicted by the candidate himself. After the McCain campaign attacked Obama as a flip-flopper, the candidate responded with another news conference the same day. "I intend to end this war," Obama said. "My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission. And that is to end this war. Responsibly, deliberately, but decisively. And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month. And again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time." Weighing all these statements together, we find that Obama has not flip-flopped on Iraq, but that he has emphasized different aspects of his plan under questioning. This rates a No Flip on the Flip-O-Meter scale.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-12T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['Iraq']

pomt-13544	Says there are "concrete examples" of University of Texas job applicants or prospective applicants and students as well as invited speakers changing their minds because of handguns being allowed in campus buildings and classrooms.	true	/texas/statements/2016/aug/26/lisa-moore/professor-concrete-examples-teachers-students-spur/	A University of Texas English professor says a law enabling Texans with state permits to carry concealed guns into classrooms has already caused prospective faculty, students and even speakers not to come to the Austin campus. Lisa Moore said in an NPR interview aired Aug. 7, 2016, six days after the campus-carry mandate took effect: "We already have concrete examples of faculty who have declined to apply for jobs here at the university or who, once offered jobs, have turned them down when they realized that this policy would go into effect, students changing their minds about coming to our graduate and undergraduate programs, and invited speakers declining to come when they realized that we couldn't guarantee that they would give their talk in a gun-free space." "Concrete examples" is definitive. So, how about details? First it’s worth noting that since 1995, Texas law has allowed any individual with a concealed handgun permit to carry a gun on public college and university sidewalks, streets, parking areas and other grounds. In 2015, state lawmakers widened the law by voting to let permit holders also carry guns in campus buildings, except in areas excluded under rules adopted by each school’s president. UT-Austin President Gregory L. Fenves has written that he doesn’t believe handguns belong in campus buildings; still, he agreed to allow them in classrooms because, he said, barring them would have the effect of generally excluding guns from campus, which the law prohibits. In February 2016, Fenves also wrote Bill McRaven, the UT System chancellor: "Since this is a new law with an unknown effect on UT Austin, we will monitor implementation and its impact on students, faculty members, and staffers. I have significant concerns about how the law will affect our ability to recruit and retain faculty members and students. Fenves is among state defendants, too, in a lawsuit filed by Moore and two fellow professors seeking to bar civilian handguns from campus. On Aug. 22, 2016, a federal judge denied their request for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed them to ban concealed handguns from their classrooms. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel said he found no precedent for the argument that professors have a right of academic freedom under the First Amendment so broad that it overrides decisions of the Legislature and the university that employs them. Moore, Jennifer Lynn Glass and Mia Carter were still free to pursue the merits of their case. But Yeakel’s ruling was a considerable setback for them, as they wanted to ban guns in time for the start of fall classes. Virginia professor declined UT visit Moore, asked for concrete examples, initially responded with an email reminding that an out-of-state candidate for a UT deanship said he bowed out of consideration in 2015 due to the gun law. A February 2016 Austin American-Statesman news blog post quoted Siva Vaidhyanathan, a University of Virginia professor of media studies who’d previously earned UT bachelor’s and doctoral degrees, saying he’d been contacted by a search firm helping the university find a dean for the Moody College of Communication--and, the story said, was later told he was a finalist. But the gun law weighed on him; the story said that if chosen, Vaidhyanathan said, he’d have felt compelled to side with faculty members seeking to bar guns from classrooms. "I would probably be fired immediately," he said. "I told the search firm I was no longer interested in the position." To our inquiry, Vaidhyanathan provided a December 2015 email he sent to search firm officials declining their invitation to return to the Texas campus for "an extended visit and a dinner" about the deanship that would have included meetings with Fenves and others. Vaidhyanathan’s email said the prospect of guns being allowed in classrooms meant he couldn’t "pursue this position with enthusiasm." Vaidhyanathan wrote: "I could not, in good conscience, ask faculty and students to put themselves into an environment in which students, visitors, or even faculty could be armed. My wife is a scientist. I could not ask her to take a job at a university that was forbidden by law to restrict guns from classrooms. The very consideration of that possibility puts a chilling effect on open and relaxed discourse in the classroom. And the fact that the university cannot restrict guns on campus in general means that university police officers are forbidden to do their jobs effectively. They can’t diffuse a threatening situation until it becomes a dangerous one. "Universities are tense enough already. And we all count on our university police forces to confront and (defuse) threatening situations as early as possible. The State of Texas has put every student and professor in Texas in danger. I applaud the chancellor, the president, the faculty, and the students for their strong opposition to campus carry." So, that’s a candidate for dean confirmed. Next, we followed up with Moore about particular students, other prospective faculty and speakers deciding not to come to UT due to the gun law. A mother’s email Moore forwarded a November 2015 email sent by a parent, Rachel Zucker, to a UT mailbox. The message says: "Dear UT, I want you to know that my son, Moses Goren, is a straight A student at Hunter College High School (in NYC) who has expressed interest in applying to your Plan II program at UT (Austin). He and I have decided, however, that he will not apply to any schools that have campus carry laws. We believe that guns should not be allowed on college campuses and that guns present a serious physical danger for faculty and students. If you were to make UT Austin a safer place by making it illegal to bring a gun on campus, I would eagerly and proudly have Moses apply to your esteemed school. Thank you, Rachel Zucker" To our inquiry, Zucker confirmed her son’s decision. "Both of us feel even clearer about this than we did when wrote that email. The rampant gun violence and lack of commonsense gun control in this country should be a source of unmitigated shame for our leaders and legislators," Zucker said by email, adding that she hopes UT bans guns on campus. Moore also noted the departures of two UT faculty members by 2016. In each instance -- Architecture Dean Frederick Steiner’s move to the University of Pennsylvania and economist Daniel Hamermesh’s shift to opportunities abroad -- news stories and emails we fielded from the men describe the gun law as a factor, though not the only factor, in the departures. Hamermesh urged us to consult Joan Neuberger, a UT history professor, who responded by emailing a prospective graduate student’s February 2016 email saying she would decline UT’s offer of admission "due to my misgivings with the campus carry guidelines President Fenves released today." Nora Dolliver went on: "Although I think that UT would be a wonderful place to complete my graduate training, I am unwilling to study or work in an environment where my classmates, professors, students, or patrons are permitted to carry handguns." Harvard professor’s decision A March 2016 news story in UT’s student newspaper, The Daily Texan, quoted Moore saying a Harvard University professor had withdrawn from a search for a faculty position in the UT Women and Gender Studies department because of the measure letting guns into classrooms. By phone, Moore told us the professor, Robin Bernstein, had been urged by Moore and others to apply in 2015, but Bernstein, citing the gun law, declared she wouldn’t. "She definitely would have been a finalist," Moore said, adding that faculty were ultimately unable to fill the position. By email, Bernstein told us she was invited to apply for a professorship in women’s and gender studies but declined to do so "in large part because of the changes in Texas law to allow guns in class." Bernstein shared a portion of her November 2015 email to Moore about deciding not to apply. The email says Bernstein had been "watching the madness with the Texas legislature" and wasn’t more than 50 percent sure she’d accept the UT job if it were offered. Concerned outside speaker Moore, asked about speakers deciding not coming to campus, pointed us to Paloma Diaz, an administrator in UT’s Teresa Lozano Long Institute for Latin American Studies. Diaz said by phone that a speaker who teaches at the University of Washington cited the gun law in initially resisting the institute’s invitation to give a talk in fall 2016, though she said the speaker subsequently relented. Diaz said she didn’t have permission to identify the speaker. Otherwise, a web search showed the institute has posted a notice that Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, a UW professor, is expected to visit and give talks Sept. 26, 2016. Godoy didn't respond to our query. We couldn’t fairly consider a couple of late-breaking instances of invited speakers deciding not to come to UT because their decisions became public after Moore spoke to NPR. Still: --A Duke University professor, Karla Holloway, wrote Phillip Barrish, a UT English professor, that she was rescinding her acceptance of Barrish’s invitation to speak on the campus in fall 2016. Holloway wrote Aug. 26, 2016: "I believe guns, and especially the vulnerabilities exposed in conceal carry cultures, contribute mightily to our nation’s public health crisis. And with the conceal carry now in full effect there, and after discussion with my family, I just cannot come." To our inquiry, Holloway forwarded a copy of the emailed March 2016 invitation from Barrish that she and Barrish told us she’d previously accepted. --Neuberger separately alerted us to a Texas Christian University historian, Hanan Hammad, reversing course about speaking at UT, also while citing the gun law (which allows private universities like TCU to opt out of the mandate). To our inquiry, Hammad forwarded her Aug. 26, 2016, email rescinding her agreement to speak in October 2016. Hammad wrote that "with campus carry now in full effect at UT, I just cannot come. I'm always proud to be a UT alumnus and I owe my mentors and teachers great deal, but I'm in full solidarity with all UT faculty, staff, and students whose health and lives are in danger due to campus carry. I believe open or conceal carry on campus is wrong and dangerous." UT administration suggests claim solid We also asked a university spokesman, Gary Susswein, about the accuracy of Moore’s claim. Susswein responded by emailing a web link to an August 2016 statement by sociologist Harry Edwards, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, in which Edwards said that due to implementation of the gun law, he was rescinding his permission to present UT lectures on sport and society, launched in 2014, in his name. "My decision was an exceedingly difficult one," Edwards wrote, "but silence is evil's greatest and most consistently dependable ally." Another campus spokesman, J.B. Bird, said by email the administration could confirm Moore’s claim. Bird didn’t identify resistant individuals by name though he wrote that the university provost’s office "confirmed hearing of a few people who decided not to interview and who stated that it was because of campus carry. Similarly, Bird said, provost officials say "they have heard of a few cases of faculty speakers who have decided not to come to campus to give talks because of the law." Bird said too that "we know of students changing their minds about coming based on campus carry. Our admissions office said when the law was announced they received about 10 calls and 10-15 emails with applicants saying that they were not coming or would not apply. We assume that we don’t hear from 100 percent of the people who make this decision. "That said," Bird wrote, "we did just admit the largest incoming freshmen class in UT’s history, with about 8,500 freshman. From what we have seen, though, the assertion is true that some individuals have chosen not to come because of the new state law."

pomt-02133	The proposed Gogebic mine in northern Wisconsin "could be extended as long as 21 miles."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/08/dan-kaufman/Dan-Kaufman-claims-gogebic-iron-mine-could-extend/	Much of the debate over the proposed Gogebic mine in northern Wisconsin has turned on environmental and economic concerns. Less attention has been paid to the size of the project. In an opinion piece in the New York Times Sunday Review, "The fight for Wisconsin’s soul," Dan Kaufman discusses the open pit iron mine that Gogebic Taconite wants to build in Iron and Ashland counties. Kaufman is a Wisconsin native, writer and musician who lives in Brooklyn N.Y. He’s also a freelance fact checker for the Times and has previously written about Wisconsin politics for the paper. "The $1.5 billion mine would initially be close to four miles long, up to a half-mile wide and nearly 1,000 feet deep, but it could be extended as long as 21 miles," Kaufman wrote in the piece published March 29, 2014. That’s about the distance from Milwaukee’s Bradford Beach to, say, downtown Waukesha. We’ve considered a couple of previous statements that addressed the size of the mine. We rated True a claim by state Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee, who said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state. State Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago. We rated that Mostly False. So what about Kaufman’s claim that the mine could be 21 miles long? Kaufman said the estimate was based on news reports, and documents that the company filed with the state of Wisconsin. Those records show Gogebic has an option to purchase the iron found in the deposit, which is 21 miles long, threading through the the Penokee mountain range. "You'll notice our phrase says ‘but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,’" Kaufman said in an email. "We don't say it will be for sure. The company has many potential phases outlined of this project." Here’s how the Department of Natural Resources describes the proposed mine on its website: "Gogebic is currently considering potential development along a four-mile stretch east of Mellen in west-central Ashland County." So, what accounts for the difference? Digging in The permit process for the mine is in the early stages, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top administrator overseeing the project. The first stage would actually be two pits, each two miles long. That’s different from a single giant trench suggested in Kaufman’s claim. Kaufman describes a mine that if fully developed could be 21 miles long, a half mile wide and 1,000 feet deep. There’s no question this would be an immense project, if it happens. But the mine would never look like that. Lynch said the first phase involves the excavation of a pit, which would, in turn, be filled in by the next pit. (Separately, we rated Mostly True a Kaufman claim that the company would be allowed to fill in "pristine streams and ponds with mine waste.") In any case, the mine’s first phase would operate for a projected 35 years. The mine faces strong opposition from the neighboring Bad River band of the Chippewa. And the permitting process would be repeated if the company wanted to mine any additional part of the deposit. That would depend upon what happens with the first phase, and comes with a host of unknowns. Geologists believe the deposit extends 21 miles, but Lynch said "we do not have any information that says it will be economical" for the company to mine all of the iron in the deposit. The iron in the latter phases might been too difficult to extract, in part because the iron is laced throughout the mountains in that region of the state. In any case, no one is suggesting the mine -- even if it was fully developed decades from now -- would be a single, 21-mile-long pit. Our rating Kaufman says the mine "could be extended as long as 21 miles." That’s the size of the deposit that Gogebic Taconite has the rights to mine. But the initial phase envisioned in the permitting process is a four-mile stretch. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away. And that’s only if the company decides it’s worth the effort. Yourdictionary.com says: "The definition of ‘could’ is often used in the place of ‘can’ to show a little doubt." But there’s more than a little doubt here. Kaufman’s statement may be partially true, but it leaves out important information and details. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-15047	"When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/29/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-when-he-left-us-house-we-had-5-tr/	Against the backdrop of acrimony in the House Republican Caucus -- leading to the resignation of Speaker John Boehner last week -- Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is harking back to his own tenure in the House, when, in his view, things moved more smoothly. "Look, I was there in the '90s when we actually got things done," Kasich said in an interview on CBS’ Face the Nation. "Think about it. We changed the welfare system, which had been in place for about 40 years. We balanced the budget, of which I was chief architect. And we cut taxes. The economy was growing and we were doing great. And when I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus." A reader asked us about the $5 trillion number, and we didn’t recall the surplus ever having been that high. So we looked back at the data. Kasich, now the second-term governor of Ohio, last served in the House in 2000, a year when Bill Clinton was ending his tenure in the White House and the Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress. That year, the federal government registered a $236 billion surplus. In raw dollars, that’s the biggest one-year surplus in American history, but it’s not anywhere near the $5-trillion number that Kasich mentioned. So what’s going on? The Kasich campaign said it came from a 10-year figure for the size of the future surplus as determined by the Clinton administration in 2000. The administration projected a cumulative $5 trillion surplus over 10 years, 2001 through 2010. (We should note the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, projected a lower surplus over the same time period of $4.6 trillion.) Of course, this never actually panned out, for a variety of reasons, including the technology bust, the post-9/11 attack recession and the Bush tax cuts, which decreased tax revenues collected. The bigger problem with Kasich’s claim is the shorthand terminology used to describe that number. Even though Kasich said, "When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus," the government never actually had a $5 trillion surplus in hand -- it had a projected $5 trillion surplus (and it was over 10 years, not one). That projection was also subject to numerous assumptions about future growth in spending and revenues -- assumptions that, as it turned out, didn’t hold. Kasich’s campaign acknowledged that his phrasing was somewhat elliptical. "It’s a bit of budget jargon to shorthand it to a ‘$5 trillion surplus’ and leave off the ‘projected,’ but it reflects the way these types of projections are used in policy and budget planning," said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Kasich. Kasich "typically notes that the $5 trillion was a projected surplus, but failed to do so in this instance," added Rob Nichols, another Kasich spokesman. Our ruling Kasich said, "When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus." His rationale for the $5 trillion figure is reasonably sound, but he was inaccurate in how he referred to it. It was a 10-year cumulative projection for future surpluses, rather than a one-year actual surplus, and the savings turned out to be ephemeral due to unforeseen events. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2015-09-29T15:56:27	2015-09-27	['None']
pomt-14349	"Today, the United States has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/mar/23/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-claim-about-us-having-one-lowest-vo/	Does the United States have a lower voter turnout rate than countries from Germany to Greece, and the Netherlands to New Zealand? Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in San Diego Tuesday night that America lags far behind the world’s major countries in carrying out this civic duty. "Today, the United States has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth," Sanders claimed. Sanders makes the claim about low voter turnout at the 17:08 minute mark in the above C-SPAN.org video. Sanders added in a news conference on Wednesday that high voter turnout – particularly among younger and progressive Californians – is key to him winning the Golden State, where turnout has plummeted in recent elections. And while California’s voting struggles have been well documented, we decided to check Sanders’ claim that the country as a whole is mired in a deep turnout slump. The iconoclastic politician has captured strong support from young people during his run for president. That group has traditionally lagged behind on voter turnout. Experts say he must continue to persuade them to vote in high numbers to stand a chance of upsetting frontrunner Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Our research As of Wednesday afternoon, the Sanders campaign had not responded to our request for sources backing up the senator’s claim. But, we found, there’s not much debate about America’s poor voting rate. Last May, the Pew Research Center ranked the United States 31st among 34 developed countries in voting turnout. The center examined votes cast as a percentage of countries’ estimated voting-age population. Looking at votes cast for president in 2012, turnout in the United States was 53.6 percent. The highest comparable rates were in Belgium (87.2 percent), Turkey (86.4 percent) and Sweden (82.6 percent). Meanwhile, Germany had a 66 percent turnout and the United Kingdom’s rate was 61 percent. Smaller players on the national stage, such as Greece, the Netherlands and New Zealand, also all outranked America by a wide margin. Of course, there’s a big caveat. Nearly 30 countries, including six in the group studied by the Pew Research Center, have compulsory voting, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Those include Belgium and Turkey, which had the highest turnout rates. Another factor at play is that many countries, like Sweden and Germany, automatically register citizens to vote. In the United States, that responsibility tends to rest with the individual. Our ruling Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has made boosting voter turnout a big part of his presidential campaign. He continued that focus in San Diego by saying the United States "has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth." Research on the topic shows the United States does, indeed, rank near the bottom in turnout among developed countries. But unlike the U.S., some of those countries require their citizens to cast ballots. And others automatically register them to vote. Sanders’ statement wasn’t wrong, but it left out information that would have helped paint the full picture. We rate his claim Mostly True. In the end, we rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-06161	"We’re $15 trillion now in debt, with a president that’s racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-has-racked-much-debt-almost/	During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy and the federal budget. "We all understand that the spending crisis is extraordinary, with $15 trillion now in debt, with a president that’s racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined." If this sounds familiar, it is: It’s a variation on a claim we’ve addressed before. Romney said something similar at a roundtable of small business leaders in Salem, N.H., on June 27, 2011. Romney said that Obama "is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined." We rated the statement Mostly True. But the second statement won’t get the same rating, for a couple of reasons. Type of debt being measured There are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. The other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future. In June, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told us that the candidate was referring to debt held by the public, so we used that for our measurements. But Romney’s comment from the Sioux City debate was less clear. In the debate, Romney initially said the nation is "$15 trillion now in debt." That’s a measure of gross federal debt -- which is not the measurement he’d been using in previous statements. We were confused about how to proceed, so we checked with the Romney camp. They confirmed that Romney was basing his comparison on public debt. That clarifies our assignment, but it does mean that Romney offered contradictory information in making his debt comparison. Time frame In the earlier statement at the New Hampshire roundtable, Romney was pretty clear that he was talking about how much Obama will have added "by the end of his first term." By contrast, the more recent statement from Sioux City lacks that qualifier, and instead makes it sound like Romney was referring to the amount of debt Obama has racked up so far in his term. The extra year or more in Obama’s first term adds enough debt to make a significant difference in the result. To analyze Romney’s comparison requires determining the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama’s first term. This is not as easy as it sounds. Obama took office on January 20, 2009, but who "owns" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush’s term, and it does not really bear Obama’s imprint. When judging Romney’s claim from the Sioux City debate -- how much debt has accumulated so far during Obama’s term -- we believe that there are three plausible date ranges: -- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Dec. 14, 2011 (the day before the Sioux City debate) -- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama’s inauguration) to Dec. 14, 2011 -- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Dec. 14, 2011 We are able to calculate the debt figures using the U.S. Department of Treasury’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. Here are the public debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above: * End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined. * Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined. * End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined. What’s the meaning of "almost"? In the Sioux City debate -- but not the New Hampshire roundtable -- Romney gave himself some breathing room by inserting the word "almost." But what he meant by that "almost" is not so obvious. In the actual quote, Romney places "almost" before "every president." We’re not quite sure how one would define "almost every president" -- do you drop George W. Bush, who accumulated a lot of debt, or William Henry Harrison, who died a few weeks into his term? If you subtract George W. Bush from the calculation, it's a very favorable way to calculate it from Romney’s perspective, and in fact for one of the measurements -- comparing the accumulated debt level at the start of fiscal 2001 to what Obama has added so far, Obama’s figure is higher. But when we talked to the Romney camp, they said that the candidate had actually meant to say, "almost as much debt as." So how does that formulation mesh with our math above? Under the first of our three scenarios, the debt under Obama has increased by about 78 percent of the amount it rose under the previous 43 presidents. That’s off by more than 20 percent. The other two scenarios don’t come that close. For the second scenario, it’s 65 percent, and for the third, it’s 38 percent. An additional point that affects all comparisons of this sort: Because of the effects of inflation, it’s not entirely fair to compare debt accumulated today to debt accumulated in the time of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt. But neutralizing that problem isn’t easy, so we won’t do anything beyond noting the issue. Our ruling Romney was trying to revive a talking point -- that by the end of his first term, Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined -- that was accurate enough to earn a Mostly True from PolitiFact. This time, though, he allowed small but significant changes to creep in and weaken its accuracy. Romney confused public debt and gross debt; he failed to clarify that he was talking about the debt accruing during the entirety of Obama’s first term; and he misplaced the word "almost" in a way that makes it hard to parse his claim. If we use the public debt figure and put the word "almost" where the Romney campaign says it should be, "almost" might apply to one of three comparisons -- one in which the debt is about four-fifths of the way to equalling totals under previous presidents. That’s a grain of truth, but not much more. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-12-16T15:53:24	2011-12-15	['None']
pomt-05863	Says he signed legislation leading to 12 Texas abortion clinics being closed.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/10/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-signed-legislation-leading-clos/	At a Personhood USA forum in South Carolina last month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry praised a move by Texas lawmakers to "de-fund" Planned Parenthood, which runs family planning and abortion clinics around the country. According to a Jan. 18, 2012, account by Politico, Perry said: "I was really proud to be able to sign legislation that we worked with our legislature to defund Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas. There are 12 abortion clinics that aren’t open in the state of Texas today because our members of the Legislature had the courage, the wisdom to do that." Perry’s statement, made the day before he dropped his bid for president, came to our attention from Sarah Wheat, interim co-CEO of the Austin-area Planned Parenthood, who told us via email that none of the clinics Perry referenced provided abortions -- and that 11, not 12, clinics closed. Wheat told us the Texas clinics to which Perry referred were "nonprofit health centers … that provided family planning health exams, cancer screenings, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other basic health care." Wheat said in another email that the clinics were located in Arlington, Gainesville, Mesquite, Plano, Terrell, Mission, Progreso, Rio Grande City, San Carlos, Alice and Brownsville. She said clinics that provide abortions are ineligible for state funds, while the closed clinics had been receiving state money until September 2011, the beginning of the state’s new fiscal year. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), advised by email that there are now 156 state-supported family planning clinics -- compared to 300 through August 2011. Previously, such clinics served 220,000 women a year, she said, while expectations are that the remaining state-supported clinics will serve about 60,000 women a year through August 2013. In a telephone interview, Williams confirmed that abortion clinics do not receive state or federal funding. In an email, she said the clinics that closed had each received state funding in 2011. Separately, she said that had those clinics provided abortions, they would not have been eligible for state money. Perry repeated his characterization of the shuttered clinics at a Feb. 6, 2012, Republican Party event north of Austin, according to a KVUE-TV report. "Since I signed that budget," Perry said then, "there have been about a dozen Planned Parenthood 'abortion clinics' that have shut down in this state. There are lives that have been saved." We asked Perry spokesman Josh Havens for backup information on the governor’s claim that legislative action caused abortion-providing clinics to close. Havens said in a telephone interview that he didn’t know which, if any, of the clinics performed abortions. Regardless, Havens said, he would "make the argument that a Planned Parenthood clinic is an abortion clinic." "Even if the specific clinic was (for) family planning, it’s affiliated with its parent organization, which does do abortions," Havens said. Havens agreed in an email that clinics that provide abortion services are ineligible for state funds. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. bills itself as "the nation's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and advocate" and runs its sexual health clinics through local affiliates. About 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood offers are abortion services, the organization says. In Texas, 14 Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics provide abortions, according to information on Planned Parenthood’s website. Wheat said its 51 other clinics in the state focus on preventive services, including the provision of contraception and screenings for cervical and breast cancer. The organization also offers some services for men. Nationally and in Texas, whether government funding should pay for abortions has long been debated. Title X of the Public Health Service Act, enacted in 1970, stipulated that federal family planning funds could not be used for abortions, according to Elizabeth Nash, a specialist in state-level sexual health policy at the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde amendment, significantly reducing federal funding of abortions by banning Medicaid and other programs from spending federal funds on the procedures except in cases of rape or incest, or when the woman’s life is in danger. In Texas, various laws have addressed the issue of state funding for abortions since the 1990s. But 2003 was a pivotal year. Before then, "Planned Parenthood and other providers that pay for abortions with non-tax dollars received state money to provide Pap smears, well-woman exams, counseling and mammograms, mostly for low-income patients," according to a May 23, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article. In 2003, the newly Republican-majority Texas House and Republican-steered Senate agreed to a budget provision barring federal family planning funds from being distributed to health care facilities that performed abortions. In subsequent legislative sessions, lawmakers renewed that language in each budget. Sometimes, they advanced into law additional proposals intended to keep public funds from reaching abortion providers and clinics affiliated with the providers. So, what exactly did the 2011 Legislature do that affected the Planned Parenthood clinics? To our inquiry, Williams of the DSHS pointed out two actions. First, Williams said, lawmakers reduced the department’s family planning funding by two-thirds. That is, they appropriated $38 million for family planning services for 2012-13, compared to the $111 million budgeted in 2009-10. Williams said the reduction wiped out funds to some of the Planned Parenthood clinics that ultimately shut down. Besides the funding cut, Williams said, lawmakers advanced two measures, House Bill 1 and Senate Bill 7, restructuring the way funding is allotted for the DSHS-supported family planning centers in the state. "It stands to reason that (there are fewer clinics now) because of the budget cuts," Williams said. "The budget for family planning was reduced dramatically, and that’s going to change the financial outlook for clinics. There’s less money available." Under the restructuring provision, state family planning aid is awarded first to public entities, like state health clinics, that provide family planning services, and last to clinics--like Planned Parenthood--that don’t provide comprehensive health services. The budget cuts and establishment of the tiered funding system "changed the landscape for Planned Parenthood and other providers," Williams said. Wheat said that the cut in family planning aid caused the Planned Parenthood clinics to shut down. "The number one, primary reason for these closures is there’s one-third of the funds that used to be available," she said. "There’s precious few dollars in the state that are left." Some Planned Parenthood clinics, including an East Austin clinic now dependent on donations, had previously relied on the state funding to survive, Wheat said. She speculated that when Perry celebrated the 12 closures, he might have been including the East Austin clinic. So, legislative moves approved by Perry evidently led to at least 11 Planned Parenthood clinic closings. Presuming those clinics did not provide abortions, since they were eligible for state money, we asked Wheat whether shuttered clinics could still be reasonably associated with abortion clinics -- and if that, as Perry’s spokesman suggested, makes them about the same as abortion clinics. Wheat said the family planning clinics and abortion service providers were entirely separate, independent nonprofit organizations, per language inserted into each budget since the 2003 legislative session that requires the separation of such institutions in order for family planning clinics to be eligible for state funds. "We are all Planned Parenthood health centers, but the services that are provided and how we’re legally operated and governed, those are all completely independent," Wheat explained. She said that while Planned Parenthood family planning and abortion clinics fall under the same umbrella organization, and all have to meet certain requirements--professional standards for personnel, for example--the two kinds of clinics are entirely separate, maintaining different bank accounts, different governing boards and filing separate tax returns. At Planned Parenthood family planning clinics, Wheat said, counselors inform women facing unintended pregnancy of three options: adoption, abortion or prenatal care. Wheat said that if a woman chooses the abortion option, a counselor talks with her about how to proceed and offers a list of resources including abortion providers. However, Wheat said, the family planning clinics do not transfer any client’s medical records to an abortion clinic or otherwise provide medical referrals. Clinics will, however, transfer official medical records for women who opt for prenatal care, she said. As we closed out this research, we asked Joe Pojman, executive director of the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life, to assess Perry’s statement. Pojman said that as far he knows, no Texas abortion clinics shut down as a result of Texas legislative decisions in 2011. Perry, he speculated, was suggesting that Planned Parenthood’s family planning clinics are closely related to the abortion services affiliated with the overarching Planned Parenthood group. Havens responded to a follow-up request for clarification of the governor’s statement in an email: "The governor meant what he said. Planned Parenthood clinics either perform abortions or refer women to affiliated abortion clinics. Neither the governor nor the Texas Legislature make a distinction between whether the abortion is performed on premises or enabled through an affiliate. When a Planned Parenthood clinic closes, it can no longer perform this function." Our ruling Planned Parenthood clinics shut down due to legislative decisions approved by Perry. But Perry's key point -- that the clinics provided abortions -- is unsupported. Abortion providers had been ineligible for state funding for years. This reference to abortion is critical to Perry's claim, which we rate Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-02-10T13:46:25	2012-01-18	['Texas']

pomt-03505	"During the Bush administration, liberal groups were targeted" by the IRS, similar to recent targeting.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/06/jim-mcdermott/irs-targeted-liberal-groups-bush-years-jim-mcdermo/	At a House Ways and Means committee hearing Tuesday, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., listened closely to the stories from members of groups that were snagged when the IRS cast a wide net for politically active organizations seeking tax-exempt status. All of the groups advocate for conservative causes, from opposing gay marriage to promoting a broad tea party agenda. While McDermott said he was sorry they had been singled out, and that "the IRS has unequivocally made a mistake here," he was more focused on the lack of clear legal rules that should guide the IRS. "Let’s not get lost," McDermott said. "During the Bush administration liberal groups were targeted without any concern by Mr. Issa or anyone else in this committee." (Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.) This caught our eye. Were liberal groups targeted when a Republican held the White House? And if so, were the circumstances back then similar to what has come to light today? We asked McDermott’s office for details and staff pointed us to a recent Salon article that described how the IRS subjected the NAACP, Greenpeace and a liberal Episcopal church in California to sometimes intense scrutiny. In 2004, the IRS audited the NAACP after its chairman said President George W. Bush was the first sitting president since Herbert Hoover who declined to speak before the group. The same year, the IRS moved to revoke the tax-exempt status of All Saints Episcopal in Pasadena. The Sunday before the 2004 election, the rector told the congregation "Jesus (would say), ‘Mr. President, your doctrine of pre-emptive war is a failed doctrine.' " That case dragged on for three years before the IRS dropped it. From 2004 to 2009, the IRS had a Political Activities Compliance Initiative aimed at 501(c)(3) groups that might have endorsed a candidate or otherwise crossed the line between charitable work and electioneering. In 2004, the IRS opened cases on 110 groups. While there were allegations and even lawsuits claiming that the IRS took a light hand with churches that promoted conservative candidates, a 2005 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found no political bias. "We ... did not identify any cases in which the same criteria were used to select one information item for examination and to decline a similar item for examination," the auditors wrote. The current controversy involves the examination of nearly 300 groups and there are significant differences today from the examples cited in the Salon article: The inspector general found that IRS staff used "inappropriate criteria" to identify groups for special attention. A group’s name or a focus on government debt and spending triggered IRS action, rather than the group’s activities. Most of the groups, about 70 percent, held or were applying for 501(c)(4) status, not 501(c)(3). The limits on (c)(3) groups -- the ones examined under Bush -- are much more strict than for (c)(4) groups. The inspector general found that all cases with "tea party," "patriots" or "9/12" in their name were singled out. All the experts we contacted said the rules concerning what 501(c)(4) groups can and cannot do are vague and leave the door open to excesses by the IRS. McDermott’s office said that the congressman’s point was that while the recent IRS actions were unacceptable, they don’t represent a political conspiracy or a unique occurrence. Nevertheless, McDermott’s comparison falls short on a number of fronts. David Keating, president of the conservative leaning group, Center for Competitive Politics, sees nothing similar between what happened under Bush and what happened under Obama. "I just don't’ see this as being in the same league," Keating said. The key difference is the global impact of the IRS screening. "What the IRS did with the tea party groups is they set them aside and every single one got special scrutiny because of the philosophy of the organization." In contrast, Keating said, there is no evidence that the IRS under Bush targeted all environmental groups or all progressive churches. Another legal expert, Bruce Fein, who served in the Reagan Justice Department, said McDermott’s comparison also falls short because the rules concerning (c)(3) groups are so tight. "Even the tiniest political activity would raise a flag with a (c)(3). You would naturally expect that there is going to be a more exacting examination." On the other hand, Gabe Rottman, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said we should withhold full judgment on the IRS actions during the 18 months between 2010 and 2012. "We don't know if it was a good faith mistake or if it was an effort by people at the IRS to target these groups because of their political beliefs," Rottman said. "What happened under Bush, the mechanics might be different, but the existence of a situation that allows selective enforcement is a problem across both administrations." That said, Rottman agreed that the systematic screening criticized in the present inspector general’s report creates greater harm than the more case-by-case instances during the Bush administration. We should note that the IRS’s more recent methods caught up at least three Democratic-leaning groups. Bloomberg reported that Emerge America, Progress Texas and Clean Elections Texas received IRS letters requesting more information. Emerge America ultimately saw its tax-exempt status denied, making it the only group to suffer that fate during this episode. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an organization that has sued the IRS for failing to rein in conservative 501(c)(4) groups, said she has no doubt the Bush administration went after the NAACP and others because it didn’t like them. But she finds little use for McDermott’s comparison. "It’s apples and oranges," Sloan said. "Those were big organizations with an established track record. What you have here are new groups asking for special tax status, and the IRS was legitimately asking them if they engaged in political activities to see if it exceeded what the law allows." Our ruling McDermott said liberal groups were targeted during the Bush administration. While some liberal groups were audited, the numbers we could find were small, largely confined to 501(c)(3) nonprofits where the rules are more strict, and stemmed from complaints levied by outsiders. In contrast, the current case was fueled by internal bureaucratic rules applied to a significantly larger number of organizations. A group’s name or its policy agenda triggered the IRS action, rather than a complaint or the group’s specific activities. While there is an element of truth in McDermott’s statement, the systematic nature of the IRS actions between 2010 and 2012 represents a distinctly different set of circumstances.

pomt-06680	Says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security must report to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/08/tom-kean-sr/former-new-jersey-gov-tom-kean-claims-homeland-sec/	People look at former Gov. Tom Kean in disbelief when he says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees. Kean, the former head of the 9/11 Commission, received the same reaction from radio host Brian Lehrer on Aug. 30 when discussing counter-terrorism efforts as the country approaches the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. During the WNYC broadcast from Montclair State University, Lehrer asked Kean about a May 2010 article on NJ.com, in which Kean is quoted as saying "Homeland Security spends way too much of its time reporting to the 100 congressional subcommittees that claim some type of jurisdiction." Lehrer asked Kean, "Is it really a hundred or were you just kind of using an expression?" Kean responded: "I wish I was. No, it’s about a hundred…Believe it or not, if you can imagine this, let’s say you’re (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary) Janet Napolitano and you’ve been given a job of running Homeland Security. In other words, protecting all of us. "And all of sudden, you find out you’re reporting to a hundred different committees and subcommittees in (the) United States Congress. And you’re spending at least a third of your time preparing testimony or testifying, you and your top deputies. That’s a third of your time you’re not spending protecting us. This is dysfunctional." That may be dysfunctional, but it’s also true. PolitiFact New Jersey discovered Kean was right -- Homeland Security must report to 108 congressional committees and subcommittees, according to the department. Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 26, Homeland Security officials testified at 120 hearings and provided about 1,809 briefings to congressional offices, according to department records. Napolitano also has expressed concern with her department’s level of congressional oversight. "This often results in our principals and their staff spending more time responding to congressional requests and requirements than executing their mandated homeland security responsibilities," Napolitano wrote in an April 2010 letter to U.S. Rep. Peter King (R-NY). The number of congressional eyeballs on Homeland Security operations has been subject to continued criticism in the years since the department was formed. Created slightly more than a year after Sept. 11, Homeland Security combined all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies. According to its July 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission recommended reforming congressional oversight of Homeland Security, which was then answering to 88 committees and subcommittees. A few months later, a report from a group of former legislators and other individuals noted that oversight of the U.S. Department of Defense was much different. "In comparison, the Department of Defense, with a budget that is more than ten times greater than DHS, reports to only 36 committees and subcommittees in the House and the Senate," according to that December 2004 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Business Executives for National Security. Following the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and another federal panel, Congress took "a few incremental steps," such as forming the House Homeland Security Committee, according to a December 2008 report from the Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism. But that report said "the creation of these new committees (and subcommittees) did nothing to streamline the number of congressional panels to which DHS must respond." More criticism of Homeland Security’s oversight came as recently as last week, when Kean and other members of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s National Security Preparedness Group -- a follow-up to the 9/11 Commission -- issued a "report card" on the status of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations. That report card said "too many committees have concurrent and overlapping jurisdiction. This is a recipe for confusion." King, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, pledged in a Sept. 1 press release to continue working with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other House leaders to reform congressional oversight of Homeland Security. The ruling As unbelievable as it may sound to his listeners, Kean accurately states that Homeland Security answers to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees. It’s a level of oversight that has attracted the criticism of various entities and the Homeland Security Secretary herself. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12402	"You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license" in Florida.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/may/25/desmond-meade/driving-suspended-license-can-lead-loss-voting-rig/	Desmond Meade, a convicted drug offender who later turned his life around and graduated from law school, is leading the effort in Florida to automatically restore voting rights to many felons. Meade’s effort to put a question on the Florida ballot got a major plug from comedian Samantha Bee, who used her TBS show Full Frontal on May 10 to highlight the topic of how felons struggle to regain civil rights in Florida. "Ever since losing the popular vote, President (Donald) Trump has had his Underoos in a wad about 3 million people who voted illegally," Bee said, setting up her interview with Meade. "They don't exist. What does exist is 6 million people whose right to vote has been taken away. To learn about them, I went to Florida, where retirees and democracy go to die." Meade, from Orlando, told Bee that in Florida, 1.68 million felons have lost the right to vote. And some of those felonies are less serious than others. "It doesn’t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license," he said. "Come on Florida," Bee replied, "do you really want to be the Florida of everything?" Meade has a point that not all the felonies that cost a person their right to vote are as egregious as murder or sexual assault. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if driving with a suspended license could really cost a Floridian his or her civil rights, and how often it happens. Restoration of rights for felons is a hot topic in Florida, a swing state where any significant changes to the voting population can have a big impact. Research in a few states has shown that more felons after being released from prison register as Democrats than Republicans. All felony convictions cost Floridians the right to vote In April, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously approved language for a proposed amendment to restore voting rights to felons after they complete their sentences. The next hurdle for advocates including Meade is to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the ballot in 2018. (Meade, a recovered drug addict, is among felons who have lost their civil rights: He served about three years in prison after a conviction for a 2001 firearm possession charge.) The proposed amendment calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically once they have completed their sentences including parole or probation. Automatic restoration would not apply to felons convicted of murder or sexual offenses, who would still have to ask the Florida Cabinet and Gov. Rick Scott to restore their rights in a slow and cumbersome process. While the policy extends back to the Jim Crow era and makes Florida an outlier nationally, there have been efforts to make the process easier. In 2007 under then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, felons convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing after finishing their sentences. However, in 2011, the Republican Cabinet, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Gov. Rick Scott scrapped that process and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period. Since 2011 through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored while more than 10,000 cases are pending. That means that felons don’t necessarily lose their rights for the rest of their life, but it’s a long and cumbersome process and ultimately the Cabinet can deny restoring someone’s rights. The Florida Constitution (section 4a) states: "No person convicted of a felony, or adjudicated in this or any other state to be mentally incompetent, shall be qualified to vote or hold office until restoration of civil rights or removal of disability." That broadly applies to all types of felonies, experts said. "Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights," said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute. Meade sent PolitiFact the statute about the penalties for driving with a suspended license in Florida. The law states that a first or second offense is a misdemeanor but a third or subsequent conviction is a third-degree felony. We were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes. That makes it difficult to quantify which statutes most commonly, or infrequently, result in loss of rights. We were able to get data on the number of felony convictions for driving with a suspended license. There were 6,759 felony convictions between 2012 and 2016, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Advocates in favor of restoring rights to felons pointed to some other felonies that don’t exactly conjure up the image of threatening lawbreakers. Bee’s show highlighted some of those statutes, such as tampering with a lobster trap or an odometer -- both felonies, although they rarely result in convictions. Take the case, for example, of the man a state trooper said violated a rarely-prosecuted felony pollution statute when Anthony Brasfield released a dozen heart-shaped balloons in Broward around Valentine’s Day in 2013. Broward prosecutors didn’t file a case based on that statute, in part because prosecutors thought the jury would likely see this as a romantic gesture rather than a criminal act. Brasfield ultimately pled guilty to a lesser offense: a misdemeanor for driving while his license was suspended. Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, pointed to a few additional felony statutes, including knowingly presenting a counterfeit or altered state lottery ticket or trespassing on posted commercial horticultural property Our ruling Meade said, "It doesn’t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license," he said. The Florida Constitution says people convicted of felonies cannot vote until their civil rights are restored, a process that takes years after felons complete their sentences and is ultimately up to the Florida Cabinet and governor. Meade omits an important caveat about the Florida statute specifically about driving with a suspended license: the first and second convictions are misdemeanors, so the crime only becomes a felony upon the third or subsequent conviction.

pomt-02066	Surface temperatures on Earth "have stabilized."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/27/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-surface-temperatures-earth-have-st/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been attracting a lot of attention recently for expressing skepticism about how much humans contribute to global warming and what policy approaches the United States should take. During a May 20, 2014, interview, Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly asked Rubio, "Now, you said (a) flat-out bold and fresh statement that you don't believe the scientists on global warming. Are you going up against these people?" Rubio responded, "No, here's the point. First of all, I have never denied the climate is changing. That shouldn't surprise us. The climate is always changing. The second point on the science is, the left loves to go around saying there is a consensus, there is a consensus. There is a majority of scientists that say that global carbon emissions by humans causes some changes in the climate. What there is no consensus on and (what) they conveniently ignore is there is no consensus on the sensitivity of the climate. How much is it changing and how much of it is directly attributable to human carbon emission? There is no consensus on that, which is why the models vary so greatly, which is why, despite 17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures (on) the earth have stabilized." We wondered whether Rubio was accurate when he said that surface temperatures on Earth "have stabilized." Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story. But in interviews with nearly a dozen scientists, we received a nuanced assessment of his remark. On the one hand, we found most accepting Rubio’s starting point -- that surface temperatures on earth, which were once rising rapidly, have "paused" their increase over the past 16 or 17 years. On the other hand, most of the scientists we checked with took exception to his use of the word "stabilized" to describe this phenomenon, saying the "pause" is temporary. While "stabilized" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of it, the reality, scientists say, is that temperatures will rise again, sooner or later. "Stabilized" is "a very poor word to use," said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Rubio’s word choice "has no merit," agreed Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Reto Ruedy, a climate specialist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, concurred, saying that the claim of stabilization had "no legitimacy." Even Paul C. "Chip" Knappenberger, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said Rubio had gone too far by saying the situation had "stabilized." While global warming "certainly has slowed down considerably" over the past 16 or 17 years, Knappenberger said confirmation that the situation has "stabilized" would take "another 10 to 20 years." "The pace will probably pick back up again at sometime in the future," Knappenberger said. "But when that will be, or what the new pace will be, are far from scientifically agreed upon characteristics." A closer look at the recent past Climate-change skeptics have made the pause a cornerstone of their argument that concern about global warming is overblown. And at least on the existence of a pause, the statistics are on their side. An interactive chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows land and ocean surface temperatures going back to the 1800s. While there’s been some variation in surface temperatures since 1998, it has remained within a relatively narrow band, which contrasts with the rapid rise during the decades that preceded it. (The strongest evidence of a pause is for the past 16 years, but we won’t quibble with Rubio’s use of the 17-year time frame.) Scientists also said that Rubio is correct to point to the uncertainty inherent in climate models. Mainstream climate scientists are taking the pause seriously. As PolitiFact Rhode Island has noted, the United Kingdom’s weather office has begun referring to the last 16 years as "the recent pause in warming." It’s worth noting that even at the level of the "pause," temperatures are still historically high. As we’ve previously noted, 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years, according to NASA. But importantly, most scientists do not expect the pause to continue indefinitely. The United Kingdom office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Judith Curry, who chairs the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology -- and who believes climate change is happening but has put more emphasis on the scientific uncertainties than other scientists -- said reasonable people can disagree with how quickly the temperature rise will begin and how far it will go. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body that has been among the most prominent voices raising the specter of significant impacts from climate change, said it "expects the temperatures to resume increasing soon, whereas certain scientists, including myself, expect the current pause in surface temperatures to continue for another decade or two," Curry said. We couldn’t find any experts who believe temperatures have "stabilized" in the sense of settling down into a consistent pattern indefinitely. "Increases in Earth's temperature have indeed slowed, but have certainly not stabilized," said Rob Jackson, an earth sciences professor at Stanford University. "Every year is now what would have been a record year in the 1990s, and the last decade was the warmest in the modern record." Rubio’s statement "is misleading, because it implies that the climate has reached a balance or equilibrium, so that global temperatures will not rise in the future," agreed Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. "However, the earth's climate has not stabilized. In particular, the flow of energy into and out of the planet is not in balance. It is gaining more energy than it is losing, due to increased greenhouse gases, and therefore future warming is unavoidable." Explaining the paradox of the 'pause' The central paradox Rubio points out -- an increase in carbon dioxide emissions without a commensurate rise in surface temperatures -- has prompted several theories to explain it. One reason is that, over the long term, data always fluctuates somewhat. "The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise," but superimposed on this general trend are "periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling," said Serreze of the University of Colorado-Boulder. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, "the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming." Some experts add that starting the count in 1998 exaggerates the "pause," since that was an unusually strong "El Nino" year. El Nino is an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally, including raising global temperatures by releasing "tremendous amounts of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere," said Jennifer Francis, a research professor at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University. "To look at the trend of a relatively short period that started out with an extraordinary El Nino event causing a huge temperature spike is a cheap device," said Reto Ruedy of NASA’s Goddard Institute. The physical explanation gaining the most traction is that "the oceans have accumulated most of the heat from human-induced global warming," said Harold Wanless, University of Miami geological sciences professor. One recent paper found that in one part of the Pacific, middle-depth temperatures have been rising 15 times faster over the past six decades than at any other time over the past 10,000 years. Other papers have found similar evidence. Basic physics teaches that water has an immense ability to take in and hold heat -- but that same heat will eventually be released. "The trapped heat is still in the system, and it will be released into the atmosphere when the recent pattern of Pacific Ocean temperatures switches back to its warmer phase," said Francis of Rutgers. Other factors may also be playing a role in the "pause," said Reilly of MIT. In addition to an absence of strong El Nino events since 1998, Reilly said, the eruption of some moderate volcanoes may have produced cooling effects that counteracted some of the heating. And there’s evidence that the long-term data sets for temperature have under-recorded Arctic regions where temperatures have been rising most rapidly. "So, several factors that are known sources of variability in the climate system all, by coincidence, contributed to a cooling trend over the period," Reilly said. This suggests that global warming "was occurring -- it's just that the added warmth was going into the ocean. It’s unlikely that all of these coincidences will continue, or continue to offset warming." Our ruling Rubio said that "surface temperatures in the earth have stabilized." He has a point that over roughly the past decade and a half, global surface temperatures have "paused," particularly compared to their rapid rise in previous decades. But scientists we interviewed agreed that the use of the word "stabilized" represents an unjustified leap from the data, since "stabilized" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of climate change. At the very least, the uncertainty inherent in climate forecasting makes such a claim of "stabilization" premature. More likely, the evidence suggests that the "pause" in global surface temperatures is temporary, with temperatures poised to rise once the oceans start releasing more heat, such as during an El Nino event. It’s not clear when temperatures will rise again, but few scientists doubt that temperatures will rise again at some point. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-07904	Wisconsin employers have repeatedly said in surveys that our anti-business litigation climate is one of the most important factors affecting their expansion decisions.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/02/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-surveys-repeatedly-showed-bu/	Gov. Scott Walker sounded a bit defensive when signing a lawsuit-reform bill he called for during the Republican-controlled Legislature’s special January session. Walker told reporters he wanted the bill passed quickly to ease the threat of frivolous litigation, because Wisconsin has "out of control" lawsuit abuse -- and employers have made it a top complaint. We have already tackled the first part of that explanation. We gave a False ruling to a small business group’s claim that Wisconsin has one of the most anti-business injury-lawsuit systems in the country. (Wisconsin stands out on a few high-profile issues, but is generally rated middle of the pack or even better in legal-climate surveys). Addressing reporters at a Jan. 27, 2011, bill-signing ceremony, Walker elaborated on the second part of his rationale. "Time and time again on survey after survey," he said, "employers tell us that one of the most important elements when they are considering expanding and investing in the state, is what the litigation climate is." Is lawsuit reform really one of the top priorities for employers seeking a friendlier business climate? The legislative debate is over. But we thought it was worth a look back as the changes -- which critics say will harm consumer protection in injury cases -- go into effect. Walker, through spokesman Cullen Werwie, pointed us to four national surveys. One was a 2010 national poll for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an advocate of easing lawsuits on business. In it, 67% of lawyers for major corporations said the litigation environment is likely to affect business decisions such as where to do business. A second -- a 2007 national survey for the chamber -- found half of businesses were concerned about getting unfairly sued. In that group, 11% blamed lawsuit-related business decisions for laying off workers. The other two surveys, by private groups surveying the public and doctors, showed strong support for tort reform as part of federal health care legislation. The national surveys don’t break out any state-specific results or rank concerns about the litigation climate against the many other factors that play a role in relocation or expansion decisions. And Walker did not cite any information specifically about Wisconsin. So, we went looking for some Wisconsin data -- and what we found did not break in Walker’s favor. The most on-point data comes from the annual surveys by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, a trade group that represents 3,500 Wisconsin employers. In June 2010, 263 CEOs responded to the organization’s survey that asked executives to pick "one thing state government could do to improve Wisconsin’s business climate." The result: 1 percent named lawsuit reform. The group also did a narrower 2010 survey, of the group’s board of directors. None named it, and over the last five years just 3 percent to 6.4 percent of board members mentioned it. In a prior survey of its full membership, in 2001, the WMC did not even put tort reform on the list of possible answers to that question. In 2010, lawsuit reform tied for lowest among 10 concerns in the membership survey. Topping the wish list: reduced taxes, less regulation and cuts in government spending. The song was the same when the membership was asked to name "one thing state government could do to help your business." Lawsuit reform was a non-issue (0 percent) in most years, with a spike to 10 percent in 2004. WMC is most often associated with big business, but has a mix of members. What about small business? We checked with the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business. The chapter made the claim that we rated False about Wisconsin having one of the most unfriendly legal climates for business in the United States. The group’s state director, Bill Smith, said lawsuit reform is always among the five or six concerns of small businesses, but it’s hard to rank the issues. The group hasn’t polled its members specifically on it. Meanwhile, when the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce surveys its members, it lumps lawsuit reform in with regulation, so it’s impossible to say how big an issue it is. The lessons from these surveys: Lawsuit reform is a minor concern, or at least doesn’t stand out from the pack when businesses spell out what they want from government. But worries about lawsuits and their effect on business decisions are pretty widespread. Nevertheless, the business community has made a high-profile push in recent years to get changes in the legal climate. Various business and industry organizations even formed a coalition to lobby on the issue. Business concerns grew after Wisconsin Supreme Court rulings and legislative tussles broke out with Democrats over damages and liability in negligence cases. "Once businesses get sued, they get more concerned," said Jim Pugh of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce. He argues that legal reform is widely desired by business, but overshadowed by taxation and spending concerns: "You have to look beyond surveys." So where does this leave us? In trying to tie the lawsuit reforms to job creation, Walker asserted the issue is "one of the most important factors" when businesses are deciding to expand or invest in Wisconsin. That’s a major overreach. He cited a series of national surveys, which show it’s a concern but lack Wisconsin data and don’t weigh how the concern stacks up against other issues. In the surveys of state businesses we found, lawsuit reform is on the radar screen -- but a blip behind taxes, regulation and other issues. We rate Walker’s claim False.

pomt-05165	"Before I was governor, tuition was skyrocketing and we stopped that. We capped and then we froze college tuition."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/18/george-allen/george-allen-says-he-froze-college-tuition-when-he/	U.S. Senate candidate George Allen says he put the brakes on rising college costs when he was governor from 1994 to 1998. "Before I was governor, tuition was skyrocketing, and we stopped that," Allen said in a May 25 debate between four candidates seeking the GOP Senate nomination. "We capped, and then we froze college tuition." Allen won the Republican primary on June 12 and will face Democrat Tim Kaine this fall. They are seeking to replace Democrat Jim Webb, who is not seeking a second Senate term. We wondered if the Allen administration really did put a lid on tuition. Allen, while making this claim, shared credit with the Democratic-controlled legislature that served with him. Dan Allen, a senior adviser to the campaign, pointed us to a July 2011 report from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. The study said that during the early 1990s, colleges and universities increased tuitions by double digits annually to compensate for state funding cuts made by the General Assembly and then-Gov. Doug Wilder to help balance the budget during a recession. Wilder, in his final budget proposal made during an improving economy in December 1993, urged the General Assembly to cap tuition and instructional fee increases for in-state students at 5 percent during the 1994-95 school year and 4 percent during 1995-96. Allen, who took office in January 1994, successfully urged the General Assembly go a step further and cap the increases at 3 percent during each of the next two school years. In 1996, as SCHEV notes, Allen and the General Assembly froze tuition and instructional fees entirely. The action did not apply to a number of other mandatory college costs, such as fees for athletic programs, health services and campus transportation. Lawmakers eased some of the burden on colleges by appropriating an additional $200 million for higher education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch in January 1998 reported that a strong economy during Allen’s term allowed him to finance the tuition freeze. State tax revenues grew by about 45 percent during his tenure. Allen, in his farewell budget, recommended freezing tuition through 2000. His successor, Republican Jim Gilmore, rolled back tuition and instructional fees by 20 percent for in-state students. When Allen arrived in the governor’s mansion during the 1993-94 academic year, the average tuition and instructional fees for full time, in-state undergraduate students at four-year colleges was $2,518, according to SCHEV’s historical tables. That rose to $2,717 in the 1995-1996 academic year and stayed at that level through 1997-1998, the last academic year of Allen’s term. Using inflation-adjusted figures based on 1992 dollars, the report shows the amount of tuition and instructional fees went from $2,383 in the 1993-94 academic year down to $2,320 in 1997-98. Even when other mandatory fees that were not subject freeze are added in, the college costs remained flat after being adjusted for inflation. Costs at two-year colleges showed the same trend: in-state tuition and instructional fees at those institutions were basically flat during Allen’s term. Our ruling Allen said that, as governor, he stopped soaring tuition costs by implementing a tuition freeze. Allen and the General Assembly did impose a freeze after tuition had risen sharply during the early 1990s recession. Allen had leeway to cap tuitions because a healthy economy during his term allowed lawmakers to increase state appropriations to colleges and universities. We rate Allen’s claim True.

pomt-05277	Says Obama broke his promise to help homeowners facing foreclosure.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/25/crossroads-gps/crossroads-ad-says-obama-has-failed-stem-foreclosu/	As the economic collapse began to threaten homeowners, presidential candidate Barack Obama vowed to come to their aid. "We must help the millions of homeowners facing foreclosure," he said on the campaign trail in June 2008. His plan called for changes in bankruptcy laws, a crackdown on predatory and fraudulent lenders and a $10 billion fund to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. With Obama seeking re-election in 2012, his record on the foreclosure crisis is under attack. The Republican group Crossroads GPS said in a recent television ad that Obama broke his promise to help struggling homeowners. The ad shows Obama saying he would help them and then stamps "BROKEN" on the screen. PolitiFact examined the Crossroads claim and found that, indeed, Obama has had limited success with his plans to ease the mortgage crisis. "I don't think there's much doubt, even within the administration, that the (foreclosure assistance) programs overpromised and underperformed -- embarrassingly so," said Ken Harney, who writes a weekly syndicated real estate column. 'They wimped out' During the 2008 campaign and his first few months in office, Obama promised a lot: ● $10 billion foreclosure prevention fund to help struggling homeowners ● Change in bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify mortgage loan terms ● Tax credits for struggling homeowners ● A crackdown on predatory and fraudulent lenders ● Better disclosure about mortgages to home-buyers ● A moratorium on foreclosures The results, experts say, have been mixed at best. Obama himself says the housing crisis is the most stubborn issue he has faced. "If we were not a capitalist economy, it would be very easy," said Ken Thomas, an independent bank analyst and economist in Miami. "We’re a market-regulated economy, we’re not a government-regulated economy. That makes it very hard for the government to do anything." The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, which Obama signed in 2009, makes it a federal crime to make a materially false statement on a mortgage application or to willfully overvalue a property to influence any action by a mortgage lending business. PolitiFact's Obameter gave that a Promise Kept. And new standards for helping people understand their mortgage were included in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul passed in 2010, another Promise Kept. But he's had limited success with the promises that would have provided the biggest help to homeowners, according to five experts we interviewed. A temporary foreclosure moratorium happened in early 2009 as banks halted their filings while they waited for the new administration to get its plan in place to address the crisis. It’s not clear, though, that it ultimately kept many people out of foreclosure. Analysts say the change in bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify individual loans could have made a significant difference, but it died in Congress. "That sort of took the wind out of the program, in a way. If it had passed, it would have put much more fire under the feet of the mortgage servicers," said Alex Schwartz, a professor of urban policy at the New School and author of the book Housing Policy in the United States. Instead, he said, "you were left with voluntary participation of servicers." The foreclosure prevention fund was the heart of his promise. He originally pledged $10 billion but ended up setting aside $75 billion, using TARP funds. He predicted the money would assist 9 million homeowners. But after three years, only about 2 million people have won permanent mortgage help, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The two main programs were dubbed HAMP and HARP. Under the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, lenders were encouraged to restructure loans for borrowers who were struggling to pay. The banks received small payments from the government as incentive. The Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, aimed to help people refinance their loans at lower interest rates. "Everything has fallen short of original expectations," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s. Other experts agree. "Obama’s program was overly complicated, it was voluntary, it was at a retail level, requiring people to call in and work with individual servicers. It was a mess," Schwartz said. (On our Obameter, we've rated the foreclosure fund a Promise Broken because it fell far short of Obama's goal of helping 9 million homeowners.) Another shortcoming of the programs: The Obama administration did not require banks to include principal reduction in modifications. The programs allowed loan servicers to reduce loan balances, but it shocked no one when most banks opted not to. Making that a requirement would have gone a long way toward keeping people in their homes. "There’s a real risk that when people are so severely underwater, they could walk away from their mortgages," Schwartz said. "So you can make a strong case for principal reduction." Harney, the real estate columnist, also blamed the president for not flexing more political muscle with the banks. "At a time when the administration could have pushed the big TARP-recipient banks much harder on modifications, short sales and principal reductions, they wimped out," Harney said. "Whether the close connections between Wall Street and the new White House/Treasury staff got in the way of stronger designs, I don't know. The numbers speak for themselves." The landscape now Numbers about the foreclosure crisis show things have improved only slightly. According to RealtyTrac, a website that collects and tracks foreclosure data, about 150,000 new foreclosure suits were filed nationwide in January 2009, the month Obama took office. They peaked at 203,948 in April 2009 and didn’t dip below 100,000 in a single month until April 2011. And last month, another 97,000 new foreclosures were filed. Crossroads cites the high rate of underwater mortgages as evidence that Obama’s programs failed. In early 2008, the number of underwater homes was estimated at 9 million. RealtyTrac says the current total is 12 million, or 28 percent of all mortgages. But that statistic, sobering as it is, offers a poor gauge of Obama’s policies. Borrowers ended up in this situation because they took out high-priced mortgages and then their property values plummeted -- a market occurrence largely outside any president’s control. "It mostly reflects bad policy leading up to the crash," said Schwartz. "Policies that encouraged reckless mortgage underwriting, which inflated prices." Still, there are some signs of progress. Early this year, changes to HARP relaxed eligibility standards and extended the length of the program to the end of 2013. HAMP also was extended through next year. Schwartz said the programs were originally geared to subprime, high-risk mortgages. So as the recession worsened and people with more conventional mortgages lost jobs and income, the programs didn’t accommodate them. The new standards attempt to reach a bigger pool of homeowners, including people deeper underwater and those still in good standing on their loans. The Treasury Department recently announced that the number of active permanent mortgage loan modifications agreed to by banks rose 12,139 to 794,748 during March, the most recent timeframe available. The Obama campaign cited HUD data showing that HAMP has trimmed a median of $535 off monthly payments of mortgages that have been modified as evidence of progress. "I still think it’s meaningful and it’s helpful," Zandi said. "It’s just not as helpful as they had hoped for." It’s also worth noting that there were forces working against Obama amid these efforts. The Republican-controlled House, for one. "The Obama administration has been completely hamstrung by Congress, refusing to spend any money on stimulus," Schwartz said. The economy, for another. "They (the foreclosure programs) haven’t been as effective as hoped and the reason is because a lot of the foreclosures were triggered by the 8 million-plus loss in jobs," said Norm Miller, an economist, financial analyst and professor at the University of San Diego. Our ruling The Crossroads GPS ad said Obama has broken his promise to help millions of people facing foreclosure. "Help" is a vague notion, and there’s certainly no doubt that the president has tried several avenues to stem the tide of home loan defaults. But there’s also no doubt that his efforts have fallen far short of expectations -- and even the benchmarks he set for himself. Two primary programs aimed at helping people keep their homes -- HAMP and HARP -- have reached more households in recent months, but they are unlikely to ever help the 9 million homeowners Obama said he would assist. And it’s reasonable that he could have leaned harder on lenders to produce better results in the aftermath of multi-billion-dollar bank bailouts. Although Obama’s efforts haven’t been the utter failure Crossroads suggests, there are still millions of struggling homeowners who need help in the ongoing foreclosure crisis. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True. Update: This item has been updated to correct that Republicans control the House of Representatives rather than the entire Congress.

pomt-12468	"Bill O’Reilly in critical condition after being attacked by ‘tolerant’ liberals."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/05/blog-posting/fake-news-says-bill-oreilly-beaten-unconscious-lib/	Ousted Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had already taken a drubbing over sexual harassment allegations, but fake news purveyors then started circulating a false story that he’d been beaten unconscious, too. "Bill O’Reilly in critical condition after being attacked by ‘tolerant’ liberals," read a headline on a May 4, 2017, story at DailyUSAUpdate.com. We found the story posted on other websites, as well. The article was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ news feeds. The post — which again, is fake — said O’Reilly was buying bagels in New York when three men and two women began complaining about his treatment of women. O’Reilly was forced off Fox News Channel on April 19 and lost his show, The O’Reilly Factor, after multiple reports of sexual harassment. The New York Times had reported the network paid about $13 million to settle claims. The confrontation turned aggressive when the liberals (as identified in the story) attacked O’Reilly, dragging him into the street and kicking him until "until he was unconscious and bleeding." The attackers ran off, the post said, leaving O’Reilly with four broken ribs and a punctured lung. He possibly suffered "a cardiac event," the story said. Except none of the details about an attack are true. There is no apparent way to contact DailyUSAUpdate.com administrators, who have hidden the site’s registration information. There were no reports from legitimate media sources that this event occurred, in any case. Surely such an attack would have been widely covered. The hoax came about a week after other reports that Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident and Sarah Palin had been run off the road and was in a coma. The fake O’Reilly story originally came from TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." And that’s what we call this fake report — baloney. Actually, we rate it Pants On Fire!	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-05-05T15:51:01	2017-05-04	['None']
pomt-08415	The Seattle Times called Patty Murray "a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.' "	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/20/dino-rossi/earmark-attack-patty-murray-rings-true/	The race for the Senate in Washington pits Republican businessman Dino Rossi against Democratic incumbent Patty Murray. Rossi says he wants to reduce government spending and debt, and he's issued an attack ad against Murray on that point. "Has Washington, D.C., changed Patty Murray? She said she was elected to cut the budget. But now the Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'" The ad also attacked her votes on bailing out the financial system and voting for President Barack Obama's health care law. Murray did vote for those bills. What we wanted to fact-check was whether the charges against Murray on earmarks are accurate. We'll take them in order. • "The Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.'" We often find that campaign ads take newspaper quotes out of context to present a misleading impression. But that's not the case here. The quote comes from a reported profile of Murray that ran on the newspaper's front page on Oct. 3, 2010. The article describes Murray as a hard worker who presents issues in common terms that people can understand and a congenial legislator who is willing to work with Republicans to get things done. But she is not known for authoring major legislation or giving lofty speeches. Instead, her seat on the Appropriations Committee has been the springboard for her accomplishments, according to the story. "Her keenest impact has come from tapping federal coffers to benefit workers and programs. "She has helped direct federal money to build Sound Transit light rail, clean up the Hanford nuclear reservation, repair the Howard Hanson Dam, pay for ferries and construct and repair countless miles of roads. She also has funneled billions of dollars to veterans, who have few better advocates in Congress." The story concludes by noting Murray's penchant for earmarks. "Perhaps Murray's starkest transformation has been her emergence as an unapologetic -- at times even defiant -- dispenser of federal dollars. "During her first year in the Senate, she defended her frequent votes to reduce the Clinton administration's spending requests by saying, 'I wasn't elected to bring home the bacon. I was elected to cut the budget.' "Murray since has become a prolific sponsor of earmarks, grants awarded at the behest of individual lawmakers to favored groups and companies. Her office churns out seemingly ceaseless news releases touting millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars she helped win for projects in Washington state. "The question for Murray now is how her brand of purse-string politics will play out with an electorate squeezed by the worst recession in 80 years." So Rossi's use of the quote in his ad is a fair excerpt of news coverage. Additionally, we checked with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that works to publicize and reduce earmarks, on Murray's record. Its 2010 database of earmarks showed Murray won or helped win 187 earmarks worth $219.5 million. Out of 100 senators ranked for the amount of earmark money they garnered, Murray ranked ninth. • "Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'" Ah, the Bridge to Nowhere. It was a 2005 project that brought infamy to earmarks: The Alaska bridge was intended to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport, at a cost of nearly $400 million. Taxpayers for Common Sense derisively nicknamed the earmark the Bridge to Nowhere, and it became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Faced with an uproar, a congressional committee directed that the $225 million earmarked for the bridge be sent to the Alaska Department of Transportation without stipulating that it be used for the bridge. It didn't get built, but the bridge was still an issue in the 2008 election. (We reported fact-checks about how Barack Obama voted on it as a senator and how Sarah Palin handled it as Alaska governor.) The question for us now is, did Murray defend the bridge earmark? News stories led us to the Congressional Record and a series of debates that took place on the Senate floor on Oct. 20, 2005. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., an opponent of the earmark process, decided to highlight the bridge and other earmarks by proposing a series of amendments that would send the money for those projects to other projects intended to help the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. One of the projects was the Alaska bridge; another was an earmark for a sculpture park for Seattle, Wash. "Let us find our will," Coburn said. "No more low-priority projects in the face of half-trillion-dollar deficits, no more exorbitant bridges to nowhere. Speaking of bridges, that is where this Congress will be, on a bridge to nowhere if we do not gain control of ourselves." Murray responded on the Senate floor to oppose all of Coburn's amendments, offering a no-holds-barred defense. Murray said that senators knew better than "bureaucrats sitting in Washington, D.C." about what projects needed funding in states around the country. "I am out in every community, talking to people, listening to them," Murray said. "It is my job to be their partner in that. I tell them that all the time. You get it going on the ground here, you develop the projects, you get the consensus within your own communities, and I will do what I can to get some small part of help from the federal government. That is how I, like most senators in the Senate, am sent projects. ... "Today, the senator from Oklahoma has targeted another project that I sat down and discussed with local community leaders. I didn't come up with this. This came from the heart of my local community because they are working very hard in an urban core in the city of Seattle to turn a brownfield into a hub of activity. It is a project that is stimulating jobs and investments," Murray said. "If the senator from Oklahoma wants to look for a culprit for the fiscal situation in this country, he should look into the billions and billions of dollars in tax cuts that have been granted to multimillionaires in this country, and he should look at additional tax cuts his party wants to implement in future years if he wants to find incredible savings." Murray didn't mention the Alaska bridge, but she said she opposed his amendment for the Seattle project as well as "the numerous other amendments he has filed with the same type of philosophy, as he calls it, in the Senate." That would logically include the Alaska bridge project, which was being discussed. "I hope the Senate will not go down the road of cherry-picking individual projects that senators have come to us and have championed on behalf of their constituents who do not live here in Washington, D.C.," Murray said. "I hope we do not go down the road deciding we know better than home state senators about the merits of the projects they bring to us." Coburn, we should note, disagreed with Murray's logic that earmarks are a needed corrective for too much bureaucracy. "If we have a problem with the bureaucracy, we have all the power in the world to change that. We have the power right here to change that," Coburn said. "So we can either change the bureaucracy so it reflects the views of the people of this country, or we can go about it the wrong way and have to control it by taking a very small percentage of the budget. We get two bad results from that. We get poor priorities. And, No. 2, we are not doing our job in controlling the bureaucracy." We should note that we called and e-mailed both the Rossi and Murray campaigns about this ad, but didn't hear back from either campaign. Getting back to our ruling, we're checking two points here about earmarks. Rossi's ad said that the Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' " That comes from a reported story and is a fair summary of one of the points in the story, and it's a fair summary of the newspaper's findings on Murray's record on earmarks. The ad also said Murray "even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'" Murray didn't specifically defend that project, although it was very clear that she felt like the bridge and other earmarks being discussed on the Senate floor should be left alone.

pomt-07872	Most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums and it would still be half the national average	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-state-employees-co/	Gov. Scott Walker left no doubt in his first "state of the state" address that he wants benefits concessions from state employees. Walker said state employees need to share the pain felt by private-sector workers so the state can balance its budget without tax increases. In making his case, he tossed out some stark statistics on pensions and health care coverage: "Most state workers only pay about 6 percent of their premium costs for their health care plan," Walker told lawmakers. "Asking public employees to make...a premium payment of 12 percent, which is about half of the national average, would save the state more than $30 million over three months." He added: "Most workers outside of government would love a deal like that – particularly if it means saving jobs." We set out to test the governor’s claim. Walker press secretary Cullen Werwie pointed to a Kaiser Family Foundation study that employees nationally -- public and private -- pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported those findings on Sept. 12, 2010. Werwie also provided state documents showing the premium contribution by union and non-union state workers, as well as the total premium cost to the state. He said they show that most state employees pay between 4 percent and 6 percent. Let’s dig into both sides of the equation. First, is Walker correct that "most" state employees pay only about 6 percent? Unionized state workers in the most common insurance tier pay $78 a month on family premiums that cost the state between $1,500 and $1,800, state figures show. That’s in the 4 percent to 5 percent range by our calculation. Non-union state workers pay a bit more -- $89 a month in most cases. That works out to a 5 percent to 6 percent share. So Walker’s number looks good. And so does the "most state employees" claim: More than 98 percent of state employees fall into those categories, according to figures from the state’s Department of Employee Trust Funds. There is a higher-premium plan in which some state employees pay about 15 percent of the cost, or $412 a month. But it is used by just a tiny fraction of state government workers. Just to cap this off, we asked the state to calculate the employee share across all plans, both single and family coverage, for all employees. They came up with 5.6 percent. Now the national side. First, a bit of background. The national cost trend is clear. Since 2000, average premiums for family coverage have increased 114 percent, the Kaiser study found. Several other studies back up Walker’s claim on the national numbers regarding public and private employees. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage. It’s 21 percent for single coverage. Of course, there is a range, but that’s the collective national figure for civilian workers, public and private. Union workers paid much less than non-represented workers. Now let’s tease out just government workers, to see how Wisconsin compares there. The Kaiser study -- the one relied on by Walker for his overall comparison -- put the employee share paid by state and local government workers nationwide at 25 percent for family coverage. Finally, a study by The Segal Co., a private benefits firm, that looked just at state government workers showed a majority paying between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage. If Wisconsin workers are paying around 6 percent, that puts them in the bottom fifth nationally among state employees, Segal’s data shows. A very small number pay zero toward their premium. There’s a clear trend toward asking state employees to pay more, the Segal study said. Still, private-sector workers are being asked to share even more, said J. Richard Johnson, Segal’s public sector health practice leader. Experts warn against drawing comparisons without looking at employees’ total package of wages and benefits -- and what they may have given up to get them. (We examined another aspect of that in an earlier item on public vs. private sector pay.) So in this item we’re not trying to determine where Wisconsin workers stand in the big picture. But we can come to a firm conclusion on the state employee health premiums, here and nationally. The governor relies on a statistic that mixes public and private workers, but in this case that’s not a problem: Walker’s point is that state workers need to be more in line with their private counterparts. Walker’s numbers for state workers and the national context are right on target. And his math holds up even when the comparison is narrowed to just public employees. We rate his statement True.

pomt-05020	"New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good. And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/16/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jersey-has-reduced-numbe/	A fresh batch of labor statistics is sending a recycled claim from Gov. Chris Christie to the bottom end of the Truth-O-Meter. The Republican governor last week repeated a claim about how there are fewer "state government" employees now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001. Better yet, the state accomplished that reduction "without any layoffs," Christie said. "New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good," Christie said in a July 9 appearance at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. "And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition." PolitiFact New Jersey issued a True ruling in December on Christie’s claim about how state government has fewer employees than when Whitman resigned. But when we looked at recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the governor’s statement is no longer accurate. Christie’s claim about there being no layoffs is wrong too, because his representatives previously cited hundreds of layoffs during his tenure. First, let’s explain what’s changed since our True ruling. At the time of that ruling, the latest numbers were preliminary estimates for November 2011, showing 137,800 "state government" workers. That figure represented 600 fewer employees than the 138,400 state workers in January 2001. But the November figures have since been revised to show 144,300 workers in that month, exceeding the estimate from January 2001. Every month since November also has shown a greater number of employees than when Whitman resigned. When Christie repeated the claim last week, the latest figures were preliminary estimates for May 2012, when there were 146,100 state government employees. That represents a 7,700 increase, or nearly 5.6 percent, over Whitman’s final month. Those statistics are seasonally adjusted and include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit. Brian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, acknowledged how "the Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the data and shifted the estimated count of state employees higher." But Murray also pointed to a reduction in employees since the Whitman era in the subcategory of "other state government," which includes the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as state boards and authorities. "It could be argued that the Governor has more day-to-day control over the workforces in the items included in ‘other state government’ rather than Educational Services and hospitals," Murray said in an e-mail. However, in both claims, Christie has just referred to "state government" in general. Also, when we referred to that overall category for our first fact-check, a Christie spokesman confirmed that was the source of the governor’s information. So, for this fact-check, we’re focusing on the same category. It’s worth noting that since Christie took office in January 2010, the number of "state government" employees has dropped by 5,600, or nearly 3.7 percent. But has the Christie administration reduced the state workforce "without any layoffs"? That’s not what the governor’s representatives told us in December when we were working on our first fact-check. Between the start of Christie’s tenure and November 2011, "743 out of 4,738 full-time positions eliminated were through layoffs," the spokesmen said in an e-mail, referring to the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Those layoffs included 138 positions at the New Jersey Network, the state-owned TV network shut down at the end of June 2011. Our ruling At the Brookings Institution, Christie claimed: "New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good. And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition." But the latest labor statistics show there were 7,700 more "state government" workers in May than when Whitman resigned. Also, the governor’s representatives have cited hundreds of layoffs during Christie’s tenure. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11138	"We got $6 billion for opioid and getting rid of that scourge that’s taking over our country. And the numbers are way down."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-opioid-numbers-way-dow/	In his speech to rally support for Tennessee Republicans, President Donald Trump spoke briefly about progress in the fight against the opioid crisis. He remarked on the new money approved in the latest congressional spending bill. "We got $6 billion for opioid and getting rid of the scourge that’s taking over our country," Trump said May 29. "And the numbers are way down." "We’re getting the word out — bad. Bad stuff. You go to the hospital, you have a broken arm, you come out, you’re a drug addict with this crap. It’s way down. We’re doing a good job with it. But we got $6 billion to help us with opioid." We wondered what opioid numbers he was talking about, and whether they are really "way down." The White House cited an article about the decline in the number of opioid prescriptions. But the reduction in prescriptions might mean less than it seems, and opioid deaths remain high. Reporting on a study from a health data firm, an April 19 Washington Post article said the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies (measured in morphine equivalents) dropped 10 percent in 2017. The study by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science suggested that public outrage over over-prescribing had led to restraint by physicians. But a drop in opioid prescriptions isn’t a guaranteed sign of progress. A review of studies of prescription monitoring programs published in the Indiana Health Law Review found that about one-third of the time, these efforts take place in states where overdoses rose after the programs expanded. In West Virginia, for example, even with a "significant drop in opioids dispensed" between 2008 and 2015, the number of heroin poisonings doubled. "Fewer prescriptions have not translated into lower overdoses," said the article's author Northeastern University opioid researcher Leo Beletsky. "Quite the opposite." As for Trump’s statement that the numbers are "way down," the government’s most recent statistics through October 2017 show a rise in overdose deaths from the year before. For all opioids, including illegal and prescription drugs, deaths were up 15 percent. For the synthetic opioids alone, such as fentanyl, deaths were up 57 percent. Deaths from prescription painkillers such as oxycodone (the natural/semi-synthetic category) rose by a small fraction. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The only possible bright spot in the numbers is that while the death toll continues to rise, it rose at a slower rate than the year before. The timing of the funding increase Trump mentioned also undercuts his claim. The appropriations bill that provided $6 billion to federal, state and local agencies to turn back the opioid crisis became law at the end of March. It is dubious to argue that this money flowed quickly enough to have a measurable impact on the opioid problem, especially since the total amount would come over two years. Our ruling Trump said that in the opioid crisis, "the numbers are way down." One study shows a 10 percent decline in the the number of opioid prescriptions at retail pharmacies. However, the latest government figures show a 15 percent increase in opioid overdose deaths between 2016 and 2017. And research casts doubt on the tie between reduced prescribing and a drop in the number of overdoses. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07901	"Despite claims that you can 'keep the health care plan you like,' the Obama Administration has predicted that as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/02/blake-farenthold/rep-blake-farenthold-says-health-care-law-will-for/	On Jan. 23, 2011, Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas -- a freshman lawmaker who ousted a Democratic incumbent in 2010 -- wrote an op-ed in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times explaining his decision to vote to repeal the Democratic-backed health care law. One of the reasons he cited was this: "Despite claims that you can 'keep the health care plan you like,' the Obama administration has predicted that as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan," Farenthold wrote. Farenthold was referring to President Barack Obama’s frequent claim that under the proposed law, "if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan." We fact-checked that claim in 2009 -- before the final version of the bill was passed -- and ruled it Half True. Later that year, Obama began using a less sweeping version of the claim -- that if you "already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have." We rated that statement True. When we saw Farenthold’s statement, we wondered whether the Obama administration really acknowledged that "as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan." We tried contacting Farenthold’s office, but his staff did not respond to our inquiries. However, Michael Tanner -- a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, which has been critical of the health care bill -- suggested that Farenthold may have been referring to a fact sheet the administration assembled and posted at the informational website HealthCare.gov. This fact sheet explained how health plans can be "grandfathered" under the law, which was passed in early 2010 and which becomes fully operational in 2014. The law allows plans that existed on March 23, 2010, to be "grandfathered," which means that they do not have to comply with new provisions that took effect last fall, such as requirements to provide preventive services without cost-sharing and direct access to ob-gyn care without a referral. To keep their grandfathered status, these plans must not significantly cut benefits or increase out-of-pocket spending for consumers. (Minor policy changes and increases to keep pace with medical inflation do not threaten a plan’s grandfather status.) While acknowledging significant uncertainty about how employers will react to their options, the fact sheet offers estimates of how many plans the administration expects to opt for grandfathered status, both for the 133 million Americans whose plans are provided by large employers and the 43 million with plans provided by small employers (fewer than 100 employees). We aren’t looking at the nation’s 17 million individually purchased policies, because Farenthold’s claim specifically referenced employer-provided health care. According to administration projections, between 71 and 87 percent of large-employer plans will be grandfathered in 2011, and between 36 and 66 percent will remain grandfathered by 2013. For small plans, the administration expects between 58 and 80 percent to be grandfathered in 2011 and between 20 and 51 percent to be grandfathered in 2013. So, in his op-ed, Farenthold used the highest estimate for the percentage of plans that will have lost their grandfather status by 2013 and therefore changed to comply with the health care law, though he does hedge somewhat by saying "as many as." Still, we don’t think these numbers fully support Farenthold’s claim. For one thing, if your plan loses its grandfather status, it won’t necessarily mean that you’ll "lose (your) current health plan," as Farenthold writes. Health care specialists said they expect that in many cases an employer (or the insurance carrier the employer uses) will change the plan in ways that are significant enough to end grandfather status but which will not terminate the plan or result in a radical change in its coverage. While some employers may decide to end health care coverage entirely (and thus pay a penalty under the bill), many will continue to offer a similar plan but perhaps with more extensive requirements mandated under the law, possibly along with higher premiums. Indeed, one way that your employer’s plan could lose its grandfather status would be if the employer decides to make it more generous to patients. In this case, "losing" the plan would be a net gain for the patient, not a net loss. This is certainly how supporters view the law -- they see the shift from a grandfathered plan to one with new patient benefits and protections as a good thing, not a bad thing. Opponents counter that un-grandfathered plans will force patients to pay more even if they don’t want the new benefits. There’s also a broader issue. Saying that the law could force 70 percent of Americans to lose their current health plans ignores that many people lose their current health coverage every year for reasons having nothing to do with the new law. Both Obama and Farenthold failed to acknowledge this point, but more on that in a moment. Answering the question of how many Americans "lose their current health plan" for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law is surprisingly tricky. Health care experts we contacted said they’d never seen a comprehensive statistical look at that question, so we pieced it together as best we could. We found one study by the U.S. Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, which looked at a statistically representative sample of Americans over a period of 48 months. Unfortunately, the data is old -- it’s from the mid-to-late 1990s -- but one finding was that 26.3 percent of fully employed Americans lacked health coverage for at least one month in the 48-month period studied. That statistic only addresses people who lost coverage entirely, at least temporarily. It doesn’t include people who switched jobs (and thus health plans) without losing coverage. That’s common in an economy as dynamic as the United States’. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month. The Census Bureau study also didn’t count those who stayed in the same job but whose company changed insurance carriers, or whose insurance carriers changed the terms of a client company’s plan. Data on this phenomenon is scarce. We found some data in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population "switched" health insurance coverage. However, this probably underestimates the rate of switching for the people Farenthold was referring to -- those who have employer-based coverage. The HHS study included people of all ages, including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch. In addition, the study would capture a switch between, say, an Aetna plan and a United Health Care plan but would not necessarily catch a shift between one type of Aetna plan and another type of Aetna plan. We found another relevant study by Mercer, a private consulting firm. Mercer's National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, an annual study of nearly 3,000 employers released every November, includes a question on whether employers will ask employees to pay a greater share of health care costs in the upcoming plan year -- for instance, by changing from an HMO to a PPO or by raising deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing. Beth Umland, the head of research for Mercer's health & benefits consulting practice, said that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly 25 percent of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, she said, that percentage rose to one-third of companies each year. So if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely, who change jobs, who work for companies that change insurance carriers or plan terms significantly, or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out, a significant number of Americans were already losing "their current health plan" before the new law was passed. The data is too scattershot to know how large or small the percentage is, but it seems reasonable to assume that the number is not trivial. In fact, the percentage could well be higher than the administration's lower- to mid-level projections for de-grandfathering. Why does this matter? Because knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans -- even if they like them -- would provide a different impression of the statistics Farenthold cites. And this confusion owes a lot to Obama’s original promise. When Obama said, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan," he never acknowledged that many working Americans were already unable to keep the same coverage every year. That set up an unrealistic perception of what the health care bill would do -- and it gave his opponents a perfect opportunity to make the bill’s impact seem problematic. Later he modified the claim to say that if you "already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor that you have." But by the time Obama changed how he made this point, it was already too late -- his opponents had seized on the initial comment and cited it repeatedly. That said, this item is about Farenthold’s claim, not Obama’s, and we find problems with it. If Farenthold is using the administration’s estimates for lost grandfather status, he’s taken the most extreme point on a wide range of possible outcomes. More important, it’s not clear that an employee whose plan loses grandfather status would be losing his current health plan in anything more than a technical sense; many workers could actually end up with a more generous plan. Finally, Farenthold ignores that many employees lose their current health plans for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the health care law. To suggest that the law is the reason for 70 percent of employees being forced off their plans, as Farenthold does, ignores all other reasons for such changes. And he is incorrect when he says the Obama administration predicted that. We rate the statement False. UPDATE: Shortly after our story was published, Farenthold’s office replied to our inquiry. They confirmed that the Congressman was referring to the administration’s projected rates of grandfathering, specifically citing Table 3 in the official regulation. We stand by our ruling.

pomt-04588	"Their New York casino deal was called ‘rigged’ and ‘corrupt.’"	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/21/its-still-bad-idea/was-grange-investor-part-new-york-casino-deal-call/	The people opposed to a private casino in Wood Village came out swinging in their first campaign ad. They renamed the Grange casino complex the "Grunge" and branded Canadian backers Clairvest as foreigners. Not only that, but the TV spot claims that casino backers would bring "a history of scandal and crime" to Oregon. As evidence, they point to a failed New York venture in 2010. "Their New York casino deal was called rigged and corrupt," says the television announcer, while on screen the words "rigged" and "corrupt" appear with the masthead for the "New York Post" daily newspaper tabloid. The campaign ad prompted one question for PolitiFact Oregon: What happened in New York? We need to introduce the players for those not following the campaign. The Grange is a $300 million entertainment and casino complex to be built at the old greyhound racing track in Wood Village if state voters approve Measures 82 and 83. Running the opposition campaign is the It’s Still a Bad Idea Committee, funded largely with money from tribes that could lose a lot of money should a private casino compete with their tribal casinos. The owner and operator of The Grange would be PDX Entertainment Company, but the big money backers are Clairvest Groupand the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation. Both are based in Canada and operate multiple casinos. Clairvest previously had served as the primary financial backer on a race track casino project in Queens, New York, as part of the Aqueduct Entertainment Group consortium. AEG was awarded the contract in 2010 despite having the lowest up-front money bid. The offer was rescinded under media scrutiny. The deal fell apart. Michael Goodwin, a political columnist for The New York Post, wrote about the unraveling in a March 10, 2010, column. It is from this column that the words "corrupt" and "rigged" were taken for the ad, and as we usually do, we hunted down the source. Here are the relevant parts: "The lucrative contract for video slots at the raceway looked and smelled corrupt from the start, and yesterday’s strange developments do nothing to dispel the suspicions," Goodwin wrote. "In fact, the failure by the winning team to finish its application on time and the withdrawals of the Rev. Floyd Flake and rap star Jay-Z from the group adds to the suspicions the process was rigged." The state inspector general’s office weighed in on the whole tangled, tarnished process with a hefty investigative report in October 2010. The report described the bidding process as chaotic, lacking clear rules. The report criticized lawmakers and state officials, especially Senate Democratic leader John Sampson, who shared competitive information with AEG and apparently pressured its lobbyists for campaign contributions, which it made. No criminal charges were filed. Anna Richter Taylor, a spokeswoman for the casino project in Wood Village, said it’s not fair for opponents to taint the Oregon project "by linking it with headlines from a project that Clairvest, one of our many investors, was involved in back east." She added, "The investigation revealed New York politicians trying to shake down participants in their legislative process. Thankfully Oregon is not New York." But Cynara Lilly, a spokeswoman for casino opponents, said voters shouldn’t minimize the role of Clairvest now or in the past. "That they now have partners doesn't negate the importance of their record." We have to agree with Lilly. Clairvest is a major player in the Wood Village casino, with co-CEO Jeff Parr now serving as a director of PDX Entertainment Company. While the words "corrupt" and "rigged" are the opinions of a columnist and not legal findings, the New York inspector general’s report made it clear that Clairvest-backed AEG engaged in dubious activities in an attempt to win the contract. The columnist wrote that "the lucrative contract … looked and smelled corrupt" and that there were "suspicions the process was rigged." Driving the problems were lawmakers -- but that doesn’t exonerate Clairvest, which financed AEG, from paying to play. Does that mean Clairvest will bring problems to Oregon? We can’t make that link, and neither can casino opponents. But opponents can say with accuracy that "their New York casino deal was called rigged and corrupt." The only additional information we’d offer is the abhorrent behavior of the others involved. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-15297	The murder rate in Atlanta is on the rise this year.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/22/atlanta-neighborhood-association/increase-murders-atlanta/	Crime is always the sort of news that attracts headlines. Now it’s also generating posts in online forums, where one neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s murder rate was spiking and had even reached a 50 percent increase from a year ago. PolitiFact Georgia couldn’t resist when an alert reader asked us to check it out. After all, the number of murders in several big cities is on the rise nationwide, after years of decline. That includes cities with populations close to those of Atlanta’s roughly 450,000 residents. For instance, through the first half of the year, Milwaukee (population 600,000) has seen a 105 percent surge in its homicide rate and the rate is up by 33 percent or more in Baltimore (about 620,000 residents) and St. Louis (about 320,000) And in Atlanta? According to the Atlanta Police Department website, the rate was up 16 percent in the first half of the year. Through July 11, the most recent date available, there have been 52 murders in the city. During the same time last year, there were 42 murders – a 24 percent increase. So while the increase is not as dramatic as suggested in the neighborhood forum or compared to similar cities, the rate is up. But the rates fluctuate wildly per week, which is how the police department reports all crimes. So it did appear that Atlanta had a serious surge of murders for the week ending May 23, or the 21st week of the year. Then, the homicide rate was up 54 percent at the time (40 murders at that point this year versus 26 last year). Then again, the city went without any murders for three weeks this year, between March 15 and April 2. And that spike in Week 21 was followed by no homicides in Week 22, the data show. In fact, the city had no murders at again for another multi-day run, between June 10 and June 20. "These numbers are very fluid," said Atlanta Police Capt. Michael O’Connor, who serves as the department Homicide Commander. So while brass are concerned that the rate is up and in theory on pace to be above 100 annual murders for the first time in years, "it’s very difficult to trend to know where you are going to finish the year." Criminologists support that analysis – and lack of analysis that can be done. To some extent, after years of declining murder rates, an increase can be little more than a statistical blip to get closer to a median. But without minimizing the loss of 52 lives, there isn’t much statistical analysis that can be done with such a relatively low number, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor of criminology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. For instance, only two women have been reported murder victims in Atlanta this year. While that may suggest the city has a better handle on domestic violence murders, a single such death could skew the data to suggest the exact opposite. "You don’t want to jump to a lot of conclusions," Kenney said. "If homicides are up, you are not necessarily at greater risk because we don’t randomly select our murder victims." That is, there are some people more at risk to be victims than others. Broadly speaking, that tends to be young men, especially men of color. Atlanta Police have just begun sifting through its first-half data to compare victims, perpetrators and scenarios to see just where the greatest risks lie, O’Connor said. Police do that constantly, targeting for instance a specific neighborhood or specific gang that may be making trouble. Putting a larger number of victims and suspect pool up for comparison should help analysts see if anything stands out that will help insert police sooner into the equation – and hopefully prevent some deaths, O’Connor said. It also will provide Atlanta Police Chief George Turner with some information to share with his counterparts at the Major Cities Chiefs Association on Gun Violence Summit, being held in Washington, D.C. next month. Such events are often heavy on anecdotes, Kenney said, but can provide the start of understanding crime trends. "When you can see a general increase virtually everywhere, that suggests crime is up but doesn’t tell you anything about why or what to do about it," he said. "Still, the police have to anticipate what they can so they can refocus their energies, and they seem to be doing that." Our ruling A neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s homicide rate is up for the year and has even reached a 50 percent increase. At one point, the murder rate did spike that high, though with weekly fluctuations, the year-to-date rate is up about a quarter from this time last year. That puts Atlanta in line with other cities seeing an increase in their murder rates. There is little conclusion on what might be driving the rate, or even if different cities share the same causes. But a 24 percent increase is cause for notice. We rate the claim True.	None	Atlanta neighborhood association	None	None	None	2015-07-22T00:00:00	2015-07-09	['Atlanta']

pomt-01295	"The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/30/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-us-added-jobs-twice-wisconsins-rat/	Introducing President Barack Obama in Milwaukee, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke touted economic growth nationwide when compared to that in Wisconsin under Gov. Scott Walker: "The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker." Asked to back up the claim, the Burke campaign pointed us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly employment surveys. That data is considered the most reliable measure of jobs, though it is less timely than that from separate monthly employment surveys. The campaign told us the statistics show U.S. growth at "nearly twice the rate" of Wisconsin. Burke, though, was more definitive at the rally, saying "two times the rate." Burke’s phrasing of the talking point has changed. In early 2014, she said the latest data from the quarterly surveys showed the national rate was "nearly double" Wisconsin’s rate. At that point, she quoted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that came to the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported 1 percent growth compared with 1.9% nationally from June 2012 to June 2013. At the time, that was the latest available data, due to the lag time in the release of the detailed quarterly numbers, We crunched the same numbers the Burke campaign cited, examining private-sector employment, which has been the central focus of both candidates’ plans. Figures show that from the start of Walker’s term to the end of his third year, the national gain was 6.6 percent compared to Wisconsin’s 4.1 percent. That meant the U.S. growth was 1.6 times that of Wisconsin’s. In the most recent year (March 2013 to March 2014), Wisconsin’s growth rate was 1.3 percent, compared with the U.S. rate of 2.1 percent. Same result: the national rate was 1.6 times better. As we examined year-over-year growth at different quarterly vantage points, we repeatedly saw growth 1.6 to 1.7 times larger for the national figures. (We also looked at results from another government jobs survey, the monthly reports. They are more up to date -- through September 2014 -- but less reliable. They, too, show, national growth at 1.6 times the state’s, from the start of Walker’s term.) There were some smaller and larger differences at various points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and into early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times larger than Wisconsin’s. The high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin. Our rating Burke claimed that "the nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker." Wisconsin lags behind the nation significantly, but for the most part quite not as badly as Burke says, based on the last year and on results from most of Walker’s term. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09930	In Texas, "the No. 1 name for new male babies — many of whom will vote one day — is Jose."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/15/mike-murphy/jose-no-1-baby-name-texas-social-security-administ/	It's not unusual for a minority party to engage in soul-searching, finger-pointing and general agonizing over why it lost power. The Republican Party is in the midst of such a process right now. Mike Murphy, a GOP political strategist, has argued that the Republicans need to address why they lost so badly among two demographics: the young and Latinos. Obama crushed McCain among Hispanic voters by a 35-point margin, Murphy wrote in a column in Time magazine. "By 2030, the Latino share of the vote is likely to double," Murphy wrote. "In Texas, the crucial buckle for the GOP's Electoral College belt, the No. 1 name for new male babies — many of whom will vote one day — is Jose." Murphy added, "Latinos need to see a quick end to the Republican congressional jihad on immigration," Murphy concluded, adding that they should support immigration reform with a path to citizenship. "Republicans should differentiate themselves from the left by heating up the lukewarm American melting pot with a firm insistence on learning English and a rejection of the silly excesses of identity politics." We were intrigued by his claim — which he repeated on Meet the Press on June 14 — that Jose was the No. 1 baby name for boys in Texas. We wondered if that could be proved with hard numbers or if it was mostly conjecture. It turns out that the Social Security Administration compiles baby names for infants born in the United States, based on applications for Social Security numbers. The administration includes a few caveats about the data — names are counted only when the year of birth, state, and gender are known, for example. But it's hard to think of a better source for name popularity. In 2008, the No. 1 name for a baby boy born in Texas was indeed Jose. (It's held the top spot since 1996.) Nationally, it was 41st. In Texas, Jose was followed by Jacob, Daniel, Christopher, Joshua, David, Angel, Ethan, Juan and Michael. In case you're wondering, that same year in Texas, the most popular name for a girl was Emily, followed by Isabella, Abigail, Emma, Madison, Sophia, Mia, Natalie, Ashley and Ava. We're not rating Murphy's political advice one way or the other. But the numbers confirm he had his facts right about Jose. We rate Murphy's statement True.

pomt-09691	Guantanamo Bay detainees will get the H1N1 vaccine.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/11/sean-hannity/hannity-says-h1n1-vaccines-will-be-given-gitmo-det/	The Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 vaccine has given conservatives plenty to complain about. First, the government got behind schedule with its massive vaccination plans. And then came reports that the Pentagon was planning to vaccinate the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sean Hannity complained of the hypocrisy on his Nov. 2, 2009, show. "So you were hoping to get the H1N1 vaccine," he said. "Well, if the vaccine hasn't reached a doctor's office near you, that might be because it's on its way to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That's right. A military spokesman announced Gitmo detainees will receive the vaccine sometime this month. That's well before it's expected to be available to the public at large. Seems the Obama administration has its priorities straight. Doesn't it?" Given the confusion over the program -- and a White House denial about the Guantanamo vaccinations -- we decided to look into Hannity's claim. It all started on Oct. 30, when CNN ran a story quoting Maj. Diana R. Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, who said the Pentagon would be offering the H1N1 vaccines to people held at the camp. "Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination," she told CNN. "JTF Guantanamo conducts safe, humane, legal and transparent care and custody of detainees. As such, we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health." The Associated Press ran a similar story on Nov. 2. The news sparked an onslaught of criticism from lawmakers of both parties. They said pregnant women, children and the elderly should have priority access to the limited supply of vaccines over the Guantanamo detainees. On Tuesday, Nov. 3, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a press briefing that, "There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there's no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo." But the same day, a Pentagon spokesman said that a shipment of vaccines would eventually be sent to the prison, although he said the detainees would get the vaccine only after it was given to active-duty troops, contractors and others working for the government. The most recent news reports say that about 300 vaccines arrived at the installation on Monday, Nov. 9. According to the Associated Press, it's unlikely those vaccines will be given to prisoners. Instead, they are meant for military personnel, contractors and U.S. workers at the base. "We have an obligation to provide for the health of [the detainees], but we're faced with a situation where we have a limited amount of vaccines at this time," Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told PolitiFact. Assuming there are enough supplies, the detainees would eventually be given the vaccine, he said. The White House told us that, to date, no prisoners have been vaccinated, but that priority for the vaccine would follow this order: U.S. forces, deployed health care workers (civilian and contractor), civilians, detainees and non-US Defense Department contractors. So, Hannity is correct. Current plans say that the vaccines will eventually be offered to the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We rate his claim True.

pomt-10623	"(My dad) used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/15/mitt-romney/dad-was-a-dinosaur-hunter/	Republican Mitt Romney, speaking from the campaign trail in Michigan, recalled his father's legacy as the owner of American Motors Corp. and the car that changed the industry. "But, you see, when I was growing up, the fact that we won the mileage championship year after year with the Rambler was a source of great pride for my dad," Romney said during an interview on the CBS Early Show . "He used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs." Romney used a similar line in February 2007 when he launched his presidential campaign in Michigan, where he was born. It's the kind of claim that could, in our current energy climate, be dismissed as rewritten history. Campaigning against gas-guzzling cars in the '50s? Really? And yet, this is not a case of inflated exuberance. George Romney took the helm at American Motors in 1954 and helped rescue the company from near financial ruin. He succeeded in large part on the sales of the Rambler, the first American compact car. In doing so, he had to sell the concept and value of a compact car. In 1958, he traveled 700,000 miles in his crusade against what he called "gas-guzzling dinosaurs," a reference to the large cars produced by Detroit's Big Three automakers. "Who wants to have a gas-guzzling dinosaur in his garage?" he told Time magazine in 1959, for a cover article that labeled George Romney "The Dinosaur Hunter." He is credited with coining the term, even though other automakers cast doubts on just how economical the Rambler really was. Still, the nickname, and the George Romney legend, took hold. It appeared in prominent obituaries after his death July 26, 1995. His youngest son, Mitt, gets it right.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2008-01-15T00:00:00	2008-01-14	['None']
pomt-02275	Says the Medicaid fraud rate in Virginia was "fact-checked" and found to be "0.47 percent."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/08/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-medicaid-fraud-rate-virginia-047-pe/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe says there’s not much fraud in Virginia’s Medicaid program. He offered a statistic to prove his point during a recent interview with WRVA radio host Jimmy Barrett. McAuliffe: "Well if you read the Richmond Times-Dispatch, I think it was yesterday, they did the political fact-check, and I give them credit for that. They answered the question. Do you know what the fraud rate is, Jimmy, in Virginia? Do you have any idea?" Barrett: "No what’s the fraud rate?" McAuliffe: "Well, you had one delegate going around saying it was 30 percent. It was fact-checked yesterday. Point-four-seven percent, less than half a percent. That’s the facts." Our ears perked for two reasons: 1) We had never written a fact-check that said the fraud rate of Virginia’s Medicaid program is 0.47 percent, and; 2) We thought it was high time to do that fact-check now. Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman, said the governor erred when he cited a March 23 Truth-O-Meter as the source for the 0.47 percent figure. That article examined a claim by Del. Jimmie Massie, R-Henrico, that 30 percent of the state’s Medicaid program was "lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies." We rated the claim Mostly False, saying that no study has ever quantified the amount of fraud, waste and inefficiency in Virginia’s system. Coy said the governor made a simple mistake, conflating our story with a fraud figure his staff had just provided to him. So that brings us to the next matter: Is the Medicare fraud rate 0.47 percent in Virginia? It’s an important question because the General Assembly is divided over expanding eligibility for the program to an additional 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. McAuliffe and the Democratic-controlled state Senate support the growth, noting that the federal government will pick up the entire tab for the next three years and 90 percent of the cost down the road. But the Republican-led House has twice rejected the expansion, maintaining, among other things, that Medicaid is rife with waste and should not be expanded before the abuse is curbed. The governor sought to refute the GOP argument by offering the 0.47 percent figure. But contrary to his statement, the statistic is not a measurement of Medicaid fraud. That figure is part of a "payment error rate measurement" compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s a computation of the percentage of Medicaid bills that were paid for services Virginians were ineligible to receive. Some of the errors result from fraud and some come from simple clerical mistakes. Each state’s error rate is examined every three years. "It is important to note the error rate is not a ‘fraud rate’ but simply a measurement of payments that did not meet statutory, regulatory or administrative requirements," the CMS says on its website. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, sounded the same warning, "It’s not a very accurate indicator of fraud," he told us. "It’s not really set up to measure fraud." We should note Virginia, under this measurement, seems to perform well, Nationally, 3.3 percent of Medicaid payments go to services for ineligible people. But CMS discourages such comparisons, saying that the sample of bills reviewed from each state is small. There have been studies in recent years estimating as much as 30 percent of all healthcare spending across the nation is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies. But the authors of those reports, as we pointed out in our story on Del. Massie’s claim, stress that their estimates don’t carry over to individual states, let alone the Medicaid program in any one state. Pinpointing Medicaid fraud rates is all but impossible. "Some (fraud) is found out eventually, but a lot of it, most of it, is never detected," explained Kip Piper, a former senior advisor to the Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Department of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees Virginia’s Medicaid system, does not try to calculate a fraud percentage. "There is no officially designated term or standardized metric to calculate a ‘fraud rate,’" Craig Markva, a DMAS spokesman, wrote in an email. Our ruling McAuliffe said the state has a fraud rate of 0.47 percent and that PolitiFact Virginia had verified that figure. A spokesman for the governor said McAuliffe made an innocent mistake in saying we found the statistic to be correct. In fact, we had never looked at the figure until now, and a number of experts told us that the governor erred in interpreting it as a fraud rate. The 0.47 is a computation of the percentage of Medicaid bills that were paid in 2012 for services that Virginians were ineligible to receive. Some of those errors resulted from deceit and some were simply caused by clerical errors. Neither the state nor the federal government offer a standard measurement of Medicaid fraud because much of the abuse is undetected. So the governor comes up empty. We rate his statement False.

pomt-14976	From 2014 to 2015, Austin’s "murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/oct/16/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-austins-murder-rate-has-spiked-8/	Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, suggesting domestic crime is rising thanks to "liberal compassion" shown to convicts by President Barack Obama and others, declared that murder rates in certain cities — including Austin— are surging. Bob Cole of Austin's KOKE FM radio brought his comments to our attention. O’Reilly said on the Oct. 7, 2015, episode of "The O’Reilly Factor": "The murder rate from 2014 to 15 is very instructive. "In Washington, D.C. it's up 46 percent. "In Milwaukee, up 68 percent. "In St. Louis, near Ferguson, up 51 percent. In Baltimore, up 54 percent. In Denver, up 75 percent." And, O’Reilly said, "in Austin, Texas, the murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent." "Those are facts," he added. "But President Obama and the left have not acknowledged them." Nevermind O'Reilly's dart at Obama. We at PolitiFact Texas were curious about his singling out the murder rate in our headquarters city. Has Austin’s murder rate surged 83 percent? Counting killings According to an online count of Austin homicides compiled by the Austin American-Statesman, based on deaths classified as murders by the Austin Police Department, 23 people have been killed in the city since the start of 2015, compared with 37 people in all of 2014. We asked O’Reilly how he reached his Austin conclusion. Fox pointed us to a City of Austin website presenting monthly crime reports from Art Acevedo, Austin’s police chief. O’Reilly relied on Acevedo’s August 2015 report stating 22 individuals had been murdered locally from January through August 2015, compared with 12 in the comparable stretch of 2014. That’s an 83 percent increase. But we realized that calculating these year-to-year percentage changes based on monthly reports can be misleading, given the small sample size. The day after O’Reilly spoke, the Austin Police Department posted the chief’s September 2015 report tallying 23 murders through that month of the year, up from 16 in the same part of 2014, or a 44 percent increase — roughly half the percentage relayed by O’Reilly. Notably, too, if O’Reilly had spoken out about Austin’s murder rate shortly after May 2015, he could have drawn on the chief’s reports to say it had ballooned 129 percent from the year before. Cherry picking? From the chief’s reports, we tried to get a fuller sense of changes by comparing full years of data. According to the chief’s December 2014 report, the 32 Austin murders that year exceeded the 25 murders in the city in 2013 by 28 percent. Annual APD crime reports by the department indicate there were 26 murders in the city in 2013; 33 in 2012; 27 in 2011; 38 in 2010; 22 in 2009; and 23 in 2008. We took a similar longer view of the latest count available to O’Reilly by comparing Austin murders reported by Austin’s chief for the 12 months from September 2014 through August 2015 (42) to murders reported by the chief for the previous comparable period (20), which indicated--gadzooks! -- a 100 percent-plus increase. A different longer view is possible via crime statistics collected and analyzed by the FBI, which also calculates murder rates. Austin’s estimated 2014 murder rate of 3.7 per 100,000 residents was up 22 percent from the 2013 rate of 3 murders per 100,000 residents, Austin police said in an April 2015 preliminary report based on how the FBI defines crimes. If Austin ends 2015 with 23 murders--the number reported by the chief through September 2015--the 2015 murder rate will be 2.5 murders per 100,000 residents, we estimate. Of course, that calculation unrealistically assumes Austin won’t have another murder before 2016. Still, Austin could end up with a lower murder rate in 2015 than 2014.. Austin Police Department, are local murders on a fast rise? We found another flaw with O'Reilly's methodology. Austin police Lt. Justin Newsom said caveats should be attached to the murder counts in the chief’s August 2015 report because it will be revised later. The 2014 tally has already been whittled down to remove deaths no longer classified as murders, and the 2015 count is almost certainly due to shrink. Newsom said the report’s count of 12 murders from January through August 2014 represents "real murders" and does not include killings not found to be murders by a grand jury or the district attorney. Conversely, Newsom said, the report’s count of 22 murders for the first eight months of 2015 folds in killings likely to be reclassified as homicides of a different variety, including, he said, six officer-involved shootings that could be deemed matters of self-defense or at the least not murders once finally reviewed by a grand jury and the district attorney. From the Statesman’s list of killings, we confirmed the six described police-involved shooting deaths, none of which had led to criminal charges at the time O’Reilly spoke. Generally, Newsom said by email, Austin homicide detectives have worked to resolve 18 murders that occurred in 2015 with all but two investigations culminating in suspects being identified, he said. If indeed 18 murders occurred from January 2015 through August 2015, that total would have been 50 percent greater than the murders tallied for the comparable part of 2014. Newsom sent us a chart showing the department’s count of murders each year from 2011 into 2015. On the chart, it looks as if there had been more murders in 2015 than through September in either of the previous two years yet fewer murders than during the comparable parts of 2011 or 2012. SOURCE: Austin Police Department, October 2015 (received by email from Lt. Justin Newsom, Homicide Division, APD, Oct. 9, 2015) Our ruling O’Reilly said that from 2014 to 2015, Austin’s "murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent." There’s an element of truth here; the Austin police chief’s August 2015 report had figures indicating an 83 percent uptick in murders through that month compared to the same chunk of 2014. But the year-to-year comparison places a raw count of violent deaths in 2015 against killings confirmed as murders for the same part of 2014--generating an incomplete incorrect percentage. In contrast, if O’Reilly had pulled back the camera, so to speak, he could have determined that Austin appears on pace to have a lower murder rate in 2015 than in 2014. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-05738	"[R]emember, the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/03/rick-santorum/santorum-attack-obama-mark/	If President Barack Obama has his way, it won’t pay for some to give anymore. Well, that’s the message Republican presidential contender Rick Santorum told an audience of about 3,000 people at a recent campaign stop in Georgia. Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, accused the president of attacking religious freedom in a political speech at the First Redeemer Church in Forsyth County. For the record, the church’s pastor has not endorsed a candidate in the race and said he’s invited every candidate, including Obama, to speak at his church. About 45 minutes into his remarks, Santorum made this statement: "Now we have an administration that’s trying to wipe the decks. Yes, remember, the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers to cripple further these … churches and nonprofits." Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Jim Galloway reported the remarks in his Political Insider blog. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about this line about Obama’s proposal to eliminate charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers. Obama has consistently proposed changes in charitable deductions that some religious organizations and nonprofit groups say would reduce giving by the rich. The White House counters that his ideas would result in "modest" changes, while others say the wealthy will still give. The president has proposed in his budget for fiscal year 2013 a reduction -- but not eliminating deductions for individuals making more than $200,000 a year or families reporting income greater than $250,000. The fiscal year will begins Oct. 1 and end Sept. 30, 2013. The proposal is similar to other plans Obama has put forward since taking office in 2009, experts on the matter told PolitiFact Georgia. The president has talked about reducing the deduction for the wealthiest income earners from 35 percent to 28 percent. None could recall an outright proposal to completely eliminate the deductions for higher-income Americans. "It’s limiting, not eliminating," Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said of the Obama plan. Nick Kasprak, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, said he was not aware of any effort by the Obama White House to eliminate charitable deductions for the highest income earners. He wondered whether Santorum was referring to the Pease Limitation, which reduces most itemized deductions by a complicated formula (we’re talking about the government here) that involves an individual’s adjusted gross income. But the Pease Limitation would not completely eliminate deductions for the wealthy. Williams suggested Santorum may have slipped up in this part of his speech to the Forsyth County audience. "It could be a loose statement," Williams said, being charitable. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional committee, said in a report last year that charitable deductions cost the federal government $30 billion to $40 billion a year. PolitiFact Georgia filled out a form on Santorum’s campaign website with questions about this statement, but it didn’t get a reply. We also called the Santorum campaign, which cheerfully asked us to send an email to a campaign spokesman. We emailed the spokesman twice but didn’t get a reply. Santorum’s statement seems off base from anything we’ve seen or read. The Obama administration has talked repeatedly about reducing charitable deductions, not eliminating them. We rate Santorum’s claim as False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-03T06:00:00	2012-02-19	['None']
pomt-01508	Says Gwen Graham "was a Washington lobbyist."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/23/steve-southerland/steve-southerland-says-gwen-graham-was-washington-/	Republican congressman Steve Southerland is throwing attack after attack against his Democratic challenger, Gwen Graham, including the dreaded L-word: "lobbyist." In a Sept. 10, 2014, campaign commercial, Southerland, who represents a northern Florida district, accused the daughter of former Florida Gov. Bob Graham of a host of left-wing positions. "Graham was a Washington lobbyist and liberal political consultant who has taken thousands of dollars from Nancy Pelosi and her special interest allies," the commercial said. It also said she is "hiding the truth" that she supported the Affordable Care Act and was "handpicked" by Pelosi -- the House Democratic leader -- to run for the congressional seat. Politicians often turn to lobbying when their public careers have ended, but it’s less common for a lobbyist to run for office. Rep. David Jolly, who won a special election in March to succeed the late C.W. Bill Young in Pinellas County’s 13th District, spent years as a lobbyist, but he won despite attacks on his lobbying history by his Democratic opponent, former state CFO Alex Sink. Graham has been touting her resume as an attorney and employee of the Leon County School District. Did she once serve as a Washington lobbyist? Curriculum vitae In 1988, Graham graduated with a law degree from American University. She then worked with the firm Andrews & Kurth, a law firm that also did lobbying for some clients. One of those clients was the Secondary Lead Smelters Association. Southerland’s team pointed to lobbying disclosure records from 1989 and 1990 that list Gwendolyn G. Logan, Graham’s married name at the time. The lobbying paperwork says in part that the work was to "promote battery recycling legislation and other legislation affecting the secondary lead industry." In addition, Southerland points to an October 1990 handwritten staff note on the Lead Exposure Reduction Act from Bob Graham’s archive at the University of Florida. The note included the sentence from a staffer, "Put lead bill & materials in envelope to Becky for Gwen from BG," which Southerland’s camp considers proof of influence. Graham’s campaign quickly responded that her name being on disclosure forms was not proof of lobbying, because she did not participate in any such activity. It was her employer who listed her name on the forms. She even supplied a letter from her former Andrews & Kurth supervisor to prove it. The supervisor, Rob Steinwurtzel, wrote in a letter that the documents in question were not proof of Southerland’s claim. "We listed everybody in our group on the form, regardless whether they actually performed lobbying activities or not," Steinwurtzel told the Tampa Bay Times. "She came as a first-year associate and basically, first-year associates spend a lot of time in the library. She did not go to meetings with legislators or advocate on behalf of clients. I’m pretty certain about that." As for the handwritten note, the campaign said at the time the note was written, Graham was bed-ridden for a high-risk pregnancy. She gave birth to daughter Sarah three weeks later and soon left the firm. The staffer’s direction from her father could have referred to anything, the campaign said. Graham’s campaign had D.C. law firm Sandler Reiff explore the legality of Graham’s name being listed on the forms. The firm concluded that the filings in question fell under the purview of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, which preceded the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act in effect today. Under the earlier rules, Graham would have had to have been in direct contact with members of Congress for herself or her clients, self-report her work, have done substantial work on the legislation in question, and register herself a lobbyist, although doing a certain amount of work for a client fell under the reporting threshold. She had done none of these things. It was also common practice for a firm to list all support staff, with no regard to what they had actually done for the client, Sandler Reiff’s Joshua Rosenstein concluded. Lobbying experts we spoke to agreed that rules were much different before the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and that undermines Southerland’s attack. "I think her firm is right by saying they were being overly compliant," said Lisa Gilbert, director of the Congress Watch Division for liberal consumer-advocacy group Public Citizen. "Under the definitions at the time she certainly did not perform lobbying activities. That said, to a layman, her support would seem like lobbying. You can’t tell from the documentation." Dan Auble, a lobbying researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics, said he wasn’t entirely familiar with requirements the earlier Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, but the weakness of the paperwork is that you have to take Graham’s employer’s word for it. "If you take what the law firm is saying on its face, then she really didn’t," Auble said, although it’s possible the firm is stretching the truth. He said things have changed in Washington in the last 25 years -- and that’s something to keep in mind when considering Southerland’s claim. "People used to list names in the report because there was no stigma related to the word ‘lobbyist,' " he said. "Now no one wants to be called a lobbyist." Our ruling Southerland said Graham "was a Washington lobbyist." Even if it’s true that Graham lobbied, it would have been for a brief period a quarter-century ago. But it’s not at all clear that the charge is true. Southerland’s campaign based their attack on paperwork from the law firm Graham worked for after earning her law degree, listing her among the support staff. However, Graham provided a note from her supervisor saying that she was a researcher at the time and had not done actual lobbying work. She was listed because listing junior and support staff was a common practice at the time, according to a law firm retained by the Graham campaign. Experts we talked to agreed. At most, Graham’s inclusion on disclosure forms may have technically made her part of a lobbying effort, but there’s little evidence to suggest what, if anything, she did. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12594	"Police find 19 white female bodies in freezers with ‘Black Lives Matter’ carved into skin."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/06/blog-posting/story-19-white-women-killed-black-lives-matter-sup/	A racially charged fake news story about a black man killing white women and putting their corpses on ice has been spread around the Internet for the past year. It’s bogus. "Police find 19 white female bodies in freezers with ‘Black Lives Matter’ carved into skin," read the headline on a July 20, 2016, post on ViralDevil.com. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being false, as part of the social media website’s efforts to curtail fake news in users’ news feeds. The story said 39-year-old Rasheed Thompson was arrested in Chicago after neighbors reported suspicious activity. Police supposedly found the bodies while searching Thompson’s home. The post is made up, and it has changed a bit since first appearing early in 2016. The earliest version we found was posted on the fake news site Now8News.com, going back to at least Feb. 18, 2016. It was set in Los Angeles, and involved a man identified only as "Mathis," who hid 12 white women’s bodies in a freezer marked "Black Lives Matter." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That was followed up the same month by EmpireHerald.com, which wrote the version about Chicago’s Thompson killing 19 women. The original link is gone, but the Internet Archive Wayback Machine has a record of the story. EmpireHerald.com, a site filled with fake stories, carries no disclaimers about how its content is fabricated. It first started promoting the story the same day as the News8Now.com post. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com This version of the story ended up on several other websites throughout the year. None of the websites identified the story as fake. Some of the photographs often used to illustrate the story are of freezers really used to hide bodies, but aren’t of the fictional Thompson or his victims. One image showed a chest freezer used by a Japanese man who strangled his wife and hid the body for a decade. Another showed police removing a freezer in which a California man’s body had been hidden after he was killed. But this story and its details are fake. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-09824	"Every survey shows strong satisfaction with private coverage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/01/americas-health-insurance-plans/strong-satisfaction-health-insurance-coverage/	Opponents of President Barack Obama's health care reform plan say if ain't broke, don't fix it. They're referring to the current health care system in which most Americans get coverage from private insurers. They say most people are happy with private insurance and that it would be a mistake to mess with that. On CNN's Lou Dobbs Show on Aug. 27, 2009, Michael Tuffin, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, cited public opinion in arguing that Congress should not approve a government-run insurance option. "What we need to do is to fix the insurance market so we get everybody covered," Tuffin said. "Make pre-existing conditions a thing of the past. Build on the system that works well for about 85 percent of Americans. Every survey shows strong satisfaction with private coverage. We need to build on that system rather than put it at risk with a government-run plan." We wondered if Tuffin was right that "every survey shows strong satisfaction." So we checked the poll results and called experts. We looked at a selection of recent polls in the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation's searchable database of health care survey data. At least two types of questions shed some light on Tuffin's assertion. The question that's most directly on point asks whether the respondent is satisfied with his or her current health plan. The exact wording varies from poll to poll and we'll leave out questions that ask broadly about health care (rather than health plans) because it includes many factors beyond just insurance. A second, related question asks people if they are satisfied with the cost of their health care. We'll start with some examples of the first question. A June 2009 poll by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 42 percent of respondents were "very satisfied" with their health plan and 39 percent were "somewhat satisfied." Just 11 percent were "somewhat dissatisfied" and 8 percent were "very dissatisfied." Meanwhile, a July 2009 poll by Abt SRBI for Time magazine found 53 percent very satisfied, 33 percent somewhat satisfied, 9 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 4 percent very dissatisfied. A Quinnipiac University poll found 49 percent very satisfied, 36 percent somewhat satisfied, 10 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 4 percent very dissatisfied. Even a survey by a Democratic polling firm — Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for Democracy Corps — found the same general contours. In that June 2009 poll, 44 percent said they were very satisfied, 27 percent said they were somewhat satisfied, 11 percent said they were somewhat dissatisfied and 14 percent said they were very dissatisfied. Gallup asks the question somewhat differently in a survey conducted every November. Between 2001 and 2008, 20 to 28 percent of respondents rated their health care coverage "excellent" while between 39 and 51 percent rated their coverage "good." So, recent surveys generally indicate that Americans are satisfied with their current coverage, although it's not always the "strong satisfaction" that Tuffin claimed, especially in the Gallup data, in which "good" outpaces "excellent" by roughly 2-to-1. And the results for the other question undercut the notion of "strong satisfaction." When the June 2009 CBS- New York Times poll asked respondents what they felt about the cost of their premiums and the items not covered by their insurance, 23 percent said they were very satisfied, 27 percent said somewhat satisfied, 15 percent said not too satisfied and 33 percent — a plurality — said they were not at all satisfied. And when an ABC- Post poll from the same month asked the same question, the results were 23 percent very satisfied, 31 percent somewhat satisfied, 19 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 25 percent very dissatisfied. We asked three experts on health care polling — Robert Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health, Eric Nielsen, the senior director for media strategies at Gallup and Karlyn Bowman of the conservative American Enterprise Institue — for their view on the data. All agreed that people have consistently said they were satisfied with their health coverage. But Blendon and Nielsen emphasized that these polls have a major complicating factor. Pollsters almost always ask the questions to people who actually have insurance. That means the millions of Americans who are uninsured — and presumably aren't very happy — aren't included in the results. Another significant complication is that most polls do not differentiate between respondents who have private insurance and those who have Medicare, Medicaid or other government-run plans. (Nor, for that matter, do they differentiate between satisfaction levels for, say, HMOs and fee-for-service plans.) Gallup typically finds that between 26 and 33 percent of its respondents to the health care poll — not a trivial fraction — are covered through Medicare or Medicaid. For this reason, it's harder to say whether private insurance is more popular with consumers than government-run programs are. An AHIP spokesman told PolitiFact that the combination of "very" and "somewhat" satisfied — which together account for a big majority in every poll — justifies Tuffin's use of the phrase "strong satisfaction." But we think that to be "somewhat satisfied," as a big chunk of Americans are in every poll, falls short of "strong satisfaction." At the same time, many poll respondents expressed concerns about costs of the health care system. And since most independent polling data doesn't separate Americans' feelings about Medicare and Medicaid from private plans, it's an overreach to attribute Americans' warm feelings about their coverage simply to private insurance. On balance, then, we give Tuffin a Half True.	None	America's Health Insurance Plans	None	None	None	2009-09-01T18:26:54	2009-08-27	['None']

pomt-05349	On support for gay marriage.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/11/barack-obama/president-barack-obamas-shift-gay-marriage/	ABC broke into its daytime lineup May 9, 2012, to announce a historic shift: the president of the United States declaring his personal support for gay marriage. "I've been going through an evolution on this issue," President Barack Obama told ABC News. Indeed. While the president has consistently supported civil rights for gay couples — peppering his comments with specifics such as hospital visitation, transfer of property and Social Security benefits — his discussion of marriage has differed. He’s called same-sex marriage unstrategic, against his religious beliefs, and something that should be in the hands of churches rather than government. In 2008, he said: "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." On Wednesday, by contrast, he said: "I’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married." PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s just gauging whether they did. How does the president’s "evolution" on marriage rate? POLITICO and others have tracked Obama’s statements on same-sex marriage since 1996. Here’s our recap. Full circle Obama was in favor of same-sex marriage before he was against it — and before he was for it again. In 1996, as he ran for Illinois state Senate, Chicago’s Outlines gay newspaper asked candidates to fill out a questionnaire. Tracy Baim, the co-founder and publisher of Outlines, dug up a copy of the questionnaire in 2009, cataloging the president-elect’s shift. He had written on the 1996 questionnaire, "I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages." Just two years later, on another Outlines questionnaire, Obama wasn’t so sure. Did he favor legalizing same-sex marriage? "Undecided." Would he support a bill to repeal Illinois legislation prohibiting same-sex marriage? "Undecided." Would he co-sponsor it? "Undecided." Later years offered greater clarity — and a shift from 1996. Civil unions? Yes. Gay marriage? No. As Obama sought a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, he told the Windy City Times, "I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about, primarily just as a strategic issue. I think that marriage, in the minds of a lot of voters, has a religious connotation. ..." He described his hesitation to endorse same-sex marriage as strategic and political. "What I'm saying is that strategically, I think we can get civil unions passed. … I think that to the extent that we can get the rights, I'm less concerned about the name. … Republicans are going to use a particular language that has all sorts of connotations in the broader culture as a wedge issue, to prevent us moving forward, in securing those rights, then I don't want to play their game." When he wrote his 2006 memoir, The Audacity of Hope, he offered a religious explanation for his definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. But he left the door open for yet another shift. "I believe that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman as the unit of child rearing most common to every culture. …" he said. "(But) it is my obligation not only as an elected official in a pluralistic society, but also as a Christian, to remain open to the possibility that my unwillingness to support gay marriage is misguided, just as I cannot claim infallibility in my support of abortion rights. I must admit that I may have been infected with society's prejudices and predilections and attributed them to God; that Jesus' call to love one another might demand a different conclusion; and that in years hence I may be seen as someone who was on the wrong side of history." He said his doubts didn't make him a bad Christian — but human, limited in his understanding of God’s purpose and therefore "prone to sin." "When I read the Bible, I do so with the belief that it is not a static text but the Living Word and that I must continually be open to new revelations — whether they come from a lesbian friend or a doctor opposed to abortion." Still, in a 2007 Democratic primary debate sponsored by a gay rights group and a gay-oriented cable TV channel, he spoke instead about his support for civil unions with "all the benefits that are available for a legally sanctioned marriage" — but not for legal recognition of "marriage" between same-sex couples. It should be up to religious denominations to determine whether they wanted to recognize that as marriage or not, he said. In August 2008, he told Southern California megachurch Pastor Rick Warren his definition of marriage: "I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God's in the mix." He later added: "I am not somebody who promotes same-sex marriage, but I do believe in civil unions." In November 2008, he said much the same thing to a rather different audience: MTV. "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." By October 2010, almost two years into his presidency, he acknowledged his views were evolving. But he wasn’t prepared to reverse himself, he said. He told a group of liberal bloggers, "I have been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily because of my understandings of the traditional definitions of marriage. But I also think you’re right that attitudes evolve, including mine." He offered an explanation that would presage his 2012 shift: "I think that it is an issue that I wrestle with and think about because I have a whole host of friends who are in gay partnerships. I have staff members who are in committed, monogamous relationships, who are raising children, who are wonderful parents. And I care about them deeply. And so while I’m not prepared to reverse myself here, sitting in the Roosevelt Room at 3:30 in the afternoon, I think it’s fair to say that it’s something that I think a lot about. That’s probably the best you’ll do out of me today." A year and a half later, he announced the result of that wrestling and thinking. Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts asked him on Wednesday, "Mr. President, are you still opposed to same-sex marriage?" He answered: Well, you know, I have to tell you, as I've said, I've been going through an evolution on this issue. I've always been adamant that — gay and lesbian — Americans should be treated fairly and equally. And that's why in addition to everything we've done in this administration, rolling back Don't Ask, Don't Tell — so that, you know, outstanding Americans can serve our country. Whether it's no longer defending the Defense Against Marriage Act, which tried to federalize what has historically been state law. I've stood on the side of broader equality for the LGBT community. And I had hesitated on gay marriage — in part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient. That that was something that would give people hospital visitation rights and other elements that we take for granted. And I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, you know, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth. But I have to tell you that over the course of several years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors. When I think about members of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together. When I think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet, feel constrained, even now that Don't Ask, Don't Tell is gone, because they're not able to commit themselves in a marriage. At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married. Our ruling Obama, a consistent supporter of civil rights for gay couples, nevertheless said as early as 2004 and through 2008 that he didn’t support same-sex marriage. He had written that he believed "that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman." In 2010, he said he wasn’t prepared to reverse himself. This week, the president said he thinks same-sex couples should be able to get married. On the Flip-O-Meter, he earns a Full Flop.

pomt-09345	"The most private question on this year’s form asks for an individual’s race, and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census conducted under then-President George Washington."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-every-census-history-ha/	In an op-ed piece for the conservative website Red State on April 1, 2010, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Information Policy, Census and National Archives Subcommittee, sought to tamp down some of the misinformation being spread about the census by "otherwise well-meaning conservatives" and warned that failing to fully participate in the census could create a competitive advantage for Democrats. Specifically, McHenry attempted to allay the fear among some Republicans who distrust the government and view the census as overly prying. By law, the U.S. Census Bureau cannot share a person's personal information with anyone, including other federal agencies and law enforcement entities. All Census Bureau employees take an oath of nondisclosure and are sworn for life to protect the confidentiality of the data. The penalty for unlawful disclosure is a fine of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment of up to five years. Nonetheless, a Pew Research Center survey in mid-March found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats); and when asked if the census asks for more information than the government really needs, 61 percent of Republicans either responded "yes" or "don't know," as opposed 47 percent of Democrats. In his posting on Red State, McHenry said "the most private question on this year’s form asks for an individual’s race and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census conducted under then-President George Washington." We decided to check that claim out, which was similar to one from Census Bureau director Robert M. Groves in a March 15, 2010, press release: "It's one of the shortest forms in our lifetime with just 10 questions very much like the questions James Madison and Thomas Jefferson helped craft on the very first Census." Conveniently, the U.S. Census Bureau keeps historical records online of all the questions asked in every census going back to the first one in 1790. If you follow the census questions asked through U.S. history, you can see how they reflect changing attitudes and understandings about race. Yes, the 1790 census and others in the early years of the survey addressed race, but it was hardly a matter of checking a box. Rather, the census asked about the number of free white males and females; the number of "all other free persons" and the number of slaves. By 1850, the Census asked about people's "color." According to the Census archives, this column was to be left blank if a person was white, marked "B" if a person was black, and marked "M" if a person was mulatto. A separate form listed slave inhabitants, the last census to do so. By 1870, the "color" options included "W" for white, "B" for black, "M" for mulatto, "C" for Chinese (a category which included all Asians), or "I" for American Indian. The question morphed into "color or race" in the mid-1900s, and then, finally to just "race" in 1970. In 1980, in addition to race, the Census began asking if a person was of Spanish or Hispanic origin or descent. It's fair to say that every census has addressed the issue of race in some fashion. But we think it's a bit of a stretch when McHenry says "this year's asks for an individual’s race and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census." In the 1790 Census (and several after it), a respondent was not simply asked their race. Rather, they were asked to list the number of white people, the number of "other free persons" and the number of slaves. In other words, it didn't ask for the race of non-whites. One could argue this reflects the common attitude about race at the time. But that's hardly the same as the 2010 version that simply asks a person's race. Prior to the Civil War the census was more concerned with whether someone was enslaved or not, and establishing whether someone was white. This is a very different conception from our modern idea of race. Post Civil War, the terminology changed (from "color" to "race," for example) and the categories expanded over time. Certainly these are different standards when compared to today's measures. But again, one could argue that the questions comported with attitudes about race at those times, and the census has always asked descriptive questions that corrolate to race. So we rule McHenry's claim Mostly True.	None	Patrick McHenry	None	None	None	2010-04-07T17:50:58	2010-04-01	['None']
pomt-10159	"Obama, Biden and their liberal allies oppose clean coal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/01/john-mccain/a-clean-hit-not-quite/	"Clean coal," the promising yet distant ideal of burning coal for electricity without releasing harmful pollution, appeals to just about everybody. Yet a new radio advertisement by Sen. John McCain's campaign, targeted to the coal-rich states of Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, alleges that Sen. Barack Obama opposes it. "Clean coal is important to America. And to Colorado/Ohio/Pennsylvania/Virginia," the ad says, tailoring the narration to the state. "For [residents of that state], coal means thousands of jobs. Economic growth. More affordable electricity. For America, coal means energy independence. And clean coal means cleaner air. But Obama-Biden and their liberal allies oppose clean coal. Listen to Joe Biden." The ad then replays part of an exchange between Biden and a voter on a rope line in Maumee, Ohio, in on Sept. 17, 2008: "Senator, wind and solar are flourishing here in Ohio, so why are you supporting clean coal?" the voter asked. "We're not supporting clean coal," Biden replied. "Guess what, China is building two every week, two dirty coal plants, and it's polluting the United States, it's causing people to die." He touted his record on supporting solar energy and fighting global warming, then continued: "But guess what, China's going to burn 300 years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up, because it's going to ruin your lungs, and there's nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build them if they're going to build them over there. Make them clean, because they're killing you." The phrase "clean coal" refers to a number of technologies, some in use and others early in the development stage, which would allow the burning of coal for energy without the harmful pollution that coal-fired power plants currently emit. Chief among them is "carbon sequestration," a process by which the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide would be captured and injected underground or into the ocean, where it would not contribute to global warming. That is at least a decade or two away. Strictly speaking, Biden's comments in Maumee were not evidence that he "oppose[s] clean coal," as the ad claims – rather they suggest he opposes clean coal plants in the United States, but supports the idea of developing the technology here and providing it to China. In fact, Biden himself has voiced support for clean coal, calling for "carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will allow us to use coal cleanly" in the energy plan he released during his presidential campaign in the autumn of 2007. In a statement , Obama campaign spokesman David Wade explained Biden's comments this way: "Senator Biden's point is that China is building coal plants with outdated technology every day, and the United States needs to lead by developing clean coal technologies." Moreover, Biden's remarks are far outweighed by the many instances in which Obama has spoken out in favor of clean coal, as our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org pointed out recently . Here's Obama in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008: "As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power." Here he is in Detroit, Mich., on May 7, 2007: "We'll also need to find a way to use coal – America's most abundant fossil fuel – without adding harmful greenhouse gases to the environment." If there were any doubt that Obama supports the development of clean-coal plants in the United States specifically, the energy plan on his Web site makes that explicit: "Barack Obama and Joe Biden will...develop and deploy clean coal technology. Carbon capture and storage technologies hold enormous potential to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as we power our economy with domestically produced and secure energy...Barack Obama and Joe Biden will instruct DOE (the Department of Energy) to enter into public private partnerships to develop “first-of-a-kind” commercial scale coal-fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration." So no, Obama and his "liberal allies" do not oppose clean coal.

pomt-07809	Under changes being debated, state employees in Wisconsin "who earn $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/17/ed-schultz/talk-show-host-ed-schultz-says-wisconsin-state-emp/	When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed making state employees pay more for health and pension benefits, one of his aides said the changes would cost the average worker roughly 8 percent of his or her salary. Walker’s move so angered MSNBC-TV talk show host Ed Schultz that he came to Madison on Feb. 17, 2011 -- the day the Legislature was scheduled to vote on the proposals -- to air his show. Two days earlier, Schultz claimed on "The Ed Show" the impact on state workers would be much greater than 8 percent. He said: "People who earn $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight." Schultz hedged a bit by saying might. But the implication was the effect of Walker’s proposals would be to cut the income of large numbers of state workers by 20 percent. Let’s see if he’s right. Schultz said in the broadcast that he had been given figures that show a 20 percent impact. We asked his staff for that information and they said they would attempt to provide it. But as of publication, we have not heard from them. Under the Republican governor’s plan, state employees would contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward pensions and pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums. Meanwhile, we consulted other sources on how much more state workers would pay if the budget repair bill is adopted. It’s a political debate, but this is largely a mathematical question. Here’s what our sources said: Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration: The higher contributions would amount to, on average, a 9.4 percent cut in take-home pay. Joe Wineke, former administrator of the state Division of Compensation and Labor Relations and former chairman of the state Democratic Party: The impact on most workers would be 6.8 percent to 11 percent of their salary. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie: Detailed estimates are being prepared, but the cost to the average worker would be about 8 percent of their wages. University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Chancellor Brian Levin-Stankevich: In a memo, he said a UW-Eau Claire employee who earns $40,000 per year would pay an annual pension contribution of $2,320, up from $80; and an annual health insurance premium for family coverage of $2,820, up from $1,068. That’s a total of $3,992 per year, or 12.9 percent of that employee’s salary. Under the plan, all employees would pay the same percentage of their income toward pensions. But the larger health insurance payments would eat up a higher percentage of the income of low-income employees than of high-income employees. So the total impact would vary on a percentage basis. That said, the total impact, in terms of a percentage of income, would not vary widely, according to Wineke. The vast majority of state employees take the same so-called Tier 1 health coverage, he said. Let’s return to the statement: Schultz said Wisconsin state employees earning $30,000 to $50,000 per year "might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight" as a result of Walker’s proposals to boost state employee payments for health and pension benefits. It was a broad statement about the impact of the measures. The sources we consulted indicate the range is 6.8 percent to 11 percent. Even if the higher payments comprise 20 percent of the income of some employees, there’s no indication it will be that high on a wide scale, particularly for state workers earning as much as $50,000 per year. If Schultz can provide evidence of a large-scale 20 percent impact, we’ll review this item. But this is our rating: False. (Editor’s note: On March 4, 2011, this item was changed to fix an error in the percentage of employee salary that goes toward paying for pensions and health insurance for a hypothetical employee at UW-Eau Claire.)

pomt-08934	Georgia is "the Saudi Arabia of pine trees."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/25/georgia-politicians/politicans-claim-georgia-pine-trees-what-saudi-ara/	Some phrases just seem to take on a life of their own in Georgia politics. Take a catchphrase of the just-ended primary election cycle. Republicans tossed it about. Democrats dished it out. It was used by failed GOP gubernatorial hopeful Eric Johnson. And Roy Barnes used it in a campaign video in his successful bid for the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor. And don't be surprised if you hear it again as the election cycle moves forward. Georgia, politicians have proclaimed, "is the Saudi Arabia of pine trees." The implication is that Georgia's pines could have a major impact on our nation's fuel needs, perhaps substantially reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Georgia has been called many things through the years -- Empire State of the South, the Peach State and the Goober State (this one owing to its prowess growing peanuts, not producing politicians). But the Saudi Arabia of Pine Trees? And where did that new moniker-in-the-making originate? Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer and exporter of petroleum liquids. It is the world’s second largest crude oil producer behind Russia. It has one-fifth of the world’s proven petroleum reserves. Georgia, meanwhile, certainly has a lot of pine trees. And pines are one of the things being looked at by the fledgling ethanol industry, which hopes to produce fuel from a variety of sustainable crops. There have also been proposals to use pine pellets to produce electricity. A massive 2007 study by the U.S. Forest Service found Georgia had about 16 billion cubic feet of pines growing within its borders. That included longleaf and slash pines, loblolly and short-leaf pines, "other" yellow pines and even a few white and red pines. The 350-page report showed Georgia comes in ahead of other Southern states in pine production. And those Southern states top other states in pine production. Nathan McClure, director of forest energy for the Georgia Forestry Commission, said the state has about 24.4 million acres of "commercial timberland." He estimated that about half that is planted in pines. The state’s forest industry is huge, producing a direct economic impact of about $18 billion in 2008, McClure said. The indirect impact pushes that figure to about $28 billion, he estimated. McClure, however, said his agency has tried to steer clear of the Saudi Arabia comparison that is getting bandied about by politicians. "We don’t like that statement because of the inference about the Mideast at the same time we are in the middle of a war in the Mideast," McClure said. In November 2008, Range Fuels broke ground for the nation’s first cellulosic ethanol plant at a site in rural Treutlen County, just outside Soperton. That facility will use pine trees to produce ethanol. Jill Stuckey, who directs the alternative fuels program for the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, said the state is second only to Oregon when it comes to trees. "And Oregon’s forests are old-growth and slow-growing compared to Georgia’s," Stuckey said. "We grow trees like Iowa grows corn." But like Saudi Arabia produces oil? We had to drill a little deeper for that connection, all the way back to April 2008 and an article in Georgia Trend magazine. In that issue, Susan Varlamoff, director of the Office of Environmental Sciences at the University of Georgia, talked about Georgia’s potential to produce fuel from various agricultural products, items referred to by scientists as "biomass." The article noted that Varlamoff "has coined a now well-worn phrase, calling Georgia 'the Saudi Arabia of biomass.' " Varlamoff, as it turns out, was very careful to use the term "biomass" and not pine trees. And there’s a good reason. She was talking about a variety of items that could be used to produce alternative fuels. Pine trees are certainly included in that equation, she told PolitiFact Georgia. But so are paper pulp, peanut shells, pecan shells and about a billion pounds of chicken fat and grease from the poultry processing industry. "We are the Saudi Arabia of biomass," Varlamoff reiterated to PolitiFact Georgia. Varlamoff, however, said she never limited her statement to pine trees. The politicians and their handlers took care of that rhetorical flourish. "Honestly, somebody just decided to make that change," she said. Georgia does have a lot of pine trees. And they could play a vital role in the development of any alternative fuel industry in the state. But so will a lot of other agricultural products. And there are still many questions about the viability of the alternative fuels industry. The Saudi Arabia of pine trees? Well, Georgia is at least the Kuwait of conifers. We give this one a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05683	There are "850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/14/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-touts-850000-buckeye-state-j/	How do you know if a Democratic candidate is talking about the auto industry bailout in Ohio? His lips are moving. But, seriously, few issues excite party operatives more these days than the resurgence of Chrysler and General Motors, both rescued by the federal government. Democrats see it as a huge positive for President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who just so happen to be up for re-election this year, and a huge negative for their Republican challengers. And while this might make for smart politics, particularly in states such as Michigan and Ohio, sometimes the crisp talking points come at the expense of facts. With this in mind, PolitiFact Ohio chose to look at a number that the Ohio Democratic Party has seized on with gusto. The party trotted the number out in a March 13, 2012, news release targeting Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, Brown’s Republican opponent in the Senate contest. The news release trumpeted criticism from Toledo-area auto workers toward Mandel, saying he would have opposed auto industry bailouts. There are "850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry," the release said. That number has become key to ODP’s core argument. The party used it in two other recent releases. One on March 6, the day of the Super Tuesday primary, took aim at front-running Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, an outspoken opponent of bailouts. The other on March 12 targeted Mandel. We’re not addressing Mandel’s position on the auto bailouts or how Romney’s anti-bailout view will serve him if he faces off against Obama in November. That’s a political calculation for another forum. ODP Chairman Chris Redfern and others have repeatedly claimed that the industry would have died had Romney and Mandel been calling the shots on the bailouts. That, too, is a hypothetical pretty much impossible to prove one way or the other. But what about the number? We asked Andrew Zucker, the ODP’s press secretary, for the source, and he pointed us to the Center for Automotive Research, or CAR. In 2010, the independent group from Ann Arbor, Mich., published a 55-page report examining the U.S. auto industry’s economic worth nationwide. Side note: We started looking into the number’s accuracy after it was used in those two previous releases. By the time we had downloaded the report, Zucker had fired off the latest ODP missive, using the same statistic -- but this time with a full citation. We’re using that statement for this item. An appendix on page 48 of the report provides a state by state breakdown that attributes 848,304 Ohio jobs to the U.S. auto industry. That’s roughly 12 percent of the state’s workforce, according to CAR. PolitiFact Ohio then took a closer look at how CAR arrived at its figures. For starters, it is important to understand what types of jobs factor into the group’s analysis. CAR looks at three levels of employment: direct, intermediate and a category they call spin-off. Direct employees include those who work for automakers, parts manufacturers or car dealers. Intermediate employees work for companies that sell goods or services used by the direct employers. And spin-off jobs are the jobs created by the spending activity of employees in the direct and intermediate categories. Such employees could be a cashier at the supermarket or mall, a waiter or a bartender. In Ohio, about 149,000 jobs are attributed to direct employment, 285,000 to intermediate and 415,000 to spin-off. Half of the jobs are tied to automakers rather than suppliers or dealers. It is clear, though, that intermediate and spin-off jobs account for a majority of the estimated jobs. Those numbers, according to CAR’s report, come from a "dynamic, inter-industry model" -- in other words, a simulation that includes multipliers. The methodology is not uncommon. We touched base with Kim Hill, one of the report’s authors, who confirmed what PolitiFact Ohio suspected. These estimates include not only U.S. automakers with Ohio operations, but also foreign automakers such as Honda, which has an Ohio presence. That is a key point because the ODP has typically used the 850,000 number in a context that suggests that’s how many jobs were at stake in the bailout. ODP, in the March 12 news release that also targeted Mandel, went as far as saying "850,000 Ohio jobs … would have been in jeopardy" had a hypothetical Sen. Mandel and his colleagues voted against the bailout. This would be more accurate if those 850,000 jobs were tied solely to Chrysler and GM, the beneficiaries of the bailout. But had these two companies failed, Ohio still would have Honda, as well as suppliers and dealers that also do business with other foreign companies and Ford. Honda employs more than 13,500 Ohioans, according to recent media statements. The company has announced more than $500 million in Ohio investment since late 2010. Hill gave the ODP a pass here and noted that industrywide fallout from the collapse of two giants would have been significant for suppliers and other service providers and thus would have impacted spin-off employment, as well. Hill also noted that those jobs are supported by the auto industry not just in Ohio but in other states, too. A generic example would be a Cleveland metals manufacturer or another Ohio company that provides some professional service (an intermediate employer) to a Detroit automaker (a direct employer). In this case, it is auto industry in Michigan that is supporting the jobs in Ohio. The ODP’s claim was that "850,000 Ohio jobs (are) tied to the auto industry." That is an accurate statement. While the jobs figure includes intermediate and spinoff jobs, as well as direct employment, that manner of counting is not uncommon for evaluating employment impact. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the statement True.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-03-14T06:00:00	2012-03-13	['Ohio']

pomt-11616	"California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2018/jan/24/worldnetdaily/no-california-didnt-pass-law-allowing-undocumented/	In April 2018, a new law will allow Californians to automatically register to vote when they renew their driver’s license. It’s intended to bolster registration in a state where voter turnout has lagged. A slew of conservative websites, however, have seized on the law, dubbed the California New Motor Voter Program, to make the claim this week that it will register undocumented immigrants to vote. They cite a separate law, AB 60, that allows undocumented Californians to apply for and obtain a state driver’s license, as alleged proof. This World Net Daily headline on Jan. 21, 2018 sparked the recent claims: "California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically." Shortly after it was published, similar allegations were made by The New American, FoxNews.com and conservative commentators Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. This isn’t the first wave of commentary on the topic. Similar statements were made when California passed the Motor Voter program in 2015. But because the claims popped up again this week, it’s time to take another look at the California laws in question and the safeguards state officials say are in place. We’ll also place a rating on the claim by World Net Daily. Background on the laws Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 60 in 2013, making California the 10th state to allow driver licenses for people in the country illegally. The goal was to increase public safety and reduce penalties for undocumented immigrants who drive. As of June 2017, the state Department of Motor Vehicles had issued more than 900,000 of the licenses. In 2015, Brown signed the New Motor Voter law. By April, it will automatically register DMV customers to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license or fill out change of address forms, unless the customer opts-out. Under the law, the DMV would electronically send information for those eligible to register to vote -- which does not include undocumented residents -- to the California Secretary of State’s Office. That office would, in turn, verify name and citizenship information. A spokesman for that office did not respond to requests for comment this week. In the past, however, Secretary of State Alex Padilla has pledged the new system will be an improvement over the existing one. "Automated voter registration is actually a more secure way of doing things," Padilla told the Huffington Post in 2015. Potential voters "have to demonstrate proof of age, the vast majority of time people are showing a birth certificate or a passport, which also reflects citizenship. That’s arguably more secure than someone checking a box under penalty of perjury." "Completely inaccurate" claims Jessica Gonzalez, spokeswoman with the California DMV, said she’s contacted several of the websites making what she called "completely inaccurate" claims and asked for corrections. One, the Daily Mail, had pulled down its story, another updated its article, while she said Fox News did not immediately correct its article. "Undocumented Californians are not eligible to register to vote at the DMV," Gonzalez told PolitiFact California. "And we have programming measures in place to prevent that from occurring." At DMV field offices, Gonzalez said, technicians will not be able to key in any voting information for undocumented customers seeking AB 60 license renewals. As soon as a technician types in AB 60, the voter information section automatically gets "greyed out" and can’t be typed into and can’t be bypassed, the spokeswoman said. She added that the same safeguards are in place for online and mail renewals. "The (mail) form won’t even have the voter information questions on it, so they won’t be able to register to vote," Gonzalez said. "It’s really interesting how quickly false information spreads," she continued, "and how difficult it is to get the correct information out there to Californians that really need to know this information." A representative for World Net Daily could not be reached for comment. Several fact-checking websites, from Snopes.com to The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, examined the topic this week. The Weekly Standard concluded "there is zero evidence to support that ludicrous claim." Our ruling Conservative news websites and commentators claimed California plans to register undocumented immigrants to vote. This isn’t the first time such unsubstantiated claims have been made. But the recent spat was sparked by the World Net Daily headline: "California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically." In reality, the California law that goes into effect in April 2018 will automatically register only those eligible to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license. Undocumented immigrants are excluded. The law does nothing to change the federal requirement that one must be a U.S. citizen to register to vote. State officials said safeguards are already in place to prevent state DMV workers from typing in any voter information for AB 60 license holders. The state allows unauthorized immigrants to obtain a driver’s license, but explicitly excludes that group from the automatic voter registration. The allegations on this topic are recycled. And they’re still blatantly untrue. We rate World Net Daily’s claim Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. UPDATE: After we published our fact check, World Net Daily published a separate article saying a spokeswoman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles "cleared up an inaccuracy in WND’s initial report." It said the spokeswoman explained that California’s licenses for undocumented immigrants "are not eligible for the new voter registration system." As of Jan. 29, 2018, World Net Daily had not updated its original report with this information.

We’re not sure what he believes. He hasn't said so in the confirmation hearings. Harris’ tweet takes Kavanaugh’s statement out of context. Harris cut an important second out of the clip — the attribution. Kavanaugh said, "They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objecting to." "They" refers to a Catholic nonprofit group, Priests for Life. Kavanaugh was answering a question from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about a case in which he argued Priests for Life shouldn’t have to provide women with the contraceptive coverage mandated by the Affordable Care Act for religious reasons. A later reply to that tweet included a two-minute clip with the full question and answer. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said Kavanaugh was using the limited time available to summarize the arguments made by the plaintiff. "It’s very clear he’s characterizing their position, which was held by all the Catholic organizations within that set of cases," Kupec said. "But even within characterizing their position, if you look at the dissent, it’s still not a blanket description of birth control." In the dissent, Kavanaugh writes, "They complain that submitting the required form contravenes their religious beliefs because doing so, in their view, makes them complicit in providing coverage for contraceptives, including some that they believe operate as abortifacients." The question is significant to abortion rights activists because most common types of contraception don’t prevent implantation but fertilization. According to the medical community, pregnancy begins after a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus. If a Supreme Court justice believes pregnancy begins at fertilization it could jeopardize the legality of birth control methods for women. Harris’ office pointed out that at no point in his answer did Kavanaugh disagree with this definition of contraception, note it was medically inaccurate, or acknowledge it was politically charged. "In his full answer, he uses the term uncritically," said Lily Adams, communications director for Harris. "He doesn’t say ‘so-called,’ ‘I don’t agree with it,’ there’s no caveat that he gives that he does not agree with the term." Adams added that Kavanaugh was not exactly quoting the dissent, as the phrase used in the case was abortion-inducing products, not drugs. Kavanaugh has not defined what he believes constitutes "abortion-inducing drugs." But the White House insisted that in that statement, "He did not express a personal view." White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said it was not the judge’s job to be critical of the term, quoting another segment of the dissent. "The Supreme Court has emphasized that judges in Religious Freedom Restoration Act cases may question only the sincerity of a plaintiff’s religious belief, not the correctness or reasonableness of that religious belief," Kavanaugh wrote, citing Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby and Thomas vs. Review Board. In the follow-up to his answer, Kavanaugh says the government did, in fact, have a compelling reason to ensure birth control access to the employees. But he determined the government could provide it without doing so on the backs of the religious objector. Our ruling Harris tweeted a clip in which Kavanaugh said, "Filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were -- as a religious matter, objected to." In Harris’ tweet, Kavanaugh appears to define contraception as abortion-inducing. But the video failed to include a crucial qualifier: "They said." In fact, he was citing the definition of the religious group Priests for Life. He has not expressed his personal view. We rate this statement False.

pomt-02209	"Social science is irrefutable" that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/22/ralph-reed/ralph-reed-says-irrefutable-social-science-shows-k/	On ABC’s Easter Sunday edition of This Week, host Martha Raddatz discussed the intersection of religion and politics with her guests. "Just a few months after taking office, Pope Francis spoke out on the issue of homosexuality, saying, ‘If they accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them?’ " she said. " ‘They shouldn't be marginalized, the tendency to homosexuality is not the problem. They're our brothers.’ " Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed told Raddatz he doesn’t support gay couples raising adopted children. "This is about what's best for children here in the United States. And the social science is irrefutable," Reed said. "And it is that a child who grows up in a home without the mother and father present and they both play very unique procreative, nurturing and socializing role, they're nine times more likely to end up dropping out of high school. They're five times more likely to end up in poverty. And they're three times more likely to end up addicted to drugs and alcohol." PunditFact wanted to know what social science has to say about the effects gay parents have on children compared to straight parents. The social science statistics Reed called "irrefutable" actually have nothing to do with gay couples raising kids. Instead, they’re focused on the effects of children who grow up without a father in a one-parent household. Put another way, the studies focus on the quantity of parents and not their gender. Reed’s office pointed us to his book, as well as a Brookings Institution report that says parents who graduate from high school and bear children within marriage have a 2 percent chance of living in poverty. But neither the study nor his book draws any comparison between gay and straight marriages. In fact, it makes no mention of gay marriages. Other research often cited by gay parenting critics, like Sara McLanahan’s Growing Up With a Single Parent, similarly doesn’t include any information on gay parenting, specifically. Again, the critique is focused on having one parent present versus two. We decided not to investigate further the specific stats Reed cited once we realized they weren’t measuring what he said they were. Comparisons like Reed’s are "a complete misuse of the research," said Judith Stacey, a New York University sociologist. We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it’s been denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, Mark Regnerus loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. Research is still limited, but many reputable studies so far have concluded that children of gay parents, generally speaking, are just as well off as children of straight parents. What’s more important is the number of parents a child has, experts told us. "Kids are better off with two parents," said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. "But we don't have much evidence that those parents must be of the opposite gender." Our ruling Reed said there’s "irrefutable" social science to show that children are better off being parented by a mother and father. That’s not right. What studies really show is that children are better off with two parents. Those studies do not focus on gender. All reputable research so far indicates that children brought up by gay parents are just well off as those brought up by straight parents. We rate Reed’s statement False.

pomt-11047	"A Trump fan was just charged with trying to murder Maxine Waters on same day Trump threatened her."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/28/blog-posting/no-trump-supporter-did-not-try-murder-rep-maxine-w/	A headline buzzing on social media falsely said one of President Donald Trump’s supporters was charged with attempting to murder U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the same day Trump targeted her on Twitter. "A Trump fan was just charged with trying to murder Maxine Waters on same day Trump threatened her," said a June 26, 2018, headline from The Washington Press, an online news website. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This story is false. According to the inaccurate report, Trump’s attack on Waters was a "barely veiled threat" based on a misunderstanding of Waters’ comments about the public’s treatment of officials in the Trump administration. The tweet came in response to video footage that showed Waters, at a rally outside a federal office building in Los Angeles, encouraging Trump opponents to boo or harass Trump administrators in public spaces. "Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!," Trump wrote. The false story said Trump’s tweet coincided with a California man’s guilty plea in relation to a murder threat delivered to Waters. The plea — entered by Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, of San Pedro, California — proved that "the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences," the story said. The story erred in getting details and timing of real incidents wrong. A man by the name of Anthony Scott Lloyd did, in fact, plead guilty to threatening a United States official. Lloyd phoned Waters’ office on Oct. 22, 2017, and left a voicemail riddled with derogatory language, including racial epithets and expletives. The message used the words "dead" and "kill" a total of four times, according to a press release from the Department of Justice. "If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you," Lloyd said, according to court documents. "If you do it again, you’re dead." (We obtained a digital copy of the plea agreement, which included a full transcript of the voicemail, from Thom Mrozek, spokesperson for the United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California.) But Lloyd plead guilty on April 16, 2018, and Trump tweeted at Waters more than two months later on June 25, 2018. So it is not true that the two events occurred on the same day, as the false headline suggested. The headline is likely not the result of confusion, either, because no reports related to Lloyd’s case were released on the day of Trump’s tweet. Lloyd’s sentencing date is set for July 16, 2018, and Mrozek said there have not been any new developments in the case since the guilty plea. Plus, Lloyd only plead guilty to threatening Waters. He was not charged with "trying to murder" the congresswoman. Mrozek said prosecutors have not made any allegations related to an actual attempt at murder. The Washington Press did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12779	Says Sen. John McCain was "caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/21/blog-posting/did-john-mccain-violate-logan-act-call-australian-/	U.S. Sen. John McCain’s attempt to smooth over a contentious phone call between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was against the law, according to several bloggers. But their ire toward the Arizona Republican relies on a hard-to-establish link to a highly politicized law that no one has ever been convicted of violating. "McCain caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country," blared the Facebook headline on several Internet posts critical of the senator on or after Feb. 3, 2017. The social media site flagged at least one undated example as part of its efforts to squash fake stories in users’ news feeds. In this case, the post isn’t fake in that details were made up, rather just inaccurate in how the details are portrayed. The posts reference an initial phone call Trump made to Turnbull on Jan. 28. That call allegedly turned sour when Trump balked over an agreement former President Barack Obama struck to take in 1,250 refugees that Australia held in offshore detention centers. But the "highly illegal phone call" that McCain made was on Feb. 2, when he contacted Australian ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey to assure Hockey of McCain’s "unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance." "I asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote," McCain said in a statement. That caused an uproar in some corners of the Internet. Several websites repurposed or made reference to an undated post that appears to originate at AngryPatriotMovement.com, which carried the same headline about McCain breaking the law. The post linked to a Feb 3 BizPacReview.com article that said McCain was "undermining" Trump, and said McCain’s call to Australia’s ambassador "might be a violation of the Logan Act." "The Logan Act says ANY citizen of the United States who ‘without permission of the United States’ either directly or indirectly ‘commences or carries on correspondence’ with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to ‘influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer’ in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years — or both," the AngryPatriotMovement.com post read. But really, McCain wasn’t "caught" doing anything. His office put out the press release about contacting Hockey. And the Logan Act isn’t necessarily a law designed to root out near-treasonous behavior, the way the blogs make it sound. The Logan Act dates back to 1798, when a Pennsylvania state legislator named George Logan went to France to negotiate a peace settlement over debts with the United States during the French Revolution, according to the Washington Post. You’ll recall Paul Giamatti agonizing over the issue in HBO’s John Adams. Adams’ Federalist Party had opposed Logan’s efforts, so they passed a law that said private citizens couldn’t work on foreign policy issues without the government allowing it. No one has ever been charged with a crime under the Logan Act, but its name comes up from time to time, usually when a lawmaker has contacted a foreign official for some purpose the opposing party doesn’t like. Some brought up the act when U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., went to Syria as Speaker of the House to attempt to wheel and deal with President Bashar al-Assad in 2007. It also was mentioned when 47 Republican senators wrote a letter to Iran in 2015 to try to scuttle Obama’s nuclear treaty. It even came up when Trump, as the GOP presidential nominee, asked Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails last year. It’s highly doubtful that McCain, who has made a habit of serving as a foil for Trump, actually violated federal law. Stanford law professor Michael McConnell doubted the Logan Act could be used to keep a senator from talking to a country’s envoy about foreign affairs, which senators often do. "So far as publicly available information indicates, Sen. McCain spoke with the Australian ambassador to assure the nation of his own unwavering support — not to influence any ‘measures or conduct,’" McConnell told us in an email. Our ruling Bloggers claim McCain was "caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country." The claim reads as if McCain tried to break federal law by influencing a foreign official, perhaps by secrecy. That’s not the case at all, but a reader wouldn’t get that impression.

pomt-13577	"At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/19/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-331-billion-rio-olympic-gold-meda/	U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell says paying off the national debt would require an Olympic feat. "Here’s something to think about while rooting on our U.S. Olympians: At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt," Rigell, R-2nd, says on his congressional Facebook page. We asked Rigell’s office where he got the figures for his claim that billions of medals would be needed to erase the U.S. debt. Kaylin Minton, Rigell’s director of communications, pointed us to a July 31 article from CNN that said the value of the gold medal is $587. We found another estimate from Forbes magazine that said the value of the medal was $564. These figures are based on the value of the precious metal used in the top Olympic award. The medals weigh 500 grams - or just more than 1 pound. If that roughly $600 value for a pound of gold seems exceedingly low, there’s a good reason: The gold medal is made mostly of silver. Brazil’s federal government website dedicated to the games says the Rio 2016 top medal consists of 494 grams of sterling silver. The remaining 6 grams is made up of 99.9 percent pure gold. The value of a gold medal fluctuates based on the price of precious metals, which change daily. We looked at commodity prices about a week after Rigell’s statement and found the value of the precious metals was closer to $550. But the bottom line is, Rigell’s estimate of the value of a gold medal is about right for the basic smelt value. The figure does not include the $25,000 cash bonus the U.S. Olympic Committee provides to athletes for each gold medal won. It’s also worth noting that if Olympic medals are sold at auction, they could fetch a price well beyond their scrap value. Money magazine recently looked at some past gold medals that have been sold and fetched big bucks. A 1936 gold medal won by track and field star Jesse Owens sold for $1.47 million in 2013, according to the magazine. Another gold medal from an anonymous winner from the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles sold this year for $41,807. Holthouse, Carlin, Van Tright LLP, a Los Angeles-based accounting firm, said in a recent post on its website that gold medals on the open market generally fetch around $10,000. The "intrinsic monetary worth" of a gold medal - the amount an athlete would report on taxes - is based on the weight of the precious metals, or about $600, the accounting firm said. So how would that translate into paying off the national debt? Minton points to the national debt figures from the U.S. Treasury Department, which lists total national debt of $19.4 trillion. If you divide that by $587, it would translate into nearly 33.1 billion gold medals. One final point: The overall debt figure that Minton cites includes all debt, including about $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt that the U.S. government owes itself, such as Social Security and Medicare trust funds that are invested in Treasury securities. When looking at the size of the U.S. debt, some experts prefer tallying just the amount of debt held by the public in Treasury bills, savings bonds and obligations to foreign governments, because that’s the debt the U.S. government owes to outside entities. The publicly held debt comes to $14 trillion. If you were to divide that by the $587 medal value, that would mean it would take about 23.9 billion medals to equal the value of the U.S. debt held by the public. That’s not as high as Rigell says, but it’s still a massive number. Our ruling Rigell stated, "At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt." The value of the award shifts based on the fluctuating price of the precious metals it contains. That said, the basic value of the gold medal that Rigell cites is a reasonable estimate. And that $587 cost would translate into billions of medals being needed to equal the size of the total national debt. But his statement benefits from some clarity. If you were to take into account a higher payday that an athlete could get by selling their gold medal on the open market, that amount could go well beyond the basic precious metal value of the award. That, in turn, would lower drastically the amount of medals it would take to pay off the debt. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/beb7e209-818a-40a7-a9ec-b19feb5c94e4	None	Scott Rigell	None	None	None	2016-08-19T13:58:19	2016-08-09	['United_States', '1,000,000,000']

pomt-14761	"Most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/11/antonin-scalia/scalia-says-most-black-scientists-went-lesser-coll/	Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is taking heat for comments he made from the bench that some are calling racist. While questioning a lawyer during oral arguments in Fisher vs. University of Texas, a case that has the potential to derail affirmative action across the country, Scalia suggested that the practice might actually harm black students by putting them into a scholastic environment for which they are not academically prepared. "There are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well," Scalia said Dec. 9. "One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they’re being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them." Scalia’s comments have generated plenty of discussion. As fact-checkers, we decided to zero in on his factual claim that "most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools." Bloomberg pointed out Scalia was probably referring to a brief by University of San Diego law professor Gail Heriot and Cleveland attorney Peter Kirsanow. The pair are congressional appointees to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Their brief made the case that affirmative action is a hindrance for students admitted through affirmative action who pursue degrees in science and engineering." As evidence they pointed to a 1996 Dartmouth study that showed 40 percent of black students graduating with science and engineering degrees came from historically black colleges and universities, where students typically have lower average SAT scores and high school grades. But Scalia’s comment was broader and talked about the number of black scientists as a whole. In that regard, there is no national count of every single black scientist and where they went to school. There is some research, however, on how minority students fare as science majors at different universities. On the raw numbers, the claim is "likely to be true, but not for the reasons Scalia thinks it is," said Benjamin Backes, an affirmative action expert with the American Institutes for Research. Most black scientists likely did not go to schools like the University of Texas at Austin — that is to say, selective research universities. Why? Because the vast majority of students and science majors do not go to these elite institutions. For reference, the American Association of Universities represents 62 leading research universities, which together house just 20 percent of all undergraduate science, math and engineering majors in the United States and Canada. "Because the typical student, both black and non-black, does not attend a selective university, the typical scientist likely did not graduate from a selective institution," he said. Let’s get back to the broader point of the statement: that black students perform better in science at "lesser" schools than the University of Texas. At the crux of this debate is the mismatch theory, which is controversial to say the least. It’s the idea that affirmative action brings minority students into universities where their academic credentials are significantly lower than the typical student, and so these minority students are less likely to persist with difficult majors like science and engineering than they would have been at a less-selective school. The study that Scalia cited is almost 20 years old, but more recent research purports to support the mismatch theory. "Scalia was certainly oversimplifying, but there is a large literature on this problem," said Richard Sander, a University of California Los Angeles law professor who co-wrote a book titled Mismatch. Sander cited a recent study examining students in the University of California system that found "minority students at top-ranked campuses would, on average, have significantly higher probabilities of graduating in the sciences if they had attended lower-ranked campuses." But — here’s a taste of how contentious this theory is — Matthew Chingos, an education expert at the Urban Institute, did his own analysis of the same data and found the results to "only marginally" hold up to scrutiny and that the relationship to affirmative action was weak. In his own book, Chingos found that attending a more selective institution makes it more likely that a black student will graduate. Following Scalia’s remarks, Chingos wrote in an Urban Institute blog that Scalia’s "viewpoint withers upon closer examination" because the theory has largely been discredited by social science. A group of 11 leading experts in quantitative social science filed their own brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the Court should not consider the mismatch theory when deciding the case. The professors wrote that research in support of the theory, such as Sander's findings, "does not constitute credible evidence that affirmative action practices are harmful to minorities" because of the "significant methodological flaws on which it rests." "Essentially Scalia is presenting mismatch as fact without acknowledging the disagreement amongst researchers," Backes said, noting that he personally thinks there’s empirical support for the theory. A 2014 study, which does not take a position on affirmative action, found that an outsized portion, 30 percent, of black Ph.D. candidates in science and engineering attended a historically black college or university for their undergraduate education. Chingos said this study does not say much about the issue of affirmative action because it doesn’t say much about relative merits of minority students going to a less or more selective university. Our ruling Citing a brief, Scalia said, "Most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools." In terms of raw numbers, it’s probably true that most of the black scientists come from schools that are less selective than the University of Texas at Austin. But that’s not a statement on the effects of affirmative action. Rather, it’s because the vast majority of American college students, and thus most science majors, go to schools that are less selective than UT. Regarding the larger point — that black students fare better at "lesser" schools because their academic credentials are better matched to the curriculum — the evidence is mired in controversy. There is some scholarly research that backs up this point, but there is also scholarly research that refutes it. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-06492	Appalachian Power Company is making "record profits."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/14/ward-armstrong/ward-armstrong-says-appalachian-power-coompany-mak/	House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry, is seeking to turn his reelection bid this fall into a referendum on Appalachian Power Company, which has raised rates on his Southside constituents nine times in the past four years. The outspoken Democrat is in the fight of his 20-year public career. The GOP-controlled House drew new political maps earlier this year that put Armstrong in a district with a Republican incumbent, Del. Charles Poindexter of Franklin County. Armstrong was prepared for challenge, having amassed a sizable campaign treasury and seized a powerful issue. For more than a year, Armstrong has been calling for tougher regulation of Apco and accusing the utility of bilking customers during hard times. He has portrayed Poindexter, who has not joined the condemnation, as a friend of Apco. The minority leader amplified the theme in two recent TV commercials, charging Apco has been raising rates "even though they’re making record profits." Several readers questioned whether Apco really is making record profits, so we decided to take a look. PolitiFact Virginia tried several times to contact Armstrong or his campaign manager over the last week, but our phone calls were not returned. So we turned to one of the lawmaker’s web sites, called "No More Rate Hikes," where Armstrong lays out his case against Apco. Under a section titled "Record Profits," he cites three sets of statistics. Let’s examine each: 1. "Appalachian Power reported $3.3 billion in total revenues for fiscal year 2010 -- a $385.9 million, or 13.4 percent, increase from 2008." We found similar numbers and dates in annual reports that American Electric Power -- Apco’s corporate parent -- filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. But Armstrong’s use of the figures to prove record profits is misleading. The numbers are Apco’s gross revenues; they don’t include data that also show significant increases in the utility’s operating costs over the same three years. 2. "Appalachian Power reported $136.7 million in net income for fiscal year 2010 -- a $13.8 million, or 11.2 percent increase from 2008." Net income -- revenues minus expenses and losses -- is often used as a term for profit. Armstrong’s figures, while correct, do not prove Apco made record profits. We reviewed annual reports going back to 1998 and found Apco’s high-water mark for profits came in 2003, when it reported net income of $280 million, followed by 2002 when the company posted a $205 million gain. Apco’s average annual net income for the past 13 years is $143.4 million -- higher than the $136.7 million reported in 2010, the latest figure available. Apco’s average net income over the last four years -- when, as Armstrong notes in ads, the utility has been granted nine rate increases -- is $117.5 million, well below the utility’s 13-year average. 3. "Appalachian Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEP, which reported $14.4 billion in total revenues and $1.2 billion in net income for fiscal year 2010. American Electric Power has reported record net income over the last three years, although the $1.2 billion in 2010 was down from almost $1.4 billion nets the parent corporation reaped in 2008 and 2009. Apco -- which serves about 1 million customers in Southside and Southwest Virginia, as well as West Virginia and a small portion of Tennessee -- is one of six power companies owned by AEP. Although each entity keep its own books, there’s no doubt money flows through the corporate chain. Apco, for example, does not generate enough of its own power to meet demand and is required to buy electricity from other AEP companies. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has questioned whether the purchases amount to profits for other AEP entities. But Virginia regulators do not review the profits of the parent corporation or other subsidiaries when considering Apco’s requests for rate hikes. "We look at the entity that serves Virginia, and that’s Appalachian Power," said Andy Farmer, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission. Apco’s rates remained stable for decades, fueled by inexpensive coal burned in power plants in Ohio and West Virginia. But federal environmental regulations have tightened, forcing the company to spend $2 billion over the past five years to upgrade pollution controls. That, combined with a rise in the price of coal, has led to a 66 percent increase in Apco electric bills over the past six years. Two major bond rating agencies -- Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- put Apco’s credit on watch for a possible downgrade in 2008, saying the utility’s debt was rising faster than its cash flow. Fitch said Apco’s performance as an investment depended on the outcome of its rate increase requests. Apco’s credit stabilized in 2009 after receiving a $450 million infusion from its parent, AEP. Apco’s 5.45 percent return on equity between from 2008 to 2010 fell well short of the 10.53 percent the SCC has been willing to allow in setting Apco’s rates. This fall, the utility has four requests pending before the SCC that would hike residential electric bills by a total of 11 percent -- to about $105.09 a month for 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. The company is seeking an 11.15 percent return on equity. The SCC staff has recommended a base rate hike that would produce about half of the $68.5 million in new revenue Apco is requesting. Cuccinelli’s office has urged no base rate increase, saying Apco has room to lower its costs. By comparison, Dominion, Virginia’s largest electric utility, has a residential rate of $112.31 per kilowatt hour. Dominion is allowed an 11.9 percent return on equity. Our ruling: Armstrong has charged in ads that Apco, which has raised rates nine time during the last four years, is making record profits. Armstrong tries to support his statement on three legs but we find fault with each. His citing of Apco’s gross revenue is meaningless because they are not profits; his argument that Apco’s net income increased by 11.2 percent between 2008 and 2010 is misleading because profits in those years were less than half of the record set in 2003; and his emphasis on the record profits of corporate parent AEP is irrelevant because state regulators, in setting rates, focus only on Apco’s performance. Armstrong, a lawyer, has been poring over Apco’s finances for more than a year and it’s mind-boggling to suppose he's in the dark on these things. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

Mitt Romney claims Giuliani filed a lawsuit that killed the line item veto. That's true. In October 1997, Giuliani joined two labor unions and the Greater New York Hospital Association in challenging the line item veto in federal court after President Clinton nixed a provision of a budget bill that would have provided the city with as much as $2.6 billion in Medicaid funds. The Snake River Potato Growers in Idaho also challenged the law over a tax benefit that Clinton also line item vetoed. Giuliani and the others filing the suit argued—as opponents of the veto had for many years—that the Constitution required the president to either sign, veto or allow a bill to become law without his signature. The Constitution, they said, did not allow him to veto parts of a bill. The Supreme Court agreed and in June 1998, ruled that the line item veto was unconstitutional. Giuliani argues that he favors the line item veto and believes the Constitution should be amended to allow it, but he said the power cannot be created by passing a simple law. Romney is correct that Giuliani is guilty of having filed the lawsuit that killed the line item veto. But Romney neglects to say that Giuliani had several accomplices along with him.

pomt-03795	An annual income of $500,000 "in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/27/sal-albanese/does-earning-500000-manhattan-make-you-middle-clas/	How much can you make and still be middle class if you live in Manhattan? Sal Albanese, a Democratic former city councilman running to succeed New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, raised eyebrows with his thoughts on the number during a televised forum on March 24, 2013. Albanese made the claim as he was criticizing a municipal tax proposal offered by one of his rivals, Bill Thompson, the former city comptroller. "I disagree with Bill's proposal to tax people even more in the city," Albanese said, at times interrupted by cross-talk. "As I said, what's at stake -- in Manhattan, a half a million -- half a million more in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class." At this point, an off-screen voice shouted, "Half a million or more is not middle class!" To some laughter, MSNBC’s moderator, Chris Hayes, said that people "are really throwing things at the television when you say that." We knew that the cost of living in the Big Apple is high. But is it really true that that an annual income of half a million dollars a year in Manhattan only makes you middle class? Unfortunately, there is no official definition of "middle class." In fact, the phrase has such a mom-and-apple-pie ring to it that politicians have been using the term expansively for generations. But we’ll look at a few methods. One is to define the upper boundary of the middle class as twice the median income. Using demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we found that for Manhattan, the median income for all households was a little more than $66,000. Using this definition, the upper limit of the middle class would be $132,000 -- well short of $500,000. The second way is to break the population into three broad categories. The bottom fifth would be lower-income, the middle 60 percent would be middle-income, and the top fifth would be high-income. Census data shows that the someone who makes $200,000 ranks in the top 16 percent of Manhattan earners. So a household could make it into the top 20 percent with roughly $180,000 -- which once again is well short of $500,000. Just to be sure that Manhattan wasn’t an unusual case due to its high cost of living, we also tried to factor the Big Apple’s famously high costs. We used a city cost-of-living calculator provided by CNNMoney.com that accounts for the costs of food, housing, utilities, transportation and health care in different cities. The calculator allowed us to determine what income in other cities was equivalent to $500,000 in Manhattan. We found a handful of cities in which $500,000 in Manhattan money worked out to roughly $200,000 in local income -- Birmingham, Ala.; Tulsa, Okla.; Tampa; Cincinnati; Detroit; Charleston, W.Va.; Salt Lake City; Des Moines, Iowa; and Phoenix. Using Census data, we found that in each of these cities, the percentage of local households earning $200,000 ranged between 1 percent and 5 percent. This confirms that in this far-flung sampling of cities, earning the local equivalent of $500,000 in "Manhattan money" puts you in the top 5 percent of local earners. Even by the most generous definition, that’s not close to middle-class status. When we contacted Albanese’s campaign, a spokesman backed off the claim. Todd Brogan said Albanese got carried away during the televised appearance and defined middle class in a way he normally does not. "It was quite frankly, a gaffe," Brogan said. Brogan added that the campaign had not made its backtrack official until PolitiFact asked about it. Our ruling Albanese said that an annual income of $500,000 "in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class." In reality, the upper boundary of "middle class" in Manhattan is probably between $130,000 and $180,000, which is well short of the level Albanese cited (a level he later backed away from). We rate the claim False.	None	Sal Albanese	None	None	None	2013-03-27T13:32:49	2013-03-24	['Manhattan']

pomt-07161	"We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/13/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-says-todays-long-term-une/	During a June 12, 2011, face-off between party chairs on NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus compared the unemployment situation since the start of the past recent recession to what the nation faced during the Great Depression. Priebus invoked the Great Depression twice during the joint interview with Democratic counterpart, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida. The first instance came as Priebus was parrying questions about why he has failed to call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., after Vitter was implicated in a prostitution scandal. (The topic came up because the day before Meet the Press aired, Wasserman Schultz had been among several Democratic House leaders to call for the resignation of Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who is embroiled in a scandal for texting sexually suggestive photos to young women.) Priebus said, in part, "Look, I'm not defending these guys, but the fact of the matter is, we have big issues here to tackle in this country. We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression. We have gas prices that are out of this world. We have crushing debt. We know what's happening to this economy. And here's the problem. It's not so much as much as 'the economy, stupid,' as people say, it's 'the policy's stupid' too. And the president's policies in regard to saving this country, getting our economy back on track are not working." The second instance came when Priebus sought to counter Wasserman Schultz’s defense of President Barack Obama’s economic record. Addressing host David Gregory, Priebus said, "The chairwoman's living in Fantasyland. We know that the facts are the facts, and we can't get away from that. And Barack Obama is defenseless to the truth on what's going on in the American economy. We have lost as--two and a half million jobs since Barack Obama's been president. And of that two and a half million jobs, almost 45 percent of those people have been out of work for six months. That number, that number rivals the Great Depression." We perceive these two references to the Great Depression as related, but distinct, so we’ll take them in turn. First, is it fair to say that "we have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression"? As bad as the unemployment situation is currently -- and it’s unquestionably bad -- there’s little statistical support that it "rivals" the situation that existed during the Great Depression. Before we analyze this further, we will mention a caveat. The current system for measuring the unemployment rate began shortly after World War II. The methodology used during the Great Depression was similar, but not identical. One difference is that post-war statistics are available on a monthly basis, whereas Depression-era statistics are available only on an annual basis. Another is that the 1930’s data includes those age 14 and up, not 16 as today. We asked several economists whether the differences in methodology suggest that it’s inaccurate to compare the old-fashioned statistics to the current ones. They agreed that comparisons are appropriate as long as the differences are disclosed. So, what did the unemployment rate look like during the Great Depression? 1930: 8.7 percent 1931: 15.9 percent 1932: 23.6 percent 1933: 24.9 percent 1934: 21.7 percent 1935: 20.1 percent 1936: 16.9 percent 1937: 14.3 percent 1938: 19.0 percent 1939: 17.2 percent 1940: 14.6 percent 1941: 9.9 percent And how does that compare to today? The current monthly unemployment rate -- for May 2011 -- is 9.1 percent. Since the onset of the current recession in December 2007, unemployment has spiked as high as 10.1 percent, in October 2009. And the annual unemployment rates for 2009 and 2010 -- perhaps the closest analogue to the Depression-era statistics -- are 9.3 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. Any way you cut it, peak unemployment since the start of the most recent recession, as bad as it has been, remains well under half of the peak it reached during the Great Depression. For more than a decade, annual unemployment never fell below 14.3 percent, or a level about 40 percent higher than the worst of what we’ve seen recently. Any suggestion that the two situations are equivalent requires herculean cherry picking. So Priebus is wrong on the first claim. But what about the second -- that "almost 45 percent of (the unemployed) have been out of work for six months," a number that "rivals the Great Depression"? Priebus is correct on the current figure. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 45.1 percent of unemployed workers have been jobless for at least 27 weeks. That’s not the highest rate in recent months, but it’s in line with historically high levels. But Priebus’ comparison has a problem: We couldn’t find any equivalent data from the Great Depression, and the economists we spoke to weren’t aware of any either. The only place we saw this claim made came in a CBS News story from June 5, 2011, which said that "45.1 percent of all unemployed workers in this country have been jobless for more than six months -- a higher percentage than during the Great Depression." When we checked with the CBS reporter, Ben Tracy, he told us that there had been an error in the story due to some garbled relaying of information and that a corrected version of the story had been ordered. At PolitiFact, our policy is that citing a news account does not protect a statement from being ruled False if it turns out that news account is inaccurate. When we contacted the RNC, we were told that the notion that unemployment "rivals the Great Depression" is valid since there are 13.9 million unemployed Americans today, according to BLS, compared to a maximum of 12.8 million unemployed Americans during the Great Depression, specifically in 1933. "‘Rivals’ would be the right characterization," the RNC said in a statement. "Chairman Priebus did not cite the ‘unemployment rate," as PolitiFact did in its query. But we think this is a ridiculous comparison, since the population of the United States was 123 million then, compared to nearly 309 million today. On the second point, the RNC said it had been referring to the CBS News story, but also pointed to a 1984 paper from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that said that "the 1981-82 recession resulted in levels of long-term unemployment far higher than any experienced since the Great Depression," specifically 25.7 percent. In an e-mail to PolitiFact, the RNC argued that "today, chronic unemployment of 27 weeks or longer is 45.1 percent. As BLS itself cited the Great Depression in talking about a chronic unemployment rate almost half of what it is today, we think it’s more than fair for Chairman Priebus to make the Great Depression comparison in reference to today’s numbers." We disagree. Just because BLS in 1984 said that the 1981-1982 recession "resulted in levels of long-term unemployment far higher than any experienced since the Great Depression" doesn’t mean that nearly doubling the rate brings it to levels that "rival" the Great Depression. The fact that the recent recession was the worst since the Great Depression doesn't mean that it "rivals" the Great Depression in severity. The fact is, the RNC can’t point to any statistic that makes its point. Maybe it’s true, but with the disappearance of the erroneous CBS report, there is no evidence for it. More broadly, both liberal and conservative economists expressed skepticism about Priebus’ comparison of the recent recession and the Great Depression. "The pre-World War II statistics are, at best, very sketchy, so people have a lot of ability to make claims that are hard to verify or debunk," said Daniel Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. He added that, in his view, "the unemployment rate assertion seems a bit farfetched. I suppose Priebus also could be looking at the broader measures of unemployment, some of which have been north of 15 percent for quite some time. But we don't have any comparable figures for the 1930s, so that's uncharted territory." Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, agreed that he sees no "sound factual basis" for either of Priebus’ two claims. However, he said it’s important to remember that the statistics we have suggest that the most recent recession has been the worst since the Great Depression. So where does this leave us? Today’s jobs picture is the worst it has been in decades, not just measured by unemployment rates but also by duration of unemployment. However, all of the available statistics -- imperfect though they may be -- suggest that today’s numbers aren’t anywhere near high enough to "rival" those that prevailed for more than a decade during the Great Depression. We rate Priebus’ statement False.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2011-06-13T15:28:39	2011-06-12	['None']

pomt-13146	"One of George Soros' companies has provided some of the (voting) machines" for some states.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/31/sean-duffy/wisconsin-congressman-fuels-soros-voting-machine-r/	How do you spread a rumor without taking responsibility for spreading it? By saying you don’t vouch for its accuracy — yet. That’s what Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., did on CNN on the topic of vote rigging. In an interview on the Situation Room, Duffy said he didn’t have evidence of "widespread problems across the country," but he went out of his way to relay some troubling reports. "Articles that I have read, I haven't verified them," Duffy told host Wolf Blitzer on Oct. 27, 2016. "But we heard that one of George Soros' companies has provided some of the machines for some of these states. And, obviously, Mr. Soros leans left. I haven't personally verified that yet." Duffy’s comment is notable because the claim had been debunked a week before he appeared on CNN by Snopes, and again three days before by the Washington Post. The claim about billionaire Soros emerged on several conservative websites. One Daily Caller report said, "Smartmatic, a U.K.-based voting technology company with deep ties to George Soros, has provided voting technology in 16 states including battleground zones like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia." The article noted that Smartmatic stated on its website that it "will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential elections." That nuance was lost on many people. More than 125,000 signed a petition posted Oct. 21, 2016, on the White House website that said, "We the people ask Congress to meet in emergency session about removing George Soros-owned voting machines from 16 states." To be clear, abundant evidence shows that Soros owns no voting machines in the United States. To go further, the link between Soros and Smartmatic is gossamer thin. Company CEO Antonio Mugica and chairman Lord Mark Malloch-Brown said in a statement, "George Soros has zero ownership or involvement in our company. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country and it abides by a strict code of ethics that forbids the company from donating to any political campaigns of any kind." The one connection between Soros and Malloch-Brown is that Malloch-Brown sits on the global board of Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Malloch-Brown is a former minister of State in the British cabinet and, as the Smartmatic website stated, he is a member of "a number of non-profit boards addressing global issues from poverty reduction to conflict resolution." On top of all this, no state is using Smartmatic machines in this election. The Verified Voting Foundation, a group founded by a Stanford computer scientist to promote accuracy in voting, tracks all companies that provide voting equipment in the United States. Smartmatic has no such equipment in any state. (Hat-tip to Snopes, the internet rumor-zapping website that first dug into this.) The Utah Republican Party used a Smartmatic system in the 2016 primary, and Los Angeles County tested one element for provisional and mail-in ballots. All of this information was available before Duffy’s interview. (In addition to Snopes and the Washington Post, investigative journalism website ProPublica also debunked the idea.) Duffy’s communications director Mark Bednar said, "Congressman Duffy didn't claim anything in particular and merely spoke about what people have been recently discussing throughout the nation." Our ruling Duffy said that there were unverified reports that a George Soros company was providing voting machines in certain states. In the week before Duffy said that, those reports had been fully discredited three times. Soros owns no company that offers voting machines, and the company named in the rumor has no voting machines in the United States. To call a baseless rumor "unverified" after it has been thoroughly debunked twists the meaning of the word.

pomt-09680	Obama has admitted a cap and trade plan would cause electricity bills to "skyrocket."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/16/sarah-palin/obama-said-cap-and-trade-would-increase-electricit/	In her new book, Going Rogue , Sarah Palin said President Barack Obama's support for a cap and trade plan was "misguided." "The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.' Sadly, those hit hardest will be those who are already struggling to make ends meet," she wrote. Here, we're looking at Obama's comments on electricity bills. First, though, here's a quick summary of cap and trade for those who aren't famliar with it: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies can buy and sell the credits as necessary to conduct their business. We were familiar with Obama's original quote from his campaign for president. It came from a videotaped interview he did with the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board very early in the campaign in January 2008. "Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket," Obama told the Chronicle . "Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers." Obama also said the biggest challenge would be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary. "The problem is, can you get the American people to say this is really important," Obama said. Obama was talking in general about cap and trade, but there is now a specific bill making its way through Congress, written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. The latest version of the bill includes a number of measures to offset higher utility bills for consumers. Revenue from the permits would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say. There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. So the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the Chronicle nearly two years ago. Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would "necessarily skyrocket," and because Palin got Obama's words right, we give Palin a True.

pomt-01605	Pinnacle Overlook in Southwest Virginia is "closer to eight other state capitals than to Richmond."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/sep/01/tim-kaine/kaine-gets-b-his-own-geography-quiz/	Sen. Tim Kaine tweeted out a geography quiz on a recent visit to Southwestern Virginia. "When I stood at Pinnacle Overlook above the Cumberland Gap today, I was closer to 8 other state capitals than to Richmond," Kaine wrote on Aug. 20. "Can you name them?" The Pinnacle Overlook is part of the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park in the Southwest corner of Virginia. Sitting 2,440 feet high, it offers scenic views of three states: Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. Jon Baliles, the first district city councilman in Richmond, took up Kaine’s challenge and on Twitter rattled off a list of state capitals that are closer to the overlook than Richmond: Frankfort, Ky.; Nashville, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta; Columbia, S.C.; Indianapolis; Raleigh, N.C.; and Charleston, W.V. Kaine sent a congratulatory tweet to Baliles. "Well done! You got them all," Kaine wrote. We took the quiz, too, and got a different answer. There were actually nine state capitals that were closer to where Kaine was standing than Richmond. The senator and the councilman omitted Montgomery, Ala.

pomt-14585	Says Goldman Sachs CEO said Congress would "have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/05/bernie-sanders/sanders-points-goldman-sachs-ceo-evidence-wall-str/	In front of a cheering audience in Keene, N.H., on Tuesday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sounded some familiar themes: reducing income inequality and increasing access to health care and education. During his speech at the Colonial Theatre in the college town, Sanders also focused on Wall Street banks, which he blamed for harming the economy. He highlighted the leadership of one firm in particular. "Two years ago, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, who himself is a billionaire, came to Washington and said, ‘You know what, you in Congress are going to have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations,’" Sanders said. In the context of the candidate’s stump speech, he was trying to point out how financiers were out to undercut everyday Americans. (At the Jan. 17 debate, Sanders made a different, shorter version of the statement, which was dinged by Politifact Texas.) But was his statement in Keene true? Did the leader of Goldman Sachs actually make a statement to that effect? We decided to check it out. When asked for supporting documentation, the Sanders campaign passed along a number of articles about Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein’s efforts in 2012 to push the U.S. Congress and President Obama toward a deal averting the so-called fiscal cliff. In case you’ve forgotten, the fiscal cliff was the combination of automatic tax increases -- some $500 billion -- and spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2013. Most economists agreed that the cliff would cause a brief recession, which business leaders were keen to avoid. What was Blankfein’s role in this? According to the Washington Post, he and other executives who were part of a group called Fix the Debt held private meetings with legislators and the president on Nov. 28, 2012. "The group’s chief executives include such corporate leaders as Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Mark Bertolini of Aetna," the Post wrote. So Sanders’s timing is off. Blankfein wasn’t in Washington doing such lobbying two years ago; he was actually there more than three years ago. But what about the senator’s claim that the executive warned of the need for entitlement program cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy? FIx the Debt’s aims in 2012 were, broadly speaking, to encourage lawmakers to both restrain grown in entitlement spending and change the tax code to bring in more revenue. According to the Post, some members of the group also advocated for cutting corporate taxes and taxes on overseas profits for businesses. But Sanders didn’t talk about Fix the Debt, or about the other members of the group. He mentioned Blankfein specifically. So what was the CEO thinking in late 2012? There are no transcripts of what was said during the private meetings, but Sanders’s campaign sent along an excerpt from a Blankfein appearance on the CBS Evening News from Nov. 19, 2012. And during an interview with anchor Scott Pelley, the financier made it clear that his position was nuanced. Overall, he said, entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid would need to be altered. "The retirement age has to be changed, maybe some of the benefits have to be affected, maybe some of the inflation adjustments have to be revised," he said. "But in general, entitlements have to be slowed down and contained." Blankfein wasn’t calling for outright cuts to these programs. He was asking that their growth be slowed, something that other politicians have proposed. Even President Obama at one point offered a proposal slowing the growth of Social Security payments. That said, reasonable people can -- and do -- disagree about whether slowing the growth of a government program amounts to a cut. Meanwhile, the CEO also called for the wealthy to pay more in taxes -- a concept Sanders agrees with. BLANKFEIN: In the long run, there has to be more revenue. And, of course, the burden of that revenue will be disproportionately taken up by wealthier people. That's just logical. PELLEY: So higher taxes on wealthier people? BLANKFEIN: More taxes on wealthier people, to the extent that we need to raise more revenue, and we do need to raise some more revenue. Blankfein didn’t address corporate taxes in the interview. But in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Nov. 13, 2012, he called for businesses to work with government to lower those tax rates, noting that President Obama also supported the move. Sanders’s campaign highlighted Blankfein’s membership in the Business Roundtable group, which just last year supported a number of proposals to lower and reform business taxes. Our ruling Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told an audience in Keene that the CEO of Goldman Sachs said that Congress would "have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations." Goldman’s CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, did call for slowing the growth of entitlement spending, which may -- or may not -- legitimately be called a "cut." The CEO also supported lowering corporate taxes, though Sanders leaves out that he also said taxes would likely need to be raised on the wealthiest people to create more revenue. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-05T18:34:57	2016-02-02	['United_States_Congress', 'Medicare_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']

pomt-07400	On redistricting.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/29/richard-saslaw/dick-saslaw-said-senate-would-not-alter-its-redist/	As is almost always the case with a legislature divided, this year’s General Assembly redistricting process was agonizing and fraught with drama. The legislature’s first stab at new election maps was vetoed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. He said districts proposed for the state Senate did not pass constitutional muster for compactness and preserving the concept of one-man, one-vote. The plan, which the chamber’s Democratic majority drew, would have lumped four Republican senators into two districts. McDonnell said little about about the portion of the bill that set new districts for the House of Delegates. That plan, drawn by the House Republican majority, squeezed several Democrats out of their districts, including Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry. House Republican responded to the governor’s overall veto by saying they would tweak their part of the redistricting plan. But Senate Democrats were defiant. "We are not going to change one period or one comma," Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, declared on April 16. Saslaw said the Senate plan was constitutional and threatened to take the matter to court. Now, fast forward to April 27, when legislators reached a tentative deal on a new plan leaving Democrats in control of the Senate, but unlike the original plan, weakening their chances of adding to the 22-18 majority. Confronted with his original statement of stubbornness, Saslaw conceded that plenty of periods and commas had been changed in those two weeks and he’d changed his tune. "I lied," he joked. "It was an unrealistic choice of words ... both sides gave a little." Well, that makes our life easy. In the heat of battle, the ever-fiery Saslaw was obstinate and braced for tough negotiations. But in the end, cooler heads prevailed and he acknowledged that his remarks had been bombast. Still, it represents a 180-degree reversal. Full Flop!

pomt-14246	"Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels."	true	/texas/statements/2016/apr/12/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-wind-power-cheaper-texas-power-d/	Barack Obama, exhorting Dallas Democrats during a March 2016 Texas swing, called Republican claims that the country and planet are in sorry shape a "false narrative." "America is pretty darn great right now," the Democratic president said. And among great things, Obama said, Democrats believe in science and that climate change is real -- and that wind is a better bargain in Texas than traditional oil and gas. Come again? "Right now, here in Texas," Obama said, "wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels." Wind power sure has sizzle. In 2015, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found Mostly True Obama’s claim that "America is No. 1 in wind power." China led in overall wind-power capacity but the U.S. was generating more electricity from the wind. Earlier, in 2010, we rated True a declaration that Texas had "installed more wind power than any other state, and all but four countries." As of 2009, Texas boasted 9,410 megawatts of wind power — enough to power two million homes. More recently, FactCheck.org, based at the University of Pennsylvania, dug into Obama’s claim in his 2016 State of the Union address that "in fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power." Nationally, average coal and gas prices were running less than average wind power costs. Yet in Iowa and Texas, wind energy proved cheaper, according to an Energy Information Administration analyst. Meantime, an American Wind Energy Association blog post talking up Obama’s Iowa-Texas SOTU claim noted a 2015 study by Lazard LLC, a financial services firm, stating the cost of wind production in Texas, not counting government subsidies, runs from $36 to $51 per megawatt-hour while an average national cost for coal-fired electricity ranges from $65 to $150 per MWh and for gas, depending on the type of plant, from $52/MWh to $218/MWh. White House cites DOE report We asked the White House about the basis of Obama’s statement in Dallas. By email, spokesman Frank Benenati said a federal report shows that in 2014, the "average executed price of wind power purchase agreements" was $23.50 per MWh and according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a non-governmental outfit, "the levelized cost of energy from wind in Iowa and Texas, even without subsidies, is lower than the" levelized cost of energy "of coal at $59/MWh." Congress in 2015 extended the federal Production Tax Credit for five years. That action, recapped in North American Wind Power, means "wind developers" get a credit of $23 per MWh for electricity generated to the power grid though the credit is set to diminish from 2017 through 2019. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest annual report on wind technologies, which affirms Texas as the No. 1 wind-power state, states that based on research compiled by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the "national average levelized price of wind PPAs," or Power Purchase Agreements, "that were signed in 2014 (and that are within the Berkeley Lab sample) fell to around $23.50/MWh nationwide—a new low, but admittedly focused on a sample of projects that largely hail from the lowest-priced Interior region of the country." Absent from the report: A direct wind-to-fossil-fuel cost comparison, though the report says that based on the agency’s sample, "wind PPA prices are most competitive with wholesale power prices in the Interior region. The average price stream of wind PPAs executed in 2013 or 2014 also compares favorably to a range of projections of the fuel costs of gas-fired generation extending out through 2040." The Interior region takes in the middle-of-the-country states running north from the Texas-Mexico border to Canada. Levelized costs represent the per-MWh cost (in inflation-adjusted dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle, the EIA says, counting capital and fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs, financing costs and "an assumed utilization rate for each plant type." So, Obama’s claim has a basis. Still, the report also cautions against comparing long-time purchase agreement prices for wind with shorter-term fluctuating prices of electricity from fossil fuels like coal. An "important note" says the presented prices don’t reflect "the full social costs of power generation and delivery." That is, the report says, the cited wind purchase agreement prices are driven down by federal and, sometimes, state tax and financial incentives. Also, the wind prices don’t "fully reflect integration, resource adequacy or transmission costs," the report says. On the other hand, the note continues, "wholesale electricity prices (or fuel cost projections) do not fully reflect transmission costs, may not fully reflect capital and fixed operating costs and are reduced by virtue of any financial incentives provided to fossil-fueled generation and its fuel production cycle as well as by not fully accounting for the environmental and social costs of that generation." "In addition, wind PPA prices—once established—are fixed and known, whereas wholesale electricity prices are short term and therefore subject to change over time," the note says. "Finally, the location of the wholesale electricity nodes and the assumption of a flat block of power are not perfectly consistent with the location and output profile of the sample of wind power projects. In short, comparing levelized long-term wind PPA prices with either yearly wholesale electricity prices or forecasts of the fuel costs of natural gas-fired generation is not appropriate if one’s goal is to account fully for the costs and benefits of wind energy relative to its competition. Nonetheless, these comparisons still provide some sense for the short-term competitive environment facing wind energy, and how that environment has shifted with time." Energy department cites Bloomberg report Like Benenati, Dawn Selak, an energy department spokeswoman, told us the estimated cost of coal in 2015 was around $59/MWh, a figure she attributed to Bloomberg research. So, Selak said, "the cost of wind (including in Texas) is less than the cost of coal even with the $23/MWh" tax credit factored in. In a February 2016 report prepared for the pro-wind-power Business Council for Sustainable Energy, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said: "Wind in Texas is among the cheapest in the country, with an unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity of around $50/MWh, due to high capacity factors (>50%) and low cost to build." Capacity factor refers to the share of time a turbine (or plant) is actively generating power. A Bloomberg analyst, Stephen Munro, told us by phone and email that Obama was essentially correct per the latest costs of wind power generation in the Texas Panhandle. "Since 2013," Munro wrote, "we have observed that the cost of new Power Purchase Agreements for wind energy has fallen below the average around-the-clock wholesale prices in the wholesale pool that covers much of the wind power generation in the Panhandle. Average around-the-clock wholesale prices include power generated from fossil fuels, renewable sources and uranium. "As of the second half of 2015," Munro wrote, "we observed a levelised cost of power of $43/MWh in PPAs for wind in the utility region including much of the Texas Panhandle." In comparison, Munro said, coal-fired electricity was costing $74.70 per MWh in most of East Texas and the Panhandle as well as Kansas plus parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana. Munro said the wholesale price of wind-fueled power is "notably lower" in the Panhandle and other parts of the region "because that region features an extraordinary wind resource and because the costs of land and construction are lower than elsewhere. Developers have taken advantage of this to install advanced, large capacity turbines." That is, it’s way windy a lot up over there, we (or maybe someone from Fort Worth) would put it. Texas analysts We also ran Obama’s statement past a staff spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the flow of electricity to most Texans. By email, Robbie Searcy said she’d grant the claim credence. a Mostly True rating. "Within the ERCOT real-time wholesale energy market," Searcy said, "all generation that is used in any interval technically clears at the same price, which is the highest price of all resources used to serve demand in each load zone at that time. During periods of high wind output," she said, "wind generation resources are able to offer power into the market at very low, and sometimes negative, prices. This in turn drives down the settlement point prices for all resources operating during those intervals, especially when demand is low." At our request, Searcy emailed a chart showing wind, coal and natural gas electricity "price offers" in ERCOT’s market at 7 a.m. Jan. 22, 2016. At that time, the chart indicates, coal and gas offers were priced higher than wind. She said the date was the most recent day of available public data when we inquired and agency experts chose the hour to reflect the period when demand, and therefore generation, peaked. Searcy said wholesale market prices at 7 a.m. that day were "about $26.70 per MWh on average among all resources used at the time." At that time, she said, average offers from gas-fired power producers were $23.37/MWh compared to $14.14 per MWh for coal and a negative $23.89 for wind power. (Perhaps wind power producers could afford that thanks to the federal subsidy.) Searcy said too it’s worth remembering that when "we talk about natural gas-fired resources, that covers a broad range of technologies and efficiency levels, from older steam units to more modern combined-cycle units to quick-start combustion turbines." The case for coal Even if Texas wind power may be cheaper for electricity than traditional fuels, other authorities told us there’s at least one smart reason to keep the other fuels handy. Winds can die down, keeping turbines from spinning. At the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas producers, Lauren Hamner, spokeswoman for Commissioner Christi Craddick, said by email that it’s worth remembering a coal-fired plant is capable of running longer at all hours than a breeze-dependent wind turbine -- so power capacity, she said, should be folded into any comparison. Similarly, Russ Keene, Austin-based spokesman for the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition, which says it represents consumers and coal producers, transporters and industrial users, pointed out a June 2015 study by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Energy Research, a free-market think tank. The study seems an outlier in saying that when "all known costs" are considered, the average U.S. cost of producing electricity from established coal-fired plants is far less than new wind-power generation. Still, we asked its lead author, Tom Stacy, to evaluate Obama’s claim. By email, Stacy said the president didn’t acknowledge that an established plant fueled by coal, gas or nuclear power can be available at all hours and that’s just not so for wind-dependent generators. It stands to reason, he indicated, that wind-generated electricity can’t (or shouldn’t) be price-compared to electricity generated by fossil fuels or nuclear sources. Availability at all times aside, we wondered, is it also so that wind-fueled power is lately cheaper in Texas than power drawn from fossil fuels? "And dog meat in China is cheaper than Kobe beef in NYC," Stacy wrote, "but it isn't the same thing, is it?" Our ruling Obama, in Dallas, said: "Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels." Wind-generated electricity is offered for sale in Texas at lower prices than power fired by coal or natural gas. Unsaid: wind power, unlike electricity fueled by oil or gas, isn’t always available.

pomt-07141	Says President Barack Obama "has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-barack-obama-has-raised-stop-si/	During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Sen. Rick Santorum blasted President Barack Obama’s policies on oil drilling. Santorum said that Obama "has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, and that is depressing. We need to drill. We need to create energy jobs." We took a look at a similar statement in March, when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- another GOP presidential contender -- told an audience at a conservative conference that "the number of new drilling permits under the Obama Administration since they came into office" is "one." We ruled that statement Pants on Fire. We’ll refer back to our discussion of that claim here, updating it with more current information. The most recent summary from Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE -- the federal agency that oversees drilling -- is included in a document titled the "Status of Well Permits and Plans Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements." The report says that 56 shallow-water permits for new wells have been issued since June 8, 2010, when new rules and information requirements were put into effect following the BP oil spill. Shallow-water drilling operations were not affected by the deep-water drilling moratorium following the spill. In addition, since February of this year -- following the lifting of the moratorium and confirmation of the industry's ability to meet subsea containment requirements -- the government has approved 48 deep-water permits requiring subsea containment, covering 16 unique wells. Another 40 permits not requiring subsea containment have also been approved since October. The operators were required to come back and meet the modified standards. So there’s been movement on offshore permits in the Gulf of Mexico under Obama. What about drilling elsewhere? Arctic Ocean exploratory drilling permits continue to wend their way through the permitting process at the Department of Interior, said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. A chart from BOEMRE confirms that no new offshore wells have been drilled in Alaska since Obama took office. However, only one such well has been drilled in the past dozen years, including eight years when a Republican, George W. Bush was president. So the shortage of drilling in Alaska is not exclusively an Obama-related problem. Obama did announce in May that he was directing the Interior Department to conduct annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. He also ordered a speed-up of seismic surveys of mid- and south-Atlantic coasts and new incentives for industry to develop unused leases both on and offshore. We should note that while drilling permits haven’t disappeared entirely, the pace of approval has slowed, in large part because Obama has made clear that he wants drilling to be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive fashion. Lee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said in March that there has been a "molasses effect" with permitting by the Obama Administration. Even shallow-water permits have fallen from their prior level, despite not being directly affected by the post-spill moratorium. Meanwhile, permits for deep-water wells are likely to be a third of what was projected prior to the gulf spill. Andy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, agreed that permit approvals dropped after the BP spill, but he added in March that the pace of permitting was picking up. "We'll get to the new normal eventually," he said. All in all, then, Santorum’s claim is incorrect. "None of this could be accurately even remotely characterized as a ‘stop sign,’" said Charter of Defenders of Wildlife. We agree. It’s true that the Obama Administration pulled back the reins after the BP spill. But the administration has continued approving shallow-water wells, and it began to approve deep-water wells again after the moratorium was lifted six months ago. Just because the pace isn’t as fast as some would like doesn’t mean that Obama "has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska." At most, it would be a yellow light, and Santorum’s claim -- referring to curbs on "any kind" of exploration -- is over-broad. So we rate Santorum’s claim False.

pomt-01278	Dave Brat said "the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/02/jack-trammell/trammell-brat-says-seniors-should-get-back-what-on/	Democratic Congressional candidate Jack Trammell says David Brat, his GOP opponent, is proposing to cut Social Security benefits. "David said the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more," Trammell says in a TV ad. Trammell and Brat are facing off for the 7th Congressional District seat, previously held by Eric Cantor. Libertarian James Carr is also in the race. With the election looming, we thought Trammell’s statement was worth reviewing. When we asked for proof that Brat made the statement, Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for Trammell, pointed us to a May video of Brat addressing the Mechanicsville Tea Party. Brat said Social Security and other programs need big cuts: "And it’s not just little marginal changes, right, in order to avoid those insolvency issues with Medicare and Social Security, you’re going to have to do some major cuts," Brat told the crowd. "And so that’s what politicians aren’t willing to say, right? We’re going to have to take some bad medicine coming up. And so we’re going to at least have to just balance the budget." Brat went on to say people will have to work longer before receiving benefits from the major federal entitlement programs. "And then you’re going to have to increase the working age, right? Social Security and Medicare and these weren’t intended to be retirement programs. These were intended to be disaster prevention for seniors, and I’m all for that. Right? But it’s in the worst case scenario. It’s not been 65, get to retirement – the average death age back then was 65, so it broke even. Now the average death age is 80. Right? So can you pay everyone in the country a huge chunk of money for 15 additional years? No. That’s why it’s insolvent. That’s the beginning." We also found a video of Brat answering questions after a speech at Life Church in Mechanicsville in April. A man in the audience noted the Social Security Disability Trust Fund is expected to be depleted in 2016 if Congress doesn’t take steps to foster it, and he asked Brat what his response would be if benefits were cut. Brat: My general answer is we have to do what’s fair. Right? And so, you put together a graph or a chart and you go out to the American people and you go to the podium and you say, ‘This is what you put in, on average. This is what you get out, on average.’ Currently, seniors are getting about $3 out of all of the programs for every $1 they put in. So, in general, I think you’ve got to go to the American people and just be honest with them and say, "Here’s what fairness would look like." So maybe in the next 10 years, we have to grandfather some folks in, but basically we’re going to move in a direct line toward fairness and we have to live within our means. Questioner: Fairness in that sense is defined as you get what is coming in and no more? Brat: Right. That’s what I’m aiming at. The questioner noted that would lead to benefits cuts in the disability program he cited. Brat: Right and I wouldn’t want that to impact people without it being announced. But that’s the downside of -- it’s not my fault that we’re there, right? It’s the current folks’ fault that we’re there, so my answer is I would never have let us get into that place in the first place. So that’s – what would you do – when Congress is about to hit a brick wall, what would you do? I mean, hit the brakes or something. On Brat’s basic point, the 2014 Social Security trustees’ report says that the retirement piece of the program now uses more than just the designated tax income and will run out of reserves to redeem and pay for the entire entitlement in 2033. Flowers, Trammell’s spokeswoman, said Brat’s position has changed over time as he moderated his message for the general election. But he certainly showed support for grandfathering in the April talk and reiterated it in a June interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "We must keep our promise to seniors who are near retirement or are already receiving benefits," Brat told the Times-Dispatch Editorial Board. "Virginians who entrusted their hard-earned money to the Social Security trust fund must receive the benefits to which they are entitled. For younger Virginians, entitlement reform is critical in order to ensure the solvency of Medicare and Social Security." In a recent article, Brat said he supported raising the retirement age by five years. Trammell said he would be willing to raise it by two years. Here’s what Gottstein told us Brat supports: A grandfather clause for those 10 years or less from retirement; A gradual increase in the eligibility age for receiving benefits for those farther than 10 years from retirement; Emphasis on stopping and punishing fraud; Reduced federal spending across the board. "When Dr. Brat talks about fairness, he's talking about being fair to existing generations AND to future generations," Gottstein said in an email. "’Grandfathering’ is one way to be fair to our seniors and the nearly-retired. But he also talks about how we have to fairly treat current workers who are contributing to the system by ensuring that the money THEY invest is there for their retirement." Our ruling Trammell says Brat said "the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more." Trammell tries a typical scare tactic -- attacking a Republican as threatening to cut seniors’ benefits. But his campaign didn’t provide examples of Brat making that actual claim, and Brat’s support of the idea of grandfathering today’s seniors -- and those retiring within 10 years -- would protect them. Brat opened the door to some speculation about his views by making open-ended statements about reforming Social Security during the GOP primary this spring. But Trammell has gone overboard in interpreting them and putting words in Brat’s mouth. We rate Trammell’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-06840	Says Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/05/buddy-roemer/obama-submitted-budgets/	Former Louisiana Congressman and Governor Buddy Roemer has been out of politics for a long time but he still knows how to throw a jab. Perhaps best known for switching parties from Democratic to Republican as governor in 1991, Roemer left politics some 16 years ago to work as a banker. Now, he’s back as a populist GOP presidential candidate who says he's fed up with special interest money. A couple of days before announcing his bid, Roemer squared off on President Barack Obama. "Someday, somehow, somewhere, sometime, the president of the United States and his party have to be responsible for running the country," said Roemer, 67, at a press conference in Bedford, N.H. He continued: "I am embarrassed that two and a half years into his [President Obama's] term in office he's never submitted a budget. You know Congress has worked two years without passing a budget." His pronouncement was startling. No budget? What has the president been doing up there in Oval Office? Asked to back this statement up with facts, the Roemer campaign declined to comment. So we turned to the experts, checking the public record and reaching out to five economists across the political spectrum. Not true, they all say. As per law, Obama has submitted a budget for each fiscal year he’s been president -- fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to a quick check on the Government Printing Office’s website, where the documents are posted. It’s as simple as that. But regarding Roemer’s second claim-- that Congress has worked for two years without adopting a budget -- budget experts say Roemer has a point. Congress last adopted a budget resolution in fiscal year 2010. It neglected to do so in fiscal year 2011 and appears unlikely to agree on a budget framework for the next fiscal year, 2012, which begins Oct. 1, said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. The budget resolution sets spending limits for broad categories of funding and is usually the first step for Congress in adopting a budget. The budget resolutions are important "organization and enforcement documents" to guide Congress through achieving most of what’s in the president’s budget, Ellis said. Without a budget resolution, "it makes it harder to enact spending bills because you don’t know exactly what the bottom line is," Ellis said. "It’s not a good way to govern. It makes it a lot harder to hammer out a deal." After the president’s budget is submitted, House and Senate budget committees are supposed to draft budget resolutions, frameworks intended to guide the spending process, which then go to the floor for approval. Once adopted, the two resolutions go to a House and Senate conference committee, where they are reconciled and sent back to the respective chambers for final approval. But that process hasn't been working. In 2010, the then Democratic-controlled House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution or adopt a single spending bill "because the Democrats were afraid of being labeled big spenders," Ellis said. In April, 2011, without a budget resolution, Congress, with the House controlled by Republicans, agreed to a spending bill for fiscal 2011 in order to avoid a government shutdown. That bill provides funding through the end of September, 2011. The budget resolution provides the blueprint for such legislative activity but it’s not necessary to the process, said Jim Horney, an economist with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "While (Congress) did not agree on a budget resolution … it did of course, pass those appropriations and other budget legislation for fiscal year 2011 and is working on legislation for 2012," Horney wrote in an e-mail. And this year, it appears again unlikely that Congress will adopt a budget resolution. The now GOP-controlled House approved its budget resolution -- commonly referred to as the Paul Ryan Plan after its principal author, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House budget committee -- which Democrats consider "draconian," Ellis said. The Senate Budget Committee unveiled a framework in early July, 2011, but the Senate has not yet approved any resolution. And it appears the adoption of a budget resolution has been overtaken by events, Ellis said. The debt ceiling plan approved by Congress will establish a discretionary spending cap, which is much of what would be accomplished by a budget resolution. Sen. Kent Conrad, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, acknowledged as much in the conclusion of his budget framework address on the Senate floor on July 11, 2011. Conrad said: "That is the blueprint the Senate Budget Committee Democrats are laying before our colleagues. We are under no illusions. We know this is a year in which the normal process is not being followed. We understand there are leadership negotiations at the highest level, so we understand this is not going to be dealt with in the normal course of doing business." Our Ruling Roemer erred in saying Obama had not submitted a budget. In fact, he’s submitted three. But there is some truth on the second part of his statement. Congress didn't pass either a budget resolution or a spending bill in 2009 and 2010. A last minute spending bill finally passed in April 2011 under the threat of a government shutdown. And, since then, the passage of the debt ceiling increase has made the passage of a budget resolution for the current fiscal year less pressing. Taken in the context of his remarks, Roemer’s assertion implies that Obama and the Democrats have been irresponsible -- and as a result, there has been no budget for the last two years. Obama submitted budgets, but it is true that during 2009 and 2010, when Democrats controlled the Congress, no budget was passed. As a result, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-10692	"A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the USDA ... But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/10/hillary-clinton/a-legitimate-beef-with-ham-sandwich-regulations/	In a speech in Shenandoah, Iowa, Clinton made a campaign issue out of a ham and cheese sandwich. She said the federal government "is not taking the steps necessary to protect us" because of inadequate inspections of toys and food. She cited this example: "A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects manufacturers daily. But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects manufacturers about once every five years." To find out if her sandwich example was correct, we turned to government reports on food safety, interviewed the head of the USDA's food inspection service and studied the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, a fascinating manual that provides rules for Wiener schnitzel ("a veal cutlet prepared by dipping in egg, flour and bread crumbs, and frying to a golden brown") and vinegar pickle ("sausage in vinegar pickle is approved with the understanding that sausage is completely covered with pickle and that the pickle has a pH level not higher than 4.5"). The manual also spells out which foods are under USDA jurisdiction. We found that Clinton is correct about the regulation of sandwiches and the big disparity in inspections by the two agencies. In an interview with PolitiFact last week, Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged that the sandwich rule is silly. "There is no rationale or logic that I can explain to anybody," he said. "It defies logic." He said the rules don't affect the safety of the nation's food supply, but said, "it's an issue that makes it look like we don't know what we're doing." Raymond didn't know the origin of the sandwich rule, but others suggested that the volume of meat might have been the key factor in whether it was FDA or USDA jurisdiction. (The rule only applies to plants that assemble sandwiches for retail stores like 7-Elevens. Sandwiches made-to-order at a deli or a Subway store are not subject to the inspections, Raymond said.) To understand the strange bureaucratic turf of food inspections, you have to go back to the 1906 publication of Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle , which described horrific conditions at meat plants. That book, still required reading in many high school English classes, had such impact that it persuaded Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt to enact a law requiring meat inspections. Roosevelt had called for a law that would require oversight "from the hoof to the can." Since then, the government has put considerable emphasis on meat and poultry, which fall under the USDA. The agency's 7,500 inspectors and veterinarians conduct continuous daily inspections of the nation's meat and poultry plants. The law requires USDA inspections before the products can be sold. But other foods have not gotten the same scrutiny. Most are regulated by the FDA, but the law does not mandate inspection frequencies, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. The report confirms that Clinton is correct that, on average, the FDA inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years. "There is no rhyme or reason to how we regulate food today in the U.S.," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. "It's based on antiquated laws and bifurcated agencies. The current food safety system doesn't protect the public." Without a mandate for regular inspections, the FDA hasn't gotten enough money to do them more frequently. Smith Dewaal said the agency is "really starving for resources." Her complaints are echoed in a new report from an FDA advisory panel. The November 2007 report for the agency's Science Board said the FDA is so overburdened and underfunded that it can't effectively conduct routine surveillance. "The nation's food supply is at risk," the report said. And so we find that Sen. Clinton has a legitimate beef on ham and cheese. We find her claim to be True.

pomt-14432	"Twenty million Americans are out of work."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/09/john-kasich/john-kasich-ad-says-20-million-americans-are-out-w/	For all the discussion of immigration, foreign policy and social issues in the 2016 campaign, one issue always returns to the fore eventually: jobs. Republican candidate John Kasich emphasizes his record on jobs as Ohio governor in a new ad. The ad begins with grainy footage of what seems to be an unemployment line. The narrator’s first words are, "Twenty million Americans are out of work," and this assertion is bolstered by being repeated in on-screen text: This figure sounded high to us, since the official number of unemployed Americans during the most recent month, February, tops out at about 7.8 million. So we asked the Kasich campaign for their evidence, and they proceeded to cite a source that caught us off-guard: Us. Specifically, they pointed to our fact-check from August in which we analyzed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump said that "we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed." We rated this claim False, largely because the 93 million number included lots of people who would not be expected to want or be able to work, including full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen to take care of their children full-time. However, in the process, we conducted a mathematical experiment in which we played with possible numbers of Americans who are "out of work" that fit somewhere between the official unemployment rate (on the low end) and Trump’s number (on the high end). HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Here’s what we wrote, using the statistics that were current at the time: The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: • The 6.4 million people who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job." • And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job. This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as "out of work" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, said the campaign simply updated our math with more recent data in preparing the television ad. The numbers for January 2016, Nichols said, were: • Unemployed: 7.8 million • People who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job": 6.2 million • People working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job: 6 million. That works out to 20 million on the nose. We salute the Kasich campaign’s efforts to fact-check-proof their assertion. Still, we should note that we didn’t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of "out of work" Americans. Rather, we were trying to provide a benchmark for showing just how wrong Trump’s number was. We’ll note that our wording was that the 21 million figure had "some justification" — not exactly a clarion call for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to change its longstanding protocol. In subsequent fact-checks, though not the one the Kasich campaign referred to, we have added language that is clearer about our intentions. We did that, for instance, in our Feb. 11, 2016, fact-check of a different statement by Trump: "Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35 (percent). In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent." In that fact-check, which produced a rating of Pants on Fire, we prefaced a similar alternative calculation this way: "We are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent." But enough from us. What do the two economists we checked with for the original fact-check think about Kasich’s use of the 20 million figure? "Given that the image looks like a guy in an unemployment line, I'd say it's a misleading figure," said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com. Many people have good reasons for not wanting to work now, she said, and that is something distinct from actually being "out of work." Burtless agreed, saying, "The 5.988 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job are not ‘out of work.’ They are employed, but on a work schedule that does not provide them with the weekly hours they desire." At the same time, Burtless said there is still some value in the number cited in Kasich’s advertisement. "Gov. Kasich has given an upper-bound estimate of the total number of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed," Burtless said. It’s just not the only estimate. Our ruling Kasich’s ad said that "20 million Americans are out of work." The Kasich campaign shrewdly cites a past PolitiFact item as evidence for this larger-than-usual estimate of America’s "out of work" population. But it’s worth noting that the calculation we did was not intended to determine the actual number of out-of-work Americans, but rather to suggest the highest figure with any sort of credibility as a way of seeing how far out of line Trump’s assertion was. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2016-03-09T10:00:00	2016-02-27	['None']

pomt-04395	In 2012, Connie Mack missed 178 votes, "one of the worst voting records" in Congress.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-mack-missed-lot-votes-year/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said that his Republican rival U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV has missed 178 votes this year, giving him one of the worst attendance records in Congress. "Speaking of votes, why don’t you explain how you don’t show up to work. Why don’t you explain how this year you have one of the worst voting records. I have missed one vote this year, you have missed 178," Nelson said. Nelson made the claim during a debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie on Oct. 17. Mack countered back that they had similar records of missed votes if looking at their entire careers, rather than just this year. Missed votes in 2012 Here we will examine recent figures for missed votes by both Mack and Nelson through September 2012. GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. It shows that for the first three quarters of this year, Mack has missed 178 votes (65 in the first quarter, 75 in the second quarter and 38 in the third quarter.) Nelson’s one missed vote this year was to confirm the nomination of a federal judge in Illinois, which passed 86-1 on May 14. But looking at sheer votes isn’t an apples to apples comparison because the House takes more votes than the Senate. Career missed votes That’s why we also looked at the percentage of missed votes on GovTrack for Mack’s tenure and Nelson’s Senate tenure (Nelson previously served in the House 1979-1990) -- and the percentage missed this year. From the start of Mack’s tenure in January 2005, he missed 6 percent of roll call votes. During Nelson’s Senate tenure starting in January 2001, he missed 1 percent. The median missed votes for all members was 2.5 percent. We noticed that Mack’s percentage of missed votes started to spike in the last quarter of 2011 around the time he announced he was running for the U.S. Senate. While Nelson faced token primary opposition, Mack faced more serious challengers, forcing him to campaign more in Florida. The New York Times’ Inside Congress tabulates missed votes and shows the top three vote missers in the House for the 112th Congress, which covers the past two years. For that time period, Mack is in 13th place, according to New York Times reporter Derek Willis. That was worst among Florida representatives. If we removed Reps. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.; and Jane Harman, D-Calif., who resigned; and Donald Payne, D-N.J., who died, Mack would be in 10th place, Willis said. In July, Mack campaign spokesman David James said that Mack missed some votes "to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington." Our ruling Nelson said Mack missed 178 votes this year, making that "one of the worst voting records." Mack did miss 178 votes this year compared to 1 for Nelson. But unlike Nelson, Mack faced serious primary challengers, which meant he had to campaign in Florida more. Also, the House takes more votes than the Senate, so it’s more useful to look at percentages of missed votes. But the numbers are correct. According to the New York Times, Mack’s record places him in 13th for this Congress which started in January 2011 (or 10th if we omit members who resigned or died). That fits the definition of "one of the worst." We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2012-10-17T21:47:14	2012-10-17	['United_States_Congress', 'Connie_Mack_III']
pomt-11095	Says Bill Clinton "spent $3 billion and got nothing. And (North Korea) started making nuclear weapons a day later."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/13/donald-trump/bill-clinton-north-korea-3-billion-nuclear/	Fresh off the first meeting of a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader, President Donald Trump said his administration would accomplish what others could not with the rogue nuclear state. On June 12, Trump and Kim Jong Un signed an agreement to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." When asked whether this was just another empty promise on North Korea’s behalf, Trump said it was not. "Well, you have a different administration. You have a different president. You have a different Secretary of State," Trump said. "You have people that are — you know, it’s very important to them. And we get it done." Trump clarified he wasn’t just talking about Barack Obama. He put forth another example of past failure: former President Bill Clinton. "(Kim) actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past and ultimately as you know nothing got done," Trump said. "In one case, they took billions of dollars during the Clinton regime. ... Took billions of dollars and nothing happened. … And (Clinton) spent $3 billion and got nothing. And he started making nuclear weapons a day later." Did Clinton spend $3 billion on North Korea and accomplish "nothing"? That’s incorrect for several reasons. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. It wasn’t $3 billion Trump’s dollar estimate is overstated. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, reported that between 1995 and 2008, the United States provided North Korea with over $1.3 billion in assistance. CRS reported that "slightly more than 50 percent for food aid and about 40 percent for energy assistance." The funding was distributed from the end of Bill Clinton’s first term to the final year of George W. Bush. $666 million were given during the Clinton administration. The portion for food aid was aimed at patching the chronic malnutrition faced by large portions of the North Korean population, as a result of famine and inequalities perpetuated by the dictatorship. The United States provided energy funds of $549.7 million in two chunks to North Korea, one between 1995 and 2003, another between 2007 and 2009. From the context of his remark, it seems Trump was talking about the first stream under Clinton. That’s the 1994 Agreed Framework, negotiated between the United States and North Korea amid threats from Pyongyang to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In the treaty, North Korea agreed to halt production of plutonium, which is used for nuclear weapons. The country halted plutonium processing in Yongbyon and froze construction of two other reactors. In return, an international consortium would replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors, mostly financed by Japan and South Korea, to provide the energy without nuclear capability. Meanwhile, the United States agreed to supply heavy fuel oil. The two light-water nuclear reactors were never built. The United States nonetheless provided North Korea $400 million in heavy fuel oil until 2003. The money was distributed by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, the organization established to implement the Agreed Framework. When Clinton was president, the United States provided $236 million. In 2002, U.S. negotiators presented North Korean officials with evidence of a clandestine uranium enrichment program, which North Korean officials initially confirmed, then denied, leading to the breakdown of the Agreed Framework under the Bush administration, according to another CRS report. That’s about eight years later than Trump suggested. Did Clinton "accomplish nothing"? While the agreement ultimately failed with the revelation of North Korea’s uranium enrichment program, experts said it was too far to say that the agreement Clinton struck didn’t do anything. "The Framework Agreement was at best an incomplete agreement, but it worked for the better part of a decade to keep spent reactor fuel in cooling ponds," Jonathan Pollack, nonresident senior fellow in the Center for East Asia Policy at the Brookings Institution. "Not optimal, perhaps, but it kept North Korea’s plutonium based program frozen between 1994 and 2002." Kingston Reif, director of disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, pointed to the key metric of North Korean warheads from Clinton’s defense secretary, William Perry. In Perry’s 2015 book My Journey at the Nuclear Brink, he estimated that North Korea would have enough plutonium for more than 100 nuclear warheads today, as opposed to the estimated 25 in its current arsenal, were it not for the Framework Agreement. Greg Thielmann, former director of the Strategic, Proliferation, and Military Affairs Office of the State Department's Intelligence Bureau, said Clinton’s policies also interrupted North Korea’s flight-testing of longer range ballistic missiles. "Recall that the U.S. intelligence community had predicted in the fall of 1999 that North Korea was likely to test an intercontinental-range ballistic missile before the end of the year," Thielmann said. "But instead, North Korea agreed during the Clinton administration to a missile testing moratorium that lasted until 2006." Our ruling Trump said Clinton "spent $3 billion and got nothing. And (North Korea) started making nuclear weapons a day later." The money that went toward North Korea as part of the Agreed Framework, negotiated by Clinton in 1994, amounted to approximately $400 million. The rest of the $1.3 billion the United States has spent on North Korea mostly went toward food aid.

pomt-00416	Says U.S. Rep. John Carter "hasn’t held a town hall in five years."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/29/mj-hegar/has-congressman-john-carter-not-held-town-hall-fiv/	Has a Central Texas congressman not hosted a "town hall" meeting for half a decade? Democrat M.J. Hegar of Round Rock says as much about the Republican she’s challenging to represent the state’s 31st Congressional District, eight-term Rep. John Carter of Round Rock. The district, north of Austin, sweeps in Williamson and Bell counties. Hegar, a decorated Air Force veteran, has promoted her candidacy with a video in which she says that she once tried but failed to land a meeting with Carter about lifting the ban on women to participate in ground combat. "We’ll show him tough," Hegar says in the video. "Then we’ll show him the door." Hegar said of Carter in an Aug. 21, 2018 interview on Spectrum News's "Capital Tonight:" "He hasn’t had a town hall in five years and he’s kind of acting as if he wants to retire." Hegar points to news stories We sought Hegar’s factual backup for her claim mindful that Merriam-Webster defines a town hall as "an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members." The dictionary makes clear that such a gathering doesn’t have to enable anyone to ask anything. Merriam-Webster follows the definition with this sample sentence: "Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on." Christian Walker of Hegar’s campaign pointed us to a Texas Observer article describing a 2013 town-hall meeting where Carter faced critical questions. Walker also singled out a February 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story quoting a Round Rock resident, Felicia Miyakawa, saying Carter’s staff had told her and others that Carter hadn’t hosted live town hall meetings since the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at a public meeting with constituents in 2011. Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer responded at the time: "I wouldn’t say that is ‘the’ reason, but it would be correct to say it contributes to the many reasons. Mostly town halls are not nearly as effective, and you can’t reach nearly as many people as a tele-town hall." One alternative: Mass conference calls. The American-Statesman story said: "Many members of Congress prefer the safety of tele-town hall meetings, which offer interaction with constituents but in a controlled setting — essentially large-scale conference calls in which hundreds or thousands of people can listen in and queue up to ask a question — with no booing, no signs with clever slogans, no bad headlines, no viral videos." Carter held an hour-long tele-town hall on March 22, 2017, according to an American-Statesman news blog post. More recently, an Aug. 11, 2018, news story in the newspaper said Carter had reached out to residents through Facebook Live events. Carter: ‘Man of the people’ When we asked Carter about Hegar’s claim, he said by phone that he’d held multiple events attended by people asking questions. "I’ve been all over my district now, for 12- to 14-hour days, which is pretty typical of my work in Augusts each year. I would say I’m way ahead of my opponent in the Man-of-the-People category," Carter said. When we inquired into Carter’s formal schedule, we heard back from his office’s Emily Taylor. By email, Taylor listed four August 2018 events where, she said, Carter took questions from constituents on topics including federal pensions, Fort Hood and the legalization of marijuana. The events, Taylor said, were hosted by the Temple Kiwanis Club (Aug. 7); American Legion Post 133 (Aug. 14); the Military Officers Association of America (Aug. 17); and the Killeen Chamber of Commerce (Aug. 23). An Aug. 14, 2018 Temple Daily Telegram news story on the American Legion event includes a section titled "Town Hall" stating that Carter "took a few minutes to discuss congressional business and field questions from the audience." We asked if Carter had held public town halls open to all constituents. Taylor replied that Carter had hosted 25 telephone town halls in five years, the latest one on June 18, 2018. "The last four alone have reached 71,471 constituents," Taylor wrote. Also, Taylor said, Carter holds Facebook Live "town halls, where constituents can tune in online and ask real-time questions or submit questions on our website if they’re unable to tune in during the live event." She pointed us to a nearly 20-minute Facebook Live that Carter held July 2, 2018. Such events are publicized, Taylor wrote, through Carter’s electronic newsletters. Our ruling Hegar said Carter "hasn’t held a town hall in five years." As Hegar maintained, it looks like Carter hasn't hosted a traditional in-person town hall any time recently. Yet he holds tele-town halls, makes Facebook Live appearances and talks at meetings hosted by local groups. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14037	"Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law."	false	/texas/statements/2016/may/27/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-wrongly-says-texas-among-states-no-equ/	She lost the Texas governor’s race in 2014, where she called for stepped-up attention to women’s health care access and equal pay. But Democrat Wendy Davis still talks up women’s issues including, in a March 2016 interview by Texas Monthly, her desire to revisit legislation nixed by the Republican governor when she was a state senator from Fort Worth. Asked what issues she’s thinking about "besides reproductive autonomy," Davis replied: "Of course, equal pay. You may recall that I, along with the amazing Senfronia Thompson in the Texas House, was successful in passing an equal pay bill here, which was no easy feat—only to have it vetoed by Gov. Perry. So Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law. Even the law that exists at the federal level needs some punch." We wondered about the Texas part of her statement. Does the state rank among a few states lacking a law that ensures equal pay for male and female employees holding comparable jobs? Texas actually has laws that apply, we found, though no law has a time window like the one in federal law for an employee to challenge a pay action. To our inquiry, a Davis spokesman, Hector Nieto, described that gap--closed by laws in 42 states--as substantially weakening a Texas employee’s ability to sue. As a senator, to recap, Davis championed a measure giving a worker affected by an unequal pay action 180 days to file a dispute from when the inequity is discovered. The sought change, in keeping with the federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, would have widened a state law that gives workers 180 days from the occurrence of an "unlawful employment practice" to file a complaint. House Bill 950 by Rep. Thompson, D-Houston, won House and Senate approval in 2013, a year after the Texas Supreme Court held that absent legislative action, the Ledbetter provision revising the statute of limitations didn’t apply to cases brought under the Texas anti-discrimination laws. Next, as Davis said, Gov. Rick Perry vetoed the proposal, as he was urged to do by business interests including Macy’s. In his veto proclamation, Perry said the measure duplicated federal law, "which already allows employees who feel they have been discriminated against through compensation to file a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission." Thompson offered a similar proposal during the 2015 legislative session. It was defeated in the House. Davis spokesman notes NCSL research We recognized that Texas has statutory restrictions on pay discrimination after asking Davis about the basis of her declaration that Texas ranks among states that don’t have an "equal pay" law. By email, Nieto directed us to a July 2015 chart summarizing state "equal pay" laws posted by the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures, which says it strives to improve the "quality and effectiveness" of the nation’s state legislatures. The chart’s Texas entry indicates the state has two laws related to equal pay--one protecting state government workers, the other generally "prohibiting discrimination based on protected class status." In Texas that includes race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age and disability. The laws are in the state’s labor code, the chart indicates, which contains: --The Texas Equal Work, Equal Pay law, which took effect in 1993, stating: "A woman who performs public service for this state is entitled to be paid the same compensation for her service as is paid to a man who performs the same kind, grade, and quantity of service, and a distinction in compensation may not be made because of sex." --Chapter 21 of the code, "Employment Discrimination," includes a section stating an employer "commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin or age the employer… fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions or privileges of employment." We wondered if the general law fairly adds up to Texas already barring pay discrimination. To our request for expert analysis, Amy Starnes of the State Bar of Texas directed us to attorneys including C.B. Burns, an El Paso labor and employment lawyer, who by phone agreed the general law in the labor code offers recourse for workers in Texas who wish to pursue equal-pay disputes. By email, Burns elaborated, though, that the law only applies to employers with 15 employees or more and that private and public employers are covered under it; in contrast, the Texas Equal Pay Act applies to state employees only. Burns summed up: "We don't have a statute called the Equal Pay Act like there is in federal law, but we have a discrimination statute that prohibits sex discrimination and equal-pay claims are a form of sex discrimination." Separately, Patrick Maher, a Dallas employment discrimination lawyer, told us it’s a "misstatement" to say there’s no Texas law against pay discrimination, explaining that the Ch. 21 law would offer protections and defenses on top of federal laws. Other states And what of other states? According to NCSL’s breakdown, as of July 2015, two states had no "equal pay" law: Alabama and Mississippi--a conclusion also reached, as of April 2016, by the Department of Labor. Put another way, the NCSL places Texas among 44 states with a degree of an "equal pay" law. Four states only have a general employment discrimination law: North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin, according to the group. A web search led us to another analysis of state equal pay laws; the American Association of University Women lists Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina as lacking equal pay laws as of 2016. The association, which favors strong state equal pay laws, ranked Texas among 13 states with "poor" laws, meaning in part that the laws don’t apply to all workers. Since the group’s ratings were last updated online, Nebraska passed a measure upping the number of employees covered under their law, moving them into the "moderate" category, Amy Becker, AAUW’s political media manager told us by email. She also explained that Texas automatically qualified for the "poor" rating because its general anti-discrimination law applies only to workplaces with 15 or more employees. AAUW’s breakdown lists 19 measures it would like states to have in their equal pay laws and lists Texas as having one: no discrimination/retaliation for involvement in legal proceedings. States with nine or more equal pay protections are considered to have "strong" equal pay laws. Those states, according to AAUW, are California, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Tennessee and Vermont. Our ruling Davis said: "Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law." Texas might not have the strongest laws against pay discrimination. But two anti-discrimination laws exist, one limited to state employees and the other to people working for larger businesses. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-00480	Claims that Democratic candidate for governor Matt Flynn "told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/10/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-radio-ad-takes-aim-democratic-candid/	In a radio ad attacking Democratic gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn, the Wisconsin Republican Party claims that Flynn "told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities." Flynn has taken heavy criticism from Gov. Scott Walker and others for his role representing the Milwaukee Archdiocese in priest sexual abuse cases from 1989 to 2004. Flynn is one of eight Democrats in the Aug. 14 primary who hope to face Walker in November. The former priest and Flynn have given differing accounts of what happened. But this much is clear: Describing the former priest in question as a "child predator" is one step (or several) too far. Let’s take a look. The case A criminal complaint filed against against Marvin Knighton in 2002 claimed the priest had sexually assaulted a 12-year-old boy. Under Wisconsin law, the charge applies to cases in which an adult has sexual contact with a child under 16 without threats, violence, or injury. According to the criminal complaint, "Knighton would frequently talk about his own penis and told (the boy) that one day he, (the boy), would have hair on his genital area and that when this happened, he would be a man and that he would take him out to dinner." The accuser claimed that the contact involved kissing and touching. The priest would call the boy by a feminine name and tell him how beautiful he was, according to the complaint. Before that, the case had played out behind the scenes. It began when the father of the alleged victim contacted Knighton in 1993 and accused him of sexually assaulting his son. Knighton reported the allegations to the archdiocese, saying he wanted to "clear this up." In a 2003 letter to then-Archbishop Timothy Dolan, Knighton wrote that he went to Flynn regarding the allegation that had been made against him. Knighton stated in the letter that "nothing inappropriate ever happened with this young man." Knighton wrote that Flynn "suggested that we simply wait to see if he would file a report with Project Benjamin," an archdiocesan program to help victims of abuse. When the accuser failed to file a report, Knighton’s letter claimed Flynn told him "not to worry about it. He felt that the young man wasn’t going to do anything." Knighton’s letter went on: "I did not feel comfortable with that decision and again requested that as ‘legal counsel’ for the Archdiocese, that we be proactive in such a delicate matter and meet with my accuser. Mr. Flynn told me that it would be too much of a hassle to do anything legally and most likely nothing would happen. How wrong was that?" The archdiocese partially corroborates Knighton’s account on its website, which in a summary of the case says "the attorney advised Knighton that, because no one had filed a complaint, nothing could be done. Knighton continued to exercise ministry." What the candidate says In July 2018, Matt Flynn held a conference call with reporters in hopes of addressing all questions related to the priest abuse scandal. In it, Flynn confirmed that he did meet with Knighton in 1993 while representing the archdiocese as a lawyer for Quarles & Bradley. However, he denied Knighton’s account and said that Knighton was an unreliable source, given that the letter in question was written a decade after the meeting. "What he says there is false," Flynn said. "I insisted (the archdiocese) go to the police on any allegation." Of course, by that definition, Flynn himself would be an unreliable witness, since he, too, is recollecting events from many years prior. The GOP claim The ad characterizes Knighton as a "child predator." According to the state Department of Corrections, a sexual predator (the law uses the term "sexually violent person") is "a person who has been committed in a civil court proceeding under Chapter 980 of the Wisconsin Statutes." For such a commitment to be made, the person has to have been "previously convicted of certain sexually violent offenses" and "diagnosed with a mental disorder that predisposes the person to engage in further acts of sexual violence." Knighton does not meet either criteria. He has never been convicted in a criminal court of sexual assault. In the 2003 criminal case, a jury acquitted Knighton of the single charge of second-degree sexual assault of a child. A second allegation of sexual abuse from a 1974 victim fell outside the criminal statute of limitations and thus was never tried in court. By 2004 a third allegation had surfaced but never translated to legal action. Indeed, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections’ sex offender registry does not list Knighton’s name. That said, the archdiocese conducted a separate investigation of Knighton and in a canonical trial found him guilty of both charges of abuse. The church dismissed him from the priesthood after he lost his appeal in 2011. Colloquially, a "predator," as defined by Merriam Webster, is "a person who has committed a sexually violent offense and especially one who is likely to commit more sexual offenses." If the multiple allegations against Knighton are true, he potentially meets this definition. But in this context, we think the legal definition carries the most weight. Reporting to authorities The GOP also claimed that Flynn "should have turned (Knighton) in to authorities." Should he have? Peter K. Rofes, professor of law at Marquette University, doesn’t think so. But the reasons are complicated. Let’s break it down. First, there is the confidentiality obligation between a lawyer and a client. "With very modest exceptions, lawyers must safeguard confidential information and refrain from revealing all information that relates to representation of a client," said Rofes. A lawyer could only share information on a client with, say, the police, if the client threatened to imminently endanger life or inflict massive monetary harm. Under the law in 1993, Rofes said, a lawyer had no legal obligation to report a non-client who threatened similarly harmful acts. In this case, Flynn’s client was the institution of the archdiocese, not Knighton specifically. Under the "principles of confidentiality" contained within Chapter 20 of Supreme Court rules, "Lawyer Flynn did not have an affirmative legal obligation to go outside the archdiocese, to go outside the organization he was representing, with any information on the priest," said Rofes. In 1993, Flynn’s only legal obligation was to make sure the archdiocese was aware of the allegations against Knighton. Since Knighton reported the allegations to the archdiocese, they were aware. Some might argue Flynn had a moral obligation to report Knighton to authorities. Flynn was not precluded from doing that. Nor was the archdiocese. Neither did, which is the thrust of the GOP point. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP claims that Flynn "told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities." Knighton and the archdiocese have described events that would support the claim, but their accounts have been disputed by Flynn. That said, Knighton does not legally qualify as as a child predator (or even a sex offender) -- which is central to the claim in the GOP ad. Finally, Flynn had no legal obligation to report a non-client to the authorities, but some might argue he had a moral one. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05735	Says "we had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-he-cut-13-billion-state-spendi/	By Gov. Chris Christie’s account, he arrived in Trenton and slashed billions of dollars of state spending in two years. In a state capital thriving off freewheeling use of tax dollars, Christie said he immediately closed a $2.2 billion gap left by his predecessor. Then, the governor claims, he wielded his budget ax to eliminate another $10.7 billion. In an interview on "Piers Morgan Tonight" that aired on Feb. 21, the same day the governor delivered his budget speech, Christie described his fiscal prudence to a national audience. "Let's look at what I've done in New Jersey, OK? And that's the best gauge to gauge and to judge a politician. Not what they say in a talk show with you, but what they've done," Christie said. "And in two years, what we’ve done is to protect the most vulnerable here, even when we had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years." OK, let’s judge the governor by his actions. When Christie took office halfway through the fiscal 2010 budget year, his predecessor’s spending plan had a $2.2 billion shortfall. Christie used several measures to close the gap, including cutting $475 million in local school aid. That’s $2.2 billion of the $13 billion Christie claims he cut. It’s at this point that the governor mixes real money with a theoretical figure. Much of Christie’s claim hinges on a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. The structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all statutory spending obligations were fully funded. However, the budget supersedes state statute. So, although certain levels of spending on different programs may be required, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise. And that’s largely how Christie handled the structural deficit in his first budget. He skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment and didn’t fully fund the school aid formula or property tax rebate program, among other measures. So, Christie didn’t cut that money. He never spent it. "While $13 billion might represent the total deferrals and non-funding what otherwise would be required programming, the actual cuts in state operations, in state government, were substantially less than $13 billion," said Raphael J. Caprio, a Rutgers University professor who researches local and state budgeting and finance. And the structural deficit didn’t go away. For the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year. Though Christie uses the structural deficit to his advantage when discussing his first budget, he dismissed the fiscal 2012 calculation as the "old way of budgeting." PolitiFact New Jersey sought a response from the governor’s office last week, and Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak issued a reply, admitting the governor got it wrong but criticizing our methods. "This is just ridiculous. Do you people ever just let something pass as a plain-as-day slip of the tongue, human error? Of course he didn’t cut spending by $13 billion," Drewniak wrote in an e-mail. Drewniak, referring to a list he provided of statements Christie made at town halls and other forums, also said: "My point in sending you all those instances of where he accurately explained the budgets, cutting spending and combined deficits was to illustrate the point that of course he knows what he cut from the budgets, and that he has explained it many times." The governor has cut state spending. The percent change differs depending on the point in time the governor’s first budget is compared with the budget he inherited. Either way, it’s a decrease of less than $3 billion. Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said Christie has tried to make fundamental changes in state spending so the structural deficit doesn’t widen. "He’s lowered actual spending and that’s sort of a new fiscal world for New Jersey," he said. Our ruling The governor said "we had to cut state spending by 13 billion dollars over two years." That’s not true. Christie decreased state spending, but the total doesn’t near $13 billion. Christie’s claim hinges largely on a $10.7 billion structural deficit. He used the measurement from his first year in office to his advantage. But the next year, he dismissed the structural deficit as the "old way of budgeting." We rate the claim False.

pomt-00239	Says Tallahassee "is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/08/andrew-gillum/andrew-gillum-says-crime-dropping-tallahassee/	Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has pushed back on attacks by Republicans that he oversees a crime-ridden city. Gillum’s opponent in the Florida governor’s race, Ron DeSantis, zeroed in on the crime rate in an interview with CBS4’s Jim DeFede. "This is a guy that is presiding over the highest crime in Florida four years running," DeSantis said Sept. 23. One week later, also on DeFede’s show, Gillum fired back: "I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate and we accomplished that by having fewer arrests at the same time," he said. We decided to fact-check both candidates who are running for governor. We found that DeSantis and Gillum point to valid statistics, but cherry-pick those that make their point while omitting the broader picture and caveats about crime statistics. "I would say that both DeSantis and Gillum are off the mark a bit in either blaming or crediting the mayor," University of Florida criminology professor emeritus Ronald Akers said. Here, we will fact-check the statement by Gillum that Tallahassee is experiencing a five-year low in its crime rate. Tallahassee’s crime rate Experts generally focus on crime rates per 100,000 residents rather than sheer numbers of crimes. The Tallahassee Police Department, among other law enforcement agencies across the state, report crime data to the state for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports program each year. The data includes arrest and crime figures for several types of offenses, including murder, rape, robberies and thefts. We looked at the reports on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s website and compiled the crime rate for each year for the past decade. Gillum was sworn into office as mayor in November 2014 following more than a decade on the city commission. Year Tallahassee crime rate per 100,000 residents 2017 5,764.5 2016 6,726.8 2015 6,211.3 2014 5,833.7 2013 5,178.3 2012 5,553.7 2011 6,041.1 2010 5,801.9 2009 5,669.6 2008 6,115.2 Source: Uniform Crime Reports So when Gillum says that Tallahassee is experiencing a five-year low in the crime rate, he is pointing to the rate of 5,764.5 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2017 and comparing that 2013, when the rate was 5,187.3. Gillum has said the downward trend in crime has continued so far in 2018. In September, city Police Chief Michael DeLeo shared data with the city commission showing that during the first six months of 2018 overall crime was down 10.3 percent and violent crime was down 24 percent. One caveat about crime data: it is only as good as the reporting by the local police agencies. An audit the police chief sought found that the city incorrectly reported crime statistics at a higher rate due to various errors in 2017. DeLeo told PolitiFact a small percentage of the drop between 2016 and 2017 is attributed to the overreporting found in the audit. However, he said that even when comparing the first half of 2016 and 2017 before the reports were audited there was a decrease in crime. Other side of the crime picture Rather than focus on the more favorable trend of reduced crime, the Republicans focus on hard, scary recent numbers. In 2017, the city had 17 murders, the highest ever. In the same year, Leon County’s crime rate was the highest in the state — as it was in 2014, 2015 and 2016. While Leon County is a broader area than just the city of Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Police Department handles the bulk of the county’s crime. Limitations of crime rate data The FBI cautions about the pitfalls of using crime statistics to rank communities. Such rankings ignore local characteristics that influence crime, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. The American Society of Criminology reached a similar conclusion. Tallahassee is a college town, home to Florida State University and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and also the state government. Accordingly, the city has a large number of visitors who do not live year-round in the city, including students, lobbyists, politicians and other people who work at the Capitol but may live in other cities. That means that crimes committed against — or by — students or commuters who work in the capital city are included in the count of Tallahassee’s crimes, but many of them are not counted in the residential population of the city. "This causes the per-person crime rate to be artificially inflated," said Brian Stults, an associate criminology professor at Florida State. A city mayor has relatively little control over the characteristics most often identified as the strongest predictors of local crime rates, such as poverty and the age of residents, Stults said. The mayor may have some control over the size of the police department, but studies are inconsistent about whether increases in police size and funding lead to decreases in crime, Stults said. The more important factor is not how many police you have, but how they police. The police department has increased its emphasis on community and problem-oriented policing over the past several years, which some studies have linked to reductions in crime. A city spokeswoman said Tallahassee has hired a few dozen more police officers during Gillum’s tenure as mayor, growing the force by about 11 percent. Mayors, and police chiefs, can influence the strategies the police department uses, but the results that flow from these strategies take time, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a police officer in Bartow, Fla., in the 1970s. The Tallahassee Democrat has written about various efforts by city and county officials to tackle crime in recent years, including targeting violent crime hotspots, monitoring crime trends, and developing a program for young people who are not in school or work. Experts caution against giving politicians credit or blame for declines or increases in crime, which are more likely a function of social changes in the community or economy than political actions. Our ruling Gillum said, "I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate." The crime rate in Tallahassee was 5,764.5 per 100,000 people in 2017 — the last time it was lower was in 2013. While Gillum points to the good news about the crime rate drop, Leon County still tops the state in the crime rate. The county includes a broader area than Tallahassee. Experts caution against mayors taking too much credit (or blame) for changes in crime, which is heavily influenced by factors beyond a mayor’s control. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04849	Says the federal government "mandates transexuals (sic) and homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones in the name of airport security."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/13/mark-clayton/disavowed-democratic-senate-primary-winner-claims-/	Mark Clayton, the 32-year-old floor installer and former Army Reserve aircraft technician who recently won the Democratic Party primary as a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, has made a lot of colorful, sometimes wacky statements, as he campaigns. We decided to check out one found on his campaign’s Facebook page, in which he claims that the federal government "mandates transexuals (sic) and homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones in the name of airport security." We asked Clayton for some supporting documentation or evidence for this assertion and he responded by sending a Public Advocate of the United States press release. It contains the statement of Eugene Delgaudio, president of Public Advocate, under the headline, "We were right all along: Perverse court allows TSA male agent to grope women." The statement begins: "The TSA’s mix of ultra-leftist hiring practices along with their intrusive ‘security’ procedures of pornographic scanners and groping is leading to disaster." We suggested to Clayton that the assertions by Delgaudio, a Loudoun County, Va., supervisor and fervent anti-gay-rights advocate, did not support his statement factually, but we received no further response. We took note that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks right-wing extremist groups, has labeled Public Advocate a "hate" group. The Democratic party has disavowed Clayton’s candidacy, has tried to keep him off the ballot and has suggested voters write in an alternative. But we decided to look at the case that Delgaudio made involving a transgender employee named Ashley Yang who worked for the TSA in Los Angeles. Yang dressed as a woman and took hormone therapy to look like a woman. Yang was fired after complaining of discrimination, sued and received five months’ back pay and other compensation in a negotiated settlement. From what we can find from legitimate sources, the Yang case does not involve "transexuals (sic) or homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones," nor even transsexuals doing so. It does involve employment law regarding the on-the-job treatment involving gender identity, and a voluntary settlement in which one party was a federal government agency. Bending over backwards to try to make Delgaudio’s statement somehow support Clayton’s claim, we nonetheless note Delgaudio is alleging that Yang was groping women, not children. There is a difference, even if the allegation itself is dubious. Delgaudio also made a statement that "when I see men with wigs and dresses lining up to work as TSA screeners, or little boys crying because a strange man is violating their bodies, I know that I can’t possibly be on the wrong path." Absent reports that such things are happening, that does not pass for evidence. Nonetheless, we sought out a response to the claim from the TSA. Jonathan Allen, a TSA spokesman, responded to our inquiry with the following statement: "While fulfilling a critical and necessary security mission, we are conscious of individual concerns of passengers and strive to conduct the screening process with dignity and respect." Allen also sent along TSA policy statements on Civil Rights, the screening of children and on "pat downs." The policy regarding children reads in part: "Security officers will approach children gently and treat them with respect. If a child becomes uncomfortable or upset, security officers will consult parents about the best way to relieve the child's concern." Our ruling The state Democratic Party’s disavowal of Clayton is but one indication of his lack of credibility. This kind of baseless statement is yet another. The TSA does not mandate that any of its screeners "grope" children in any "zone." Clayton is making a ridiculous, reckless claim, and for that we give this statement a Pants On Fire!

pomt-05064	Says "while state leaders have cut funding for our schools and other basic priorities, the amount of money the state is projected to give away through tax breaks increased by a whopping $3.4 billion."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/06/our-oregon/has-state-left-tax-giveaways-grow-while-cutting-sc/	For several years, Oregon has faced an economic crunch. Schools, social services and public safety have all taken cuts. In a recent newsletter, Our Oregon, a nonprofit backed by public employee unions, highlights those cuts and points to an alternative: Tax breaks. Here’s what the newsletter says: "The reason for this crisis is simple: As a state, we're not funding our schools at even an adequate level. And it's not that we don't have the resources, it's that we're choosing to give away the money through an ever-increasing list of tax breaks and loopholes. Even while state leaders have cut funding for our schools and other basic priorities, the amount of money the state is projected to give away through tax breaks increased by a whopping $3.4 billion." PolitiFact Oregon has looked a lot at budgets. We say this again and again, but technically the state budget as a whole is not shrinking. It’s actually up about $400 million this biennium over last. But that growth isn’t enough to keep up with inflation and other factors. That means, even with budget increases, the state still has to make service cuts. The state’s schools are seeing something similar happen. The State School Fund is up about $160 million this biennium over last and yet teachers are being laid off and class sizes are increasing. We’re also no stranger to the issue of tax breaks. Previously we looked into whether the state spends more on giveaways than it does on education, public safety and health care combined. The answer: Mostly True. Still, we wondered if lawmakers were really growing giveaways by the billions while cutting other programs. We pulled out our copy of the state’s 2011-13 Tax Expenditure Report and on Page 5 we found the numbers we needed. We figured Our Oregon was talking about this biennium compared to last -- by that measure, they were right. In the 2009-11 biennium, the state granted nearly $28 billion in tax breaks. This biennium, the total is expected to hit $31.4 billion. That’s the $3.4 billion -- or 12 percent -- increase Our Oregon mentioned. We confirmed with Our Oregon spokesman Scott Moore that those were the same numbers they looked at. Fact checks, though, are never that easy. We wondered why this increase was happening, especially, as Our Oregon pointed out, during a time when other things are being cut. We called the state’s economist Mark McMullen and asked him if he could explain some of the growth to us. "A lot of these are just going to grow organically or just along with the economy," he said. Some of these are particularly big breaks, too. Say mortgage interest deductions or state income tax deductions. A good chunk also comes from the fact that Oregon is linked to the federal tax code. That is all to say that lawmakers can’t cut these areas as easily as they can other spending. That doesn’t mean they don’t try. During the 2011 session, about 20 tax credits were set to expire and lawmakers opted to renew half of them -- or about $10 million worth. This is part of a recently instituted, six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed. We asked Moore whether he thought the group’s newsletter might have pointed that out. "The sunsetting of the tax breaks that they embarked on in the last session is a good start," he said. "It's wonderful that they're doing that ... but right now that only applies to tax credits." What’s more, he said, whether the growth happens with or without an explicit vote, the problem remains. "We are automatically giving away money because we're connected to the federal tax code," he said. "Rather than just throwing up their hands and just allowing us to be connected to the federal tax code (they should ask) ‘Does this make sense for the state of Oregon?’" Our Oregon said in a newsletter that the state is projected to give away $3.4 billion more in tax breaks this biennium than the last, even as lawmakers make cuts in education and other programs. Education budgets have definitely seen service cuts -- though the actual state education budget has grown. Our Oregon’s math is right, but we think it’s important context that the increase isn’t all a result of legislators passing new giveaways and that other budgets haven’t shrunk so much as failed to keep up with growth. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Our Oregon	None	None	None	2012-07-06T15:26:11	2012-06-20	['None']
pomt-07383	Drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf and in parts of Alaska will "immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/04/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-easing-access-drilling-would-/	Except for the speculators and some investors, no one is happy with high gasoline prices. And as prices approached and then topped $4 a gallon in late April, an old debate roared with one side wanting to hold the profiteers accountable -- while the other side said it’s high time to tap America’s protected oil fields. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman weighed in by saying that price fixing, if there is any, should be prosecuted, but that it’s also time to harness energy sources "in our own backyard." "As an immediate bridge, we should increase access for oil exploration and production in energy-rich areas of the country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska," the Ohio Republican said in his column, which ran on his Senate website as well as on RedState.com. "This will create jobs, drive investment, and immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil." Immediately? Not so fast, say the experts. Pretend that environmentalists dropped all objections to drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf -- that area that lies offshore between states’ jurisdictions and the end of United States oceanic boundaries. Also pretend that the public decided its need for oil trumped what environmentalists see as the sanctity of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. Since we’re just pretending, everyone join in: Drill, baby, drill. Then wait. See ya around 2021. These things take time. The process would have to start with bidding for government leases -- normally a two- to three-year process -- which could lead to the establishment of exploratory wells just to see what, exactly, lies below. Only then is it time to firm up plans for production while drilling more wells, building offshore platforms, assembling and inserting pipelines and, finally, bringing the oil to refineries. "It’s quite a while before it can go into production, and the lag time is significant," Phyllis Martin, a senior energy analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Agency or EIA, told us. As a general rule, "it could be anywhere from three to 11 years, and three is really fast-track and that’s for shallow offshore" production with little or no need for exploration or lease negotiations. The price differential, too, is misunderstood, she said. That’s because gasoline prices are set on the global market, and as various studies have noted, OPEC and other foreign oil producers could cut back or respond in other ways to keep prices high. "So it’s not going to have a major impact," Martin said. "There’ll be a few pennies, but not major" savings. Besides talking to Martin, we looked at several studies. Among the highlights: The Outer Continental Shelf of Alaska’s Beaufort Sea could produce its first oil in 2019, and the Chukchi Sea area in 2022, according to a February 2011 analysis by Northern Economics for Shell Exploration and Production. Access to the Continental Outer Shelf off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico "would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030," said a 2009 update of an earlier EIA study. That was two years ago, when EIA said that "leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017." Push that back by two years now. ANWR drilling would take 10 years to actually produce oil, according to an EIA analysis in 2008 requested by the late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican. That 10-year timeline would be pushed back if there were protracted legal battles or delays in getting government permits, the analysis said. Portman’s claim seemed off base when we first saw it, but that’s only because we had seen something similar to it before. It was voiced by Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, in 2008 when he was running for president and gasoline prices spiked. A number of other GOP officeholders have repeated it in recent weeks, each wanting to lift federal drilling prohibitions more quickly and more extensively than President Barack Obama and Democrats have been willing to do. PolitiFact ruled McCain’s claim False in 2008, noting that while some economists and energy experts agreed that producing more American oil would be good for jobs and, eventually, the trade balance, it would have no immediate effect on gasoline supply or prices. "I have a problem linking the drilling to current gas prices for political reasons," Dr. A.F. Alhaji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, told PolitiFact nearly three years ago. "The reality is there is no correlation between today's prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf." Before researching this subject, we asked a Portman spokeswoman, Christine Mangi, about the source of her boss’s claim. Her response in an e-mail: "Sen. Portman was referring to, among other things, the situation in the Gulf. The Obama Administration was not processing deep water permits in the Gulf which contributed to a 13 percent reduction in oil production there. By freeing up our domestic, energy rich resources in a place such as the Gulf, we can immediately reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil." Yet Portman said nothing about the Gulf of Mexico (which accounts for about 30 percent of U.S. oil production, according to the EIA). His column took a big-picture view of energy needs and did not engage in the dispute about the government’s speed in granting permits since the BP oil spill in the Gulf in 2010. But most of the Gulf drilling is in fact on the Outer Continental Shelf, so we asked Andy Radford, a senior policy advisor at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group, about it. He said that at a high point before the spill, the Gulf produced about 1.7 million barrels of oil a day. That’s down by 10 percent to 15 percent today, he said. And if we had that oil now? There would be little to no effect on prices because oil trades on a global market. India and developing nations are consuming more. Turmoil in the Middle East plays a role, too. As for the drop in the Gulf of Mexico, "The Saudis can make that up in a few hours," Radford said. "The effect would be more psychological than anything." In fairness, Portman spoke of reducing reliance on foreign oil, not of reducing the price. But he spoke of an "immediate bridge" to harnessing America’s natural resources by increasing oil production and exploration "in energy-rich areas of our country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska." This would "immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil," he said. All evidence is that it would not. The current reduction in oil flowing from the Gulf, which Mangi mentioned in defense of her boss’s claim, represents a tiny portion of this country’s oil output, and the reduced flow is not entirely attributable to the post-spill slowdown in issuing drilling permits. In some cases, Gulf fields were simply tapped out, ending their productive life, said Richard Charter, a senior policy advisor for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Furthermore, issuance of new permits has picked up, according to records from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. New permits can lead to more exploration, but there is no guarantee that new exploration will lead to a specific amount of oil. As we said already: It takes time. It is noteworthy that the very day Portman’s column came out, the EIA released its annual energy outlook, saying that while U.S. consumption of liquid fuels is expected to keep rising, the import share has been falling and should keep doing so due to increases in production -- including biofuels -- and greater fuel efficiency. That’s not to say it would or would not be worthwhile for the United States to produce even more oil over the long run. Economists and others cite potential economic, defense and trade benefits in the future. But by asserting this would produce an immediate reduction in dependence on foreign oil, Portman’s claim is False.

The headline on an April 2, 2017, post on usanews4u.us declared, "Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across U.S." Likely concerned by the prospect, Facebook users flagged it as potentially being fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to stamp out fake news. The fake post said that Trump was going to take action despite criticism from congressional Republicans, because fake news was still being widely circulated on the site. Facebook users, federal judges and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were all prepared to fight any executive order, but Trump didn’t care. "Inside, we both know what’s been going on. We know the game and we’re gonna play it," Trump is quoted in the story. First and foremost, we know that this is a faker than fake quote, because it’s a line from Rick Astley’s Never Gonna Give You Up. Internet-savvy users should realize instantly they’re being Rick Rolled here. That’s apparently still a thing for some people. But we just gotta tell you how we’re feeling, and gotta make you understand. Even with Trump’s penchant for labeling things as fake news, there has been no report about an executive order banning Facebook. We tried to reach usanews4u.us through their Contact Us form, but didn’t receive a reply. The site is registered to an address in Veles, Macedonia, a hotbed of fake news websites. And while the post was dated April 2, the tags on the story clued readers in that it is actually for April Fool’s Day. It appears it was a news outlet’s attempt at a joke that was repurposed without clear attribution. The story originated on April 1 at Firstpost.com, a website filled largely with what look to be legitimate, India-centric news stories. There also is a "Faking News" section full of intentionally bogus content "to attract your attention." But this post wasn’t categorized there, instead getting the label "World News." The post also had an April Fool’s Day tag, so the story is a prank.

pomt-00611	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed state budget contained 110 pages of errors -- an unusually high number -- "and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes" that were corrected with a follow-up document.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/01/chris-taylor/rep-chris-taylor-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-fil/	As Gov. Scott Walker travels the country in his not-quite-formal-presidential bid, Democrats in Wisconsin complain he’s neglecting the state. That criticism extends to the 2015-’17 state budget, which will soon be up for votes in the Assembly and Senate. Democrats (and a few Republicans) have complained about a variety of matters in the budget, and said the package was poorly prepared. Such complaints were raised in a news release issued the day before work on the budget began in the Joint Finance Committee. The Democrats on the committee complained that lawmakers were given a "last minute error document" that ran 110 pages. "Drafting errors may happen, but I highly doubt that 110 pages and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes and unintended consequences are anything but the product of an extremely distracted Governor not putting his home state first," state Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) said in a news release issued by the Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee. Is Taylor right? Did Walker’s budget have an unusual number of budget corrections that were cleaned up in the final hours? How the process works Such last-minute correction documents are not new. They even have a formal bureaucratic name -- an "errata report." Like past governors, Walker issued his budget in February of 2015. The document itself runs 1,800 pages, with most of it being highly technical in nature. The errata report is a document that corrects mistakes identified between the time when the budget is announced and when the Legislature begins its work. In April 2013, during the last state budget cycle, the Walker Administration sent lawmakers an errata report fixing about a dozen items and recommending eight amendments. A March 15, 2013 memo corrected 61 more items, all of which appeared to be very technical. In Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, similar memos corrected about 40 items. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s final budget included about 75 corrections in memos issued in March 2009. "When you’re dealing with an 1,800 page bill you’re going to find a mistake or two," said Legislative Fiscal Bureau Director Bob Lang, who has been with the agency since 1971. "I don’t recall a budget where there weren’t technical changes." Department of Administrator spokesman Cullen Werwie said much the same in an email: "Nearly every budget has an errata to make minor and technical changes. This year is no different." Looking at Walker’s budget Compared with recent budgets, the errata report from the Department of Administration for the 2015-’17, dated April 15, 2015, budget made more corrections -- about 110 by our count -- than those in the past several budgets. On April 13, 2015, the Joint Finance Committee received a smaller document with 12 items that needed to be cleaned up. What about the portion of Taylor’s claim that the changes involved millions of dollars? The "millions" figure cited corresponds with the April 13 errata memo, which says the changes will decrease the state’s general fund balance by $2.87 million. Taylor aide Maggie Gau noted that "millions" also applies to a figure that shows up on page 106 of the April 15 memo. Walker wanted to move the worker’s compensation division from the Department of Workforce Development to the Officer of the Commissioner of Insurance. The original budget failed to include funding for the workers comp agency for the period leading up to that transition. That added $15.67 million in expense. Page 52 of the memo said there were another $4.8 million in expense related to "supplies and services" that were not accounted for in the move of the workers compensation division. That’s at least $20 million in cleaned up mistakes. Other corrections included in the errata memo were substantial policy changes. Among the corrections: Walker’s original budget eliminated mention of the Wisconsin Idea as the foundation of the University of Wisconsin System. (Walker claimed at the time that it was a mistake, but records showed the budget drafting staff following directions issued by Walker’s team.) The memo restored the Wisconsin Idea language. The memo also created a new policy, and proposed capping UW System undergraduate tuition increases at no more than the annual increase in the consumer price index. Our rating Taylor said that Walker’s proposed budget "contained 110 pages and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes" that were corrected with a follow-up document. Taylor is right on the number of the tweaks made in the budget and that they affected millions of dollars in the state budget. But such clean-up memos are a routine part of the budget process -- though there were a bit more this time than in the three previous state budgets. We rate Taylor’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-12715	"Most U.S. foreign assistance ... is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants."	true	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/08/raj-shah/yes-most-us-foreign-aid-flows-through-us-organizat/	President Donald Trump’s budget director Mike Mulvaney confirmed recently that foreign aid is on the chopping block. In an interview before the president’s address to Congress, Mulvaney said Trump would help pay for an increase in defense spending with "fairly dramatic reductions in foreign aid." Critics of programs that aim to boost economies, increase education and otherwise give poorer nations a leg up often say such aid is wasted through corruption and poor design. While Trump himself indicated during the campaign that some aid was warranted, in 2013 he tweeted, "Every penny of the $7 billion going to Africa as per Obama will be stolen - corruption is rampant!" The former head of the U.S. Agency for International Development Raj Shah wrote recently that such concerns about fraud and theft are way behind the times. "Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets, engage private-sector partners, adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments," Shah wrote in a Feb. 24 Washington Post op-ed. "Most U.S. foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments. It is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants; these organizations then implement projects in other countries, employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society." We wondered if, in fact, most American aid goes to private companies and nonprofits, which then run programs in foreign countries. According to the Congressional Research Service, Shah is correct by a whopping margin. The nonpartisan research arm of Congress reported in 2015 that only 4 percent of USAID assistance goes directly to foreign governments. "Most USAID funds go through U.S. partners — universities, NGOs, and contractors — although their efforts may directly assist a government’s ministries of education or health, for example, in providing educational and health programs to their public," the report said. The report said that, collectively, 49 percent of aid flows through American nonprofits, for-profit companies and American educational institutions. Another 29 percent goes to international organizations such as the Global Fund and various United Nations agencies. The domestic share is likely even higher. Shah is a fellow at the aid advocacy group Results for America. Staff there cited a specialty trade publication article that found that in 2015, the top 20 recipients of USAID funding were American organizations and "these transactions account for 70 percent of the total USAID spending for obligated contracts for the year." Not all assistance flows through USAID, but it accounts for over 60 percent of the total. This pattern began to take shape in the mid 1970s as Washington shifted from financing large infrastructure projects to programs more directly aimed at helping the poor. Technical assistance replaced bricks and mortar. There has been a growing emphasis on health, most significantly the President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). According to a 2013 report on all PEPFAR funding streams, as of 2008, 22 of the top 25 contractors were based in the United States. In 2016, the United States spent about $3.4 billion on health-related programs and about $2.9 billion on humanitarian assistance, according to the government’s website on foreign aid. Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, told us the general pattern of working through the private sector holds across all of the agencies that oversee the aid budget, including the State and Agriculture Departments. "The checks and controls in the procurement system are quite sound," Morris said. "There is this culture of measurement and transparency that is more common today. Our foreign assistance programs are much more steeped in trying to measure what are we getting for our money. We’ve gone beyond protecting against corruption." Our ruling Former USAID administrator Shah said that most U.S. foreign assistance goes to private companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants. According to the Congressional Budget Office, USAID, the government’s largest agency for non-military aid, spends about 4 percent of its funds on direct aid to foreign governments. A trade publication reported that 70 percent of the agency’s money ran through U.S.-based organizations. The use of contracts and grants has grown over the past three decades.

pomt-01681	Says Charlie "Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money."	false	/florida/statements/2014/aug/15/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-charlie-crist-made-it-easier-duke/	Failed nuclear projects by utility provider Duke Energy have suddenly electrified both sides of this year’s gubernatorial campaign. After environmentalist PAC NextGen Climate ran an ad accusing Gov. Rick Scott of not doing anything to stop the North Carolina company from fleecing consumers, the Republican Party of Florida responded with its own commercial pointing fingers at former Gov. Charlie Crist. "Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money," the narrator of the Aug. 12, 2014, ad says. "Crist signed a law helping Duke get billions, while Rick Scott put a stop to the Crist giveaway." PolitiFact Florida already reviewed whether Scott allowed Duke to take ratepayers’ money; we found the claim Half True largely because Scott didn’t say much of anything about the issue. But did Crist have anything to do with the company taking money for doomed nuclear power plant plans? We’ll check this bill line by line. Power play The accusation is based on the twists and turns surrounding the Crystal River nuclear plant and a planned nuclear plant in Levy County that was never built. Duke Energy (which merged with Progress Energy in 2012) had botched required repairs to the existing Crystal River facility and never moved the Levy project out of the planning stage. Thanks to SB 888, which the Legislature passed overwhelmingly in 2006, both companies had been able to charge the state’s 1.7 million Duke customers an "advance fee" to pay for those plants. That bill was signed by Gov. Jeb Bush, though. (Crist was elected in 2006 but didn't take office until 2007.) After it became apparent neither project was going anywhere even while costing Floridians millions, the state amended the law in 2012 with SB 1472, which put a 10-year time limit on the utility companies to start their projects. The state GOP said that’s how Scott stopped "the Crist giveaway," but the measure actually doesn’t affect past collections. Duke decided in 2013 to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fix it. The total cost of the Crystal River project grew to about $1.7 billion from repair work and other expenses. The company also canceled the Levy County project after spending $1.5 billion on it. And yet Duke continued to clamor for more advance fee cash. The Florida Public Service Commission decided in October 2013 to settle with Duke Energy for the two doomed projects. Customers would shoulder $3.2 billion in expenses, insurance would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest. Customers will have to pay monthly charges of $3.45 per 1,000 kilowatt hours for Levy through the early part of 2016 and $2.17 for Crystal River through at least 2017 -- all for two projects that never produced any electricity in exchange for the money paid. The RPOF claim The state GOP told PolitiFact Florida the response ad’s claim was based on then-Gov. Crist signing HB 7135, a 2008 amendment to the original law allowing the advance fee. The portion of the law to which the Republican Party pointed, Section 366.93, was amended to allow the advance fee to be applied to transmission lines to move electricity from power plants to consumers. But as mentioned, Bush signed the original bill, not Crist. Furthermore, Duke Energy didn’t benefit from what Crist approved. "The problem with that argument is that, to the best of our knowledge, Duke never recovered any money related to transmission lines," said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy. "Even though Gov. Crist signed the omnibus energy bill, the provision Scott refers to never played a role in the costs now being borne by Duke Energy customers." Glickman added that one utility company will probably benefit from the inclusion of transmission line planning in the 2008 amendment: Juno Beach-based Florida Power & Light Co., which has 4.4 million customers in the state. Scott and his Cabinet in May approved FPL plans to erect 88 miles of transmission lines for two new reactors in Miami-Dade, despite vocal protests from residents and local officials. The planned lines would include poles that could reach up to 15 stories high and be about 5 feet wide, according to CBS Miami. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said, "Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money." The accusation is about a 2008 amendment to a law that allowed electric providers to charge an advance fee to customers to build or upgrade facilities. The change Crist signed added the planning of transmission lines to the list of approved uses to the fee. There are two big problems with the attack: Jeb Bush signed the original 2006 law, not Crist; and it doesn’t appear Duke Energy ever collected advance fee money to plan transmission lines from its two nuclear projects. Crystal River was an existing plant that didn’t need more, and the Levy County project never made it far enough to consider power lines. If anything, Scott is the one who has allowed a utility company to potentially profit off the change Crist allowed. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05392	"If you put the $47 billion in revenue (raised over 10 years by the Buffett rule) into infrastructure you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/06/sheldon-whitehouse/sheldon-whitehouse-said-47-billion-raised-over-10-/	The Buffett Rule, a proposal to force millionaires to pay federal taxes at a rate of least 30 percent, has turned into a hot-button issue, even if it stands little chance of passage. Formally known as the "Paying A Fair Share Act of 2012," it failed a test vote in the U.S. Senate on April 16 after Republicans blocked it. When its chief sponsor, Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, spoke on the Senate floor about the projected $47 billion it would raise over 10 years, he suggested that the money could be used to rebuild roads and bridges and, in the process, underwrite jobs -- lots of jobs. "The Senate Republican leader has described the bill as yet another proposal from the White House that won't create a single job or lower the price at the pump by a penny," Whitehouse said. "Well, the minority leader is absolutely right that the aim of this bill is not to lower the unemployment rate or the price of gasoline. However, if you put the $47 billion in revenue into infrastructure you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs, and a lot of good infrastructure as well." Earlier in the speech he made the same point: "We could use the $47 billion on badly needed infrastructure projects and create 611,000 jobs nationwide." That's 13,000 jobs for every billion spent, or $76,923 per job. One of our readers pointed out that if you spread that over the 10 years that Whitehouse was talking about, that's only $7,692 per year, or a measly $148 per week, about half the federal poverty level. And that wouldn't include paying the costs of the building materials needed for an infrastructure project. When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson directed us to two documents. It turns out -- based on the first document, a May 2009 report by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) -- that the 13,000 "jobs" aren't jobs. Those are job-years. That's one job lasting one year, a distinction Whitehouse didn't make clear anywhere in his speech. In that study, the CEA forecasts that spending $1 billion would create 10,870 jobs for one year at a cost of $92,000 for each of those one-year jobs. (We'll leave it up to others to decide whether that's a reasonable price to create a single job.) The second document, a notice in the Federal Register from the U.S. Department of Transportation, says in a footnote that the CEA had revised its estimate, concluding that each billion spent on transportation infrastructure would create 13,000 one-year jobs. So if $4.7 billion were raised per year by enactment of the Buffett Rule, that would be, on average, 61,100 jobs for that year. If those people continued to work on those infrastructure projects over the 10-year period, that would still be only 61,100 new jobs, not 611,000. How reliable are these estimates? PolitiFact Ohio looked at this issue on Oct. 26, 2011, when U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette claimed that $1 billion in infrastructure investment translates to 42,000 jobs. That statement was ruled Half True because the estimates were all over the map. LaTourette was citing an old number, used by both Republicans and Democrats, from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration. The newer estimate was 27,800 jobs for every billion spent. Before the recession, a University of Massachusetts study said a billion dollars in infrastructure spending created 18,000 jobs. We put out calls and e-mails to a lot of people asking about the reliability of these numbers, including the Council of Economic Advisers (via the White House), a former member of the council who worked there during the Bush administration, the Cato Institute and several universities. We only received two responses. "This is guesswork at best," and different economists will find such analyses more plausible than others, said Laurence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who served as a senior economist on the CEA during the Reagan era. (He is also running for U.S. president as part of the Americans Elect campaign to nominate a candidate via the Internet.) Arthur Mead, an economist at the University of Rhode Island, said, "You're always going to get a difference of opinion" on how many jobs will be generated if the government cycles money through the economy, known as the multiplier effect. "Depending on how much labor is involved, the size of the multiplier will be different." And while liberal Democrat-leaning economists are more tempted to believe such investments will be a big boost to the economy because there are lots of people looking for work, conservative Republican-leaning economists might think the benefits will be less, fearing it will drive up wages and interest rates. "Each side has an element of truth to it," Mead said. "There's always going to be a difference in terms of how they look at it." Said Larson, the Whitehouse spokesman: "As noted by the FHWA [Federal Highway Administration], these projections change over time. That's why we chose to use the most recent -- and the more conservative -- formula available, which is also the one used by the Obama administration." Our ruling U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said $47 billion raised by the Buffett Rule could finance 611,000 jobs for people rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. But that's not really 611,000 jobs. It's job-years. It's the equivalent of 61,100 people employed full-time for just one year. To get to 611,000, you'd have to fire those 61,000 at the end of the year and then rehire another 61,000, and do that for a total of 10 years. Because he didn't give it a clearer context, the 611,000 is misleading. When we think of a job, it's not working for just one year. Also missing is the fact that these types of estimates -- even from reputable groups cited by both parties -- can vary widely. To his credit, Whitehouse was citing an estimate that translates into fewer jobs than what other sources say. But the certainty of his statement is undercut by the mushiness of the underlying economic projections. Ultimately, if everyone hired with this money stayed on the job for 10 years, Whitehouse would be off by a whopping 549,900 jobs. For that reason, we rate his statement False.

pomt-04950	Taxes on groceries and medicine will rise under a plan to improve roads and rail for metro Atlanta.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/27/vincent-fort/transportatioplan-tax-foe-says-plan-hikes-prices-f/	Opponents of a 1 percent sales tax to overhaul the region’s roads and rail are saying the plan will make it harder for metro Atlantans to buy the things they need the most. It’s downright unfair, said state Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat who represents a district that stretches from East Point through parts of Atlanta. The proposal goes before voters on Tuesday. "We shouldn't be putting a sales tax on people's food and medicine," Fort said in a television news story that aired on CBS Atlanta (WGCL-TV) on July 21. Your PolitiFact Georgia reporters have vetted nearly two dozen claims about the upcoming penny-per-dollar tax, which would raise an estimated $8.5 billion (after inflation) for transportation projects over the next 10 years. But we hadn’t heard Fort’s claim. Will the transportation tax really increase taxes on food and medicine? "It’s not in dispute," Fort told PolitiFact Georgia. Fort said his statement referred to groceries and over-the-counter medicine, and that he was uncertain whether prescription drugs would be taxed under the plan. Later, he called us back to say that a legislative staffer informed him that prescription drugs were exempt. We reviewed state law and consulted with a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Revenue to check Fort’s account. The tax referendum was born out of Georgia’s Transportation Investment Act of 2010, otherwise known as House Bill 277. The bill divided the state into 12 regions so that voters could decide whether to add a 1 percent sales tax to pay for local transportation system upgrades. These regional taxes would have to meet certain criteria, the bill said. One is that the tax would apply to the sale of food and beverages. The sale of "food and food ingredients to an individual consumer for off-premises human consumption" is exempted from the state’s sales tax, but local governments may tax it. Another criteria is that other existing sales tax exemptions would apply. Under current state law, prescription drugs are exempt. The transportation plan would therefore impose a regional tax on groceries such as a loaf of bread or bananas. It also would tax over-the-counter medications such as the aspirin you took for the headache you got from listening to the transportation debate rhetoric. But prescription drugs would remain tax-free. While the bill specifies that groceries will be taxed, it makes sure other items are not. Jet fuel is exempt, as is fuel used for off-road, heavy-duty equipment or locomotives. So are motor fuel and energy used during manufacturing. Fort’s claim holds up well. "Food and medicine" would be taxed under the new plan, just not prescription drugs. Fort got the important stuff right, but he could have been a little more precise and said "non-prescription medicine." Still, he earns a Mostly True.

pomt-08341	Says Republican candidates in key Wisconsin Assembly races "side with those who want to privatize Social Security -- and risk our retirements on Wall Street."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/28/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/group-says-wisconsin-republican-assembly-candidate/	Worried about the future of Social Security? A liberal Wisconsin group is betting you are -- or that it can make you worried before election day. The Greater Wisconsin Committee and its Greater Wisconsin Political Fund are using mailers and radio ads to target Republican candidates in key 2010 races for the Wisconsin Assembly. Democrats outnumber Republicans there, 52 to 46, with one independent. The central theme of the attacks: The GOP Assembly candidates, like their Washington counterparts, want to privatize Social Security. Yes, Social Security, that venerable federal program -- one the state Assembly has no control over. The wording of the attacks varies, but the claims are all similar to this one against Republican Travis Tranel, who is challenging Rep. Phil Garthwaite, D-Dickeyville. "Travis Tranel," a mail piece says, "sides with those who want to privatize Social Security -- and risk our retirements on Wall Street." Lest anyone miss the point, the flier includes a man -- presumably a fat-cat Wall Street banker or investor -- lighting his cigar with a Social Security card that’s been set aflame. There’s also an image of a magnifying glass inviting readers to "check the facts." Why, thank you. We will. Asked to elaborate on her organization’s claims, Greater Wisconsin Committee executive director Michelle McGrorty offered two main points: In the group’s view, "A Roadmap for America’s Future" -- U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to tackle the federal debt and deficits, and make significant changes to taxes, Medicare and Social Security -- would privatize Social Security. Ryan, a Janesville Republican, has ties to the state GOP Assembly candidates targeted by the group. At PolitiFact Wisconsin, this is familiar ground. We gave Pants on Fire ratings to claims that GOP congressional candidates backed privatizing Social Security, when Democrats provided no proof beyond a sliced-and-diced statement and a two-word answer taken out of context. Now state Assembly candidates? This could get good. Let’s start with Ryan’s "Roadmap," a plan that has helped put Ryan on the political map, but one that does not have universal support among the GOP leadership in Washington. PolitiFact National examined the roadmap in August 2010, after President Barack Obama alluded to it in saying GOP leaders are backing privatization plans that would tie Social Security benefits "to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market." If adopted, Ryan’s plan would enable workers under 55 to, voluntarily, invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in funds managed by the government. As Politifact National noted: "That's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security." So, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is starting off on the wrong road with its claim about the roadmap. As for the ties to Ryan, this is old-fashioned guilt by association ... and there ain’t much association, at least when it comes to the Social Security issue. Tranel, a Cuba City dairy farmer, is making his second attempt to unseat Garthwaite, a second-term Assembly Democrat. The mail piece that claims he "sides with those who want to privatize Social Security" says its proof is a newspaper article. In the article, Tranel expresses admiration for Ryan -- but there’s no mention of Social Security. Dennis Clinard, a retired U.S. Army master sergeant from Cataract, is seeking to unseat first-term Rep. Mark Radcliffe, D-Black River Falls. A flier says "Washington politicians who wants (sic) to privatize Social Security are the fund-raising muscle behind" Clinard’s campaign. The proof listed in the flier is Ryan’s appearance at a fundraiser for Clinard. It took in $7,250, according to a state GOP official, or about 15 percent of the $46,357 Clinard’s campaign has raised in 2010. Howard Marklein, a Wilson Creek accountant, is running for an open seat against Mineral Point Democrat John Simonson, a retired University of Wisconsin-Platteville economics professor. A mail piece says Marklein is "backed by Washington, D.C., politicians who want to privatize Social Security." McGrorty said the proof is a picture of Ryan and Marklein on Marklein’s campaign website. We could go on. A GWC radio ad says some tea party candidates want to eliminate Social Security and "we have one right here, this guy Jack Cummings." Cummings, an Endeavor farmer, is challenging first-term Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo. McGrorty’s defense: The ad talks about a number of issues and doesn’t say that Cummings wants to eliminate Social Security. Hmmm .... "We have one right here." (Assembly Democrat Ted Zigmunt of Francis Creek also uses a flier to accuse his Republican opponent, Andre Jacque, of supporting privatization of Social Security. A campaign aide cited Jacque’s endorsement by the Republican Liberty Caucus, but no statement Jacque has made about Social Security.) How do the targeted candidates respond to all of this? Brian Pleva, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Republican Assembly Campaign Committee, said none of them supports -- or has made statements in support of -- privatizing or eliminating Social Security. Why would they? They’re not running for Congress. In any case, we could not find any such statements. And the Greater Wisconsin Committee could not provide any. Indeed, on two of the fliers, one of the check-our-facts citations is a report by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. The report predicts cuts in Social Security benefits would result from Ryan’s plan, but that doesn’t address the question of privatization, and the report doesn’t mention the targeted candidates. If you’re sensing a theme here, so are we. In targeting Republicans in races that could shift the balance of power in the state Assembly, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is taking a page from the national Democratic playbook -- and misusing it. To play to fears of seniors and others, the group labels a proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, as privatizing Social Security. Even if the plan did privatize Social Security (in our view it does not), the group has offered no evidence that the GOP Assembly candidates back it. The "proof" cited borders on absurd: One candidate praised Ryan, one got his picture taken with him and a third had Ryan appear at his campaign fundraiser. Is that cigar still burning? If not, we need a light, because the ruling is Pants on Fire.	None	Greater Wisconsin Committee	None	None	None	2010-10-28T09:00:00	2010-10-27	['None']
pomt-06712	"H.B. 194, the Voter Suppression Bill, invalidates a vote where a voter properly marks the ballot in support of a particular candidate, but also writes in the name of that same candidate."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/02/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-state-approved-voter-legisla/	A sweeping election reform bill the GOP-controlled Ohio legislature recently passed has stirred widespread opposition. Democrats have even called it the Voter Suppression Bill. In that spirit, opponents have initiated an effort to repeal the law, House Bill 194, through a voter referendum. U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Warrensville Heights, sent an email to her supporters on Aug. 22 asking for help collecting the 231,147 valid signatures of registered voters required to put the law on the ballot in November 2012. The signatures must be submitted by Sept. 29 or the law will take effect. In her email, Fudge laid out several changes the bill makes that she opposes. "HB 194, the Voter Suppression Bill, invalidates a vote where a voter properly marks the ballot in support of a particular candidate, but also writes in the name of that same candidate," Fudge wrote. Invalidating a vote, especially when the voter’s intent is clear, definitely is an issue worth examining. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Fudge’s claim as she pushes for the law’s repeal. The section of HB 194 dealing with a redundant write-in vote represents only a small portion of the massive bill. It is clear, however, this piece of the law is not as clear-cut as Fudge conveyed in her email. The bill defines a ballot as "contrary to law" – such ballots are tossed and not counted – "if the voter marks the ballot for a candidate and also writes in the name of the candidate as a write-in vote," according the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission’s analysis of the bill. However, the bill lays out a scenario in which such a ballot would be counted. Three conditions must be satisfied. First, the ballots must be centrally counted (we’ll explain this shortly). Next, the write-in name on the ballot must be the same as the candidate marked on the ballot. Finally, at least three of four board of elections members must agree that the name on the ballot is "identical" to the name the voter wrote in. Daniel Tokaji, an election law expert at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, gave us a quick explanation of the first requirement. He said the reference to centrally counted ballots is another way of referring to absentee ballots. The law singles out absentee ballots because voting machines at the polls are supposed to notify voters if their ballot has a redundant write-in vote. But some voting machines allow voters to override the notification and submit the ballot with the extra write-in. Those ballots will not be counted, said Matt McClellan, a spokesman at the Ohio secretary of state’s office. Now to the stickier part. The elections board in each of Ohio’s 88 counties has four members – two Democrats and two Republicans. If an absentee ballot contains an extra write-in, the bill says three of the four board members must agree that the write-in is "identical" to the candidate’s name on the ballot. That means the ballot would not be counted if the board deadlocks. "We can easily imagine this leading to shenanigans," said Tokaji, who has been outspoken in his opposition to HB 194. Tokaji described a potential situation in which the voter’s intent was clear, but two board members of the same political party refused to agree the write-in vote is identical to the candidate’s name on the ballot. "Under these circumstances, the ballot would not be counted," Tokaji wrote in an email. The Ohio Democratic Party, which responded for Fudge because the party sent out the email on her behalf, raised similar concerns about the write-in provision of HB 194. Seth Bringman, a spokesman for the party, wondered if an elections board would consider a write-in identical to the ballot if the voter wrote "Marsha Fudge" and the ballot listed her name as "Marcia L. Fudge." "While there are some circumstances in which a vote would count if a voter selected a candidate and also wrote in the name of that same candidate, such a case is the exception under the bill, not the norm," Bringman wrote in an email. Tokaji reached a similar conclusion. "The bottom line is that in some, but not all, circumstances, a ballot which has both a mark and the name of the candidate written in should be counted. Which is, of course, not to say that it will in fact be counted," Tokaji wrote in an email. That some ballots could be counted, though, is a point of clarification for Fudge’s statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification rates Mostly True.	None	Marcia Fudge	None	None	None	2011-09-02T06:00:00	2011-08-22	['None']
pomt-10736	"My husband has not withheld a single document."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/10/hillary-clinton/why-withhold-when-you-can-delay/	When Hillary Clinton says her husband isn't withholding any documents, she's technically correct. But she doesn't mean "withholding" in the layman's sense of "to refrain from giving." In fact, former President Clinton is exercising his right to review his White House records before they are made public, and that has delayed the release of thousands of pages of records. In the world of presidential records, "withhold" has a specific meaning. It means a former president raises an objection to a document's release and blocks it from being made public. So far, President Clinton hasn't done that. Here's how it works: When a president leaves office, the records of his administration go to the National Archives. After five years, the records are generally subject to public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Professional archivists determine which records should be publicly available, and the current and former presidents are able to review them as well. The former president is given another seven years — in Bill Clinton's case, until 2012 — to review records and claim exemptions. Under the provisions of FOIA and the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the exemptions include matters of national security and national defense; invasions of personal privacy such as personnel or medical records; federal appointments; proprietary commercial or financial information; and confidential communications between the president and his advisers. To withhold a document, Bill Clinton would have to assert that a document falls under one of those protected categories. However, the former president can take as long as he wishes to review the records, and there's nothing to stop him or his designee from being especially slow about reviewing documents he'd rather not see made public. Even if you don't presume such cynical motives, it's true that President Clinton could be making documents available more quickly by speeding up his own review. We're withholding a True despite Clinton's technical accuracy because most people who hear her statement will take it to mean the former president isn't holding documents back that could be released, and that's not the whole story. We rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-11-10T00:00:00	2007-11-04	['None']
pomt-05119	Says, "Yet in Salem they have traditionally waited until the money is almost gone to pay for the most important things in our state’s budget."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/26/shawn-lindsay/does-salem-traditionally-wait-until-money-almost-g/	Education is pretty much always in vogue in Salem, with politicians clamoring they are for it, not against it. For example, Rep. Shawn Lindsay, R-Hillsboro, issued a press release last week, highlighting support from local school board members. He strongly believes that the K-12 budget should be approved early in the legislative session, say March or April, so that districts can start making plans. "Families across Oregon set priorities and pay for the most important things out of their bank accounts first, not last," noted Lindsay (in the release). "Yet in Salem they have traditionally waited until the money is almost gone to pay for the most important things in our state’s budget." That didn’t sound right. Lawmakers, as far as we know, do not parcel out money on a vote-as-they-go process. Instead, chief budget negotiators on the Joint Ways and Means Committee have a rough idea of how much they can spend for the next two years, and they start piecing the puzzle, knowing they have a minimum for some programs. In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Lindsay said the Legislature has a history of approving budgets for lesser needs -- natural resources, employment department, housing -- before passing a K-12 schools budget. He thinks the process should be reversed. "The education budget is held until late in the session after less important budgets have been pushed out early. Those less important budgets are pushed out early so there’s less money in the coffers," he said. Again, that continues to sound inaccurate. We turned to Ken Rocco, Oregon’s legislative fiscal officer. He’s the person who works with legislative budget co-chairs to piece together a spending plan for Oregon, a job he’s done for a long time. The 2011-13 general fund and lottery budget, for some perspective, is nearly $15 billion with $5.7 billion for K-12 schools. Rocco confirmed what PolitiFact Oregon suspected. Lawmakers know roughly what they have to spend. If they agree to a budget figure for K-12, that needs to fit within an overall budget that contains enough money to keep prisons open, provide social and health services, and pay for the state patrol. In other words, no individual budget exists in a vacuum. "You need to have an overall plan," Rocco said. "You can pass the K-12 budget first, but you still need to know what that leaves for the rest of state government." Schools have been receiving a shrinking share of general fund and lottery money, as other needs have grown. There’s no question there’s politics in budgeting, as legislators fight over issues such as compensation, regulations and standards. And there have been legislative sessions when K-12 was among, if not, the last budget to pass -- but not because that was all the money that was left over in the end. We leave you with one final thought before our ruling. In 2011, lawmakers approved a schools budget early in the session, allowing the governor to sign it in April. But Lindsay did not vote for it. He said that while the early approval gave certainty to school districts, the amount was inadequate in his opinion. Do legislators in Salem traditionally wait "until the money is almost gone" to pay for important programs, such as schools? They do not. Lindsay paints an inaccurate picture of the budgeting process. We rate the statement False.	None	Shawn Lindsay	None	None	None	2012-06-26T17:00:30	2012-06-21	['None']
