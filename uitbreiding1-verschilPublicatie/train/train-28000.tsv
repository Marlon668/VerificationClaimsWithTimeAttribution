pomt-14040	"No one in American history has moved from a June 16 announcement to a May 26 winning of a majority. Trump's achievement is remarkable."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/may/27/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-offends-history-claims-trumps-timeli/	Donald Trump’s rapid ascension from reality TV star and businessman to presumptive Republican nominee is truly historic, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga, said in a post on Twitter. Shortly after Trump secured enough delegates to officially clinch the GOP nomination, Gingrich extolled Trump in a post on social media. "No one in American history has moved from a June 16 announcement to a May 26 winning of a majority," Gingrich told his 1.55 million followers. "Trump's achievement is remarkable." Many do see Trump’s victory as remarkable. And Gingrich would have been on firmer ground had he stuck to the narrative of Trump's ascension rather than focusing on the timeline. But the speed at which Trump went from his announcement at Trump Tower to becoming the GOP standard bearer isn’t a remarkable achievement. Trump announced his candidacy for president June 16, 2015, in New York, and officially clinched the GOP nomination May 26, 2016, after 29 unbound delegates said they would support Trump. That’s a span of 346 days, if you include May 26. We didn’t have too look too far to find shorter spans for non-incumbents. John Kerry in 2004 John Kerry didn’t announce his run for the White House until Sept. 2, 2003, and he clinched the Democratic nomination May 5, 2004. That’s a speedy 246-day window. George W. Bush in 2000 Republicans, too, have been much quicker. George W. Bush announced his run for the White House June 12, 1999. He clinched the GOP nomination after the primaries of March 15, 2000, a span of 278 days. Al Gore in 2000 In the same election, Al Gore needed a little less time. Gore announced his run June 16, 1999, while clinching the same day as Bush, March 15, 2000. That’s 274 days. Bob Dole in 1996 Bob Dole, a senator from Kansas, announced his campaign April 10, 1995, and clinched the Republican nomination March 19, 1996. That’s 345 days, one fewer than it took Trump. Bill Clinton in 1992 Bill Clinton announced his campaign for president Oct. 3, 1991. Even though he didn’t clinch the Democratic nomination until June 2, 1992, he still only needed a total of 244 days — more than 100 days quicker than Trump. For the record, Trump took a few weeks less than Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008, and he easily bested Barack Obama, who needed about 16 months in 2008. A spokesman for Gingrich, Ross Worthington, said Gingrich's point was that no one has won the nomination from a standing-start in such a short period. "The other nominees you mention did not begin running for president on their announcement day," Worthington said. "Instead, they were clearly running, or at least preparing to run, for months or even years before they made an official announcement. They all had significant preexisting political operations and held significant political offices. The achievement that Newt is referring to is starting from zero to winning the nomination outright." Our ruling Speaking of Trump’s path to becoming the 2016 GOP standard-bearer, Gingrich said: "No one In American history has moved from a June 16 announcement to a May 26 winning of a majority." Whatever Gingrich was trying to say, it didn't come out quite right. As one person replied to the former speaker on Twitter, "This tweet sounds smart and impressive if someone doesn't have Google." Of the last eight non-incumbent presidential nominees, five (Kerry, Gore, Bush, Dole and Clinton) went from announcing their candidacy to becoming the presumptive nominee quicker than Trump.

pomt-07399	Says Florida is one of a few or perhaps the only state "that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/29/chris-dorworth/comparing-floridas-growth-management-laws-others-a/	Here's a secret about floor sessions of the Florida House of Representatives -- they can get pretty repetitive. Most legislators ask questions about bills that they already know the answers to, and are simply asking the questions to make political points. Most amendments offered by Democrats in the GOP-dominated body fail. And most always, a bill's fate is known well ahead of time. But for hours, members go through a ritualistic sparring that -- to the first-time viewer -- can look unscripted. We start with that description, because we fact-checkers must admit to sometimes being guilty of tuning it all out. That is, until, our name is being called. The situation occurred on April 21, 2011, during a debate about a bill that would ease the amount of oversight the state Department of Community Affairs has over local land use issues. HB 7129 was going to pass, after all. The debate was academic. But Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, shook us awake with his floor remarks advocating on behalf of the bill. "This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do," he said. "I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state." First off, thanks, Rep. Dorworth, for the plug. The issue here is the state Department of Community Affairs' ability to review local comprehensive plans and amendments, and more specifically, to determine whether or not they are in compliance with state growth management laws. If the DCA finds a local comprehensive plan not in compliance, a judge is asked to settle the discrepancy. Dorworth and others want to relax that oversight, believing it can be unnecessary and burdensome. As Dorworth suggested, he also believes it's a one-of-a-kind standard in the United States. HB 7129 prescribes a more-streamlined process that attempts to cut the DCA review period in half, and strip some of the power the state agency now has to object to local land use decisions. We let Dorworth know that we were taking his challenge to fact-check his claim, and he said he has asked 10 different times if another state has Florida's system of review. "No one seemed to know," he told us. "People said Oregon has something like ours, but then they said that it's not the same." Understanding Florida's system Without getting too technical, we're not talking about a state review of every land use decision a local government makes (Dorworth oversimplified things in his original statement, which we will factor in when making our ruling). We're talking about comprehensive plans, which offer rough guidance on how a community can develop over time. The plan and corresponding maps let you know where the agricultural land in an area is -- and what someone can possibly build there -- and where a city defines its urban core and what can go along with that. As municipalities grow, they sometimes want or are asked to redraw their plans to accommodate more dense development. A common example would be wanting to designate agricultural or rural land for a more intense use. Florida has a very prescribed process for that, which includes time for the state to review the amendment and public hearings at the local level. (Here's a flow chart to help you follow.) If the local government approves the amendment, DCA then decides whether it is in compliance with state law. If the DCA deems the amendment is not in compliance, the local government is often asked to alter its plan, or to take the matter to court. In a contentious case, it's a judge who ultimately decides whether or not the amendment is permitted. The system in other states Rather than checking the 49 other states individually to see whether Dorworth is correct, we got a road map of places to examine from Stuart Meck, an associate research professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has written about state planning. He said several states, including Florida, had some level of state review of local land use decisions -- though the level of oversight varied. At each stop, we asked state planners or planning experts what other states might include stringent reviews of some local planning decisions. Most all states have some sort of appellate review of planning decisions, whether it's through the state government or through the courts, or both. But as we searched over the course of a week, we built a final list of suspects that most mirror Florida. They are the states of Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Vermont and Rhode Island. In the Northeast, Vermont and Rhode Island have similar laws that give the state oversight over land use decisions, but only if local governments want to participate in state development grant programs. It's a carrot approach, said Jared Rhodes, the chief of Rhode Island's Division of Planning. In Rhode Island, a state review of local comprehensive plan amendments is essentially required, Rhodes said. But if the state does not approve of the amendment, it is still considered valid. "A state denial does not necessarily put the brakes on it," he said. In Vermont, municipalities have the option of submitting plans and plan amendments to state-created regional planning commissions. Local governments that receive approvals from the regional planning commissions can then be eligible for state grant funding, said Joss Besse, the director of community planning with the Vermont Department of Housing and Community Affairs. In Washington, local governments are required to send prospective land use changes to the state's Department of Commerce for review. But the state provides only technical assistance and does not override local decisions. "State agency written correspondence will not state that local plans are out of compliance with the (growth management act)," the state says on its website. "State agencies may express concerns, but conclusory statements as to compliance will be avoided." Oregon's rules -- which were created in 1973 -- are more stringent, and built the framework for Florida's law, former DCA secretary Tom Pelham told us. All Oregon cities and counties are required to have a comprehensive plan, and those plans must be approved by a seven-member state board. That was finished by 1985, said Bob Rindy, senior policy analyst and legislative coordinator with the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development. But when plans are amended, Rindy said, typically there is not much oversight. Local plan amendments are considered finalized 21 days after they are adopted by the local government unless someone appeals. Appeals, which can be initiated by the state or other affected parties, are first heard by a state Land Use Board of Appeals and then could enter the state court system. The rules are different, though, when local jurisdictions seek to expand their urban growth boundaries. Those expansions need the approval of the state, Rindy said. "When cities try and move out into farmland to grow larger, then the state has oversight over the decision how much they expand that boundary by," he said. "That's one of the things that puts us in the limelight." And then there is Hawaii, which by our estimation has the most state-level oversight of planning decisions -- even more so than in Florida. The state of Hawaii's Land Use Commission holds sweeping power over granting development rights outside the urban centers of the island chain, said David L. Callies, Kudo Professor of Law at the University of Hawaii, who was written a book about Hawaii's system for land use planning. The commission, appointed by the governor, decides whether land should be classified Agriculture, Conservation, Urban or Rural. Only in the Urban district, which makes up less than 4 percent of land in the state, do local land use controls like zoning apply without shared authority by the Land Use Commission, Callies said. If property owners wish to reclassify their land in order to develop it, they must receive the permission of the Land Use Commission. Callies said the commission generally accepts large-lot development projects in the Agriculture district. But, if "your land is in Conservation, you almost have no chance." Callies says the system is the most regulated in the country, and that going from raw land to completed development could take 10 years. Our ruling This is a tough claim to rule on for a couple of reasons. First, Dorworth oversimplified things when he said Florida reviews local land use decisions. The state review is of changes to comprehensive plans. Second, Dorworth said only that he might be right that Florida is the only state in the country with a state review procedure. Our analysis shows that Florida has a unique form of state review, but it's not the only state to have some oversight. Some are certainly less stringent. Vermont and Rhode Island offer incentives to provide oversight, while Washington offers just technical assistance to local governments. Oregon is similar in that major changes -- in its case, an expansion of the urban service boundary -- require state approval. And Hawaii has a system with a great amount of state oversight. Here's what Dorworth said: "This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do. I think we might be the only (state) in the United States of America that has a statewide review of local land use and zoning decisions. And that means we are 50th, or 49th at worst, in terms of the fact that we have to get our local decisions approved through the state." If you look at each sentence, Dorworth's first sentence is largely true, his second sentence is really not (except for adding might), and his third sentence is somewhere in between. The best way to explain this, perhaps, is to say that many states have procedures to review some local planning decisions, but Florida has more regulatory authority than most states.

pomt-00721	The recently passed transportation funding bill is a billion-dollar tax increase for Georgians.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/27/debbie-dooley/maybe-not-today-and-maybe-under-different-name-tax/	Ever since Georgia voters roundly rejected regional sales taxes to fund road and transit projects in 2012, state leaders have pledged to take the lead on transportation. The Legislature made good on that promise this year with House Bill 170. Awaiting the governor’s signature, the measure is projected to raise nearly $670 million in transportation funding next year, by moving the state from a series of sales and excise taxes on gasoline to a single excise tax. That plus a mix of new fees for drivers of electric car and heavy trucks, the end of a popular tax credit for electric cars and a $5 per-night fee on hotel/motel stays, is expected to generate close to $1 billion a year to tackle the state’s backlog of transportation projects. "That is really what all of this has been about --- finding sensible and fair ways to make our transportation network better and keep Georgia moving forward," House Transportation Committee chair Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, wrote in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Not that everyone was on board. Sen. Mike Crane, R-Newnan called the bill a "midnight run" on taxpayers. Debbie Dooley, who led part of the opposition to the 2012 sales tax referendum as chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party, echoed that language on her Twitter page. "GA Republicans just pulled a midnight run on taxpayers and passed a billion-dollar tax increase with a rushed vote giving only 2 hours," Dooley posted on March 31. Is that right? Does the long-awaited transportation plan translate into a massive tax hike? And with that, PolitiFact Georgia waded into the squishy semantics of what counts as a "tax" and what is a "fee." In public policy terms, a broad swath of people pay taxes, for broad services, even if they don’t use them. Homeowners pay property taxes to local governments, for instance, to fund police and fire departments they may never need. Fees, meanwhile, are charged for the use of a facility, service or good that government provides. Your federal taxes help fund national parks but you still pay a fee to camp under the stars. That much is clear. Where the lines blur is when politicos and journalists begin using the terms interchangeably. House Bill 170, for instance, refers to the state’s gas tax. The money paid by Leaf drivers, or hotel visitors? Those are called fees. But to public policy folks, the gas tax is more like a fee, said Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who specializes in budget and finance issues. That’s because you can opt out of owning a car, never buy a gallon of gas and still benefit from others picking up the tab, making what they pay a fee. And to complicate things further? You can pay a tax and a fee at the same time. Don’t own a car but need some gas for your lawn mower? You aren’t using the road to drive but you still pay for the product. "A lot of it is semantics," Neuby said. "It’s a tax increase, or additional fees if you use certain things. To some people, that’s splitting hairs. Any time government extracts money from your pocket, folks tend to see it as a tax, even if it isn’t." There is not, in economic circles, a clear or bright line between the two terms. After all, the gas tax could be a user fee if only motorists paid it. But to an economist, if a 10-year-old walks to Dairy Queen for an ice cream cone, the price will include the cost of getting the treat’s ingredients to the store, said William J. Smith, the economics department chairman at the University of West Georgia. "Any good or service you purchase that involves transportation will involve the gas tax," Smith said. "So that’s why it’s so hard to say with any conviction that any one thing is either a tax or a fee." All told, both expert realms lend some credibility to Dooley, and the public, seeing the transportation bill as a giant tax hike. But that refers to the language distinction. Math math, however, does not fully back up claims about a tax increase. Jared Walczak, an analyst with the right-leaning Tax Foundation, examined Georgia’s gas tax at PolitiFact Georgia’s request. The current mixed system includes a 7.5 cent per gallon excise tax, a 4 percent sales tax and, generally a 3-4 percent local tax. The effective rate: 26.5 cents per gallon, based on the current AAA fuel price of $2.37 a gallon. And with the elimination of the local and state sales taxes and jump in excise tax? At today’s prices, motorists would pay 26 cents a gallon in taxes. The break-even point would be gas prices at $2.65 a gallon, Walczak said. And those calculations do not include the local option, which could add an additional 1 percent sales tax after a public vote. But because the bill also will index the excise tax to inflation, the amount paid is projected to go up over time, as the cost of living gradually rises. The state’s amended fiscal note acknowledges that index in its projections. The impact of the gas tax in 2016 will be up to $668 million. By 2020, the tax could generate as much as $867 million. "Some people will pay more under this proposal. Those who drive a heavy truck, those who drive an alternative vehicle, will certainly pay more immediately," Walczak said. "Certain others may pay less or identical amounts at this juncture, but in succeeding years that burden will be indexed to inflation and is apt to increase." Dooley said that conclusion remains the same, regardless of the semantic dispute. The Tea Party understood the need for transportation funding, she said. Members supported the bill repealing a jet fuel tax exemption for Delta, estimated to bring in $21 million this year and up to about $32 million in 2020. By not looking at other tax incentives to cut – such as credits given to the movie industry or breaks that helped lure Mercedes Benz USA’s headquarters – lawmakers ensured most Georgians will pay more for the necessary work, she said. "They are increasing the burden on everyday motorists in Georgia while giving out all of these subsidies to businesses," Dooley said. ""They can call it a fee all they like, but if it raises revenue like this does, it’s a tax," Experts quibble over the semantic distinction. And at least in the short term, people will pay slightly less, or about the same, on the tax that is the biggest piece of the funding overhaul. But over time, the experts agree that the burden on taxpayers will increase. The distinction between a tax and a fee brings it down a notch, but we rate Dooley’s statement about a "billion dollar tax increase" to be Mostly True.

pomt-12122	Says Sen. Bill Nelson "has aligned himself with communists and dictators," "went to Venezuela to admire Chávez’s revolution" and "supports murderers."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2017/aug/17/national-republican-senatorial-committee/ridiculous-statement-republicans-radio-ad-says-sen/	A national Republican group is misleading Miami voters with a radio ad that says U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson "supports murderers," pointing to the Democrat’s positions on Cuba and Venezuela. The crisis in Venezuela could become an issue for Florida candidates in 2018, including Nelson, who is expected to face a challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott. The Spanish-language ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacks Nelson for meeting with then-Venezuela President Hugo Chávez in 2005 and tries to link Nelson to Chávez’s successor, Nicolas Maduro, and the Castro brothers of Cuba. Here’s part of the script in English: "In the past, (Nelson) has aligned himself with communists and dictators. Look at him with Cuba. He supported Obama when he negotiated with the other terrorists, the Castro brothers. When Nelson supports the Castros, that only reinforces and encourages others, like it did with Chávez’s and now with Maduro. In 2005, Bill Nelson even visited Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Here it says Nelson went to Venezuela to admire Chávez’s revolution. If Bill Nelson supports murderers, I can’t support Bill Nelson." The fact that Nelson met with Chávez and supported Obama’s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba is by no means evidence that Nelson "supports murderers" or admired Chávez’s revolution. In fact, Nelson has repeatedly criticized the leadership of both Venezuela and Cuba. Nelson met with Chávez in 2005 but didn’t show admiration When we asked for evidence of the ad’s claims, an NRSC spokeswoman pointed to a Miami Herald article about a 2005 meeting between Nelson and Chávez. In January 2005, Nelson and two other U.S. senators on the Foreign Relations Committee -- Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. and Lincoln Chafee R-R.I. -- met with Chávez in Caracas. In addition to Venezuela, the senators traveled to Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru to discuss counterterrorism, counter-narcotics and economic issues. The senators discussed with Chávez concerns about his relationship with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), though Nelson also described the session as "very friendly (in) tone." Senators "made a point of emphasizing the need for a fresh start in the often troubled relationship between Washington and Chávez's government," the Herald wrote. An NRSC spokeswoman also pointed to a September 2006 editorial in Investor’s Business Daily that describes trips taken by Nelson as "junkets to Venezuela to admire Chávez's ‘revolution’ in his dog and pony shows." But the article included no evidence that Nelson admired Chávez’s revolution. There is evidence of Nelson, however, criticizing Chávez over his new media laws, private property seizures and pro-Chávez judicial appointments in a 2005 op-ed. "While we cannot accept Chávez's duplicity, his anti-democratic consolidation of power or his ties to Cuba, dialogue between the United States and Venezuela is needed to help avoid the real possibility of a disruption in the relationship with our fourth-largest oil supplier," he wrote. Nelson repeatedly criticized Chávez Other have called Nelson a frequent critic of Chávez. In 2004, the Miami Herald described Nelson as being "perhaps Chávez's fiercest critic in Congress." Nelson called on the federal government to investigate terrorist operations in Venezuela and called Chávez a "serious threat" governing in "an increasingly autocratic manner" and "unfriendly to the civilized world." In April 2014, Nelson held a joint press conference with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio to call for stepped-up attention to Venezuela for repressing political protests. "It's time to stand up and speak out," he said. In July 2017, after Maduro won re-election in which what has been described as a fraudulent vote, Nelson urged sanctions. "It's time that we consider cutting the imports of Venezuelan oil," Nelson said in a Senate Floor speech. "We are now dealing with a Cuban-style dictator." "Maduro has made himself dictator, and he and his cronies are bent on turning Venezuela's once-vibrant democracy and once-vibrant economy into a Cuban-style regime," he said. Nelson supported normalizing relations with Cuba but criticized Castro Nelson supported Obama’s move in December 2014 to normalize relations with Cuba, but he called for Castro to expand freedoms. The Republicans point to an article about Nelson speaking on CNN after Obama’s announcement. He described the day as "Hallelujah Day," as American Alan Gross was released from Cuba prison as part of the agreement. Nelson described himself as "anti-Castro" but saw Obama’s decision as a step in the right direction. In July 2015 when the U.S. and Cuba opened embassies, Nelson supported the move but continued to criticize Castro. "I still distrust Castro, but we have to get that regime to open up, stop human rights abuses, and give the Cuban people their basic freedoms," he said in a statement. The records of Chávez, Maduro and Castro The ad says that Nelson "supports murderers," which appears to be a reference to Chávez, Maduro and the Castro brothers. The leaders have been associated with political violence of different types. Sebastian A. Arcos, associate director at the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said the Castro brothers have a well-documented history of politically motivated killings beginning in the early months of the Cuban Revolution and extending to recent years. "Chávez and Maduro do not have the Castro’s record of politically motivated killings," he said. "Under their collective rule, however, Venezuela has suffered a significant spike in the murder rate, already high before Chávez came to power. In addition, Maduro has been responsible for over 100 dead while repressing anti-government demonstrations." Andy Gomez, interim director of the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies, called the attack on Nelson "absolutely silly." "Bill Nelson has always been anti-Castro and anti-Chávez and Maduro, the record speaks for itself," he said. "Does the U.S. ever take positions, or any senator including Bill (Nelson), approving atrocities being made to the people? Absolutely not. Has Sen. Nelson ever supported any of these guys? Absolutely not." Our ruling The NRSC radio ad says Nelson "has aligned himself with communists and dictators," "went to Venezuela to admire Chávez’s revolution" and "supports murderers." Though Nelson did visit Venezuela with other senators in 2005, he also repeatedly criticized Chávez in 2004 and 2005, calling him a "serious threat" and raised concerns about his property seizures, judicial appointments and "anti-democratic consolidation of power," as well as his ties to Cuba. Nelson has also been critical of Maduro, including the recent election, which he called a "sham." While Nelson agreed with Obama’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba in 2014, Nelson called for democratic reforms. This ad grossly distorts Nelson’s record about his visit with Chávez and about his record on the leadership of Venezuela and Cuba. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12517	Illegal immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border is "the lowest in 17 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/25/donald-trump/illegal-immigration-lowest-17-years-trump-said/	President Donald Trump hasn’t been decisive on whether he’d sign a spending bill that did not include funding for his promised border wall. But he raised a related topic in an interview with the Associated Press: declining illegal immigration. "People want the border wall … They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down. ... That's a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower," Trump said in the April 21 interview, which we fact-checked. Trump’s wording did not specify what was the lowest in 17 years, but similar comments made by others in his administration indicate he was referring to apprehensions at the southwest border by border patrol agents. Historical data from Border Patrol show that Trump’s claim is accurate. Southwest border apprehensions Trump has used different timeframes to make a case that fewer people are attempting to cross into the United States illegally. He’s looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there’s been a 64 percent decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016 to say it’s gone down 61 percent; and said there was a 40 percent decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data show that in March 2017 agents made 12,193 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. It is the lowest number in at least 17 years, according to monthly southwest border apprehension numbers since fiscal year 2000. Apprehension data is generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. Experts have told us that Trump’s rhetoric has played a role in deterring illegal immigration, perhaps more so than his newly issued policies, which may take longer to implement on the ground. "The recent dip in apprehensions likely does signify a trend, in particular as apprehensions typically rise in March and early spring," said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that researches migration. It’s still to be determined if it’s a temporary lull or a lasting decline, "but at this point it seems clear that would-be migrants are concerned about rising enforcement not just at the border but within the United States," Mittelstadt said. Apprehensions at the southwest border peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) but began a declining trend during the 2008-09 recession that has continued since, Mittelstadt said. Aside from policies and enforcement in the United States, factors in Mexico have contributed to lower apprehension numbers, Mittelstadt said, among them: lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. Trump isn’t the only one who has said the numbers are declining; Democrats have cited the same point. During the Democratic National Convention we rated Mostly True a claim by U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. that fewer people were crossing the southwest border than in the last three decades. More recently, Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr., of Michigan, also said apprehension rates had plummeted and that numbers for Mexicans caught by Border Patrol had reached their lowest point in nearly half a century. That also rated Mostly True. Mittelstadt, from Migration Policy Institute, noted that as the number of Mexicans apprehended has gone down recently, about one-third of apprehensions last year were Central American unaccompanied minors and families seeking refuge in the United States – presenting themselves to immigration authorities instead of evading detection. Apprehensions of Central Americans outnumbered those of Mexicans in 2014 and 2016. "Amid overall declining unauthorized inflows, the Obama administration prioritized putting more people in formal removal proceedings rather than permitting voluntary return, which increases the range of punishments for those seeking to re-enter illegally," Mittelstadt said. "And during the Obama administration, as occurred with prior administrations, sizable new border enforcement resources were provided by Congress." Our ruling Trump said illegal immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border is "the lowest in 17 years." Border Patrol data support Trump’s claim. In March, Border Patrol recorded 12,193 apprehensions at the southwest border, the lowest in at least 17 years. It’s worth noting that apprehension rates have been declining since the recession, and significantly so since their peak of 1.6 million in 2000. Overall, we rate Trump’s claim True.

pomt-08875	The Bush administration "pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/03/paul-krugman/number-deployed-iraq-and-afghanistan-show-one-war-/	The war in Afghanistan was the main topic on This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Aug. 1, 2010. Liberal economist Paul Krugman noted that ongoing problems in Afghanistan should actually be pinned on the Bush administration. "You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, 'We can't abandon Afghanistan,' all that," Krugman said. "I'm surprised that people aren't pointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan was taken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was on the run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead. And now you're asking Obama to recover from a situation where we've spent eight years losing credibility." We were interested in fact-checking Krugman's statement that "the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead." To do this, we checked troop levels in Afghanistan from eight years ago, using monthly estimated numbers provided by the Department of Defense. (We're counting just U.S. troops here, not NATO forces.) What we found is that troop levels were basically static during the invasion and occupation of Iraq. But we were surprised by the relatively small number of troops that were in Afghanistan eight years ago. In October 2002, there were approximately 9,500 troops there. A year later, in October 2003, that number had increased slightly to 10,400. Meanwhile, in Iraq in October 2003, there were 130,800 troops. In Afghanistan, the number of U.S. troops stayed below 20,000 for all of 2003, 2004 and 2005. In 2006, it hit a high for the year of 23,300 in April. President George W. Bush announced a surge for Iraq in 2007. The number of troops in Iraq climbed above 60,000, while U.S. troops in Afghanistan hovered between 10,000 and 11,000. In 2008, the number of troops in Afghanistan started increasing to between 16,000 and 18,000. The number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan increased dramatically in 2009, the year President Barack Obama took office. By the end of 2009, troops numbered just over 67,000. And right now, there are approximately 89,000 troops. So Krugman said that "the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan" eight years ago, but we could not document any declines until the surge in Iraq in 2007. Experts said Krugman was right about resources being pulled away, though, particularly intelligence operations and elite Special Forces units. (We can't quantify these shifts with data because the government considers it sensitive operational information; however, all the experts we consulted agreed on this point.) "It was the kind of troops that we pulled out," said Marvin Weinbaum, a former Afghanistan specialist at the State Department and now a scholar at the Middle East Institute. "We pulled out special forces units and they were not replaced by similar kinds of units." "It's more that valuable and scarce intelligence assets, Special Forces, and high command and political attention shifted to Iraq from Afghanistan. It's not overall troops that matter as much in this case," said Ivan Eland, a senior fellow at the Independent Institute, a libertarian think tank, and author of an upcoming book on counterinsurgency warfare. "I think it would be more accurate to suggest that the Bush administration failed to reinforce the Afghan mission once it began to focus on Iraq," said Doug Bandow of the libertarian Cato Institute. "So Krugman was technically wrong on troop levels but correct in terms of some specialized forces as well as a larger strategic sense." To add one more wrinkle: The experts we consulted also said that the situation in Afghanistan started deteriorating significantly in 2006 and 2007, years after the invasion of Iraq. That's a point when Afghanistan could have used more troops but didn't get them. "By 2006/2007 when we saw the Taliban begin to return, we might have beefed up forces in Afghanistan much more quickly -- except that we were tied down still (and in fact, surging) in Iraq," said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. So to sum up, Krugman said the Bush administration "pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead." He's right on the substantive point that the U.S. was waging war in two countries with limited resources, and Iraq got the bulk of those resources. And experts said that key assets including intelligence operations and Special Forces units were pulled away from Afghanistan for the Iraq invasion. But he's wrong that troop levels in Afghanistan declined when Iraq was invaded in March 2003. The numbers in Afghanistan were small, and they stayed small until they declined later, in 2007. As a result, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2010-08-03T11:08:27	2010-08-01	['Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-01333	"Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with me."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/24/allan-fung/allan-fung-former-ri-gov-donald-carcieri-has-not-b/	The ill-fated 38 Studios loan guarantee took up the biggest block of time during the Oct. 21 Providence Journal-WPRI-12 debate between the three candidates for Rhode Island governor, and part of the focus was Donald Carcieri, the former Republican governor who shepherded the deal. Democrat Gina Raimondo and Republican Allan Fung sparred over who had fought hardest against the loan. Raimondo said she fought the deal from the beginning, but said Fung, who was Cranston’s mayor at the time, "was silent." Then she went a step further. "In fact," Raimondo said, "a week ago, he was campaigning with Governor Carcieri, the architect of this." Fung's response a few minutes later: "Governor Carcieri has not been campaigning with me, so that's false." It would be surprising if the two had campaigned together because Carcieri, who is widely criticized for his role in the 38 Studios deal, has been keeping a low profile. Because Fung had the last word in the exchange, we decided to assess his denial. We were also motivated by a "fungfacts Fact Check" news release from Rhode Island Democratic Party spokesman Peter Baptista, which claimed to prove that Fung lied. The news release said Carcieri attended a fundraiser for Fung that featured Mitt Romney and noted that Carcieri was on Fung’s gubernatorial exploratory committee. We know it can be difficult to prove that something didn't happen, but here are the facts. Carcieri did attend the Oct. 16 fundraiser for Fung that featured Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate, who served as Massachusetts' governor from 2003 to 2006. But most people would define campaigning with someone as being out and about with the candidate, meeting people, shaking hands, and trying to convince them to vote for the candidate and/or give money. Serving on an exploratory committee or attending a fundraiser as a spectator does not constitute campaigning with a candidate, at least not in the way Raimondo made it sound. Fung spokesman Robert Coupe said, "Governor Carcieri contributed to the campaign and he attended the lunch with Governor Romney last week. He has had no 'role' in the campaign. Prior to Mayor Fung's announcement, Governor Carcieri was a member of the exploratory committee." We also contacted Carcieri directly. "Both my wife and I have contributed to Allan and support him, but that's the whole extent. I have not campaigned with him," the former governor said. "I know what campaigning is. I did enough of it." Carcieri said he went to the event to see Romney "because Mitt and I go back to when we first came into office together, and we worked very closely together as New England governors. I was a big supporter for both of his runs for the presidency, and I hadn't seen him or talked to him in a while, so it was an opportunity to catch up and visit a little bit, which we did." We asked the Raimondo campaign if they had any better evidence that, for example, Carcieri addressed the crowd at the fundraising event. Spokeswoman Nicole Kayner produced a photo taken outside the Providence Biltmore of Carcieri going in, and cited a report in The Providence Journal that said: "Through the closed doors of the ballroom, cheers followed mention of both Fung’s name and that of the state’s last Republican governor, Donald Carcieri." But that’s pretty weak evidence for a loaded claim. In summary, we could find no convincing evidence that former Gov. Donald Carcieri has been campaigning with Allan Fung. Until we do, we rate Fung's statement True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-01845	"Perdue mismanaged Pillowtex, and nearly 8,000 people got laid off."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/16/jack-kingston/pillowtex-accusations-overstate-point/	Jack Kingston and David Perdue must hope voters remain angry about the tepid economy and Congressional inaction. Perdue has tried to tap into the latter, going after his opponent in the tight GOP runoff race for U.S. Senate as an ineffective Washington insider. Kingston has responded with a populist theme, attacking Perdue’s time as CEO of Pillowtex, a troubled North Carolina textile firm that went under shortly after he left in 2003. "Perdue mismanaged Pillowtex and nearly 8,000 people got laid off," a Kingston ad says, noting Perdue got "rich" from the job. With Perdue making much of his business background, his tenure at a firm in the state next door seems prime Truth-O-Meter material. The timeline that details that tenure dates back to 1887, when Cannon Mills began operations in North Carolina that would gradually become the world’s largest producer of textiles such as sheets and towels. In 1997, Dallas-based Pillowtex bought the firm, which had become Fieldcrest Cannon, according to a 2004 University of North Carolina study about the plant closing. At the time, Pillowtex was in a leading market position for five textile categories: bed pillows, down comforters, mattress pads, blankets and throws. Pillowtex could not avoid technology changes that resulted in a loss to domestic textile manufacturing. The UNC study found mismanagement, such as excessive debt, contributed to the company and the industry. In November 2000, Pillowtex filed for bankruptcy after defaulting on a $650 million bank loan. The firm emerged from bankruptcy in May 2002. Perdue arrived in July on the heels of sneaker success, having revived Reebok’s finances as CEO. Perdue told Pillowtex top leaders his plan was to improve sales through aggressive marketing and moving more work overseas, according to a Charlotte Observer investigation. A similar game plan catapulted his career at Sara Lee, which closed dozens of plants (including four in Georgia) while adding work in Asia. But the company lost $27 million in the seven months after coming out of bankruptcy. Shortly after arriving, Perdue and top managers also found between $40-$50 million in pension liabilities missed in bankruptcy proceedings. In March, 2003, Perdue left Pillowtex to become chief at Dollar General. Pillowtex shut down four months later. About 7,650 people lost their jobs nationwide, including 300 people who had been laid off in the first bankruptcy. "I wouldn’t call that turning things around the way most Georgians would want this country turned around," said Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford. "If those are the kinds of results an outsider is going to deliver, let’s keep him on the outside." But is Perdue to blame for the closure? He served as Pillowtex’s third leader in two years, as it was emerging from bankruptcy brought on by overwhelming debt and a changing industry. Perdue told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the missed liabilities killed his plans for a turnaround – and any need for his leadership. "I was not given the opportunity to turn it around as I had planned," Perdue said. "There were factors beyond my control." The experience didn’t hurt Perdue’s career, given his jump to Dollar General. It also didn’t hurt his bottom line: records show he made $1.7 million for his brief leadership stint at Pillowtex at a time when people were losing their jobs. And that is the point Kingston misses in his claim. Pillowtex had laid off hundreds of workers and sought bankruptcy protection before Perdue ever arrived. It was a firm in bad shape that hired a business leaders known for rejuvenating industries – often through job losses. Investors don’t view that strategy as mismanagement, even if populists would object to it. Kingston would have been on firmer ground to make the populist point and let voters decide the merits. But the claim of mismanagement is an overreach. Even the loss of jobs after Perdue left – closer to 7,000 – is overstated from what is sure a massive number.

pomt-07352	"Gov. (Scott) Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/09/lena-taylor/wisconsin-sen-lena-taylor-says-gov-scott-walker-ha/	Since budget protesters descended upon Madison in February 2011, Wisconsin has seen a barrage of television commercials, news releases and radio spots, with each side blasting the other. One news release was particularly harsh: As the Legislature’s budget-writing committee opened its hearings on the governor’s spending plan, state Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee) issued a news release March 29, 2011, that made several sharp claims about Republican Gov. Scott Walker -- all rolled into one neat sentence: "Gov. Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people." Incompetence, corruption and raising taxes: sounds like the political equivalent of the trifecta. Let’s examine Taylor’s statement, one claim at a time. Claim #1: "Gov. Walker has yet to create a job." This goes at one of Walker’s main promises, to create 250,000 new jobs in his first term. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said: "(Walker) typically talks about growing jobs in light of ensuring Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs, which is different than claiming the governor will directly create 250,000 new jobs." Officials are quick to claim the credit for job growth, and even quicker to assign blame elsewhere for job loss, but employment gains have much more to do with the economic cycle than individual politicians, said Bruce Hansen, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Nevertheless, if a person is in higher office at the time the economy tanks or improves, he or she typically gets the credit or the blame. So, let’s look at what has happened since Walker took office in January 2011. According to Department of Workforce Development statistics, the state had a net gain of more than 13,000 jobs in January and February. To be sure, Walker’s policies hardly had time to take effect in that time frame, but that’s not what Taylor is citing as evidence. Taylor said when she calculated the net job gain in January and February she took into account thousands of potential jobs that were lost when Walker killed a high-speed rail line to Madison. In the past, Democratic groups have claimed somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 jobs were lost when Walker rejected $810 million in federal funding for the new train link between Milwaukee and Madison. PolitiFact gave a Barely True and Pants on Fire rating to variations on this claim, since -- among other reasons -- the groups double counted the number of jobs that were to be created. Beyond that, the projections did not measure other impacts. Walker might have saved some jobs in the airline, auto and gas industries by killing the rail line, said Steven E. Polzin, an expert on rail proposals from the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, a pro cars and roads group. But even if we were to accept Taylor’s calculations when it comes to subtracting jobs lost that were never created in the first place, and disregard Polzin’s thinking, Wisconsin still gained at least "a" job this year under Walker’s watch. Claim #2: "He gives away millions to his friends." In politics, friends can be a fairly ambiguous term. It can mean campaign contributors, ideological supporters or actual ... friends. Does Taylor mean Walker literally gives million-dollar handouts to his golf buddies? Or that he uses state money to reward the governor’s supporters? Taylor said she meant the latter. "Throughout the January 2011 special session, the governor proposed and signed into law over $140 million in tax credits and contributions, which flows to a predominately corporate environment which has been strongly supportive and friendly to the governor," she told PolitiFact Wisconsin. But Taylor’s evidence doesn’t exactly hold up after scrutiny. For starters, the $140 million in tax credits and contributions don’t flow to "a predominately corporate environment." That figure incorporates a couple of different bills, including the Economic Development Tax Credit, which includes tax benefits for every job Wisconsin businesses create, and a tax break for Health Savings Accounts. The Health Saving Accounts deduction primarily benefits individual workers who have an HSA, whether the workers voted for Walker or not. This credit allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Almost every other state already allows this. And while the Economic Development Tax Credit does include a provision giving corporate companies additional tax cuts for locating their regional or national headquarters in Wisconsin, all businesses are eligible for the job creation tax breaks. In other words, whether businesses are Walker’s friend or foe, they can obtain tax benefits from adding jobs. Taylor also cited the recent Jack Links controversy, in which the snack food company was awarded a $75,000 grant. The company and its CEO made nearly $50,000 in contributions to the Republican Governor’s Association, which spent $5 million to help get Walker elected. While Jack Links was awarded $75,000 after contributing $50,000 to Republican causes, the grant handed to the beef jerky company doesn’t validate Taylor’s statement. She has not provided evidence the company received the grant because of the political donations. What’s more, the grant was for tens of thousands -- not millions -- of dollars. And the news release that was critical of the grant came out six days after Taylor's original statement. Claim #3: "He raises taxes on working people." Taylor’s evidence for this claim was pretty straightforward: "Governor Walker strips $41 million from the Earned Income Tax Credit in his 2011-’13 budget. This move reduces the credit available for persons eligible for the EITC which means that their tax liability is increased or refund reduced." Walker’s response? "Her blanket statement about taxing the working class is way too broad in scope and factually inaccurate when you look at the impact of taxes in the budget on the worker," spokesman Werwie told PolitiFact Wisconsin. "While the EITC credit will decrease, Senator Taylor doesn’t talk about Governor Walker’s efforts to hold Wisconsin’s income and sales tax steady. The EITC only hits some workers." He also argued there is a net decrease in taxes under Walker’s budget. This is true if we combine all of Walker’s tax policies. However, Taylor was referring only to taxes on working class people, which the Earned Income Tax Credit reduction affects the most. And the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau backs up Taylor’s view that the change is a tax increase in an April 15, 2011 memo. In that memo, the bureau listed the EITC change under the "tax increases" section, saying families with multiple children will pay more to the state. Where does all of this leave us? In her statement, Taylor said "Gov. Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people." But the state gained 13,000 jobs in January and February, ruining Taylor’s argument of "yet to create a job." Walker has not given away millions of dollars to "friends," and the "corporate" tax cuts cited as evidence by Taylor are, for the most part, available to all businesses in Wisconsin. By taking out funds from the Earned Income Tax Credit, Walker has raised taxes on "working people," meaning Taylor was spot on with one of her claims. Taylor batted one for three in her news release-- great numbers for a baseball player, but not a strong percentage on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate Taylor’s statement as a whole as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06979	Says scientists are "in dispute" over whether being gay is a choice.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/13/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-scientists-are-dispute-over-whet/	During a July 10, 2011, appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty about the origins of homosexuality. Here’s their exchange: Gregory: "Let me ask you about social policy. You've notably said that you're a big fan of Lady Gaga and even the song Born This Way. There's a lot of debate about a gay marriage pledge in Iowa. And related to that, I wonder, do you agree with some of those who are behind that, that being gay is a choice?" Pawlenty: "Well, I have two teenage daughters who listen to Lady Gaga, so I'm subjected to it. And it has some good qualities to it. But as to, as to gay marriage, I'm in support of traditional marriage as between a man and a woman. I have not supported the issues of allowing gay couples to have the same benefits … as traditional couples. And so this is an issue in Iowa and across the whole country. But I've stood in favor of traditional marriage and traditional relationships in that regard. Gregory: "Is being gay a choice?" Pawlenty: "Well, the science in that regard is in dispute. I mean, the scientists work on that and try to figure out if it's behavioral..." Gregory: "Right." Pawlenty: "...or if it's partly genetic." Gregory:"What do you think?" Pawlenty: "Well, I defer to the scientists in that regard." Gregory: "So you, you think it's not a choice." Pawlenty: "Well, there is no...." Gregory: "That you are, as Lady Gaga says, you're ‘born that way.’" Pawlenty: "There's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic. We don't know that. So we don't know to what extent, you know, it's behavioral, and that's something that's been debated by scientists for a long time. But as I understand the science, there's no current conclusion that it's genetic." We decided to rate two of Pawlenty’s statements separately. In another item, we’ll look at his claim that "there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic." In this item, we’ll look at the first part of the exchange. We're not fact checking whether being gay is a choice, but whether scientists are "in dispute" over whether it is or is not. We’ll start out by noting an important difference -- the difference between sexual orientation and sexual behavior. Scientists don’t doubt that it’s possible for someone who’s gay to choose, through sheer willpower, to ignore their impulses and abstain from homosexual activity. Both gay and straight people have been going celibate by choice since time immemorial. But scientists add that for such people, sexual impulses don’t go away. So, scientists argue, even if sexual behavior is a choice, sexual orientation -- the state of being gay, and the impulses one feels -- is not a choice. "We only choose to act, and our actions are influenced by desires," said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who specializes in the origins of homosexuality. "So I think that in an ordinary understanding of ‘choice,’ sexual orientation -- i.e., increased sexual desire for one type of person -- is not chosen, but sexual behavior is." Both the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association -- the two leading organizations for their professions -- reject the idea that the driving factor in determining one’s sexual orientation is personal choice. A spokeswoman for the American Psychiatric Association -- which has about 36,000 members out of roughly 48,000 psychiatrists nationwide -- didn’t recall any significant internal dissension in recent years over the question of whether sexual orientation is a choice. Meanwhile, the American Psychological Association, which has 150,000 members, also considers it a "settled question" that homosexuality isn’t a choice, said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office. Interestingly, we found less division than we’d expected between gay-rights advocates and social conservatives. Michael Cole-Schwartz -- a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay advocacy group -- said that "there is significant agreement that one does not choose one’s sexual orientation." Meanwhile, Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council -- a leading think tank for social conservatives -- agreed with the distinction between orientation and behavior. He suggested that fuzzy definitions of "sexual orientation" explain why the two camps sometimes talk past each other. "Part of the problem is that the term ‘sexual orientation’ is somewhat ambiguous," Sprigg said. He suggests that it is sometimes used to cover three separate elements -- attractions, behaviors and self-identification. "What I generally say is that I don‘t believe that same-sex attractions are a choice, but behaviors and self-identification are," he said. "If Pawlenty had wanted to be more subtle, he could have asked Gregory what he meant" by being gay. In fact, Sprigg articulated his somewhat nuanced view on the Family Research Council website in 2010, in a document titled "The Top Ten Myths About Homosexuality." In it, he reviewed some of the studies on this topic and concluded that "if it was not clear in the 1990’s, it certainly is now—no one is ‘born gay.’" Yet he went on to write that "homosexual attractions are clearly not a ‘choice’ in the vast majority of cases." In an interview, Sprigg said he didn’t see the two statements as contradictory. "When I say it’s clear that no one is born gay, I don’t think any of those three factors" -- attractions, behaviors and self-identification -- "are fixed and determined at birth. Just because it’s not a choice doesn’t mean it’s present at birth. It could be the result of developmental factors in childhood. Sometime between the time you’re born and the time you begin to experience sexual attraction, things can happen that can affect your development." He even pointed to an American Psychological Association statement that "although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation – heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors." The scientists we spoke to freely acknowledged that much is unknown about what determines sexual orientation. (More on that in our accompanying item.) But what scientists do know pretty much rules out the idea that homosexuality is simply a choice. At this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we’ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research on that question has been much less extensive. We struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception to the scientific consensus on homosexuality. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings. So where does this leave us? Pawlenty said that scientists are "in dispute" about whether being gay is a choice or not. We think most people would interpret that to mean sexual orientation -- that is, attractions and impulses -- rather than sexual behavior. And on that question, it seems that the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Human Rights Campaign and even the Family Research Council are in agreement. So we rate Pawlenty’s statement False.	None	Tim Pawlenty	None	None	None	2011-07-13T12:23:00	2011-07-10	['None']
pomt-09340	Says Holly Turner "failed to vote in five straight Republican primaries."	true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/09/paul-workman/workman-says-turner-didnt-vote-five-consecutive-go/	Republicans Paul Workman and Holly Turner haven't shied from negative campaigning as they vie to get their party's nod to represent a Texas House district covering southwestern Travis County. The winner of Tuesday's runoff will face Democratic Rep. Valinda Bolton in November. Workman has hammered Turner for being new to Austin and, of late, to partisan politics. In a TV ad that debuted April 3, the narrator says: "Turner's record? She ... failed to vote in five straight Republican primaries." Workman's blast could cause runoff voters to think twice about supporting someone who hasn't been up to her elbows in the GOP; many view voting in primaries as essential to being a partisan activist. That said, it's a small club: According to the Texas Secretary of State, only 17 percent of 13 million registered voters cast primary ballots in the governor's race in March. Has Turner has been missing in action in GOP primaries? Offering back-up for Workman's claim, Eric Bearse, a Workman consultant, said the campaign checked Turner's voting history since 1996, when she turned 18, in Travis, Tarrant, Guadalupe, Bexar, Comal and McLennan counties. Bearse said the campaign also searched for voting records attached to Turner's maiden name, White, and her name from her first marriage. Turner spokesman Craig Murphy countered that Turner voted in Travis County's March primary and the 2008 GOP primary in Tarrant County. He confirmed that she did not vote in the GOP's 2006 primary. Seeking independent verification of Turner's voting history, we called election officials in five counties where Murphy said she's lived — Travis, Tarrant, Bexar, Comal, and Guadalupe counties — plus McLennan County, where Turner attended Baylor University in Waco from 1995 through 1999. Murphy initially said Turner voted in three consecutive GOP primaries from 2000 to 2004, in Comal County. He said he didn't know if she voted in 1998, when she was registered in Guadalupe County. He said that since she was born in May 1978, she wasn't eligible to vote in the 1996 primary. Murphy also said Comal County destroys its voter records two years after someone cancels their registration there, so Workman would have no record of her voting history on which to base his claim. What we found: Monica Goodall, a supervisor for the Comal County tax assessor, said the office only destroys paper voting records; its electronic records remain intact. Through the electronic database, Goodall said, "we can see that she is currently registered in Travis County, but it would also show us if she was ever registered somewhere else." At our request, the office staff checked its records several times using Turner's different names. They didn't find any record that she'd registered or voted in Comal County. Jeff Smith of Austin, a Democratic political consultant whose clients have included Bolton, keeps records of Texas voter histories and came up with a slightly different result. He said Turner was registered in Comal County in March 2003, but was no longer registered as of November of that year. He said he found no record of Turner voting in a Comal County primary. What about Guadalupe County? Sylvia Marmolejo, a deputy clerk at that county's elections office, said Turner was twice registered there, in 1996-2001 and 2002-2006, but their records don't show she voted in any primaries. According to election officials in Bexar and McLennan counties, Turner didn't vote there, either. So, interviews indicate that Turner voted in the GOP primaries of 2008 and 2010, but didn't vote in the primaries of 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006 — five in a row. As we finalized this article, Murphy backed off some of his earlier claims about Turner's voting record. Murphy said Turner thought that when she lived in New Braunfels — which crosses county lines — she was a resident of Comal County when, in fact, she was living in Guadalupe County. "I apologize for the rabbit chase on this," he said Murphy said: "Holly Turner did not vote in the five primaries" claimed by Workman. We rate Workman's statement as True.

pomt-11386	NC Republicans "raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/27/north-carolina-democratic/nc-democrats-say-republicans-redirected-58m-meant-/	Approval of a key permit for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline through Eastern North Carolina has been among the most hotly debated political moves this year. The state Department of Environmental Quality in January signed off on the permit for the 600-mile pipeline, which is expected to deliver natural gas to the eastern part of the state from fracking operations in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Shortly after Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration approved the permit, Cooper announced that pipeline builders Dominion Power and Duke Energy planned to put $57.8 million in a fund to be used for environmental and economic-development initiatives. Some advocacy groups worry the pipeline will hurt the environment. Meanwhile, many Republicans in the GOP-controlled N.C. General Assembly questioned the legality of the mitigation fund and accused Cooper’s administration of conducting pay-to-play politics. They suggested Cooper required pipeline builders to fund mitigation efforts in order to acquire the permit, which Cooper has denied. In February, the legislature voted to redirect the $57.8 million to schools in districts that the pipeline would run through. In response, the North Carolina Democratic Party recently launched an ad campaign that targets Republicans in Eastern North Carolina districts. The online ads and mailers say state Reps. John Bell and Brenden Jones, as well as state Sen. Danny Britt "raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians." Every seat in the N.C. General Assembly is up for election this year and Democrats hope to gain influence in Raleigh. Republicans hold a supermajority in both the state House and state Senate. But, aiming to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s unpopularity, Democrats expect to break the supermajority and hope to take control of at least one of the chambers in midterm elections this fall. The N.C. Democratic Party told reporters in a press briefing on March 22 that their messaging on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in Eastern North Carolina has been effective. In an email to PolitiFact, party spokesman Robert Howard defended the mailers as both "factually accurate and intellectually honest." The party "launched digital ads and mailers to hold Republican politicians accountable for raiding a fund meant to help eastern North Carolina access the Atlantic Coast Pipeline," Howard said in an email. "The funds would have gone towards economic development in Eastern North Carolina by covering costs of fuel distribution lines as well as renewable energy projects. Republicans diverted funds through HB90 as part of a 'poison pill' provision in an omnibus bill that included a Democratic priority – funding for the class size mandate." Mitigation money Cooper’s office said half of the $57.8 million is supposed to go toward mitigating the environmental damage the pipeline may cause to wetlands, streams and wildlife habitats. The rest is designated for economic development and renewable energy projects. However, the deal didn't specify the projects or the number of jobs that would be created. The state would receive half of the $57.8 million once the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved the pipeline; the rest would be paid upon its completion. Sadie Weiner, Cooper's communications director, said the Rural Infrastructure Authority and the Clean Water Management Trust Fund are two agencies that could distribute the funds. On the economic side, WRAL reported the Cooper administration hoped the money would help farmers in Eastern North Carolina hook into distribution lines tied back to the pipeline. They hoped the new gas connections would not only prevent economic damages, but also create jobs. Durwood Stephenson, director of the U.S. 70 Corridor Commission, and Norris Tolsen, president of the Carolinas Gateway Partnership, told WRAL that they’d heard from companies unwilling to consider Eastern North Carolina manufacturing sites without easy access to natural gas, and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline planned just three taps along the project's 200-mile route through the state. Prior to DEQ’s approval of the pipeline permit, utility companies ran commercials claiming the project would bring jobs to NC. Where the money went Democrats and many school advocates across the state had been lobbying the legislature to avoid what they called "class size chaos," which they said would happen if state laws went into effect this summer requiring schools to lower average K-3 class sizes from 20 students per room this school year to roughly 17 students in July. School leaders had said they didn't have the thousands of extra classrooms needed and might have to fire art, music and physical education teachers to help come up with the money to hire additional K-3 teachers. House Bill 90 pushed back the class size deadline for schools and redirected the mitigation funds to go to school districts in the eight counties the pipeline would run through. The ads provided to PolitiFact don't say what Republicans did with the mitigation money. They also omit details about the vote, giving the impression that the vote was overwhelmingly partisan. But a majority of Democrats voted for it too – including many from Eastern North Carolina. The vote In the state House, the bill passed 104-12. In the state Senate, it passed 37-5. In fact, none of the House Democrats from areas east of Raleigh opposed the bill. And in the Senate, Angela Bryant was the only Democrat from Eastern North Carolina to oppose the bill. So, on paper, it appears as if many Democrats wanted to redirect money from the pipeline mitigation fund. However, some Democrats said they only voted for the bill because it funneled money to needy schools. Republicans hold majorities in the House and Senate and could’ve redirected the mitigation money without support from Democrats. So Democrats had two realistic options. They could oppose the bill, supporting Cooper but risking the chance that Republicans accuse them of not prioritizing education. Or they could support the bill, breaking with Cooper on the pipeline fund but going on record as supporting education. Most chose the latter. Cooper, for his part, said he supported the class size changes and didn’t veto the bill. "Democratic lawmakers strongly objected to Republicans’ decision to address changes to the state elections board, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline mitigation fund, and a class size fix in a single piece of legislation," said Howard of NCDP. "Many Democratic politicians stated publicly that they are voting in favor of bill solely because of the class size funding measure." What Democrats said State Reps. Garland Pierce and Bobbie Richardson, Democrats from Eastern North Carolina, voted for the bill. But they stood next to House Minority Leader Darren Jackson of Wake County during a press conference as he denounced Republicans for tying education funding to the pipeline. Jackson said it put Democrats in a political predicament in an election year. "There will be a lot of support obviously for the class size and pre-K fix." The rest of the bill, Jackson said, "is an attempt to get the governor to veto it or us to vote against it so they can run political ads." State Sen. Erica Smith, a Democrat from Eastern North Carolina, supported the bill but noted the situation in her statement to Policy Watch, a news arm of a liberal-leaning think tank. "When you put these provisions in this bill in this manner in which it is, you make it unfair. You make it political," Smith is quoted saying. State Sen. Paul Lowe, a Forsyth County Democrat, said some only voted for the bill while holding their noses. "But it’s bad, really bad. You didn’t have to do it this way." State Rep. Gale Adcock, a Cary Democrat who voted for the bill, noted that Republicans could have addressed the education and pipeline issues separately – but chose not to. She described the bill as "a bitter pill." Our ruling An NC Democratic Party ad campaign claims Republicans in the legislature "raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians." It's unclear how many jobs the mitigation fund would create. The party also withheld the fact that Democrats voted for the bill too, and that the mitigation fund was diverted to schools. But the party’s broader point is accurate. Republicans led the push to empty the mitigation fund and Democrats reluctantly went along with the effort because it was tied to education changes they supported. So we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06511	In the early 1960s, all levels of government were "consuming about 27 percent of the U.S. economy," a number that has risen to 37 percent today. With that trendline, "we cease at some point to be a free economy."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-rising-government-share-threatens/	During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney reprised two talking points about the government’s role in the economy. During the time of President John F. Kennedy, Romney said, "the government at all levels -- federal, state and local -- was consuming about 27 percent of the U.S. economy. Today it consumes about 37 percent of the U.S. economy. It's on track to get to 40 percent. We cease at some point to be a free economy." We checked prior versions of these statements in two separate items. Here, we’ll recap both in a single item. In the early 1960s, all levels of government were "consuming about 27 percent of the U.S. economy," a number that has risen to 37 percent today. We found that the numbers Romney cited were close to correct -- but he also left out some important context. The Percentages The Office of Management and Budget produces a table every year that tracks total government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here are the statistics for the years in question: Fiscal year 1961: 27.4 percent Fiscal year 1962: 27.8 percent Fiscal year 1963: 27.7 percent Fiscal year 2009: 36.5 percent Fiscal year 2010: 35.0 percent Romney’s figures aren’t exact. But he’s got the general pattern correct. However, using the big-picture numbers is only part of the story. Digging deeper into the numbers provides a much fuller sense of what’s going on. For simplicity, we’ll choose the 1963 and 2010 figures for a more detailed analysis. Once again, the listed figures are expressed as a percentage of GDP and are rounded. 1963 Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 9.8 percent Federal net interest expenditures: 1.5 percent Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 2.6 percent Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 2.6 percent Federal spending in all other categories: 2.3 percent State and local government: 8.9 percent Total: 27.7 percent 2010 Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 5.1 percent Federal net interest expenditures: 1.4 percent Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 8.4 percent Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 7.3 percent Federal spending in all other categories: 1.6 percent State and local government: 11.1 percent Total: 35.0 percent Behind the numbers So let’s look at the components of government that expanded and contracted between 1963 and 2010. Defense spending was cut almost in half as a percentage of GDP, as was "other spending." Net interest barely budged, while state and local government increased by about one-fifth. But the big increases came from two categories: Social Security and Medicare, which more than tripled as a share of GDP, and other federal payments to individuals, which fell slightly short of tripling. First, we should note that Medicare didn’t exist until 1965, so a big share of the increase Romney pointed to stems from this single program. More important, there’s something that ties together all of these fast-growing expenditures: They are all payments made by the government to individuals. Why is this important? It’s a question of control, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, when we originally reported the item. These transfer payments, as they are known, "can be more or less freely spent by private individuals," Burtless said. "Your mom can spend her Social Security check any way she wants -- on food, shelter, vacations at Disney World or deposits in her bank account or her favorite mutual fund. Even cash public assistance recipients have pretty wide freedom over how they spend their welfare checks." Some transfer payments are more restrictive, such as food stamps or Medicare and Medicaid benefits, but even these still allow some degree of consumer choice. "This distinction is important for a simple reason," Burtless said. While lawmakers and government officials have direct say over many types of government expenditures, "their say over government transfers is a lot more restricted." In addition, he said, many government transfer payments "are paid for with earmarked taxes – FICA and unemployment insurance taxes. When we get transfers from the government under Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, we’re getting back the money that we or our employers contributed when we were working." So how would taking this into account change the equation? If you subtract the share for federal transfer payments from figures above, it turns out that government spending as a percentage of GDP actually declined between 1963 and 2010, from 22.5 percent to 19.3 percent. And this trend is confirmed if you use a different data set. The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes statistics that break down the components of national GDP. If you take the category "government consumption expenditures and gross investment" for all levels of government -- a figure that doesn’t include transfer payments -- and divide it by GDP, government accounted for 22.0 percent of GDP in 1963 and 20.7 percent of GDP in 2010. So Romney’s numbers are nearly correct, but they don’t tell the whole story. Yes, government spending has risen as a share of GDP, but the actual control on spending exerted by government has not risen by anywhere near that amount, because the bulk of the growth has come in transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with). On balance, we rated that part of the statement Mostly True. With that trendline, "we cease at some point to be a free economy." This marks the third time we’ve rated Romney’s claim that the United States is on the verge of ceasing to be a free-market economy. Here are some of the statistics to consider: Government spending. On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that Romney is "implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent," Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s percentage of GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit. And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion."It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom," Bartlett said in an interview for our original fact-check. "Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about." Here are a few other statistics to consider. Taxes. Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011. And as weconcluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. Regulation."One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others," J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us when we first checked the claim. Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.) However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011 -- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom. Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the "mostly free" category. The only nations to be considered more "free" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark. For the U.S. to fall into the "mostly unfree" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan. So where does this leave us? It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. In June, we found this claim ridiculous. In August, we did again. Now, in October, we do for a third time, once again rating this part of Romney's statement Pants on Fire. So the first part of his comment from the New Hampshire debate rates a Mostly True, and the second part a Pants on Fire. Averaging them out, we rate his statement in New Hampshire Mostly False.

pomt-10670	"Obama was enrolled in a Wahabi school in Jakarta. Wahabism is the RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/20/chain-email/obama-attended-an-indonesian-public-school/	An anonymous e-mail makes a number of specious claims to promote its Manchurian Candidate-style conspiracy theory, including, "Obama was enrolled in a Wahabi school in Jakarta. Wahabism is the RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world." Like many Internet smears, the e-mail starts with a bit of truth before lurching wildly into fantasy. It's true that Obama's father was from Africa, and Obama has said his father was born a Muslim. Obama's stepfather was from Indonesia, raised a Muslim. But there's no evidence that either man was particularly religious as an adult — Obama's father is sometimes described as an atheist, while his stepfather drank alcohol, forbidden in Islam. Obama's American mother, Ann Dunham, rejected organized religion, according to several accounts. Obama has summed up his own faith history by saying he didn't grow up in any particular religious tradition. (Obama's mother, father and stepfather are all deceased.) Obama lived in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather from 1967 to 1971, approximately from the ages of 6 to 10. In 1971, he returned to the United States and graduated from high school in Hawaii. "Madrassa" is an Arabic word for "school," but Americans generally understand the word to mean a school where anti-Western Islamic ideology is taught. The e-mail says the school taught Wahabism, a "RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world." Westerners typically understand Wahabism to be an austere form of Islam based on a literal reading of the Koran. So is that the type of school Obama attended? No. Indonesia is a Muslim country, and Obama attended a public school there, which taught a small amount of religion. CNN, the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune investigated the e-mail claims by visiting the school and interviewing former teachers and students who were there at the same time as Obama. These investigations found a public school where students wore Western clothing and prayer was a small part of the curriculum. The Chicago Tribune reported the school was "so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate Christmas." PolitiFact found no on-the-record sources able to substantiate a claim that the school taught Wahabism or any other form of austere Islam. The great preponderance of substantiated evidence indicates Obama attended a public school that taught a small amount of mainstream Islam. The news reports say that Obama's registration form indicates his religion was Muslim, but there are errors on the forms and it seems reasonable to assume that he was registered as Muslim simply because his stepfather was Muslim. And it's worth noting — as the chain e-mail does — that Obama also attended a Catholic school in Indonesia for several years. So while the e-mail gets a few things right, its contention that Obama attended a madrassa that taught Wahabism seems to be a wholesale invention designed to frighten voters. We rate the claim Pants-on-Fire wrong.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2007-12-20T00:00:00	2007-10-01	['Jakarta', 'Islam', 'Barack_Obama', 'Salafi_movement', 'Jihad']

"Chinese restaurant in Coral Springs, Fla., busted for selling dog meat to VIP customers," read a Dec. 21, 2016, headline on a post at MajorThoughts.com. It included a disturbing photo overprinted with "Yamstar.com," purporting to show cooked canines being butchered. Facebook flagged the article as being potentially fake as part of its efforts to root out fake news on the website. This unpalatable tale certainly qualifies. The story, rife with odd punctuation and capitalization, claimed that an eatery called China Chow had been serving dogs slaughtered in the back of the restaurant as a special-order menu item for customers who asked for it. The article said police shut the restaurant down after a two-month investigation following a customer complaint, according to a faux department spokesman. For all the dog lovers out there, take heart that none of these things happened. A Coral Springs Police Department employee told PolitiFact that nothing about the story is true. Community Involvement Coordinator Lynne Martzall said there was no two-month investigation by the department, and the police spokesman named in the story is not a real person. Furthermore, there is no restaurant named China Chow in Coral Springs, and there is no Chinese restaurant at the intersection named in the fake story. (We did notice that there is a fictional Yelp profile of China Chow, but it only links back to the same story, published the same day on GummyPost.com.) After receiving complaints, the department had posted a message on its Facebook page in December to tell the public the story was totally contrived. Martzall said Facebook removed the post from the department’s page after police reported the story as fake. We attempted to contact the administrator at MajorThoughts.com, which is registered to an address in Sunrise, Fla., but we didn’t get a response. Besides basing its claim on a racist stereotype of Chinese eating dogs, this fake story makes up every detail it cites.

A Houston reader asked us about that. Sharia law, the religious law of Islam, can apply to issues ranging from dietary restrictions to divorces to punishment for stealing and killing, the Dallas Morning News noted in a February 2015 news story. In 2011, though, we found False a legislator’s claim that Michigan judges were using Sharia law in lieu of U.S. laws and the Constitution. And as of 2013, according to a Pew Research Center report issued that year, there were no Shariah courts in the United States, though "a number of Muslim imams," religious leaders, "offer voluntary dispute-resolution services to American Muslims based on principles of Islamic religious law," the report said. Chain email: Muslims thwarted in Irving In June 2015, the reader forwarded us the chain email, which said: "The group of Muslims who attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas just received a devastating blow thanks to the town’s mayor standing strong and not backing down." The mayor, Beth Van Duyne, this year led the Irving City Council to pass a resolution endorsing an ultimately unsuccessful Texas House proposal. House Bill 562, which cleared a House committee but didn’t make it to a floor vote, barred foreign courts or laws from superseding U.S. laws. The chain email further said efforts by Van Duyne "to stop this abomination will echo throughout the country, setting precedent for other cities and towns where Muslims attempt to establish footholds. Share this if you support the mayor’s efforts to put a screeching halt to the formation of illegal Sharia courts in her Texas town." Irving mayor says mosque identified as starting Sharia court News stories and a commentary by Bud Kennedy of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram helped us catch up to a Feb. 6, 2015, Facebook post by Van Duyne in which she wrote: "Sharia Law Court was NOT approved or enacted by the City of Irving. Recently, there have been rumors suggesting that the City of Irving has somehow condoned, approved or enacted the implementation of a Sharia Law Court in our City. Let me be clear, neither the City of Irving, our elected officials or city staff have anything to do with the decision of the mosque that has been identified as starting a Sharia Court." We reached out to Van Duyne, who by email pointed out a Feb. 2, 2015, news report by CBS 11 News headlined: "North Texas Home to First Islamic Tribunal in U.S." The station’s story, reported from Irving, said four local religious judges, guided by Sharia law, "are offering up their services to handle cases involving divorce, business problems and other disputes among the community" though not other civil or criminal matters nor child support, custody battles or asset transfers, the story said. Also, the story said, its rulings are nonbinding. Moujahed Bakhach, described as one of the tribunal judges, said generally that state and federal laws would always take precedent. In his Feb. 19, 2015, commentary, Kennedy did not repeat the first-in-the-land characterization. After describing local objections to a "dispute panel" offered at an Irving mosque as "Shariah-phobia," Kennedy said: "Imam Moujahed Bakhach of Fort Worth, two other area imams and a case manager from a Dallas law firm hear disputes for a $1,200 fee. We asked Van Duyne if she thought it accurate to say a Sharia court opened in Irving. It’s accurate, she said, that "a tribunal has been formed in the greater DFW-area and they have indicated it functions in various locations such as Dallas, Richardson, Arlington and Irving. My understanding is they don’t operate in a single fixed location since the tribunal is essentially four men and they could be conducting their ‘court’ from an office, a mosque or elsewhere," Van Duyne emailed. Islamic Tribunal website Van Duyne also emailed us screenshots of the IslamicTribunal.org website, which we then clicked to, spotting this undated message: "Over the past few days, some media speculation has led members of the local community to wonder if the Islamic Center of Irving is facilitating ‘Shariah Courts’ at the Mosque. The management of the Islamic Center of Irving categorically declares that no such court operates on the center’s premises." The message continues: "No other mosque in the area operates such courts. However, the Islamic Tribunal ...operates in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, independent of the mosques, to address a genuine need within our faith community for intra-community arbitration." The message continued: "Similar religious tribunals have existed for decades in the American Jewish and American Christian faith communities to resolve disputes, most especially within families. These religious tribunals are optional arbitration vehicles that only conduct their work when requested to do so by both parties involved in a dispute, do not attempt to impose any belief system upon any individual and work in compliance with State of Texas and U.S. law under the United States Constitution." A "mission" section of the website says the tribunal exists to satisfy the "need for a mediation and non-binding arbitration firm that adheres to Islamic principles in the Muslim community" in Dallas/Fort Worth, also indicating it was formed in part to focus on marital disputes. The website also presents the tribunal’s "constitution;" its first article states the "objective of this Court is to resolve any dispute among Muslims residing in USA while complying with the federal laws of the United States and Texas state laws under the approval of the Texas Judicial system." Other articles indicate the tribunal is a Dallas-based nonprofit whose offices are: President: Imam Yusuf Ziya Kavakci, Ph.D., scholar in residence, Imam, Islamic Association of North Texas; Vice President: Imam Moujahed Bakhach, director of Mediation Institute of North Texas; Treasurer: Imam Zia Sheikh, PhD, Imam, Islamic Center of Irving; and member, Dr. Taher Elbadawi, assistant lawyer in A&M Law Group. On her Facebook page, Van Duyne pointed out the Feb. 23, 2015, news story in the Morning News stating the tribunal had been launched in Dallas in 2014 to settle civil disputes among the growing Muslim population. Organizers, the story said, said its panel of arbitrators issues "non-binding decisions on matters such as business disputes and religious divorces. They note its parallels with Jewish rabbinical courts and Catholic tribunals." The News story said the court uses a conference room in a northeast Dallas law office, where one of the judges works, with hearings there or in conference rooms at some of nearly 60 North Texas mosques. The judge who works in the Dallas office, Taher el-Badawi, told the newspaper the tribunal had settled about two dozen cases, mostly of divorcing couples. "Our community really needs an Islamic tribunal to solve problems," he said. "And we save money and save time for all the community." We left phone messages with the tribunal and the Islamic Center of Irving and didn’t hear back. A national expert Concurrently, we reached the Pew center; spokesman Stefan Cornibert nudged us to contact Lee Ann Bambach, an expert on Sharia law quoted in the center’s 2013 report who wrote a dissertation titled "Faith-Based Arbitration by Muslims in an American Context." Bambach, a Georgia lawyer, told us by phone she considers the Dallas-rooted Islamic Tribunal an alternative dispute resolution service--not a court working outside the bounds of U.S. law. "They’re not trying to establish anything that’s going to take jurisdiction away from the state or federal courts," Bambach said. Similarly, she said, Christians and orthodox Jews sometimes adopt dispute resolution processes. Broadly, Bambach said, there is nothing in the U.S. she’d call a Sharia court. "I’d call them dispute resolution services," she said. Not many services like the Islamic Tribunal otherwise exist in the U.S., Bambach said by email, with most alternative dispute resolution done informally in mosque settings. "I am aware of no such tribunals/services that seek to enforce any aspect of sharia criminal law," Bambach said. Our ruling The chain email said Muslims "attempted to establish the first Islamic Sharia court inside the United States in the town of Irving, Texas." Not so; news stories and the Islamic Tribunal website indicate a few Muslim individuals teamed up to offer Sharia-governed, non-binding mediation services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including in Irving, with the declared intent of complying with state and federal laws. We spotted no evidence of residents trying to open a Sharia court with all the powers that word implies. We judge this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-11670	"New York state spends more than $8 billion in taxpayer money each year on job-creation programs - more than the combined total of the next three largest states"	half-true	/new-york/statements/2018/jan/05/brian-kolb/does-ny-spend-more-create-jobs-any-other-state/	Assembly Republican Leader Brian M. Kolb said New York state economic development spending outpaces every other state by a large measure. Kolb, a 2018 candidate for governor, claimed New York state spends more than the next three highest spending states combined. "New York state spends more than $8 billion in taxpayer money each year on job-creation programs - more than the combined total of the next three largest states," Kolb wrote in an op-ed. Republican lawmakers have targeted the state’s economic development strategy, saying little progress has been made since Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took office in 2011. Cuomo, conversely, rarely makes a public appearance without touting the state’s growth. In the summer of 2016, PolitiFact New York rated as True the governor's claim that 800,000 jobs had been created, the unemployment rate fell by almost half, and the state had more private sector jobs than ever before. But is New York state spending as much as Kolb indicated? Where’s the number from? Kolb’s spokesperson said the development spending amount came from a June article in the Democrat & Chronicle newspaper in Rochester. "The W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research found New York awarded $8 billion in incentives in 2015 — three times as much as the next three largest states combined," according to the article. The institute is one of the nation's leading nonpartisan sources of research and analysis on employment trends in the U.S. The article also cited research from the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan government watchdog group, that likewise found more than $8 billion spent each year on economic development incentives in New York state. The report The report by the W.E. Upjohn Institute tracked at least $4.9 billion spent on economic development incentives in New York state based on state government reporting in 2015. State and local governments spend that money in several different ways, ranging from tax credits for film companies to property tax waivers. The next three highest spending states were California, Texas, and Louisiana. They spent a combined total of about $5.6 billion, more than New York state's spending. California, the second highest, spent about half as much as New York state. Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the institute and the report’s author, said New York state likely spent more on economic development. His report, based on a simulation model, arrived at a higher estimate for New York state: $8.2 billion. The model is the only one of its kind. Experts we spoke to that specialize in similar research said its methodolgy is credible. The model used the state’s laws and commonly used tax incentives to predict total economic development spending beyond numbers reported by state government. Some incentives may not be properly counted in state reporting, according to Bartik’s research. Bartik said Kolb’s statement on New York state’s amount of spending is accurate based on that data. "I would be inclined to say that the statement is true but based on an estimate of state and local incentives," Bartik said. The other part of Kolb’s claim does not add up. The other three high spending states — California, New Jersey, and Texas — spent a combined $8.8 billion, more than New York’s estimate, according to his model. "In terms of the bigger picture, New York state is well above average in the magnitude of incentives it provides," Bartik said. Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, did not provide any data to support or refute Bartik’s estimates. A few caveats New York state is bound to spend more money than other states because its economy is larger, but the state still ranked high when Bartik considered the size of each economy. Three other states ranked higher than New York in reported economic development spending as a percentage of their economies: Louisiana, New Mexico, and South Carolina. New York ranked third behind New Mexico and Tennessee when numbers from the report’s simulation model are used instead. The report also combined both state and local economic incentives in its data. There are state incentives, like tax credits for film companies, and local incentives, like property tax abatements. More than half the cost of economic development was at the local level in 2016, according to a report from the Citizens Budget Commission. Of the $8.6 billion in tax breaks or direct spending they found in New York, about $4.6 billion was local. That’s not necessarily an important distinction to make, Bartik said. "In New York, as in all other states, local governments are creatures of the state," Bartik said. "They only have the powers and functions that the state decides to give them." Our ruling Kolb said "New York state spends more than $8 billion in taxpayer money each year on job-creation programs - more than the combined total of the next three largest states." Research suggests Kolb is right on the amount, but wrong about New York state exceeding the next three states combined. The report Kolb cited also includes local government spending, so the $8 billion cannot be attributed completely to the state. His statement is partially accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True.

pomt-12077	Says video shows Mike Pence quoting the Bible as justification for "Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/31/liberal-bloggers/mike-pence-cited-bible-oppose-katrina-relief-liber/	Left-leaning bloggers used the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey to attack Vice President Mike Pence, saying he opposed relief for Hurricane Katrina while he was a congressman. Many partisans and political groups pointed to a speech Pence gave on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2005, implying that Pence was going to be unwilling to help Houston-area residents affected by Harvey. One such example we saw took exception to the floor speech by calling Pence out for citing the Bible: "Here's Pence quoting Matthew 7:25 while urging Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort. Can't get any more phony," @adamcbest tweeted on Aug. 29, 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The admonition, which had been retweeted more than 13,000 times as of this writing, featured a video of Pence posted on Twitter by Scott Dworkin, the cofounder of the Democratic Coalition. Dworkin also posted the video on DailyKos.com. Most critics tended to especially focus on Pence’s line, "Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren." Did Pence really cite the Bible while demanding that Congress not fund Katrina relief? Considering cuts Pence spoke in a one-minute speech on the House floor on Sept. 8, 2005, shortly after Katrina wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast by making landfall near New Orleans on Aug. 29. The brevity of his remarks allows us to consider his statement in full: "Mr. Speaker, Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider its tragic aftermath, the ancient parable comes to mind: ‘And the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.’ "For most American families, when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, you rebuild, and then you figure out how you are going to pay for it. Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina, and well we should, by speeding more than $50 billion to FEMA and other agencies. "But as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do, in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do: let us figure out how we’re going to pay for it. "Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren." The parable to which he refers is a Bible verse, but it’s actually Matthew 7:27, not 7:25 as the tweet said. (The wording is very similar.) In context, the parable is about believing in the true God in the face of temptation or suffering, although here Pence is clearly playing off the idea of building on stable ground. While the tweet that’s been shared said Pence urged Congress not to approve Katrina aid, the video that accompanied the piece — and Pence’s full remarks — actually support the opposite conclusion. Pence did not oppose any aid for Katrina victims. He said in his remarks that Congress should pay for relief efforts. Pence joined the vast majority of lawmakers who voted later that same day in favor of a $51.8 billion relief package, which passed 410-11. The bill then passed the Senate 97-0 and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. What Pence was saying is that Congress should not go into debt to pay for the aid package, and find other solutions to offset costs. It’s no secret Pence is a fan of reducing government spending. As chairman of the Republican Study Group, a collection of very conservative legislators, Pence did propose cutting or delaying spending on some projects to offset the costs of rebuilding the Gulf Coast. Their plan was even called "Operation Offset." Among the group’s targets were a prescription drug benefit for seniors and transportation projects. But even as Pence and other congressional Republicans looked to find cuts to curtail a budget deficit, he did not propose holding up Katrina relief. He continued his cost-cutting rhetoric a couple of weeks later, when he discussed cutting "big-ticket items" from the budget to deal with Katrina spending. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Bloggers said a video showed Pence quoting the Bible as justification for "Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort." They cited a short 2005 floor speech in which Pence said Katrina relief should pass, but then Congress should look to cut costs elsewhere. He did not hold the aid bill hostage, even while making cost-cutting a personal priority. (The tweet we’re citing also was a bit off about which particular Bible verse he used.) Critics are misrepresenting Pence’s comments, which are plain just from watching the video. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-10105	"Barack Obama thinks terrorists just need a good talking to."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/22/republican-national-committee-republican/the-rnc-needs-a-good-talking-to/	(Published Oct. 22, 2008) Sometimes they make it easy on us fact-checkers. Take the new flier from the Republican National Committee landing in mailboxes in the hard-fought state of Virginia. "Terrorists don't care who they hurt," it says on the front, with a photograph of an airliner looming over silhouetted figures in an airport concourse. "Why should we care what they have to say?" the text continues inside. "Barack Obama thinks terrorists just need a good talking to." The flier, which first appeared in mid October, goes on to recount how Obama said he would meet with leaders of hostile nations, and concludes with an ominous warning: "Barack Obama. Not who you think he is." We'll review past statements from Obama to see whether he really believes terrorists "just need a good talking to," starting with more context from a comment the RNC cites as evidence for its claim. It's from the CNN/YouTube debate among the Democratic presidential contenders on July 23, 2007. A questioner asked whether the candidates would meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea. "I would," Obama replied. "And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them — which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration — is ridiculous. "Now, Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire. And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward." To state the obvious, it's not fair to extrapolate from that comment the sentiment that "terrorists just need a good talking to." Iran, Cuba and Syria are indeed designated "state sponsors of terrorism" by the U.S. State Department. But diplomacy with their leaders does not preclude confronting the countries in other ways, any more than summits with Soviet leaders kept Cold War-era presidents from engaging in the nuclear-arms race or competing with communism in Southeast Asia, Afghanistan and South America. On many occasions before and after that debate, Obama has spelled out that his diplomacy would not replace military options. "Tough-minded diplomacy, backed by the whole range of instruments of American power — political, economic, and military — could bring success even when dealing with long-standing adversaries such as Iran and Syria," he wrote in an article that appeared in the July/August 2007 edition of Foreign Affairs (emphasis added). And just because Obama favors diplomacy with certain nations that sponsor terrorism does not mean he would talk to all terrorists, as the claim implies. In fact, Obama has consistently argued for beefing up the U.S. military effort against the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and does not propose diplomacy with those groups. He said at a rally in Iowa on July 14, 2007, that America must "take the fight more effectively to the enemy's home by destroying al-Qaida's leadership along the Afghan-Pakistan border." Obama has arguably outhawked Sen. John McCain on that subject. McCain said in the second presidential debate that it was inappropriate for Obama to talk about launching cross-border raids into Pakistan because such talk "turns public opinion against us." "If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out," Obama countered in that Oct. 7, 2008 debate. "We will kill bin Laden; we will crush al-Qaida." That's more than just a "good talking to." Examples abound of Obama pledging to take on terrorists militarily. This claim is beyond false. It's Pants on Fire wrong.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2008-10-22T00:00:00	2008-10-21	['None']
pomt-12884	"Not one dime of the tax cut that they are going to enact with the repeal of Obamacare will go to people who make under $200,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/26/claire-mccaskill/claire-mccaskill-overstates-tax-impacts-repealing-/	Facing the possibility that congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump will repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are trying to warn Americans about some of the consequences. Sometimes, though, such warnings have gone too far. One example is a statement by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in a Jan. 23, 2017, interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. During a discussion of the women’s march held a few days earlier, McCaskill said Democrats needed to shine a light on potential policy changes by the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress. As an example, she cited how the tax code could change if lawmakers repealed the ACA. "Not one dime of the tax cut that they are going to enact with the repeal of Obamacare will go to people who make under $200,000," McCaskill said. We’ll take a closer look at this statement, with the acknowledgement that we don’t know the final shape of a congressional repeal of the law (or, for that matter, whether one will happen at all). Of course, neither does McCaskill. We do know, however, that McCaskill is wrong to say that a repeal would only give tax cuts to the rich. Taxes on the rich While the Affordable Care Act is best known for its provisions aimed at expanding health insurance coverage, it is also a major tax bill, since its authors sought to provide ongoing revenue sources to support other portions of the bill. When we checked with McCaskill’s office, they said that McCaskill was referring to a provision of the bill that imposed a 0.9 percentage point payroll surtax for individuals earning $200,000 or married couples earning $250,000, along with a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for higher-income taxpayers. This is indeed the biggest tax increase in the law. Shortly before it was passed, the Joint Committee on Taxation -- the bipartisan congressional panel that analyzes all proposed tax changes -- projected that these provisions would raise $210.2 billion in revenue over the 10-year period between 2010 and 2019. We found another tax provision that would also benefit wealthy Americans -- one that limits the deductibility of executive compensation in the health insurance industry to $500,000. The Joint Tax Committee projected that this provision would generate much less revenue -- $600 million over 10 years. The grand total for these tax cuts for high-income Americans, then, is nearly $211 billion. This makes it clear that a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s tax provisions would enact a significant tax cut for Americans earning more than $200,000 a year. Taxes on everyone else However, the law imposed other taxes that would hit more than just the wealthy. For instance, several provisions of the law changed the rules governing flexible spending accounts for medical expenses, such as limiting the maximum dollar amount people could put into them. In addition, the law imposed a 10 percent tax on tanning-bed services. Combined, the JCT projected that these provisions would raise more than $37 billion over 10 years. But that’s not all. The provisions we’ve listed so far in this section are direct taxes that could (and likely would) hit middle-class Americans. However, the law also contains taxes on drug makers and the health insurance industry that would likely be passed through to middle-class Americans. According to JCT’s projection, the taxes on the drug and insurance industries would raise $87.1 billion in all. Not all of these costs would necessarily be passed on, but the yardstick used by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center is that one-fifth of corporate taxes are passed through to workers, with the remainder swallowed by investors. So if we use the center’s one-fifth ratio, then the hit to middle-class Americans from these taxes would be about $17 billion. Finally, a repeal would almost certainly lift the mandate that Americans purchase health insurance or else face a tax penalty. The JCT didn’t project how much revenue these tax penalties would generate, but the most recent report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that for the 2014 tax year, 8.1 million taxpayers had been hit by these tax penalties, totaling almost $1.7 billion. So, over the 10-year window used by JCT, this provision would be expected to produce revenues of $17 billion over 10 years. If you put all these categories together, the tax changes add up to $71 billion. Two independent experts -- Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center and Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush -- told us that our analysis was sound. McCaskill’s office, for her part, pointed to a Tax Policy Center analysis that showed high-income Americans reaping the majority of the tax benefits if all ACA taxes were repealed. For instance, those earning $1 million and up would see their taxes go down by about $50,000 each, while those earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see a tax cut of $4,580. By contrast, no income group lower than that would see an average cut (or in some cases, a tax increase) of more than a couple hundred dollars. McCaskill’s office also cautioned that the JCT analysis is seven years old, and that it does not provide specifics about which taxes would hit income groups. They also cited news reports suggesting that the GOP was likelier to repeal the high-income taxes than the ones that tend to hit middle-income Americans. Still, while a repeal of all taxes in the law would disproportionately benefit high-income Americans, McCaskill’s notion that "not one dime" of the tax benefits would go to ordinary Americans goes too far. While a minority of the total tax benefits from a repeal would end up in the pockets of ordinary Americans, the percentage is neither zero nor negligible. Our ruling McCaskill said, "Not one dime of the tax cut that they are going to enact with the repeal of Obamacare will go to people who make under $200,000." She has a point that if all taxes in the law are repealed, then high-income earners are likely to reap a majority of the benefits. However, $71 billion in tax cuts spread more broadly across the income spectrum are a far cry from "not one dime." The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01663	Obamacare "prevents (Florida) from regulating insurance."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/aug/20/republican-party-florida/obamacare-wont-let-florida-regulate-health-insuran/	Health insurers want to raise rates in 2015, Florida’s regulatory agency is largely powerless to stop it, and the Republican Party of Florida wants you to believe it’s all the federal government’s fault. By extension, the state GOP implies Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist is worth some blame, too, since he’s come out in support of the law. During a Facebook Q&A on Aug. 6, someone asked Crist if he planned on reinstating the state insurance commissioner’s power to renegotiate 2015 rates in time to affect how much those rates cost. "Absolutely," Crist replied. "The fact that we have a law on the books under Rick Scott that says the Office of Insurance Regulation can't regulate insurance is astounding. We deserve better, you deserve better." But the state Republican Party was quick to contradict Crist, making the first comment on that response. "Wrong, Charlie," the GOP’s Facebook account wrote. "It's Obamacare that prevents OIR (the Office of Insurance Regulation) from regulating insurance … a law that you think is great even though premiums will go up by double digits for Floridians." So who’s right? Does Obamacare keep Florida’s insurance regulator from regulating insurance? We’re not going to make you fill out dozens of forms in triplicate to find out, because we’ve got you covered. Regulating the regulators PolitiFact Florida has looked at a version of this claim before, when Florida’s Democratic members of Congress complained in a letter to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. The letter -- dated Aug. 1, 2013, authored by U.S. Rep Ted Deutch and signed by all 10 of the state’s Democratic representatives -- asked the federal government to protect Florida consumers, because the state Legislature had prevented Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from being able to "negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high." We rated the statement True. What’s that all about? In May 2013, Scott signed Senate Bill 1842, a law that suspended for the next two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans. The bill took away McCarty’s power to negotiate rates or refuse rates deemed too high. Insurance companies still had to file rate changes with the state, but could institute those changes without approval. The bill was in response to 2010’s Affordable Care Act, which said state law had to follow minimum federal guidelines for insurance plans. These guidelines included things like requiring that pre-existing conditions be covered, and protections against gender bias. The health care law also required insurance companies to justify unreasonable rate increases, defined as more than 10 percent year over year. The Legislature decided that if the federal government wanted a say over policy premiums, then they could go ahead and regulate it themselves. Republicans passed SB 1842 largely along party lines, with Scott writing, "I support the Legislature's deference to the federal government. ... Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period." Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act doesn’t give the federal government power to regulate insurance rates. It defers to states to regulate their premiums, following a set of criteria for state agencies. There are five states that don’t meet the standards of having effective rate review programs -- Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Those states don’t empower commissioners to regulate premiums. Ironically, the Republican Party of Florida told us it was referring directly to the portion of the Affordable Care Act that says state law is to be followed unless it contradicts the federal health care law, and that’s why Obamacare makes the insurance commissioner obsolete when it comes to setting rates. Experts we talked to said that doesn’t mean Washington can or wants to do Florida’s job. "If a state doesn’t have rate review authority, then no one really has the power to review them," Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost, who supports the law, told us. "If Florida can’t do it, then no one can." Jost said the federal government does have some power over insurers in Florida. It can ask insurance companies to explain those so-called unreasonable rates, then deny the companies the ability to sell in that state if the government chooses. The company would have to disclose to policyholders and potential customers it had been reviewed for unreasonable rates, an undesirable distinction. The ACA also has a provision requiring at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premiums on medical care, or pay rebates to customers. But that’s not the same kind of power that a state has to regulate health insurance directly, he said. Florida is unique in its unwillingness to let what the federal government considers an effective regulatory agency to do its own job, according to Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, a consumer health advocacy group. "The intent of Obamacare was to keep states in charge of regulating insurance," Mellowe said. "Instead, the Legislature changed state law to take away Florida’s rate review." Washington even offers states grants to assist in strengthening rate review powers, a program in which Florida has refused to participate. We rated a statement from Sen. Bill Nelson about whether Scott gave the $1 million grant back and found it Mostly True. For 2015, 14 insurance companies have filed plans for rate increases averaging 13.2 percent, although three companies said their rates would go down next year. While those are preliminary proposals and will in all likelihood change, the state has no power to negotiate to lower the premiums until next year, thanks to the 2013 law Republicans overwhelmingly supported. The U.S. Health and Human Services Department points to states like New York and Oregon as examples of states that actively keep premiums low through rate reviews. Since 2010, other states have started or are planning to enact stronger insurance regulations to enforce Obamacare rules. Both Louisiana and Montana have joined the effective rate review list in the last four years, and Iowa, Pennsylvania and Virginia have expanded regulatory powers over certain types of coverage. Californians this fall will vote on strengthening their elected insurance commissioner’s powers to regulate rates, with 70 percent of voters backing the initiative. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Obamacare "prevents (Florida) from regulating insurance." That’s not at all the case. The Affordable Care Act says if states can regulate premiums, they should. States only have to bring laws up to minimum Obamacare requirements. The federal government only intervenes in states that don’t have effective rate review programs -- something Florida can do on its own but won’t, thanks to the 2013 law passed by the Republican-led Legislature. The state GOP not only misrepresented the terms of the Affordable Care Act, but it also implied the Democratic president’s signature law was to blame for the state’s (temporary) regulatory woes. It was mostly Republican lawmakers who spearheaded that change to Florida law, after the state rejected a $1 million federal grant to help improve the process. Most other states regulate insurance rates without the difficulty the Republican Party of Florida claimed. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-10470	Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise taxes on all income brackets.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/17/chain-email/dems-dont-propose-tax-increases-on-lower-incomes/	A chain e-mail going around the Internet announces, "Voters Beware! ... We are in for big time trouble if either H. Rodham Clinton or B. Hussein Obama were to be elected as President of the United States." ( Click here to read the chain e-mail in its entirety .) The e-mail asserts that Sens. Clinton and Obama want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels . We'll look at the income taxes claim here. The e-mail says Clinton and Obama will roll back the Bush tax cuts for people making $30,000 a year and up, while Sen. John McCain won't. These cuts are set to expire during the next president's first term. But the e-mail wrongly describes the Obama and Clinton plans. Obama and Clinton have both said they don't want to let the tax cuts expire for people earning under a certain amount. When we first looked at this e-mail, Clinton had said she would not raise tax rates on people making more than $250,000 a year, and Obama had made similar statements. They further clarified their stances on tax cuts at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008. Both candidates said said then they would not raise tax rates for people making less than $250,000 a year. Both indicated they would consider raising the capital gains tax. ( See the statement on capital gains here. ) So the e-mail is wrong about what Clinton and Obama have actually proposed. It's correct that McCain supports making the Bush tax cuts permanent for all income levels. Also, the e-mail calculates the current taxes for different income brackets, purporting to show what taxpayers would pay under McCain's "no changes" plan. But the numbers appear to be slightly off. We calculated the tax rates using the 2007 tax tables listed by the IRS. The taxes are as follows: Single making 30K - tax $4,113; not $4,500 Single making 50K - tax $8,930; not $12,500 Single making 75K - tax $15,180; not $18,750 Married making 60K- tax $8,221; not $9,000 Married making 75K - tax $11,604; not $18,750 Married making 125K - tax $24,098; not $31,250 We find this chain e-mail gets facts both large and small wrong. It doesn't list the higher tax brackets that actually would go up if Clinton or Obama implemented their plans, and it accuses them of wanting to raise rates on lower incomes that they've said should stay the same. So we rate the chain e-mail's claim False. UPDATE: This statement has been updated to reflect comments the Democratic candidates made about the capital gains tax at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008.

pomt-06211	Says recall organizers "started their website last November" and began work on their effort before he even took office.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/08/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-recall-organizers-began-effo/	CNBC’s Becky Quick put a question to Gov. Scott Walker after recall organizers claimed that after just 12 days they had more than half the signatures needed to force an election. How are you feeling about this? Walker conceded the drive probably would succeed, putting a recall election on the ballot in 2012. But he downplayed the significance, saying if the effort got the required 540,000 valid signatures it would equal just 25 percent of the voters in the 2010 governor’s race he won. "A minority of voters will get to force a new election in Wisconsin," he said in the Nov. 30, 2011 appearance. Walker also argued against the idea it was a fast start by opponents, saying that while the drive officially kicked off in mid-November, those behind the recall actually got going well before he even took office in January 2011. "The recall organizers -- who by the way started their website last November, they didn’t just start organically earlier this year – they’ve been planning this for some time." He made a similar to a claim National Public Radio two weeks earlier. To be sure, Walker inspired anger and protests even before assuming office, based on his rejection of high-speed rail funds, talk of a showdown with state employee unions, and other issues. But was a recall effort already under way? When asked to support the claim, Walker’s office referred us to the state Republican Party, which is helping with his campaign. They told us Walker was referring to recallscottwalker.com, a website that -- as its name suggests -- advocates for Walker’s ouster. The domain name was registered more than a year ago, in November 2010, according to the registration record and a post on the site by its manager, Ben Paulson, a Milwaukee-area resident. State GOP spokesman Ben Sparks said the party views Paulson as one of several liberal activists who got the recall push rolling in the fall of 2010. "The recall began because the Democrats are sore losers," Sparks said. The state Democratic Party is behind the recall drive, in concert with the group United Wisconsin and labor organizations. Based on publicly available information, United Wisconsin began operating in late February, signing up supporters and getting 200,000 unofficial "pledges" to recall Walker. That was shortly after Walker unveiled the union limits that drew massive protests at the Capitol and sent Senate Democrats fleeing to Illinois to block a quorum for weeks. But Walker’s statement puts Paulson at the center of the effort -- and gives it a three-month earlier start. Paulson is a virtual unknown among major players on both sides, both personally and politically, based on our interviews with both parties, recall activists and union officials involved in the effort. In fact, Paulson and his site have attracted little attention, even in the liberal blogosphere. We couldn’t find a single interview with Paulson and only a few scattered Internet references to his website. At least initially, Paulson’s site was viewed suspiciously by some liberals as a possible GOP front aimed at locking up a good domain name. A story on the Wisconsin Reporter, a conservative online site, described recallscottwalker.com as "the purported creation of Ben Paulson." As for Paulson himself, even the Republicans know nothing about him and say he’s "elusive." "We have not been able to connect him in any official way" to the recall organizers, said Sparks of the state party. So, that undermines the group’s main point -- and the statement from Walker himself. On his website, Paulson describes himself as a moderate Democrat "who believes in fiscal and social responsibility." "As many of you, I have been horrified with what has been transpiring in this state since January 3, 2011," Paulson wrote in an undated introductory post. "Let’s see where this takes us and maybe ... just maybe ... we can change people’s minds and get a change in the governor’s mansion before too much damage is done in Wisconsin." Notably, Paulson did not post on the site until Feb. 19, 2011 -- eight days after Walker announced his curbs on unions. That post was a link to the recall statute. In fact, the site functions mainly as a repository of news and commentary on the recall. That’s a sharp contrast to the United Wisconsin and Democratic Party recall machine, which run interactive websites and detailed county-by-county organizing efforts. As for the recall effort itself, United Wisconsin launched its "pledge" drive on Feb. 18, 2011, and registered a political action committee March 1. It joined forces on the petition drive in the fall of 2011 with the Democratic Party, prompting skepticism on the right about its independence. Paulson’s website does link to the United Wisconsin and Democratic Party of Wisconsin sites. But so do many other blogs and websites on the left. We reached Paulson, and he scoffed at the notion he somehow spawned the current recall drive. "I was talking and joking with a co-worker about how Gov. Walker would end up being recalled just as he had won election as the Milwaukee County Executive via recall," he wrote in an email. "I checked, the domain was free, and I registered it, not to think about it again until everything erupted in February." He added: "I am not an organizer of the recall nor have I initiated any recall activities. The current recall does not trace back to me in any way." Paulson, who works as an engineer with a manufacturing company, said he has had no contact with the United Wisconsin recall group or the Democratic Party. Indeed, United Wisconsin officials said he was not among the 200,000 people who signed the "pledges" to recall Walker. Our conclusion In a CNBC interview, Walker traced the current recall drive and organization to November 2010, arguing that recall leaders were gearing up even before he took office. But the founder of the website is not a recall organizer; he’s a fringe player at best who took no steps to actually organize the petition drive. Even Republican officials can cite no evidence to the contrary. While his recall-advocacy website was registered back then, the site was dormant until Walker’s controversial bill was introduced. The real "recall organizers’" website, that of United Wisconsin, kicked into operation only after Walker proposed his controversial budget bill in February 2011. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-00322	Says he "beat (President Barack) Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs."	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/20/patrick-morrisey/did-patrick-morrisey-beat-obama-supreme-court-savi/	In his quest to win a U.S. Senate seat, Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey is touting a legal accomplishment that he said aided the state’s coal industry. A television ad by Morrisey says, among other things, that Morrisey "beat (President Barack) Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs." (An earlier ad made a similar claim as well.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is that correct? We took a closer look. Did Morrisey "beat Obama at the Supreme Court"? This part of the claim refers to the February 2016 decision by five justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay that blocked the Clean Power Plan from going into effect. The plan, developed by the Obama administration’s Environmental Protection Agency and initially released in 2014, would have set a standard for power plants’ emissions of carbon dioxide, which most scientists say are causing global warming. Critics of the plan included the coal industry, which would have suffered because coal has relatively high emissions of carbon dioxide. The stay put the proposal on hold, and it was officially scrapped under President Donald Trump. In October 2015, Morrisey was a key player in leading a coalition of 24 states in a lawsuit against the Clean Power Plan. The lawsuit came the same day as the rule was filed in the Federal Register — the first day the rule could be challenged in court. In an unusual move, the Supreme Court issued its stay only a few months later. Officially, the five justices who granted the stay referred to a related case, North Dakota vs. EPA. And because West Virginia was part of a coalition of two dozen other states, Morrisey did not accomplish this singlehandedly. That said, Morrisey was widely noted as a leader of the effort. "He was very aggressive in bringing the early rounds of the litigation and trying to get a court order to stop EPA from even finalizing the rule," Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA air regulator who is representing a coal industry group in the lawsuit, told the Hill newspaper not long after the Supreme Court stayed the EPA program. "He really has taken very much a leading role in the Clean Power Plan litigation." The same month, the Associated Press singled out Morrisey for his role in the legal battle, in an article headlined, "Rising GOP star in West Virginia fight for coal against EPA." Did Morrisey’s legal victory save coal jobs? In 2015, the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimated that the Clean Power Plan could eliminate 63,838 coal mining-related jobs (though the same group estimated that the plan would increase the number of jobs overall by roughly 360,000). So, shelving the plan would be expected to save coal jobs. As it turns out, employment in coal mining has rebounded modestly since the plan was stayed. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, coal mining employment hit a low in July, August and September 2016. Since then, it’s been on a slight upswing. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In the two-year span since its low point in 2016, coal mining employment has risen by about 8.5 percent, or 4,200 jobs in all. That said, coal mining employment remains far below its mid-1980s peak, and even well below its pre-Great Recession level. Our ruling An ad for Patrick Morrisey said he "beat Obama at the Supreme Court, saving coal jobs." Morrisey wasn’t the only legal player involved in the lawsuit that derailed the Clean Power Plan, but he was widely considered a key figure. And employment levels in the coal industry have recovered, though modestly, and have only returned to their levels from early 2016. The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Patrick Morrisey	None	None	None	2018-09-20T12:50:00	2018-09-04	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-03697	Proposed immigration legislation would give new immigrants "a taxpayer-funded cellular phone."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/19/blog-posting/immigrants-would-get-free-cell-phones-under-new-pr/	Have you heard of Obamaphones, cellphones for people on welfare? Now there’s a new catchphrase going around conservative circles: Marcophones. It’s a hard jab at U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who’s supporting immigration legislation put forward by a small group of senators called the Gang of Eight. The group recently released a draft of the legislation. Now bloggers have seized on the bill to make the claim that it gives free cell phones to illegal immigrants. "Move Over ‘Obama Phone,’ Say ‘Hola!’ to the Marco Rubio Immigration Phone, AKA MarcoPhone," said The Shark Tank, a conservative South Florida website. "According to the newly filed bill, immigrants who are allowed to enter the United States under a work visa, will be ‘granted’ a taxpayer funded cellular phone," it continued. "Immigration bill contains Marcophones," repeated the conservative website Breitbart. Soon, the story was zipping around the Internet, in one case even sent out by a staff member of U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who opposes the legislation. It prompted Marco Rubio to take to Twitter in protest of the rumors. "Report that claims #immigrationreform gives immigrants free cell phones is false & reckless," he said. We were immediately dubious that the legislation said any such thing. The old "Obamaphones" rumor, for example, has been widely debunked. President Barack Obama never started a program to give out free cell phones to his supporters. Instead, he inherited a longstanding federal program that subsidizes phone service for the poor, including cellphone service. And the Federal Communications Commission under Obama’s watch has moved to put more restrictions on the program to prevent fraud and waste. So it was an easy call to take a look at the legislation and check out the "Marcophones" rumor for ourselves. One quick clue that the rumor was off-base: The section that allegedly authorizes the free phones, Section 1107, is part of the bill’s Title I, which has to do with border security. The bill authorizes a program to "improve emergency communications in the Southwest Border region." It creates grants for people who can prove they work and live in the region and are "at greater risk of border violence due to the lack of cellular service at his or her residence or business and his or her proximity to the Southwest border." The bill specifically mentions grants should be for satellite phones that "provide access to 911 service and are equipped with global positioning services." After the blogosphere lit up with the rumor, Rubio said in a statement that the program was put forward in response to the death of an Arizona rancher, Robert Krentz. Intruders attacked Krentz on his property near the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010. His murder remains unsolved. "Attempts to track Krentz's location using GPS from his cell phone were unsuccessful. Verizon had trouble getting a ‘ping' signal possibly due to sparcity of cell towers in the area," said a report from News 4 Tucson. In the weeks after Krentz’s death, then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., sent letters to the major wireless carriers asking them to improve cell phone service in the border area. "It is evident that the lack of reliable electronic communications is a factor in the growing public safety problem faced by area residents," Giffords wrote on April 9, 2010. "It also contributed to a delay in the search for Mr. Krentz once he was reported missing and in the coordination of an immediate hunt for his killer who was able to escape into Mexico." PolitiFact reached Javier Manjarres, managing editor of the Shark Tank blog. He said the blog highlighted the communications grants because the language of the bill seemed ambiguous. "Obviously, the bill doesn’t say only immigrants are getting them. We’re saying it because, hey, it could happen down the road, and the bill is so vague," he said. It’s true that the bill authorizes the program in broad outlines and doesn’t set out specific criteria. But the bill also says the program will be administered by the secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the governors of the Southwest border states. This means the secretary would have the authority to set up eligibility criteria. And that criteria would have to promote the goal of border security, not welfare for new immigrants. Our ruling Bloggers charge that new immigration legislation includes "a taxpayer funded cellular phone" for new immigrants. Their evidence is based on something else entirely: a public safety program aimed at beefing up border security. The bill includes grants aimed at helping American ranchers and others in remote locations along the border get satellite phone service so they can be in touch with authorities. And Rubio can point to a well-documented case in which a rancher was killed on his property, and authorities said better phone service would have made a difference in speeding up their response to the case.

pomt-14350	"Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/mar/23/gayle-smith/did-we-really-reduce-extreme-poverty-half-30-years/	At the dawn of the new millennium, the United Nations set a goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. With 14 years left to go, we’ve already reduced the proportion of destitute people in world by 50 percent, according to U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Gayle Smith. "I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress. Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half. Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates, and there are half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago," Smith said in a speech on Capitol Hill. We looked at the education figures in a separate fact-check, but we also wondered if extreme poverty really has been halved. According the World Bank, the reduction is actually greater than what Smith stated. The global poverty line Extreme poverty typically refers to the minimum consumption level of the world’s poorest people. The World Bank first defined this in 1990 as living on $1 a day or less, by converting the national poverty lines of a group of the poorest countries into a common currency based on their purchasing power. Since then, the World Bank has raised the bar every few years to adjust for inflation. A spokesperson for USAID referred us to a United Nations report based on the 2008 definition of $1.25 a day or less. According to the report, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from 36 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2011 — a 58 percent reduction in 21 years, more than what Smith claimed. By the current metric of $1.90 a day, the decline is even greater. According to the World Bank, 1.9 billion people (or 37.1 percent of the global population) lived on less than $1.90 a day in 1990, compared to a projected 702 million (9.6 percent) in 2015. That’s a 74.1 percent decline in 25 years. We should stipulate that the World Bank’s definition of extreme is by no means perfect. For 25 years, critics have pointed to methodological issues while others have questioned the very notion of a one-poverty-line-fits-all approach. Princeton University economist and Nobel laureate Angus Deaton, for example, pointed out in 2010 that the World Bank’s standard is based on the most destitute places in the world and neglects the issue of regional inequality. So the poverty count would effectively include "all of the locally poor Indians, and none of the locally poor Americans." In short, the global poverty line is "an inaccurately measured and arbitrary cut off," said Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. "I know I’d consider myself extremely poor on multiples of ($1.90 a day). And no one doubts that people on $1.91 are still really, really poor." Nonetheless, the World Bank’s estimate still gives a good sense of just how many people live in abject poverty, Kenny added, so Smith’s claim of " ‘halving’ is suitably cautious and about as accurate as you are going to get." Other approaches The World Bank’s global poverty line isn’t the only measure of poverty out there. By many other definitions, the World Bank's count of the desperately poor is low-balled. In a 2012 working paper, the World Food Programme’s Ugo Gentilini and the Institute of Development Studies’ Andy Sumner looked at national poverty lines and found that 1.5 billion people are poor, according to their own countries — more than double the number under the World Bank’s definition. The Agriculture Department's Thrifty Food Plan, the minimum cost of getting adequate nutrition in the United States, was the basis for an alternative poverty metric by economists Sanjay Reddy of the New School and Rahul ​Lahoti of the University of Göttingen. Reddy and Lahoti applied purchasing power exchange rates for the $5.04 plan and, just to be cautious, half its value. According to this analysis, the percent of people who live below the higher poverty line ($5.04) was cut by 18 percent from 1980 to 2012, and the poverty headcount at the lower line ($2.52) was reduced by 37 percent. To some, income or consumption alone isn’t enough to define poverty. The University of Oxford’s multidimensional poverty index considers a host of other indicators such as nutrition, child mortality, education, and access to electricity and water. By this definition, there are still 1.6 billion people living in poverty. While Oxford doesn’t have long-term data, it did calculate the change in multidimensional poverty in 34 countries over various periods, spanning from two to eight years. On average, multidimensional poverty decreased 5.6 percent (albeit in much short time frames). Then there’s the idea proposed by Harvard University development economist Lant Pritchett that poverty lines shouldn’t just measure destitution, but rather set a global standard for human well-being. Pritchett suggested a high poverty line of $12.50 or even $15 a day. Under this definition, billions more would be considered poor. "There seems to be massive global inequity built into definitions of poverty that do not allow the world’s population to even aspire to the living standards of the now rich industrial world," Pritchett wrote in a 2013 blogpost. "Roughly speaking, about 1 billion people are in extreme poverty, about 1 billion are above a high threshold and 5 billion are in between. Why would we want to build a development agenda that did not measure how the standard of living of those 5 billion people is progressing?" Our ruling Smith said, "Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half." By World Bank figures, Smith actually understated the reduction. We’ve cut extreme poverty by 58 percent using the 2008 definition of extreme poverty, and 74.1 percent by the 2015 definition. While we don’t quibble with Smith using that metric, our research shows that there are other ways of determining poverty, and those different ways show different declines. Moreover, defining poverty is not an exact science, experts say. Because of those caveats, we rate Smith’s claim Mostly True.	None	Gayle Smith	None	None	None	2016-03-23T12:33:11	2016-03-09	['None']

Sarah Palin once tried to have removed from the Wasilla, Alaska, public library shortly after she was elected the city’s mayor in 1996. The title on the e-mail is “The Books Sarah Palin tried to have banned” and it claims to reflect a list taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. ( Read it for yourself here. ) The list of 93 books includes such classics as Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice ; young adult novels such as Forever by Judy Blume and The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier; even a few Stephen King novels such as Cujo and The Shining . It's a vitual who's who of frequently banned books. Inundated with questions about the issue, Wasilla Mayor Diane M. Keller released a statement saying, “We have no records of any books being ‘banned or censored’ ever .” Keller told PolitiFact that city officials scoured board minutes and weren’t able to substantiate that the issue of book removal was ever raised by Palin in a meeting. Nor does Keller, who was a council member at the time, recall any such conversations. We looked into a claim in an e-mail from longtime Wasilla resident Anne Kilkenny, who said that Palin asked the city librarian at a council meeting if she would consider removing books from the library, but that the librarian refused. Palin later said in a local newspaper article that the questions were rhetorical, and that she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed them. You can read our blow-by-blow account of the issue here. Kilkenny said she did not recall that any titles were ever mentioned, and the former Wasilla librarian, Mary Ellen Baker, recently told ABC News that she also could not recall that Palin had ever mentioned specific titles. Jeanne Troshynski, president of the Friends of Wasilla Library, said the last formal request to remove a book came in 2005, with the challenge of a book written by Jon Stewart of The Daily Show called America (The Book): A Citizen’s Guide to Democracy Inaction. That was three years after Palin left office as mayor. Wasilla records show the last formal challenge before that was in 1986 to Bumps in the Night, by Harvey Allard — well before Palin’s tenure as mayor. In both cases, the challenges were denied and the books remained on the shelf. June Pinell-Stephens, longtime chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Alaska Library Association, said she scoured the organization’s archives and could find no record of any formal actions to ban books in Wasilla under Palin’s tenure as mayor. So we can say for certain that no book was ever banned. Nor is there any record that Palin ever initiated a formal process to censor any books, as the e-mail suggests. The 93 titles in the chain e-mail appear to be a generic list of frequently banned books. It was not part of the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. In fact, the first book in the Harry Potter series wasn't released in the United States until 1998, two years after this list is alleged to have been generated. In short, the list is a fake. We give the whole e-mail a Pants on Fire. Update: After this item was posted, a reader pointed out that the list is identical to one posted on an old Web site for Adler and Robin Books, a literary agent and book packager based in Washington D.C. Company President Bill Adler confirmed that he compiled the list of books banned in the United States several years ago and posted it on his company Web site as a public service. Adler said the list was first generated through public records, and then was added onto as readers sent in additional banned titles over the years. Adler said he got a few e-mails last week alerting him that his list had been co-opted. He checked, and the alleged Palin list was identical to his. He said he doesn't know who may have copied and pasted it into the bogus Palin chain e-mail. "We are now a small footnote in history, I guess," Adler said.

pomt-12756	Says Tammy Baldwin "wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!"	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/27/restore-american-freedom-and-liberty/no-evidence-pacs-claim-tammy-baldwin-wants-require/	The sexuality of Tammy Baldwin, the nation’s first openly gay U.S. senator, is under attack by a group that says it wants to unseat her in an election that is 21 months away. Restore American Freedom and Liberty goes personal on the Wisconsin Democrat as part of what it says is an effort to draft conservative Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. to run against her in 2018. In a fundraising email revealed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Feb. 16, 2017, the group calls Baldwin a "pervert" and "disgusting." It also uses extreme language in claiming Baldwin "wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!" That claim caught our attention. The group The Denver-based Restore American Freedom and Liberty, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, is a so-called Carey committee -- a "hybrid" political action committee that is not affiliated with a candidate and can operate as a traditional PAC, contributing funds to a candidate's committee, and as a super PAC, which makes independent expenditures. The Journal Sentinel reported that Restore American Freedom and Liberty is one of four pro-Clarke groups that drop the names of popular politicians in fundraising appeals but then use the cash primarily on consultants, not candidates. Denver attorney Alexander Hornaday, the treasurer for the group, did not reply to our email and phone requests for information to back up the group’s attack on Baldwin. According to the Denver Post, Hornaday is a gay Republican who was a leader of the Colorado chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents gay conservatives. The attack Since Restore American Freedom and Liberty didn’t respond to us, we’re left to search for what its claim might be alluding to. We found three pieces of legislation backed by Baldwin, none of which became law, that are possibilities in that they all pertained to gay students. Orientation surveys: In 2010, as a member of the U.S. House, Baldwin introduced a bill that would have required a federal agency to request sexual orientation data in health-related national surveys it does. But the bill did not have any requirement to teach children about gay sex. Bullying in schools: In 2015, Baldwin co-sponsored a bill to require states to direct their local educational agencies to establish policies that prevent and prohibit bullying. The bill states that students have been singled out for bullying based on various factors, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Again, no requirement to teach about sex. Sex education: In 2016, Baldwin co-sponsored a bill that would, among other things, require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to award grants for training teachers and staff to teach age-appropriate comprehensive sex education to elementary and secondary school students. For the elementary students, the teaching would be aimed at "broadening student knowledge about issues related to human development, relationships, personal skills and sexual behavior, including abstinence." None of the grants could be given to programs that "are insensitive and unresponsive to the needs of sexually active youth or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth." So, that legislation provides financial incentives to teach sex education in a manner that is inclusive of gay students. But it’s not a requirement. It’s a grant program that school districts can choose to apply for. What’s more, it is for elementary and high school students, not targeted at kindergarteners. Indeed, the bill dictates the education be age appropriate, making it highly unlikely that 5-year-olds would be taught about sex acts. Our rating Restore American Freedom and Liberty says Baldwin "wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!" The group did not reply to our requests for information that would back the statement. And we could not find any evidence that Baldwin supports such a requirement. If information surfaces that was available when the group made its claim and it is relevant, we could reconsider this fact check. But in the meantime, we rate the statement False.

pomt-04527	Chinese tire imports threatened 1,000 American jobs, so President Obama "stood up to China and protected American workers. Mitt Romney attacked Obama's decision."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/01/barack-obama/ad-says-obama-defied-china-save-tire-making-jobs-h/	One skirmish in the heated presidential race centers on this: Who’s tougher on China? The Obama campaign has released an ad saying the president held firm against China in a trade decision, to the benefit of American tire manufacturers. "When a flood of Chinese tires threatened a thousand American jobs, it was President Obama who stood up to China and protected American workers," a narrator says as images from manufacturing plants flash on the screen. "Mitt Romney attacked Obama's decision … said standing up to China was ‘bad for the nation and our workers.’" It concludes with the line, "How can Mitt Romney take on the cheaters when he’s taking their side?" We’re checking whether Obama saved 1,000 American tire-making jobs and whether Romney criticized him for it. In addition, we discovered ample analysis of Obama’s action that calls into question whether it protected some workers but harmed others. The background The United States and China became permanent, normal trading partners in 2001, after China joined the World Trade Organization. As a condition of joining, China agreed to a provision in law that lets the U.S. government determine whether a product from China is being imported in such increased quantities that it causes "market disruption" to domestic producers. In the years following that agreement, several petitions were filed under the provision, called Section 421. But President George W. Bush rejected the petitions on the reasoning that any limitations on Chinese products would be filled in by other foreign exporters and American companies would not ultimately benefit. A Section 421 petition is what brought the tire question to Obama’s desk. In 2009, the United Steelworkers sought relief from a surge in Chinese tire imports that the union said had cost more than 5,000 U.S. jobs since 2004. A panel with the U.S. International Trade Commission heard the case and determined that "certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from the People’s Republic of China are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products." The panel recommended a three-year tariff, of 55 percent in the first year, 45 percent in the second year and 35 percent in the third year. Obama did impose a tax, albeit a lighter one of 35 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent over three years. It was the first time a president approved Section 421 relief on imports from China. China appealed the tariff to the WTO but lost. It expires this month. A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the tariffs saved as many as 1,200 domestic jobs. The study’s lead author, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, served as deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy under President Jimmy Carter. He has written extensively about international trade. What Romney said The Obama campaign cited three instances of Romney criticizing Obama’s move. The first is a video, unearthed by the New Republic, of Romney speaking at the conservative group Foreign Policy Initiative in September 2009, the month Obama imposed the tariffs. Romney said these kinds of protections just encourage lower productivity. "The tire workers of America look at these tires coming in from China and say this is not good for me. ... But if that’s what their response is, my experience is over time, they will lose out slowly but surely. As they protect their lack of productivity with barriers, they will become less and less competitive, the foreign guys will get more and more volume, more and more successful, they’ll become more and more productive. The domestic guys get less and less productive, less and less competitive, until finally even the tariff can’t hold them out and the foreign products come flooding into the marketplace and the domestic guys are gone. So putting barriers up, trying to put walls up, in my opinion is a defeating strategy and will yield ultimate decline and collapse." In his 2010 book, No Apology, Romney wrote that action by the government to protect individual industries should be rare and temporary. "President Obama’s action to defend American tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for his support of their campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers. Protectionism stifles productivity," he wrote. Finally, in a policy memo, Romney’s policy director Lanhee Chen also characterized Obama’s intervention as little more than a favor to unions that backed his campaign. "What message does it send the Chinese when President Obama takes protectionist action against China on behalf of Big Labor, undermining free trade principles for political gain? The Obama campaign has repeatedly held out its Section 421 action against Chinese tires as an example of President Obama’s supposedly tough China policy." Did the tariff protect jobs? It’s clear to us that the claims in the ad are substantially accurate. Obama did push back against China to protect American tire manufacturing jobs, and Romney did criticize him. But Romney wasn’t alone, and we think it’s worth examining the real effect of the tariffs on American jobs. Some pro-trade groups tell a different side of the story than the ad. The U.S.-China Business Council, a private organization comprised of companies that do business with China, said the tariff did succeed in lowering Chinese imports, as expected, but the vacuum wasn’t filled by American producers. "We’re still importing a lot of tires from Indonesia, Taiwan and Mexico," said communications director Marc Ross. "It just shifted supply chains." What’s more, the council said job gains for tire makers were more likely due to the burgeoning economic recovery and improved outlook for the auto industry, more so than the tariff. The Peterson Institute study, mentioned above, did attribute 1,200 tire jobs to the tariff, but found there were other employment casualties. "The additional money that U.S. consumers spent on tires reduced their spending on other retail goods, indirectly lowering employment in the retail industry," the authors wrote. The fallout? "On balance, it seems likely that tire protectionism cost the U.S. economy around 2,531 jobs, when losses in the retail sector are offset against gains in tire manufacturing." As for those higher prices, the Peterson study said consumers paid an extra $1.1 billion for tires in 2011 because of the tariffs, and "adding further to the loss column, China retaliated by imposing antidumping duties on U.S. exports of chicken parts, costing that industry around $1 billion in sales." The Wall Street Journal noted that the steelworkers union "believes the measure has been a success, adding jobs to the U.S. It cites anecdotal and other evidence of production expansion across the industry. Some companies have indeed added production and employees, but whether that is a result of the tariff or the recovery in the U.S. economy isn't entirely clear." Our ruling Obama’s ad is accurate in stating that the president imposed trade sanctions against China in an effort to protect American workers and "Mitt Romney attacked Obama's decision." But did the tariffs work? That’s less clear. Romney said the result was "bad for our workers," and there are studies that back him up. Even with tire-making jobs that were saved, one analysis found that the higher price of tires depressed spending on other retail, and ultimately led to a loss in retail jobs. The statement in the ad is accurate, but it needs additional information about the tire tariff’s effect. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-08961	"Sixty percent of the Hispanics" support the Arizona immigration law	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/21/russell-pearce/immigration-law-author-claims-60-percent-arizona-h/	How do you defend a state law that the President of the United States calls "misguided"? Simple, you start naming all of the people and groups that allegedly support it. That's what the conservative TV host Glenn Beck did when he claimed that 64 percent of Americans support the controversial Arizona immigration bill that Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law in April of this year. It's also what Brewer did when she cited the support for the legislation among Arizona's law enforcement. It was only a matter of time before the author of the bill, Arizona state senator Russell Pearce, joined the chorus. Talking about the bill on CNN, Russell said that "This is the most popular bill in America. America supports it, overwhelmingly they support it, yet every time folks get on the air, they talk about the Arizona controversial law. Controversy with whom, lawbreakers versus law keepers?" To prove his point, he threw in an eye-catching statistic. "Sixty percent of the Hispanics support it in Arizona." The number seemed high based on the media reports that we've seen, so we decided to investigate. We found several polls that measured support for the law among Hispanics, both at the state and national level. Here is a quick summary: *A national poll conducted by Univision, a Spanish-language television network, in May found that 67 percent of Hispanics oppose the law. *A May poll released by the Wall Street Journal/NBC showed that 70 percent of Hispanics on the national level are either strongly or somewhat opposed to the measure. *A national poll released in June by the Quinnipac University found that 54 percent of Hispanics disapprove of Arizona's immigration law. Most importantly, a study commissioned by the National Council of La Raza along with the Service Employees International Union in May looked at support for the law among registered Hispanic voters in the state of Arizona. It found that 81 percent either strongly or somewhat oppose the law. Only four percent somewhat support it and 12 percent strongly support it. We checked with polling experts to see if we had missed something. "The La Raza poll is probably the best poll available for gauging Hispanic attitudes" toward the immigration law, said Fred Solop, a Northern Arizona University polling expert. "This poll was run by social scientists, includes an ample sample of Hispanics in the state, and approached the issues somewhat more complexly than other polls." A representative from Pearce's office told us that he was referring to a Rasmussen poll but didn't supply us with more details. So we went digging. In the end, we decided that a possible source of the claim was a poll published on April 21, 2010. That survey looked at attitudes among likely Arizona voters, and found that 70 percent favor the legislation. Broken down by race, the approval rate was 73 percent among white voters, 50 percent among African American voters, and 63 percent among "other". It seems like Pearce took the 63 percent "other" figure and re-labeled it Hispanic. Our polling experts told us that there are numerous problems with that approach. To begin, the "other" category also includes groups like native Americans, not just Hispanics. Moreover, there are some Hispanics who self-define themselves as white, so there could "very well be overlaps between the White and Other," said Solop. Finally, because the poll only looked at likely voters, by the time you get down to how many actual Hispanics were interviewed, you are dealing with a very small sample size, which means that you are at a risk of incurring large margin of error. To be thorough, we got in touch with Scott Rasmussen himself. His office sent us a statement saying that "it would be inappropriate to use our data to state that Hispanic and Latino voters favor the Arizona law." Well, there you have it: Pearce's own source telling us his data was used inaccurately. To recap. Russell Pearce claimed that sixty percent of Hispanics support the Arizona immigration law. During our research, however, we found three national polls and one Arizona-specific poll that showed the exact opposite. On the national level, anywhere from 54 to 70 percent have either a strongly or somewhat unfavorable view of the legislation. On the state level, 70 percent strongly disagree with the law and 11 percent somewhat disagree. What's even more disqualifying, however, is Pearce's misuse of the poll on which he apparently based his claim. The very source that he quoted told us that it's inaccurate to equate the "other" category with "Hispanics", a point of view that we also confirmed with several other polling experts. Pearce earns himself a Pants on Fire.	None	Russell Pearce	None	None	None	2010-07-21T11:56:21	2010-07-07	['Arizona']

pomt-12843	Says a study indicates up to $8.5 billion in lost GDP and up to 185,000 lost jobs if Texas lawmakers approve a measure limiting transgender bathroom choices.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2017/feb/03/texas-association-business/business-group-says-bathroom-law-could-lose-texas-/	A major business group predicts billions of dollars in economic losses should Texas lawmakers advance "discriminatory" legislation including so-called bathroom bills or measures limiting local control of non-discrimination ordinances. We checked on whether the widely cited projections, linked to actions in other states, hold up. Portions of the study commissioned by the Texas Association of Business proved solid. But other elements were shaky. One projection, for instance, rests in the Super Bowl set for Houston on Feb. 5, 2017 being moved to another state. Another extrapolates Texas losses from research rooted in Arizona’s immigration law--not that state’s failed proposal targeting LGBT residents. And the report’s biggest projected loss to Texas starts from an Indiana legislator’s comment that might lack documentary backup. There could be heft to claims that a Texas Senate proposal poses economic risks. Opponents of Senate Bill 6, requiring Texas residents to use bathrooms matching their assigned sex at birth, underscore North Carolina’s experience, which gets TAB attention elsewhere in its report presenting the possible economic losses. In 2016, Republicans in the Tarheel State curbed protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, touching off economic losses mostly tied to boycotts adding up to as much as $201 million, PolitiFact North Carolina confirmed. The TAB, which calls itself the state’s leading advocate for employers, initially highlighted the study that caught our attention in a Dec. 6, 2016, press release urging the 2017 Legislature to spurn "discriminatory legislation." That release said the study, undertaken at St. Edward’s University in Austin, found that a discriminatory law could result in $964 million to $8.5 billion in reduced state gross domestic product and up to 185,000 lost jobs, partly due to fallout in the tourism sector. State GDP refers to the market value of all final goods and services produced within a state in a particular period of time. We broke down the figures in the study, exploring research assumptions and identifying instances of unstated or questionable sourcing. Separately, outside experts sounded a few cautionary notes. University researchers unavailable for interview We were barred from talking to the people who made the projections. But at the association’s request, Brad Zehner, a St. Edward’s associate professor of management, addressed a set of questions in writing. We fielded Zehner’s responses by email from the association’s Belinda Matingou after a university spokeswoman, Mischelle Diaz, advised by email that faculty and students who did the study had signed non-disclosure agreements prohibiting additional commentary. She further said the "research provided should not be interpreted as the official position of the university, but rather that it contains views and opinions of the student teams based on discussions, observations and analysis." Study’s timeframe, scope Zehner wrote that four St. Edward’s business graduate students under faculty supervision reached the projections in December 2015--or more than a year before the 2017 legislative session. That timeframe explains why North Carolina’s experience wasn’t considered; its law won legislative approval in March 2016. We noticed too that as of 2017, none of the study’s three analyzed states still had a mandate like the ones gauged by the study. Arizona’s proposal was vetoed, a Louisiana gubernatorial order was rescinded and Indiana’s law was amended not to apply to LGBT residents. Also, the study presents the potential Texas costs as a three-year forecast. Zehner, asked to explain that length of time, said: "A singular event such as the loss of the Super Bowl or the March Madness tournament does not have a one-time impact on an economy but rather ripples through multiple years as ancillary businesses are impacted. Think about tourism. If out-of-state tourists have a great experience in Austin, Dallas, Houston, or San Antonio, they will tell friends who might decide to vacation in Texas the following year. A multi-year projection is more meaningful than a single-year projection." State by state Let’s look at the numbers behind the projections, state by state. Arizona In 2014, Arizona’s legislature advanced a proposal, vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer, allowing businesses to deny services on religious grounds--a change in law widely taken as permitting discrimination against gays. Prior to the veto, the study says, "several large businesses expressed formal opposition to the bill, including the National Football League, which threatened to take the Super Bowl to another state, at a potential cost of $500 million." The study says Arizona estimates "of costs incurred over the course of three years in cancelled conventions and travel costs equaled $140 million." The study attributes that figure to a February 2014 Arizona Republic news story, though the story attaches that predicted effect to an earlier state law targeting unauthorized U.S. residents that was partly overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012. We asked Danny Court of Elliot D. Pollack and Company, the Scottsdale-based firm that reached the figure, to review the Texas citation. By email, Court commented: "Our report had nothing to do with issues pertaining to religious freedom policies." Court further said it’s "unclear, but likely, that the $140 million figure was not the correct figure to base an extrapolation from." Then again, he said by phone, he hasn’t probed if a Texas law would result in greater or lesser losses. In the Arizona analysis, the Texas study says the estimated three-year impact of similar Texas legislation could be $464 million to $964 million, that high-end figure, we confirmed, rests in Texas losing the equivalent of the 2017 Super Bowl. The study says: "• Houston is scheduled to host the 2017 Super Bowl. LGBT activists have lobbied for the National Football League to move the event, but it will continue as planned. "• As Texas’ travel and tourism industry is three times larger than Arizona’s (Dean Runyan Associates, 2015), the potential drop in tourism could amount to $464 million over three years. "• This equates to a loss of approximately 12,000 jobs." We confirmed the listed travel and tourism figures, also determining from Matingou and Zehner that the researchers calculated job losses by dividing the economic loss projections by the $46,000 annual average Texas wage as of May 2015. A Bureau of Labor Statistics chart pegs that wage for all Texas occupations -- meaning plenty of jobs not directly connected to tourism -- was $46,560. Louisiana Louisiana legislators in 2015 didn’t reach a law to protect businesses from negative consequences for denying services on religious grounds. Gov. Bobby Jindal then placed such provisions into an executive order later rescinded by Jindal’s Democratic successor, John Bel Edwards. According to the Texas study, the city of New Orleans predicted Jindal’s order would cause 85 percent of the city’s top conventions not to return. The study, applying that declaration to conventions in Houston and to Texas sales tax revenue, says the estimated impact of a Texas law could be as high as $1 billion, risking 26,000 jobs. We didn’t see a source in the study for New Orleans’ top conventions not returning. But a web search yielded a May 2015 Travel Weekly news story quoting Stephen Perry, ceo of the New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau, talking about the failed legislation. According to the story, Perry said 80 percent to 85 percent of the city's "most important corporate customers" called to say that if it were to pass, "it’s unlikely we’re going to be able to come back here." The story also quoted Perry saying Jindal’s order "caused a lot of consternation and confusion." We asked a bureau spokesman, Kristian Sonnier, about Perry’s conventions statement. By email, Sonnier offered that "our industry had approximately $1 billion/year in corporate convention and special event business at stake that would have been put at risk by our state government passing an anti-LGBTQ bill and," he said, Jindal’s order. Indiana In 2015, the TAB-requested study says, Indiana’s legislature voted to allow businesses to refuse service due to objections on religious grounds. After negative reactions, the study notes, legislators amended the law to blunt its effect on LGBT residents. Still, the study says, the economic impact was calculated as $1.5 billion in short-term losses alone. The study footnotes that figure to a web link that didn’t work when we tried. But we found an April 2015 WNDU news story attributing the $1.5 billion figure to an Indiana legislator, Terri Austin, quoted saying that she’d talked to industry professionals and concluded the original Indiana act had caused the state to lose $1.5 billion in meetings and conventions. "I talked to some of the industry professionals just to get the facts and figures so I didn't just pull them out of thin air," Austin said. We tried to reach Austin about what went into her figure, which she brought up in April 2015 legislative debate. At our inquiry, John Schorg, a staff spokesman for Indiana’s Democratic House caucus, said Austin told him that she drew on discussions she had with the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, the Indiana Restaurant and Hotel Lodging Association and the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce. Schorg said documentation of the figure, if any, is long gone. Indiana’s losses might not have been that huge. A web search led us to a January 2016 Indianapolis Star news story stating that according to the city’s tourism agency, the furor surrounding Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act "might have cost the city of Indianapolis as many as 12 conventions and up to $60 million in economic impact," which would break out to 4 percent of the bandied $1.5 billion figure. The story said Chris Gahl, vice president of marketing for Visit Indy, reported that in 2015, 12 conventions cited RFRA as at least one reason they chose not to book Indianapolis. But that loss of $60 million amounted to a small piece of Indianapolis's $4.5 billion tourism industry, the story said. Matingou put us in touch with Gahl, who affirmed the $60 million loss, adding by email: "This economic impact number would have significantly escalated had the amendment" protecting LGBT residents "not been put in place so swiftly." Neither he nor other Indiana officials we reached offered a basis or backup data for the $1.5 billion figure. The Texas study accurately recapped fall-out in Indiana before its law was amended including an NCAA chief expressing serious concerns over hosting events in the state, Apple CEO Tim Cook penning a critical commentary and Indianapolis-based Angie’s List saying it was cancelling a $40 million headquarters expansion due to Indiana’s law. The Texas study says that if a similar law passed in Texas, the estimated impact could reach $8.5 billion. How so? "Given that the Texas travel industry has a $31 billion annual impact, a 15 percent reduction would result in an overall loss of $8.5 billion," the study says, "or 0.5% of the State GDP, the same percentage GDP loss experienced by Indiana," which equates to more than 150,000 jobs, the study says. This needed unpacking. We didn’t see a study source for the stated $31 billion annual impact of the Texas travel industry though Matingou pointed out that Oregon-based Dean Runyan Associates, which employs its model to calculate travel and tourism spending for states, pegged the 2015 GDP of the Texas travel industry at $33.5 billion. Also, Matingou told us, the "15 percent" reduction was a typo that should have said "0.5 percent," as the study states otherwise. She further said the researchers projected Texas potentially losing $8.5 billion in GDP starting from the realization that the $1.5 billion in declared losses to Indiana was equal to 0.5 percent of that state’s GDP. Applying the same percentage to Texas’s GDP of $1.7 trillion, she noted, breaks out to $8.5 billion. We didn’t spot sources for state GDPs in the study. When we asked, Matingou said the study relied on a July 2015 report from the Texas state comptroller stating Texas had a 2015 Gross State Product of $1.657 trillion; researchers rounded that up to $1.7 billion, she said, with 0.5 percent of that being $8.5 billion. Outside experts Experts including economist John Gnuschke of the University of Memphis mostly saw no major problems with the research approach. Gnuschke wrote: "State-to-state impact comparisons are widely used for studies of this kind but are difficult given the wide range of policy variations and economic conditions in each state," Gnuschke wrote. "Individual states find it difficult to assess the impact of any policy." But economist Craig Depken of the University of North Carolina-Charlotte and Timothy Werner, a University of Texas professor, each urged caution in converting data from other states into specific Texas forecasts. Werner said: "One of the biggest challenges faced by this sort of study is that we don’t have a lot of data on the actual effects of these bills, as only one (in North Carolina) has gone into effect." A Wharton professor, Maurice Schweitzer, and Don Hoyte of Austin, a former 20-year analyst for the Texas state comptroller’s office, each said he’d expect an anti-LGBT law to be detrimental to the Texas economy. Schweitzer said, though, precise "figures are difficult to forecast, because the effects can snowball—once one company or sporting event boycotts a state, others are more likely to follow. Though I cannot forecast the exact amount, I am positive that a measure limiting transgender bathroom choices will harm the Texas economy." Hoyte said a weakness is the study’s focus on the overall state economy when it makes better sense to expect distinct effects among local economies--tourism-dependent San Antonio, for instance, or other big cities in terms of the likelihood of big sporting events not coming to town. Matingou later reminded us the study presented ranges of possible impact, also saying: "The researchers you consulted echo TAB’s concern that discriminatory legislation will have a significant, negative impact on the Texas economy." Our ruling The TAB said a study projects up to $8.5 billion in lost GDP and up to 185,000 lost jobs in Texas if lawmakers approve a discriminatory measure like proposals in other states. Such a law might cause economic shivers. But we find this study’s headlined figures, reached about 13 months ago, to be based on predicted or actual effects of discriminatory mandates in Arizona, Louisiana and Indiana that didn’t make it into law or were rescinded or softened. Moreover, not all the study’s numbers, calculations and assumptions proved solid and a key figure, reflecting on Indiana losing $1.5 billion in conventions, doesn't appear to have a documented basis.

pomt-04542	Says Lois Frankel "took a 40 percent pay raise" as mayor while West Palm Beach "lost jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/28/yg-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-lois-frankel-over-pay-raise-jobs/	The YG Action Fund launched an ad bashing Democratic congressional candidate Lois Frankel’s tenure as West Palm Beach mayor. YG (which stands for Young Guns) is supporting Frankel’s Republican opponent Adam Hasner in the Broward/Palm Beach Congressional District 22. Their cartoonish ad shows a smiling headshot of Frankel and makes a series of claims about her tenure as mayor. Here is part of the script: "Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise with our money. We lost jobs," says the narrator while the text on the screen states "West Palm Beach lost jobs." The ad then continues: "Frankel flew from a posh country club to a party across town in a police helicopter. You sat in traffic. Frankel went on a spending spree resulting in a budget deficit. You? Higher taxes to pay for it. $13,000 in taxpayer money for a designer marble bathroom in Frankel's office." You can read here about a TV station pulling the ad over a dispute about the word "deficit." (A spokesman for the PAC told us that a new version omits the word "deficit" and that some other stations didn’t object to the original version.) For this fact-check, we will examine whether Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise while West Palm Beach lost jobs. 2004 pay raise The ad doesn’t explain when Frankel -- who served as mayor from 2003 to 2011 -- took that 40 percent pay raise. A spokesman for the PAC said the pay raise referred to 2004 and sent us quotes from Palm Beach Post articles that year. We will pull information from those articles: In January 2004, Frankel formed a committee to explore whether she and commissioners should get a pay raise. She said she was forming the committee because the city code required an annual review of all employee salaries. At the time, the city foresaw a budget shortfall of $110,000 -- the prior year it had a $2 million shortfall. The committee recommended increasing the mayor’s salary and the city commission obliged. (We were unable to quickly obtain the committee’s report or commission meeting minutes ourselves from a city spokesman so we relied on the Post’s articles about it.) On July 6, 2004, the city commission unanimously voted to raise Frankel’s salary from $89,250 to $125,000 effective Oct. 1. That’s an increase of about $35,750 or 40 percent. The last time the mayor received a raise was 1998, the Post wrote. Frankel didn’t vote on the pay raise, her campaign said. The city has a strong mayor form of government in which the mayor votes to break a tie, which wasn’t necessary in this case. The Post wrote that Frankel’s new salary would place her in the middle range compared with other strong mayors. (Strong mayors tend to earn higher salaries than other mayors because strong mayors are the chief executive.) The city commissioners received a smaller pay boost. (PolitiFact Florida contacted a couple other large cities with strong mayors and found these annual salaries in 2004: Tampa, $135,000; St. Petersburg $110,334.) An analyst in the city’s human resources department told us that Frankel’s annual salary remained at $125,000 from 2004 through 2011. Frankel’s response about the pay raise Frankel doesn’t dispute that she got that pay raise. "The city commission voted unanimously to adopt the recommendations of a blue-ribbon committee that called for raising the salaries of West Palm Beach's elected officials to be more competitive," wrote Frankel spokesman Joshua Karp. He cited this sentence from a Palm Beach Post article: The blue-ribbon committee "said the mayor’s pay hadn’t kept pace with the demands of the job in a fast-growing city." But as for the second half of the claim -- while West Palm Beach "lost jobs" -- Frankel points to some different statistics about employment than those sent to us by the PAC. Were taxpayers losing their own jobs while paying Frankel a higher paycheck? The ad says that West Palm Beach lost jobs as Frankel’s own taxpayer-funded paycheck soared. A spokesman for the PAC sent us data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the unemployment rate starting in March 2003 when Frankel took office and through her tenure in March 2011 and beyond. But that data was for the entire metropolitan area, which extends beyond the city boundaries. We looked at Local Area Unemployment Statistics data for just the city of West Palm Beach. That showed the unemployment rate rose from 5.8 percent in March 2003 to 10.2 percent in March 2011. Frankel’s tenure overlapped with the national recession -- the rise in unemployment wasn’t unique to her city. But during her tenure, the number of employed workers also rose -- from 42,876 to 44,848. (Her campaign cited some regional figures showing growth in the number of employed people.) So while it’s true that unemployment rose, the number of employed workers also rose. We interviewed Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida about the unemployment statistic emphasized by one side and the employment figures emphasized by the other. Both are important to get a picture of the labor market, he said. "You can't cherry-pick your favorite statistic and point to that and have it as definitive evidence," he said. "Neither is superior." The unemployment rate relates to the number of unemployed people relative to the labor force. That means if some unemployed people give up looking for work, the employment rate can improve even though in reality the situation hasn’t improved. Generally speaking, city mayors can’t take much of the blame or credit for unemployment or employment. "There is only so much (mayors) can do when financial markets are in disarray, and the housing market has imploded," Snaith said. "I don’t care how adept you are at sweet-talking businesses." If we thought that Frankel should take the blame for the unemployment spike during part of her tenure then we’d also have to give her credit for the drop in annual unemployment to below 4 percent between 2005 and 2007. Our ruling The YG Action PAC said that "Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise as mayor." Frankel did form a committee to explore whether she should get a pay raise and that resulted in a 40 percent boost -- an extra $35,750 -- in 2004. However the ad omits the context for that raise -- the mayor’s salary hadn’t had an increase since 1998 and after she got the raise in 2004, her salary then remained set at $125,000 a year until she left office in 2011. The ad also stated that while Frankel got a hefty pay hike, the city "lost jobs." The unemployment rate rose from about 5.8 percent to 10.2 percent during her tenure. But the number of employed actually increased slightly and Frankel can’t be blamed for a national recession. If we look at the big swing that occurred in the economy, "no mayor in the world would be able to counterbalance the forces that were in play," Snaith said. For those omissions about context, we rate this claim Half True.	None	YG Action Fund	None	None	None	2012-09-28T14:34:31	2012-09-28	['None']

pomt-08542	Says Kurt Schrader voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare, threatening "thousands of Oregon seniors and their access to their current coverage."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/02/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-says-kurt-schrader-cut-500-billion-med/	Politicians love seniors. It's a bloc that stays put, pays attention and, most importantly, votes. So it's no surprise that the over-65 crowd figure prominently in elections. In Oregon's 5th Congressional District, Republican challenger Scott Bruun is accusing Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., of voting to cut $500 billion from Medicare, and hurting seniors. In Bruun's first television ad, "Broken," he says: "I believe that $500 billion in cuts to Medicare is wrong, and hurts our seniors." In his second ad, "Seen," he goes even further: "The Kurt Schrader record. $500 billion in cuts to Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Schrader's vote threatens thousands of Oregon seniors and their access to their current coverage." Really? Thousands of seniors? At risk of losing their current health care? A quick check shows this is a common complaint among Republicans. Remember, in March not one Republican in Congress voted for President Barack Obama's controversial health care overhaul. PolitiFact National has already debunked the notion that seniors will be hurt by changes to Medicare called for by Obama's health reform plan. Bruun's campaign statements give the impression that less money will be spent on seniors, that $500 billion will be lopped from Medicare immediately, and that seniors are in danger of losing health care benefits. All that is misleading. To back up, Medicare is the basic federal health plan for seniors 65 and older. Medicare Advantage is a more generous version that some seniors choose to buy from private providers. It's true the federal government will reduce the growth of future spending on Medicare over the next decade. The reforms to Medicare will result in $500 billion in savings over 10 years. But the law does not eliminate $500 billion out of the current budget for Medicare. There are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits. In fact, spending on Medicare will actually increase over the next decade, reaching $845 billion in 2019, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Without reform, Medicare spending in 2019 was projected to be $943 billion. So then the question becomes, does a reduction in future spending mean a reduction in quality or quantity of medical services? No, says Tricia Neuman, director of the Kaiser foundation's Medicare Policy Project. The $500 billion in savings will come from a mix: Higher insurance premiums for wealthier seniors, reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage plans, a new panel to oversee reimbursement rates, and smaller-than-expected increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. (Neuman provides an easy to understand 19-minute tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website.) Payment reforms to Medicare Advantage programs are long overdue. The programs are popular, but cost more. Reducing the payments to the private companies that provide the programs is projected to help trim $136 billion from Medicare Advantage over 10 years. But it's not all reductions and savings -- something else Bruun doesn't flesh out. On the plus side, health care reform means Medicare recipients will get more preventive health care services, such as wellness visits, and they won't face the "doughnut hole" gap in prescription coverage left by the original Medicare Part D. Cynthia Chilton, a Multnomah County counselor with Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance, said elder advocates are watching, but the situation looks OK for now. Premiums for next year will not skyrocket, she said, and seniors will get free preventive care visits starting in January. She rejects the claim that changes to Medicare will harm seniors. "No, it doesn't mean that seniors will be hurt. It might be better," Chilton said. Finally, we note that as evidence, the Bruun campaign offered a July 2009 story by The Oregonian, which includes this sentence: "The health care bill written by House Democrats calls for $500 billion in Medicare cuts over 10 years to help offset the enormous cost of providing care to 45 million uninsured Americans." The context of the story was that Oregon providers could suffer disproportionately if payment rates go down. That's because services here are cheaper than in other states. The story ran in print with the headline "Oregon health care hit for being too efficient." More significantly, it was written before Oregon's congressional Democrats wrangled higher Medicare reimbursements for providers in Oregon in negotiations for their yes votes on reform in March. Overall, the health care reforms are designed to reward efficiency -- and that may be a good thing for seniors here. PolitiFact Oregon's view is that Bruun's statement contains some element of truth -- the $500 billion figure. But it ignores critical facts that would give voters a different impression. The ad conflates actual cuts with decreases in future spending, over the next decade for a program expected to expand, and it fails to mention any of the benefits to seniors under the new Medicare program. We rate this statement Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Scott Bruun	None	None	None	2010-10-02T12:00:00	2010-09-30	['Oregon', 'Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-14975	Says Bernie Sanders once said, "Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/16/viral-image/internet-graphic-says-bernie-sanders-slammed-antid/	Ever since Bernie Sanders announced his campaign for president, journalists have been poring over his writings from late 1960s and early 1970s Vermont, some of which have raised eyebrows. As we’ve noted previously, Sanders back then wrote pieces in alternative media floating such proposals as legalizing all drugs and ending compulsory K-12 education -- positions he no longer holds. But we hadn’t heard the quote attributed to him in an Internet graphic that a reader sent our way. Superimposed over a photograph of Sanders, it said, "Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable." We asked the reader who sent us the image for the original source, and he sent us to a personal page on Facebook. That page alone reported more than 9,000 shares and 1,000 likes for the Sanders image. But did Sanders really say (or write) this? We took a closer look. A quick Google search provided an answer. Those words were actually written by Theodore Kaczynski. Kaczynski was arrested in 1996 and accused of sending mail bombs to universities and airlines that resulted in three deaths and 23 injuries over two decades; he pled guilty and is now serving four life sentences. Kaczynski was captured after he sent a 35,000-word "manifesto" to the Washington Post and the New York Times in 1995, saying he would commit another bombing unless it was published in full. On the recommendation of the attorney general and the FBI director, the Post published it as a supplement to the newspaper. Its publication is credited with breaking the case, after Kaczynski’s brother David recognized the writing style and arguments in the manifesto as his estranged brother’s and informed the authorities. Here’s a portion of the manifesto, archived on the Post’s site: "Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual’s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable." The wording is identical to what’s in the graphic. To their credit, a number of commenters on the original Facebook page figured out that the quote was actually by Kaczynski. Our ruling The Internet graphic says Sanders said, "Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs." He didn’t -- Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, wrote that in his 1995 manifesto. Pants on Fire!	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2015-10-16T14:17:29	2015-10-15	['None']
pomt-15159	Gov. Maggie Hassan’s budget proposal "raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/aug/27/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-calls-nh-gov-maggie-hassans-b/	What’s a tax increase? In examining the big claims about New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan’s budget proposals made by the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity, that’s the question that keeps coming up. An ad released earlier this month by the Koch Brothers-backed AFP says Hassan’s budget proposal "raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million." We decided to take a closer look at the claim. In doing so, we had to consider what is and isn’t a tax increase. Is a tax increase simply increasing the rate of a tax that someone pays? Or can it also mean changing the law to make a tax apply more broadly, so that more people pay? Can it mean giving the state greater powers to collect taxes already owed? We’ll come back to those questions in a second. We decided to examine this claim in two parts and reached out to the New Hampshire’s state director of Americans for Prosperity and the governor’s office. The first claim is that Hassan’s new budget "raises taxes on small businesses." The ad cites as its source an op-ed that ran in the New Hampshire Business review in 2011 -- before Hassan was elected governor -- talking about an obscure provision of state tax law. The details are complex, but can be simply sketched. New Hampshire taxes profits but not personal income, which can lead to questions from the state Department of Revenue if a business pays out most the money it makes to its owner as tax-deductible salary. Small businesses, as noted by the New Hampshire Business Review in a later article, are sensitive to such regulations because of the record-keeping required. When Republican Bill O’Brien ran the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013, the party altered these "reasonable compensation" rules, putting more of a burden on the state to justify audits. The GOP didn’t call the change a tax cut outright, but it came close. "This bill will provide real world protections against government’s excessive regulation and whimsical taxation levels on people’s personal income as small business owners," said state Sen. Andy Sanborn in a 2011 House Republican press release. Hassan proposed reverting to the earlier rules, as well as other code revisions, to "restore business revenues to what they were," as summarized by the Concord Monitor’s Allie Morris in February. The amount of money these changes would raise depends on the proposal you’re looking at. The governor’s initial February budget said they would raise $59 million in total. Her compromise proposal in July said that would raise some $20 million. Regardless, AFP cited this change as a tax increase. Greg Moore, the state director of Americans for Prosperity -- and former chief of staff under O’Brien in the House -- puts it this way: "The governor’s proposal would seek to reverse this legislation and flip the burden of proof back to small businesses, with the stated goal of increasing tax revenue." That 2011 bill, he says, "represented a reduction in taxation for small businesses in New Hampshire. Reversing this law would, therefore, represent an increase in taxation for small businesses in New Hampshire." Needless to say, Hassan’s office disagrees vehemently with this characterization. Pamela Walsh, the governor’s chief of staff, explained her position as a matter of fairness. If you claim tax credits, she wrote, "you have to be prepared to show that you actually earned those credits if the IRS asks." Such rules protect taxpayers, she said, and the governor’s budget is merely asking businesses to do the same. It boils down to this, Walsh says. "None of these proposals – nor the existing law – change what people owe in taxes (except to lower their obligation). It just allows DRA – as it can for all other taxes – to request fair documentation to protect all taxpayers." Walsh also noted that the governor’s compromise budget proposal exempted 5,500 small business from paying the business enterprise tax. Such an exemption could, for these companies at least, be seen as a cut. At a certain point, the spin from both sides has to be discounted here, and the facts have to be looked at. The facts are these: Hassan proposes changing state tax rules. Changes in those tax rules will bring in more money. Businesses would pay that money in the form of taxes. Hassan proposes spending that revenue on new programs. It may well be, as Walsh suggests, that this clamping down is merely making businesses pay what they owe already. But the changes Hassan proposes are substantive and have been debated -- and changed -- by the Legislature before. AFP’s citation in the ad was confusing and relied on viewers to have an understanding of the state budget that few outside of the government or news media possess. But the basic statement seems to stand on its own. If you told someone on the street that the state was proposing legal changes to bring in $20 million to $59 million more from businesses in taxes, that person would likely characterize that change as a tax increase. It’s a defensible interpretation of the facts, if not one shared by the governor’s office. Increases taxes and fees? The second part of the ad we’re checking is AFP’s claim that Hassan proposed increasing taxes and fees by $100 million dollars. The ad cites an Associated Press story from July, but the figure is nowhere to be found in Kathleen Ronayne’s reporting. It is instead taken from this quote from state Senate President Chuck Morse: "Proposing $100 million in new taxes and revenues is not going to work for the Senate." Here, the issue is relatively clear. In her original and compromise budgets, Hassan listed three sources of significant new revenue. 1. A 21-cent increase in the cigarette tax. Her budget proposal from February says this would raise $39.2 million, while her July revision predicts an extra $32.6 million. (Moore suggests these numbers are optimistic, given that the extra taxes could reduce tobacco consumption.) 2. A $5 increase to register vehicles, as well as a hike in title fees. This money would go to cover highway-related costs. It totals about $29.4 million. 3. The changes to tax rules and closing of loopholes mentioned in the first section of this fact check. As stated earlier, this number differs dramatically from February ($55.4 million) to July ($20 million.) The numbers from Hassan’s proposals can be added up in two different ways. One of them includes all the new revenue sources outlined in February ($39.2 million + $29.4 million + $55.4 million), and totals $124 million. The other would include her July proposals ($32.6 million + $29.4 million + $20 million, and would total about $82 million. But are those increases? For the governor’s part, Walsh says that "AFP’s decision to count updated revenue estimates and fair documentation changes – which don’t change what people owe in taxes – as ‘tax and fee increases’ is completely dishonest." Moore maintains simply that changes to state law that lead to more revenue equals a tax or fee increase. While there’s no easy resolution to that standoff, it make sense to say whether the ad is defensible on its own terms. Given the revenue numbers that Hassan cited in her February budget -- regardless of any quotes or citations applied to the ad -- the $100 million number can be defended as long as both taxes and fees are included. The text onscreen in the ad says that "Hassan proposes raising taxes by $100 million," which is incorrect because tax changes alone don’t equal that much. Our ruling The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity says that Gov. Maggie Hassan’s budget proposal "raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million." Hassan indeed proposes changes that would result in more tax money being paid by businesses in the state. Yes, some small businesses would receive a tax break under the governor’s compromise plan, but the other changes still apply. And looking at a list of tax and fee changes the governor put together in February -- including the tweaks to the tax code -- easily adds up to $100 million. Overall, we find the statement to be accurate, but it could use additional clarification and documentation. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00086	Under the GOP tax law, "if you live in Hinsdale, Illinois … you are now being double-taxed to the tune of $35,000."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/oct/31/sean-casten/casten-tax-claim-taxed-facts/	The effects of the new GOP tax law have played an outsized role in the tight race for the west suburban 6th Congressional District where U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, a key architect of the landmark overhaul, is fighting for his seat against Democratic challenger Sean Casten. The two met for their final televised debate last week, and afterwards we gave Roskam a Pants on Fire! for making a claim about a Washington Post fact-check he said debunked attacks over his position on safeguarding health insurance protections for those with pre-existing conditions. No such fact-check exists. At that same debate, Casten also leveled a claim that left us puzzled. It involved the tax law, which Roskam accused the Democrat of misrepresenting. "Sean has also taken on a tactic of going door to door out in the western suburbs putting notice [sic] on people’s homes telling them that their taxes are going to go up," the Republican said. "And that’s not true." Casten then rattled off numbers in an effort to demonstrate that he, not Roskam, was the truth-teller when it came to the tax law. "If you live in Hinsdale, Illinois, your average state and local taxes are $45,000 a year," Casten said. "You are now being double-taxed to the tune of $35,000." For starters, Casten’s choice of words was murky. Did he mean Hinsdale taxpayers were facing a $35,000 increase on their tax bills? Or did he mean that $35,000 more of their income was now exposed to being taxed because of Roskam and his fellow Republicans? More broadly, though, we wondered if Casten might be right that most Hinsdale residents will pay more under the GOP law. Deceptive data The first questions are easy to answer. A Casten spokeswoman pointed us to IRS data that made it clear that when he invoked the term double-taxing he did not intend to suggest that average tax bills were going up by $35,000. For 2015, Hinsdale residents who took the so-called SALT deduction for state income and property taxes claimed an average for that category of more than $48,000. The next year the average claim in Hinsdale was nearly $44,000. The new tax law now caps SALT deductions at $10,000, meaning that roughly $35,000 would have been disallowed for deductions each year if the rules had been in effect in 2015 and 2016. But it’s important to note that the SALT cap doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The tax overhaul made a number of other changes, from lowering federal tax rates to raising or allowing more people to benefit from various exemptions and credits. In Hinsdale, where the 2016 median income was $173,500 according to census figures, it’s likely a number of residents stand to benefit from other alterations in the law, among them an expanded credit for children and a doubling of the standard deduction. Casten’s argument also relies on the tax experience of an average Hinsdale resident, which is misleading on multiple levels. Nearly 40 percent of filers in Hinsdale didn’t itemize deductions on their 2016 returns, opting instead to take the standard deduction. The SALT cap is likely to mean nothing to these filers in the future, since they didn’t take the deduction in the first place. Hinsdale may be a well-to-do suburb, but those at the very top of the income heap benefit far more from itemizing their deductions than do everybody else. IRS data show that 37 percent of tax filers in Hinsdale listed income of $200,000 or more in 2016, yet those filers accounted for nearly 82 percent of dollars claimed for itemized deductions that year. "You’re not talking about the typical person in that particular jurisdiction," said Jon Davis, an expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who directs that school's Institute of Government & Public Affairs. "You’re talking about an average, which is skewed. That in itself can be misleading to the public." Tax hike or tax cut? The broader question posed by Casten’s claim is whether the average Hinsdale resident would be hit by an actual tax increase because of the actions of Roskam and his fellow Republicans. That’s what fliers posted around Hinsdale and several other towns by Casten’s campaign contend. "Your tax bill could increase an average of $19,169 due to the loss of State and Local Property Tax (SALT) deductions," the fliers read. To back up that claim, Casten’s spokeswoman sent us a spreadsheet detailing the campaign’s calculations. The spreadsheet, however, makes it clear that $19,169 figure refers to a diminished SALT deduction, not a tax increase. "The disallowed deduction is not the tax effect," Davis, the accounting expert, said. "The tax effect is the disallowed deduction times the tax rate." In short, the campaign fell short in basic math. But even if they had done it correctly, other provisions in the tax law mean an increase in federally taxable income due to the SALT cap won’t necessarily translate into a tax hike for many in Hinsdale or other communities in the congressional district. The Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning group with a solid reputation for number-crunching, created an online calculator that attempts to account for the tax law changes, including the SALT cap. To test it out, we plugged in information for a married couple making $200,000 with no children who itemized their return but filed only for SALT with the average itemized amount for state and local taxes in Hinsdale. Even in that limited situation, the Tax Foundation calculates such a family would receive a tax cut of about $1,000 under the new law. Add two children and the savings increase to $5,000, thanks to the law’s expanded child tax credit. Our ruling Casten said that under the GOP tax law, "if you live in Hinsdale, Illinois … you are now being double-taxed to the tune of $35,000." His vague debate comment suggests — and fliers his campaign have posted around the area claim — that because of the cap on SALT deductions, residents could be hit with massive increases on their tax bill for 2018. But Casten’s statement ignores the reality that the calculation of any tax averages for Hinsdale are heavily skewed by a minority of residents who are very wealthy. It also fails to recognize the many other factors at play in the new tax law. The Republican overhaul made several changes to past tax law, some of which may come as a benefit to taxpayers and some of which may not. By focusing only on the downside, and exaggerating its impact at that, Casten’s claim greatly distorts the tax situation for the constituents he seeks to serve. We rate his claim False.

pomt-06333	Ilana Shafran Mandel’s stake in Forest City Enterprises "constitutes significantly less than 1 percent" of the company’s shares and any implication of a conflict of interest "is legally incorrect."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/10/josh-mandel/wifes-assets-company-not-conflict-interest-casino-/	Now that Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel has submitted his personal financial disclosure statement to the U.S. Senate, where he hopes to serve if he can win the election next year, the scope of his holdings are in focus. Nearly all of his household wealth is his wife’s, and her assets -- worth anywhere from $1.95 million to more than $7 million in 2010 -- are held in a family trust that she will not control until later in life, the Republican candidate says. Reporters and political operatives were eager to see the extent of Ilana Shafran Mandel’s assets, and not merely because of an interest in wealth. There is also a political and journalistic reason for poring over financial disclosure reports: They reveal the trip wires over which politicians can stumble. Which brings us to Forest City Enterprises, the real estate development, management and investment firm headquartered in Cleveland. The company started as a lumber business, founded by siblings who emigrated from Poland. Mandel’s wife is the granddaughter of one of them, the late Fannye Shafran, whose maiden name, Ratner, is well known in Northeast Ohio. Forest City went public in 1960, and as recently as last year, Ilana Shafran Mandel owned Forest City stock worth anywhere from $315,003 to $650,000, according to her husband’s disclosure statement. Exact amounts are impossible to ascertain because Senate financial disclosure forms only report values in ranges. This information about Forest City is important because of a statement made by Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino when the financial disclosure report was distributed to reporters on Nov. 4: "First, Josh has no interest whatsoever in Forest City Enterprises. Second, Forest City Enterprises is not a ‘family company.’ … Third, Ilana’s investment in Forest City Enterprises constitutes significantly less than 1 percent of the total issued and outstanding shares." It’s that last part that PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at. Why would this matter? Well, remember what we said about potential trip wires? Prior to his sending in his financial disclosure statement, there had been whispers about a trip wire concerning Mandel and Forest City. Mandel’s political opponents, including former GOP Senate contender Kevin Coughlin, suggested the answer might be in this disclosure filing. This was specifically what Coughlin was alluding to when he said in September on "Capitol Square," an Ohio News Network public affairs program, that "there may be some issues about interest in the family business, which is involved in development, involved in casino development -- and he cast a vote last June on casinos in Ohio." The vote, when Mandel served in the Ohio legislature, was to approve a wide set of rules governing casinos in Ohio. One of those casinos, opening in 2012, will operate for at least the first five years in the Higbee Building in downtown Cleveland. The building is owned by Forest City, which is leasing it to Rock Ohio Caesars Cleveland LLC. It is next to Forest City’s Tower City office, hotel and retail center. In addition, Forest City in February sold 16 acresof downtown Cleveland land to the casino developer. This land, too, is next to Tower City, and it is for the casino’s second phase. Let’s check the score: As a state legislator, Mandel voted to approve casino rules after Ohio voters passed a constitutional amendment allowing casino gambling. One of those casinos, opening next year, is buying and leasing property from Forest City Enterprises. And Mandel’s wife, the granddaughter of a Forest City founder, owns stock in Forest City, or at least did in 2010, as the new financial disclosure report shows. Is there a problem here? Mandel, through Aquilino, says no. But anticipating questions, Aquilino included his statement when giving the disclosure report to reporters. (He gave it to the press before the Senate even received it.) He said the implication of a conflict of interest in Mandel’s casino vote "is legally incorrect and absurd." That’s the second piece of Mandel’s claim that PolitiFact Ohio took a look at. PolitiFact Ohio is not qualified to pass legal judgment. But we verified two important points made by Aquilino, on behalf of the treasurer. First, Forest City, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, had a market capitalization as of Nov. 7, 2011, of $2.35 billion, according to YCharts and MarketWatch, which track data on publicly traded companies.Market capitalization is a measure of the company’s value. You get it by multiplying the share price by the number of outstanding shares. We do not know how many Forest City shares Ilana Shafran Mandel owns, but we know the maximum value in 2010 was $650,000. That means, based on Forest City’s market capitalization, her stake in Forest City amounted to less than 0.03 percent in 2010. We can get somewhat higher figures by looking at Forest City’s stock price at various periods in 2010, but they still don’t even amount to a rounding error. This percentage is important because of an advisory opinionissued in 1999 by the Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee. The opinion said that Ohio’s conflict-of-interest statute "does not prohibit a member of the General Assembly from voting on legislation which specifically grants money to a company in which the member owns less than 5 percent of the issued and outstanding stock of the company." If that’s not clear enough, the opinion also put it this way: "It would appear from this statute that where a public official owns less than 5 percent of the issued and outstanding stock, that amount is not considered substantial enough to cause a conflict of interest and therefore prohibit the official from participating." Call us obstinate, but we’ve known a few lawyers, and what if this opinion applied to only a very narrow set of circumstances or a specific legislative vote? So we called the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee and spoke with Pete Russell, the general counsel. Nope, Russell said. That 5 percent threshold is generally the rule for when a member should abstain.. That’s not to say Ilana Shafran Mandel doesn’t own a healthy amount of Forest City stock. And it isn’t to say that Democrats won’t look at her roughly half-a-million-dollar stake in Forest City and ask whether her husband should have abstained from voting, strictly on principle. We’re willing to bet on that. But the Mandel campaign is accurate in describing her share of Forest City ownership as minor. And it is correct in citing the 1999 advisory opinion that would appear to apply to Mandel’s legislative vote. On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes Mandel’s statement True.

pomt-14892	On the VA: "Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/09/donald-trump/trump-says-300000-veterans-dies-waiting-va-care/	Donald Trump came to the U.S. Navy stronghold of Norfolk on Halloween afternoon to announce his plan to fix the "disaster" at the Department of Veterans Affairs. "The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable," Trump said at a rally in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin. "Over 300,000 - and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now - over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care." We decided to check Trump’s claim, which also has been made by Carly Fiorina, one of his rivals for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our request for more information, but it’s a safe bet that his statement was based on a Sept. 2 report by the VA’s Office of Inspector General that denounced the agency’s record-keeping system as "inadequate." The inspector general’s investigation, as noted by The Washington Post’s Fact Checker in September, was triggered by whistleblower complaints about backlogs in providing services at the VA. The probe focused on operations at the agency’s Health Eligibility Center, which is described as the "authoritative system for veterans’ health enrollment and eligibility information." It holds about 22.3 million records. The report found that as of Sept. 30, 2014, 866,879 records were listed as "pending," a status given to VA applications that are incomplete - usually because they lack financial information. Of those records, 307,173 pertained to individuals who had been reported dead by the Social Security Administration. So there’s a basis for Trump’s number, but the figure is very complex. The report says the VA’s record-keeping was so shoddy that there’s no way of knowing how many of the 307,000 actually were waiting to be enrolled for VA health care when they died. The agency’s enrollment database was started in 1998 and includes pending files on veterans who died before that year, although the report does not say how many. The inspector general found, for example, that one veteran who died in 1988 still was listed with a pending VA application in 2014. Adding to the complication is that in 2013, the agency added into the entry center’s database "millions" of records from other arms of the VA. Many of these records ended up in the pending file, according to the report, but software glitches made it impossible for investigators to determine how many of the records pertained to veterans seeking health services. You have to remember that the VA provides many services, including home loans and disability payments. In some cases, it provides health care to family members of veterans; patients whose military service has not been confirmed; and people receiving humanitarian care. The report also notes that some of the pending files pertain to people inquiring about services rather than actually applying for them. The VA "does not have a reliable method to distinguish which enrollment records were created in response to an enrollment application or records entered into (the database) by actions other than enrollment," the report says. Making matters worse, about 55 percent of the pending files are missing contact dates with the VA. The omissions make the database "unreliable for monitoring timeliness or determine if a record represents a veteran’s intent to apply for VA health care," according to the report. The inspector general concluded, "Most of the pending records are old and inactive and many of them were misclassified." Our ruling "Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care," Trump said in a Norfolk speech in which he promised to overhaul the VA. Trump offered the most dire possible interpretation of a scathing report on VA record-keeping and went well beyond what the inspector general was able to conclude. The report found that 307,173 dead people were listed last year on a VA database as having pending status with the agency. But shabby records make a detailed dissection of that number impossible. Investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began. No doubt, the VA is ripe for criticism. But Trump’s statement takes liberty with the facts, and we rate it Mostly False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-11-09T00:00:00	2015-10-31	['None']
pomt-02915	"Before the Republican wave in 2010, Democrats had an advantage on the generic ballot in Congress. Even in 1994 with the Gingrich revolution ... Democrats had that advantage."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/03/jonathan-karl/jonathan-karl-looks-back-generic-ballot-1994-and-2/	President Barack Obama and the Democrats got clobbered by health care in recent weeks, George Stephanopoulos said on ABC’s This Week. He asked his experts on the show: "How do you see this playing out as we head toward the midterms next year?" Democrats currently have about an 8-percentage point lead on what is called the "generic ballot" for the 2014 election, Stephanopoulos said. A generic ballot refers to a poll question that asks voters if the election were held today, would they vote for a Republican or a Democrat for Congress. Stephanopoulos and his other guests -- ABC’s Jonathan Karl and 538 blogger Nate Silver -- noted that the recent polls about Obama’s approval rating and the generic ballot don’t necessarily predict the outcome of the 2014 elections. "And you (know) on that point, if you look at where those numbers were before the Republican wave in 2010, Democrats had an advantage on the generic ballot in Congress," Karl said. "Even in 1994 with the Gingrich revolution. I mean you had, Democrats had that advantage. So it wasn't quite as big as it is now, but it wasn't much different." We wondered about Karl’s history. Karl sent us an email stating that he was citing ABC’s polls and emailed us results for registered voters dating back to 1994. The question asked: "If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were being held today, would you vote for (the Democratic candidate) or (the Republican candidate) in your congressional district? In October 2013, the poll showed that Democrats had the advantage 48-40. 2010 election The 2013 results in some way mirrored the results of the poll from October 2009, a little more than a year before Republicans picked up six seats in the Senate and 63 in the House. In October 2009, the ABC News poll showed Democrats leading 51-39. But by February 2010, Republicans were ahead in the same poll 48-45. Democrats pulled back ahead through June, then Republicans led in July and early September. In the final days of October, Republicans were ahead 49-45. Other polls asked the question as well, to slightly different results. Reuters/IPSOS: About a year before the election, Democrats were 1 percentage point ahead and the two parties remained fairly close for much of 2010. USA Today/Gallup: In October 2009, Democrats were ahead 46-44. Then the next month, Republicans were ahead. The numbers remained fairly close for much of 2010. CNN: About a year before election day, Democrats were ahead 50-44 among registered voters. During many points in 2010, Republicans were ahead. In the final days of October, Republicans were ahead 49-43. In all three of the above polls, likely voters gave Republicans a significant edge in the homestretch. 1994 election It was more difficult to find polling prior to the 1994 election, which saw Republicans pick up 54 seats in the House and made the GOP the majority party for the first time since 1952. Karl sent us the results of three ABC polls in the final weeks of the 1994 election which showed the Democrats ahead by 4 or 5 percentage points: 11/6/94: 47-42 10/31/94: 48-44 10/23/94: 50-45 Gallup found between March and October 1994 that the advantage went back and forth between the two parties, and was close near the end. Twice in the final weeks, it was dead even. Silver wrote in his fivethirtyeight blog that Gallup tends to show worse results for Democrats than other likely voter models. In 1994, Gallup gave the edge to Republicans while other polls gave the advantage to Democrats. Relevance of generic ballot We turned to political analyst Larry Sabato for an explanation of the relevance of generic ballots. "The generic ballot is one important indicator of the likely outcome of U.S. House elections, though by itself it cannot predict which party will win control," Sabato said in an email. "It is also true that Democrats tend to have an edge on this measure." The problem, according to Sabato, is that Democratic voters are "inefficiently distributed" and concentrated in urban, minority districts. As evidence, Sabato said Democratic candidates for Congress in 2012 received more votes than their Republican counterparts, yet Republicans won a majority of seats. Our ruling Karl used polling from before the 1994 and 2010 elections to emphasize that people shouldn’t read too much into the fact that Democrats currently hold a 48-40 lead among voters who are asked generically if they’d vote for a Democrat or Republican for Congress. Karl is accurately citing ABC polling leading up to the 1994 and 2010 elections. Other polling we found does not contradict Karl’s statement. We rate this claim True.

pomt-00395	Says Beto O’Rourke said he’s grateful that people are burning or desecrating the American flag.	false	/texas/statements/2018/sep/05/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-falsely-says-beto-grateful-flag-burners/	Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, striving to define his Democratic challenger before voters make up their minds, posted a video snippet indicating Beto O’Rourke gave public thanks for people who trample or burn the American flag. We confirmed that O’Rourke, who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, recently fielded a crowd member’s question about his position on flag desecration. But O’Rourke’s reply didn’t directly take that up, instead revisiting his support of non-violent protests for civil rights and against police misbehavior--which previously extended to his support for NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. Let’s cover Cruz’s claim, then turn to the question posed to O’Rourke and what O’Rourke said. Cruz’s video A 25-second video released Sept. 4, 2018 by Cruz’s campaign opens by showing O’Rourke standing with a microphone in front of Texas and U.S. flags as an audience member is heard saying that "the reason I ask this question is as a voter, I don’t know how I would feel to have my own elected representative being open to kneeling on the Senate floor or encouraging and supporting acts that desecrate our American flag." Next, the video goes silent as text appears: "Beto O’Rourke was asked his views on burning or desecrating the American flag. This was his answer." Finally, the video shows O’Rourke saying: "I think there is something inherently American about that. And so I’m grateful that people are willing to do that." Cruz’s campaign also issued a press release stating O’Rourke had made his comment at a town hall the day before, Labor Day. To our inquiry, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier corrected that timing, saying by email that O’Rourke fielded the question and made his reply at an El Paso town hall Aug. 31, 2018. Frazier also pointed us to the O’Rourke campaign’s post of its Facebook Live video of the town hall, including the full question and answer, and she shared what she described as a transcript of the key question and answer, which we slightly amended after watching the video. The question: "My question is with regards to your remark that there is nothing more patriotic than for NFL players, when discussing NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. And I'm curious as to know if you hold the landmark Texas Supreme Court case—well, the Supreme Court case Texas versus Johnson—to that same standard, where a man was charged for burning and desecrating an American flag on the state Capitol. And do you disagree with the dissenting opinion that the American flag is a unifying symbol that should be respected and revered, as it plays no politics? And I guess the reason I ask this question is, as a voter, I don't know how I would feel to have my own elected representative being open to kneeling on the Senate floor or encouraging and supporting acts that desecrate our American flag." O’Rourke’s reply: "My comments about there being nothing more American were about being—there's nothing more American than standing up for, or in this case kneeling for, your rights under the Constitution. When the women and men who are serving in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Syria tonight, the gentleman who served in Vietnam—when they serve this country, they're not serving a president, they're not serving a political party. They swear their allegiance to the Constitution. This idea that we are a country of laws and that no woman and no man is above or below those laws. "When some people are treated differently because of their race—and we're reminded of the fact that it is not just in the distant past. For someone born in 1972 such as I, that might be the Freedom Riders in the 1960s who rode those Greyhound buses through Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia, and in so doing as African-American women and men, took their lives into their hands, put them on the line. And in many cases those who stood up for civil rights lose their lives in the process. Many were beaten to within an inch of their lives to ensure better civil rights for every single American. "They got us a lot closer than we were before. Witness the Voting Rights Act from 53 years, the civil rights act from 54 years ago. Those would not have been signed into law by Lyndon Baines Johnson if people had not protested, if Rosa Parks had not moved from the back of the bus to the front of the bus. If our young fellow Americans of different colors did not have the audacity and the boldness and the courage to sit at lunch counters knowing that they would be humiliated, knowing that they would be spat upon, knowing that they would be dragged out in front of their fellow human beings. They did all of that to stand up for the equal treatment under law of everyone. "Now, part of the genius of this country, and I think no one expresses it more brilliantly than Martin Luther King Jr., is that in the face of injustice, in the face sometimes of violence, in the face of the very real possibility that you will lose your life in the process, people have been willing to non-violently and peacefully protest to seek political solutions to otherwise intractable problems. "When you have unarmed black men in this country all too often being killed, and sometimes being killed by members of law enforcement—and those members of law enforcement—as I see a former chief of police for the El Paso Police Department, a former county commissioner, someone who exemplifies the best in public service—those are among the very toughest jobs that anyone in any community can hold. Those are also people who put their lives on the line, securing and protecting their fellow citizens in these communities. "But when there is use of force, when there is a life taken and there is not accountability, there is not justice done, there's not the ability to prevent that from continuing to happen in the future, and someone is willing—is willing—to call attention to that, to try to awaken our conscience, to force us to do the right thing, in the face of that injustice and violence and to do so peacefully and non-violently—I think that there is something inherently American about that. And so I—I—I'm grateful that people are willing to do that. I understand that people can come down to a different conclusion on this issue and I respect that, as well. That's American as well. But those are my feelings on the issue and I’m grateful for the question." O’Rourke before When we asked O’Rourke’s campaign about Cruz’s claim, spokesman Chris Evans noted by email a Sept. 4, 2018 Dallas Morning News article flagging the claim as false. Evans, asked if O’Rourke had aired a position on flag burning, pointed out a Sept. 4, 2018 Corpus Christi Caller news story quoting O’Rourke saying after an Aug. 27 event in Austin: "I don't think anyone should burn an American flag. I also don't think this is about flags. It's about people's lives. It's about civil rights. It's about making sure that everyone has an opportunity to succeed and that there is justice and accountability for everyone in this country." We shared that comment with Frazier, who wondered in reply why O’Rourke didn’t say as much in response to the question in El Paso. Frazier suggested too that reasonable people would interpret O’Rourke saying "that is inherently American" and "I’m grateful that people are willing to do that" to be answering the crowd member’s question about people who burn the flag in protest. Supreme Court case And what about that Supreme Court case? By 5-4, the court held in Johnson v. Texas in 1989 that a state couldn’t bar anyone from desecrating the flag due to the First Amendment though the incident itself occurred in 1984 outside the Republican National Convention in Dallas--not at the Texas Capitol. By phone, constitutional scholar Sanford Levinson, a University of Texas law professor, said the court majority, including conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, agreed that flag-burning was protected by the free speech provision in the First Amendment. Regardless, Levinson said, "flag burning is dumb as political technique because you can predict it will alienate far more people than it will encourage." Chief Justice William Rehnquist’s dissent in the case, joined by two justices, said: "For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning." Levinson summed up: "It was not a case about whether or not someone respected the flag. It was about whether you could be jailed if you disrespected it." Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke said he’s "grateful" that people are burning or desecrating the American flag. O’Rourke was asked to speak to a Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to desecrate the flag in nonviolent protest. However, his answer didn’t go there, instead focusing on his support of protests for civil rights and other causes. O'Rourke earlier said he didn't think anyone should burn an American flag.

pomt-12338	"Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/jun/14/gavin-newsom/claim-americans-are-25x-more-likely-be-shot-and-ki/	Gun control is a top priority for California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. So, it’s no surprise Newsom, a Democrat and 2018 candidate for governor, promoted the cause on National Gun Violence Awareness Day. He claimed in a statement on Twitter on June 2, 2017: "Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries. We've had enough. #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay." This is not the first time we’ve fact-checked a gun claim by Newsom. In November 2016, we rated Mostly True his assertion that California has seen a "56 percent decline in the gun murder rate" since the 1990s. Earlier that year, we rated Mostly False his statement that "So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days." In this case, we wondered whether the facts support his claim about the seemingly huge disparity in gun homicide rates between the United States and other developed countries. We’ll fact-check this claim below. First, here’s some background on Newsom and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Newsom is among several prominent Democrats as of now competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; California Treasurer John Chiang and Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction. Announced Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player. As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at politifactca@capradio.org, tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Newsom has supported California’s stringent gun and ammunition laws. In 2016, he proposed and helped pass Proposition 63, a voter initiative that requires instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Our research We interpreted Newsom’s claim of "shot and killed" to mean gun homicides. These are intentional killings using a firearm, not including suicides. To back up the statement, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in March 2016 called "Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010." The study relied on mortality data from 2010 collected by the World Health Organization. It found the rate of gun homicides was 25.2 times higher in the United States than in 22 other populous and high-income countries for which data was also gathered. A sample of those included South Korea, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. When considering all types of gun deaths, such as homicides, accidental shootings and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries, the report said. Authors of study weigh in We contacted the co-authors of this study. Both described Newsom’s claim as "accurate." "Yes, what he said seems accurate," David Hemenway, professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author, said by email. "I think anyone who looks at the data would agree." Erin Grinshteyn, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of San Francisco and the other co-author, also said the claim was correct. Grinshteyn described the report as "purely an academic study." She said her portion of the work was not funded while Hemenway’s participation was funded, in part, by the Joyce Foundation. On its website, the foundation says it supports "research-based strategies that can prevent gun violence by reducing the easy accessibility of firearms." Related study In 2014, PolitiFact examined a related claim by lawyer and author Lisa Bloom that said "Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries." PolitiFact took this to mean gun homicides. It rated her claim Mostly True, citing figures collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. That data showed the United States had a slightly lower gun homicide rate in 2010 than reported in the American Journal of Medicine Study. That, in turn, meant Americans would be closer to 20 times as likely to die in gun homicides compared with several other "civilized countries." But as PolitiFact noted, much depends on which countries are included in this comparison and the years for which that data was available. Chile and Turkey, both with relatively high gun homicide rates, were included in the United Nations study but not in the report in the American Journal of Medicine. Grinshteyn told us her study only included high-income, populous countries as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. "If they included Chile and Turkey, which were not included in our comparison group, those will cause the comparison to be skewed," she added. We reached out to the Sacramento-based Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights advocacy group, to ask whether its members knew of any additional and independent reports on this topic. We did not immediately hear back. Our rating Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said "Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries." Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information. In the end, we rated Newsom’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-14392	California "cut about $1.3 billion in child care (during the recession). We’ve only reinvested about $300 million."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/mar/17/anthony-rendon/claim-california-has-restored-only-fraction-1-bill/	For California’s new Assembly speaker, Anthony Rendon, winning more state budget funding for child care is deeply personal. Before his election to the Legislature, Rendon ran a nonprofit that helped provide child care to thousands of Los Angeles County kids. Now, he wants young children and their families to be part of the ‘California comeback.’ Surging tax revenue has allowed the state to put aside billions of dollars in reserves and regain financial stability in recent years. Rendon, a Democrat from Los Angeles County, has said it’s now time to fully restore the deep funding cuts that weakened California’s early childhood education programs, such as subsidized child care. "I was the executive director of a Head Start and Early Childhood Education organization when this state cut about $1.3 billion in child care (during the recession)," Rendon said during a news conference at the Capitol on March 7th, shortly after being sworn in as the state’s 70th Assembly Speaker. "We’ve only reinvested about $300 million," Rendon continued. "So we’re nowhere close to where we were. We have more kids now than ever before. … We need to invest in our families." It’s not the first time Rendon has used child care to argue for greater state budget investments. In January of this year, he told reporters: "We’ve cut about $1.2 billion out of child care and I think we need to put that money back in. We’ve gotten about a quarter of the way in terms of restoring those funds. But restoring more funds to early childhood education is something that’s very important to me." Taking a more conservative approach, Gov. Jerry Brown has declined to restore social service funding as rapidly as many Democrats in the Legislature would like. But in recent budgets, the four-term Democratic governor has agreed to pour hundreds of millions of dollars back into programs slashed during the recession. That made us wonder, was Rendon right when he said the state has reinvested just $300 million in child care? Or has California done more? We decided to check the facts. Assembly Member Eduardo Garcia, left, congratulates Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon on his inauguration March 7, 2016. Andrew Nixon / Capital Public Radio Our research First, it’s important to define what’s meant by ‘child care.’ For lawmakers and budget analysts at the Capitol, and for early education advocates across the state, ‘child care’ is a huge umbrella term. It includes subsidized child care programs for infants and toddlers of low-income working parents and preschool for older children. There’s no debate that California slashed more than $1 billion in funds for these programs during the recession. Those cuts eliminated child care and preschool for tens of thousands of working families. Cuts to child care alone totaled nearly $1.1 billion between the fiscal years of 2007-08 to 2011-12, according to budget estimates from the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That’s not quite the $1.3 billion that Rendon stated this month, but it’s close. Historical Child Care And Development Funding Create your own infographics When looking at reinvestments in the child care system as a whole, the state has put back more than $578 million, according to the Department of Finance, which is part of the Brown Administration. Taking a more narrow look at what can be defined as child care, Brown’s finance team said the state has still pumped more than $450 million back. Both figures are far more than Rendon’s $300 million reinvestment total. We asked Rendon to explain his number. His spokesman said Rendon was speaking strictly about child care services, not preschool. Of the $1.1 billion in child care cuts, under this strict view, the state has reinvested a figure matching Rendon’s total -- $303 million -- over the past two fiscal years in childcare programs, according to budget estimates from the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That figure, however, excludes $151 million reinvested under a preschool category that Brown’s finance team described as "wraparound child care," which gives preschool students a full day of care. An independent expert we spoke with said it was strange that Rendon would ignore the preschool component, but agreed it was possible he was using the much stricter definition of child care funding. One advocate for early childhood education suggested Rendon may have been highlighting the fact that while California has made "huge strides" in investing in preschool, it’s not done the same for child care. "It’s a tale of two different parts of the system when you think about what’s been put back in," said Erin Gabel, deputy director of First 5 California, a state commission that advocates for health and education programs for children up to the age of 5. With the push to provide preschool for all of California’s eligible four year olds, state preschool funding has more than tripled from the recession to the current fiscal year, according to budget figures. Gabel said child care programs for children under age 2, meanwhile, have seen "almost no restoration" from cuts during the recession. While there are questions about the numbers Rendon used, experts we contacted agreed that Rendon is correct that California "is nowhere close" to restoring all the child care funds cut during the recession. Our ruling California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said recently that the state cut $1.3 billion in child care programs during the recession and has reinvested only $300 million since. His spokesman told us Rendon was speaking strictly about child care programs, not preschool funding. Experts agree that more than $1 billion was cut to the child care system. An analysis of budget data shows the total cut from just child care programs was closer to $1.1 billion, a bit less than Rendon’s total. A very strict look at how much has been reinvested shows California put back $303 million of that $1.1 billion just to child care programs. The state Department of Finance, however, says the total is more than $450 million because some preschool funding actually pays for child care. We believe this is an important point for those who crunch budget numbers at the Capitol. But we don’t feel it’s enough to say Rendon was intending to deceive the general public. We rate his statement Mostly True because it’s accurate but needs clarification and additional information.	None	Anthony Rendon	None	None	None	2016-03-17T00:00:00	2016-03-07	['California']

pomt-11675	Says Hillary Clinton once said "the average Democrat voter is just plain stupid, they’re easy to manipulate."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/05/david-clarke-jr/despite-david-clarkes-tweet-no-evidence-hillary-cl/	Getting himself briefly banned from Twitter made us wonder whether David A. Clarke Jr., the provocative Donald Trump supporter and former Milwaukee County sheriff, had tweeted anything lately that we should fact check. He had. On Dec. 30, 2017, Clarke tweeted this: LYING Lib media spreads FAKE NEWS about me and @realDonaldTrump to fool their liberal followers into believing LIES because as Mrs. Bill Clinton once said, "Look, the average DEMOCRAT VOTER is just plain STUPID. They’re easy to manipulate." Classic! Clarke included with his tweet an image that pictures Clinton, the alleged quote and a reference to a book originally published in 2004 by Dick Morris. Morris was an adviser to President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton’s husband, and later became an ardent Hillary Clinton basher. So, Clarke claims that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president in 2016, once said "the average Democrat voter is just plain stupid, they’re easy to manipulate." Do you remember any news headlines about that? Catching up with Clarke Despite being a staunch conservative, Clarke ran as a Democrat for sheriff in heavily Democratic Milwaukee County. He held the post from 2002, eventually becoming a favorite of conservatives across the country as he spoke out on national issues, until resigning in August 2017. Then he took his current job, as a senior adviser with the pro-Trump America First Action Super PAC. Clarke had been a surrogate for Trump during Trump’s 2016 campaign against Clinton. CNN reported on Jan. 2, 2018, that days earlier, Clarke was temporarily blocked from tweeting after Twitter user complaints alerted the company that three of his messages violated Twitter’s terms of service. Clarke was placed in read-only mode until he deleted three tweets that seemed to call for violence against members of the media. In one of the deleted tweets, Clarke said: When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is to go right at them. Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD. Nothing gets a bully like LYING LIB MEDIA"S attention better than to give them a taste of their own blood #neverbackdown. Claim against Clinton The quote Clarke attributes to Clinton was among those featured in a March 2016 PolitiFact National article that was headlined, "7 Hillary Clinton quotes on the Internet that are complete fakes." Which doesn’t get Clarke’s claim off to a good start. The article said Snopes.com had debunked the alleged quote. The Snopes fact check, originally published in December 2015, rated the quote false, saying: This statement was not uttered by Hillary Clinton, nor was it published in the 2005 book Rewriting History by Dick Morris as something she ostensibly said. We found no record of this quote in any major publication or news account. In fact, the first mention of this item came in October 2015, more than a decade after Morris’ book was published, on a Tumblr page dedicated to generating fake Hillary Clinton quotes. In addition, Morris told us by email that the quote attributed to Clinton is "not true." Indeed, had the quote been real, it would have caused a storm of news coverage. Clarke did not respond to our emails and phone call. Our rating Clarke says that Hillary Clinton once said "the average Democrat voter is just plain stupid, they’re easy to manipulate." Not only is there no evidence to confirm the alleged quote, which surfaced on a site dedicated to generating fake Clinton quotes, it had been debunked two years earlier. That makes Clarke’s statement false and ridiculous -- Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	David A.

pomt-00925	"The Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments" including United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/26/american-crossroads/conservative-group-claims-hillary-clintons-foundat/	A group founded by Karl Rove launched one of the first salvos of the 2016 presidential election cycle with a Web video attacking presumed Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. American Crossroads released a video Feb. 23 that features audio of a speech from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat from the party’s progressive wing, warning that "powerful interests have tried to capture Washington and rig the system in their favor." The video shows photos of Clinton meeting with various foreign delegates and leaders. Text on the screen alleges that "the Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments" including "up to $5 million" from the United Arab Emirates and "up to $25 million" from Saudi Arabia. We should note off the bat that Warren's remarks were ripped from two separate speeches aimed at limiting money from corporations and Super PACs in politics, and they were merged together and cut in such a way to eliminate those references. They certainly weren't about Clinton or foundations or foreign governments. Still, we wanted to check whether Bill and Hillary Clinton's foundation has indeed received large sums of money from foreign governments. Former President Bill Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001 as a nonprofit philanthropy for global development. The organization partners with government, non-government organizations and businesses to tackle quality-of-life issues, such as AIDS, poverty and climate change. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors at the request of the White House. According to a memorandum of understanding, the foundation could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If contributions from those countries increased significantly or a new foreign government wanted to make a donation, the State Department would have to first approve (more on that in a bit). We should emphasize there is nothing illegal about the contributions. Candidates for office are prohibited by law from accepting campaign contributions from foreign governments, but foundations have no such restriction. The main issue is that the foundation presented ethical quandaries when Clinton was a candidate for president in 2008 and when she was Secretary of State. But at this time, the foundation was her husband’s project, not hers. That changed when Clinton left the State Department. In 2013, the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton foundation, with Hillary Clinton taking an active role in fundraising. Throughout the years, donors have included celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz, businesses like eBay and Pepsi, and other nonprofits, like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And, yes, some governments. So which countries and foreign governments have donated to her organization? Not just Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it turns out. We pulled the information from the Clinton Foundation website, which tracks donors by contribution range. As it is, we don’t have exact amount for each donation, nor do we know when the contribution was made — except donations made in 2014, which were marked on the site. Here’s what we found. Due to search constraints on the Clinton Foundation’s website and the vast number of small donations, we’re only including contributions larger than $25,000. Foreign government Amount Tenerife Island government $25,000 to $50,000 Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah $25,000 to $50,000 Government of Jamaica $50,000 to $100,000 Kingdom of Bahrain $50,000 to $100,000 Federal Republic of Germany $100,000 to $250,000 Embassy of Algeria $250,000 to $500,000 Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada $250,000 to $500,000 Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office $500,000 to $1,000,000 State of Qatar $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 Government of Brunei Darussalam $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 Sultanate of Oman $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 United Arab Emirates $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 UK Department for International Development $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 Commonwealth of Australia $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 Government of the Netherlands $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 State of Kuwait $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 Australian Agency for International Development $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 Government of Norway $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 Kingdom of Saudi Arabia $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 Of the 25 donors that have contributed more than $5 million to the Clinton Foundation throughout the years, six are foreign governments. Six of the 19 countries listed above made donations to the Clinton Foundation in 2014: Germany, Canada, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Australia and Saudi Arabia. It’s not clear whether those governments had donated previously, and if so, how much of their donation came last year. So the assertion at the center of the ad is accurate: the Clinton Foundation did, in fact, take millions from foreign governments. Additionally, the ad singled out two countries — the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia — that have donated to the foundation since Hillary Clinton officially joined her family’s foundation. Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said most of the money from foreign countries is earmarked for specific projects and grants, like AIDS relief. Minassian said that the ad implied nefarious dealings, and that isn’t the case. "I just have a problem with the premise of the ad," Minassian said. "It’s the same premise when people say we’re the same as a Super PAC. We’re not; we’re philanthropy. This is what NGOs do." Readers can decide for themselves how they feel about the charge. We’re just checking the fact behind the ad. American Crossroads did not respond to a voicemail and emails. We should note that since the ad came out, and while we were reporting this story, the Washington Post reported that the contribution from Algeria, that had never donated previously, came while Clinton was Secretary of State and was not approved by the State Department. Minassian said the donation from Algeria was related to Haiti relief efforts, and that, per the agreement with the White House, "the State Department should have been formally informed." "As the Clinton Foundation did with all donations it received for earthquake relief, the entire amount of Algeria's contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti," Minassian said. "This was a one-time, specific donation to help Haiti and Algeria had not donated to the Clinton Foundation before and has not since." Our ruling An American Crossroads web ad claimed, "the Clintons' foundation took millions from foreign governments" including "up to $5 million" from the United Arab Emirates and "up to $25 million" from Saudi Arabia. As we noted, it doesn’t violate campaign rules for a nonprofit philanthropy to accept donations from foreign governments. Over the years, the Clinton Foundation has taken millions of dollars from foreign governments. This includes between $1 million and $5 million from the United Arab Emirates and between $10 million and $25 million from Saudi Arabia. At least a portion of those donations came in 2014, after Clinton left the State Department and formally joined the family’s foundation that had previously been in her husband’s name alone.

pomt-03073	"There are still tens of thousands of missing service members from previous and current conflicts that our nation is working to find and repatriate."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/29/john-scocos/tens-thousands-us-service-members-missing-wisconsi/	To remember prisoners of war and members of the military missing in action, state Veterans Affairs Secretary John Scocos issued a statement on Sept. 20, 2013 -- national POW-MIA Recognition Day. The statement included this claim: "There are still tens of thousands of missing service members from previous and current conflicts that our nation is working to find and repatriate." A reader asked us: Tens of thousands? The answer hinges on how missing is defined. Previous factcheck It turns out Scocos wasn’t the first to make such a claim. A New Jersey state lawmaker said in 2011 that nearly "88,000 United States service members are still missing and unaccounted for, dating back to World War II." PolitiFact New Jersey rated the statement Mostly True. Our colleagues found that a couple of months earlier, the federal Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office had revised its figure of missing and unaccounted for from 88,000 to 83,601. In checking Scocos’ claim, we found the most recent tally, as of Sept. 11, 2013, shows a slightly lower figure -- 83,343 service members as being unaccounted for. "It’s not something that the average person is aware of," Jessica Pierno, spokeswoman for the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, told us. Here’s a breakdown from the office, which was formed in 1993: World War II Korean War Cold War Vietnam War Iraq and other conflicts Total 73,661 7,906 126 1,644 6 83,343 The tallies make it clear that the federal government’s search-and-recovery efforts -- coordinated by the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office and the federal Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command -- are for remains. "In all of the years we have been doing this, we have never found one to be alive," said Pierno, a native of Virocqua in western Wisconsin. But there is always hope when it comes to those missing from recent conflicts, she said. Here’s how Pierno described the search process: "Imagine a cold-case detective piecing together historical documents," she said. Staff review a missing service person’s files, interview witnesses and use other methods to determine where the person went missing. If a precise location is found, a team travels there and does an excavation not unlike archeologists searching for dinosaur bones. "There have been identifications made from a single tooth" and strands of hair, Pierno said. Even service members missing from World War II can be identified by matching DNA from remains to the DNA of a family member. Indeed, the list of missing continues to get a little bit smaller as more service members are accounted for. For example, a burial was scheduled for Sept. 28, 2013, in Springville, Utah, following the recent recovery of the remains of 2nd Lt. Vernal J. Bird. His bomber crashed in New Guinea in March 1944. The remains of Marine Lance Cpl. Merlin R. Allen of Bayfield, Wis., who was lost June 30, 1967, in a helicopter crash in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Vietnam, were identified in February 2013. A funeral was held several months later. Accounting for the missing has not gone without controversy. On Sept. 19, 2013, several weeks after a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing examined the recovery efforts, Senators Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) called on the Defense Department to address "reports of mismanagement and internal divisions" between the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office and the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command. "While we were encouraged to hear that DMPO and JPAC have finally begun work on the long overdue plan" to delineate responsibilities, the senators said in a statement, "we were concerned to hear that the plan was still in ‘coordination.' We were also troubled to learn that the department's approach to accounting may be doing families more harm than good by failing to provide them with a realistic assessment of the possibility of identifying missing service members." At the hearing, the director of the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office had said that during the past year, he and "others in the personnel accounting community have made significant strides in improving our unity of effort. But this is an issue that clearly needs further work." Our rating Scocos said: "There are still tens of thousands of missing service members from previous and current conflicts that our nation is working to find and repatriate."

pomt-11786	The North Carolina bathroom bill "was really never repealed."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/22/pat-mccrory/former-nc-gov-says-state-hasnt-really-repealed-con/	It might seem like House Bill 2 – the controversial law that regulated transgender bathroom access – has been repealed and tossed into the annals of North Carolina’s political history. A new law, House Bill 142, was passed. The NCAA ended its boycott of the state. The NBA, which last year relocated its All-Star game from Charlotte to New Orleans upon passage of HB2, plans to hold the game in Charlotte in 2019. And protests that occurred in front of the governor’s mansion in Raleigh when former Gov. Pat McCrory was in office have dissipated. All this, McCrory contended in a recent interview with WBT radio in Charlotte, has happened despite the fact that HB2 "was really never repealed," he says. HB2 is a touchy subject for McCrory, who faced immediate backlash from corporations, advocacy groups and sports organizations after signing it into law in spring 2016. Democrat Roy Cooper beat McCrory, a Republican, last November in a tight race where Cooper campaigned on the idea that state leaders should focus less on social issues and more on teacher pay and health care. McCrory told WBT that the media are biased because they haven’t reported that "all of the restrictions that were in place last October are in place this October." "Nothing's changed, but it is one of the best kept secrets in the media and in politics," McCrory said. "Everyone's pretending the problem's solved and we're going to move on," he continued. "It was a fake issue in many ways all along, and this is one issue where it's fake news that a bill was signed and very little changed except for the public perception." This is one subject where McCrory and some of his former adversaries in LGBT advocacy groups basically agree. Ben Graumann, communications director for Equality NC, referred to new law HB 142 as "a continuation of HB2." And Chris Sgro, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign, said HB 142 "while purported to be a 'repeal' of HB2, simply replaces one discriminatory anti-transgender bill with another." So we wondered if McCrory was on to something. What didn’t change HB2 required people in schools and other government buildings to use the bathroom that corresponded with their birth certificate. The law also banned local governments from passing local laws that protect LGBT people from discrimination within their boundaries, and prevented governments from making local rules raising the minimum wage, requiring paid leave policies and more. Republicans had contended that HB2 protected safety and privacy in bathrooms by overriding a Charlotte ordinance that had allowed transgender people to use bathrooms matching their gender identity. On March 30, the legislature approved and Cooper signed HB 142, which removed HB2’s name from the books. The new law received bipartisan support in the legislature but harsh criticism from conservative Christian groups that said it endangered women and equal rights groups that said the bill didn’t go far enough. HB 142 repealed just one of four HB2 sections. The other three sections re-established modified versions of some of the most controversial parts of HB2. As PolitiFact’s promise-tracking Coop-O-Meter points out, HB 142 added back HB2's bans on local anti-discrimination ordinances, but gave them an expiration date: Dec. 1, 2020, after the next gubernatorial election. The new law left regulation of bathrooms, showers and changing facilities to state lawmakers, not the local school systems, universities, community colleges and other state agencies that had been setting their own policies. But, since the state steered clear of creating new regulations, the new bill creates "widespread uncertainty about whether and where transgender people can use restrooms in government buildings," said Chris Brook, legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina. "Asking if House Bill 2 is repealed doesn’t tell the whole story," Brook said. "The more important question is, does North Carolina law continue to discriminate against LGBT people and transgender people in particular? And the answer is yes." What changed The most controversial part of HB2, and the part that drew the most national attention, was the requirement that people in government facilities use the bathroom matching their birth certificate. The cornerstone of HB 142 was the elimination of that requirement. Rather than allow transgender people to use the bathroom matching their gender identity, North Carolina rejoined 48 other states that have no explicit law about bathroom access for transgender people. One state, Washington, has gone the other direction and explicitly allowed allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. In a statement explaining its willingness to resume placing events in North Carolina, the NCAA said: "We have been assured by the state that this new law allows the NCAA to enact its inclusive policies by contract with communities, universities, arenas, hotels, and other service providers that are doing business with us, our students, other participants, and fans. Further, outside of bathroom facilities, the new law allows our campuses to maintain their own policies against discrimination, including protecting LGBTQ rights, and allows cities’ existing nondiscrimination ordinances, including LBGTQ protections, to remain effective." The new law dissolved a ban on cities and counties imposing anti-discrimination ordinances on their contractors. Norma Houston, a lecturer for the UNC School of Government, described the changes in a post on the Coates’ Canons blog. Can a city or county require a contractor to have an anti-discrimination policy relating to the contractor’s suppliers or subcontractors that includes nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, transgender, or gender identity? Pre-HB2: Yes HB2: No Post-HB2: Yes On Oct. 18, Cooper signed an executive order that aims to prohibit discrimination (on the basis of race, gender, National Guard or veteran status, sexual orientation or gender identity) in government agencies and by state contractors. "Governor Cooper said when he signed HB 142 that it represented a first step and he will continue to work to provide non-discrimination protections for all North Carolinians," Cooper’s spokesman, Ford Porter, wrote. Along with Josh Stein, the N.C. attorney general, Cooper also announced a proposed settlement that if approved by a judge would allow transgender people in North Carolina facilities run by the Cooper administration to use public restrooms and other facilities that match their gender identity. "By taking these steps, North Carolina is sending a clear message to the world that we are a welcoming state that is open for business," he said. "Claiming that no progress has been made is completely and objectively false." The proposed settlement, known as a consent decree, was proposed and agreed upon by Cooper and challengers of the lawsuit "because of the significant constitutional harms H.B.142 has caused transgender North Carolinians," the ACLU said in an email. "If entered, the consent decree would alleviate some of the sweeping harms that vulnerable transgender North Carolinians suffered from the H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 saga." It’s unclear whether the judge will approve the settlement. Our ruling McCrory said HB2 "was really never repealed." The bill named HB2 was indeed trashed and the most controversial part of it is gone. Advocates point out that parts of the repeal bill are still restrictive. But it’s incorrect to suggest, as McCrory did, that "nothing’s changed." We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02561	Cuba has "a lower child mortality rate than ours. Their life expectancy is now greater than ours."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/31/tom-harkin/sen-tom-harkin-says-cuba-has-lower-child-mortality/	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, recently spent three days in Cuba -- the longtime socialist adversary of the United States -- to learn more about the island nation’s health care system. For years, some health policy specialists in the United States have been intrigued by Cuba’s health care system. Cuba produces a disproportionate number of doctors, and it has posted relatively strong health statistics in international comparisons, especially considering the country’s shortage of material goods and economic wealth. For some liberals, Cuba’s health care system has offered an alternative to the one in the United States, where millions of Americans have struggled without insurance in recent years. Notably, Michael Moore’s 2007 health care documentary Sicko includes scenes where Americans in need of medical attention travel to Havana and are treated for free at a high-quality hospital. Critics have countered that such free, quality care is available only to the communist elite, not to ordinary Cubans. Harkin certainly saw something promising in Cuba’s health care system. During a press conference upon his return to Washington on Jan. 29, 2014, Harkin -- who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee -- said that Cuba is a "poor country, but they have a lower child mortality rate than ours. Their life expectancy is now greater than ours. It's interesting — their public health system is quite remarkable." We wondered whether these statistics are accurate, and what they say about health care in Cuba. Child mortality statistics On child mortality, we found a few data sources that are generally considered credible. According to the CIA Factbook, Cuba infant mortality rate is indeed lower -- an estimated 4.76 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2013, compared to 5.90 for the United States. And more precisely given the phrase Harkin chose, Cuba also has a better child mortality rate -- that is, the likelihood of death under 5 years of age. According to the World Health Organization, Cuba had 6 deaths under age 5 per 1,000 live births between 2005 and 2010, compared to 8 deaths for the United States. So on child mortality, Harkin had his numbers right. Life expectancy statistics The data for life expectancy appears to be mixed. According to both the CIA Factbook, the estimated life expectancy for both sexes in 2013 was 78.62 in the United States, compared to 78.05 years in Cuba. And according to the World Health Organization, life expectancy in 2011 was 79 years in the United States and 78 in Cuba. By these sources, Harkin would be wrong. But when we contacted Harkin’s office, they pointed us to data from Pan American Health Organization that backed up their claim. For 2012, the group found that life expectancy was 79.2 years in Cuba, compared to 78.8 years in the U.S. So for life-expectancy numbers, the data is varied, with some supporting Harkin and some not. How reliable is this data? We wondered, however, whether the data from Cuba’s authoritarian government could be trusted. As we looked into it, we heard a measure of skepticism. We did find one area of agreement: Cuba puts a lot of emphasis on its health data. Richard H Streiffer, dean of the College of Community Health Sciences at the University of Alabama, said his conclusion from two visits to Cuba is that Cuban health practitioners are "very compulsive about collecting data and reporting it regularly." On a recent trip, Streiffer said, he spent time with a family doctor in a neighborhood clinic. "Family doctors are mandated to collect certain data," he said. "He had right on his wall a ‘dashboard’ of data characterizing his practice -- an age/sex distribution; an age/sex distribution of the top 10 chronic diseases in his practice; a map of where his patients lived in the neighborhood. You don't find that in the US." However, some experts said that this obsession with statistics can be a two-edged sword when it comes to reliability. Some say Cuba is so concerned with its infant mortality and life-expectancy statistics that the government takes heavy-handed actions to protect their international rankings. "Cuba does have a very low infant mortality rate, but pregnant women are treated with very authoritarian tactics to maintain these favorable statistics," said Tassie Katherine Hirschfeld, the chair of the department of anthropology at the University of Oklahoma who spent nine months living in Cuba to study the nation's health system. "They are pressured to undergo abortions that they may not want if prenatal screening detects fetal abnormalities. If pregnant women develop complications, they are placed in ‘Casas de Maternidad’ for monitoring, even if they would prefer to be at home. Individual doctors are pressured by their superiors to reach certain statistical targets. If there is a spike in infant mortality in a certain district, doctors may be fired. There is pressure to falsify statistics." Hirschfeld said she’s "a little skeptical" about the longevity data too, since Cuba has so many risk factors that cause early death in other countries, from unfiltered cigarettes to contaminated water to a meat-heavy diet. In a more benign statistical quirk, Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Pittsburgh, suggests that the flow of refugees could skew longevity statistics, since those births are recorded but the deaths are not. Transparency would help give the data more credibility, but the Cuban government doesn’t offer much, experts said. "I would take all Cuban health statistics with a grain of salt," Hirschfeld said. Organizations like the Pan-American Health Organization "rely on national self-reports for data, and Cuba does not allow independent verification of its health claims." Rodolfo J. Stusser -- a physician and former adviser to the Cuban Ministry of Public Health's Informatics and Tele-Health Division who left for Miami at age 64 -- is another skeptic. While Stusser acknowledges that Cuba has improved some of its health numbers since the revolution, the post-revolution data has been "overestimated," he said. "The showcasing of infant mortality and life expectancy at birth has been done for ideological reasons," he said. Our ruling Harkin said that Cuba has "a lower child mortality rate than ours. Their life expectancy is now greater than ours." According to the official statistics, Cuba does beat out the United States for both infant and child mortality, and on life expectancy, the data is mixed, with a slight edge to the United States. However, the combination of the Cuban government’s heavy-handed enforcement of statistical targets and the lack of transparency has led some experts to suggest taking the numbers with a grain of salt. On balance, we rate Harkin’s claim Half True.	None	Tom Harkin	None	None	None	2014-01-31T15:29:24	2014-01-29	['Cuba']
pomt-03158	"Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/sep/08/new-jersey-education-association/njea-ad-claims-politicians-cut-1-billion-education/	Some cuts just never heal, apparently. And that is especially true for school aid funding cuts, based on claims made in a video ad released last week by the New Jersey Education Association. The ad features Trenton elementary teacher Talithea Briggs, who talks about the impact of state aid cuts during Gov. Chris Christie’s first year in office, as somber music plays in the background. "Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education," Briggs says, adding that those cuts resulted in larger class sizes, less money for books and materials, and fewer computers for students. For this claim we’re looking only at how much was cut in state aid – and in this case, the NJEA’s claim is correct. Let’s begin by looking back at some of the fiscal matters challenging Christie shortly after he took office in January 2010. Faced with major revenue loss to the state as a result of the recession, Christie began making cuts in several areas of the budget. Education took among the biggest hits. The governor withheld $475 million in state aid that January and then cut another $820 million from the fiscal year 2011 budget. The FY11 plan covered the school year starting in September 2010. The National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as lasting from December 2007 through June 2009. Combined, the education cuts totaled just under $1.3 billion. NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer noted that the $475 million would have paid for things such as new classrooms, vehicles, special education placements and more. The result, he said, was larger class sizes, a loss of education personnel and programs being cut. And the impact of those cuts are still being felt, he said. "Districts are going to get squeezed more and more," Wollmer said. "That’s the bottom line." But Christie had to put more education money in the budget after the state Supreme Court in 2011 ordered him to increase aid to poor school districts by about $500 million the next fiscal year. The order resulted from a lawsuit that claimed the education cuts violated the 2008 School Funding Reform Act, which was a funding formula to support the state’s poorest districts. Christie maintained that the cuts were necessary to balance the budget, as required by state law. But New Jersey’s education funding drama didn’t end with the increased aid for poorer districts. The NJEA’s ad also notes that many of New Jersey’s school districts received a $1 increase in state aid under the current Fiscal Year 2014 budget. Still other districts had aid totals that stayed the same from the year prior. It's worth noting that as the economy has improved, Christie and the Legislature have put more money in the budget for education. Our ruling A recent video ad by the NJEA claims, "Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education." Christie made two rounds of cuts between the time he took office in January 2010 and in the FY 2011 budget, which was ultimately approved by the state Legislature. The combined cuts totaled just under $1.3 billion. Although some aid has since been restored, the NJEA claim is correct about the amount of the cuts. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14345	(Since 1990) "every continent has seen substantial gains, with individual incomes growing by more than a third in every region of the developing world."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/mar/24/gayle-smith/usaid-head-highlights-worldwide-income-gains/	While many global challenges are ahead, USAID administrator Gayle Smith struck an upbeat tone in her first major policy speech on Capitol Hill. Smith underscored how much progress has been made on many fronts, from education to economic well being. On the last, she said that since 1990, "every continent has seen substantial gains, with individual incomes growing by more than a third in every region of the developing world." We decided to look into that particular sign of progress. The USAID press office told us the numbers came from the World Bank. The measure the agency used was Gross Domestic Product per person. The World Bank makes the numbers for each region comparable by correcting for the purchasing power of consumers in each country, and putting everything in constant 2011 dollars. "Between 2014 (the last year for which data are available) and 1990, per capita income, in real terms and adjusting for purchasing power, has increased by more than one-third in every region, ranging from 34 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa to 192 percent in East Asia and the Pacific," press staff told us. Smith’s numbers hold up. The development agency gave regional figures that included both developing and higher-income nations. The World Bank offers a version that looks strictly at developing countries. World Bank staff said in some regions, the change is more dramatic than the numbers cited by USAID, and in some, it is less so. This table, using World Bank data, compares the change for regions solely in developing countries to the USAID approach that combines both developing and higher-income countries. Percent change: GDP per capita, PPP, 2011 dollars Region Developing only Combined East Asia & Pacific 418% 192% Europe & Central Asia 49% 37% Latin America & Caribbean 46% 50% Middle East & North Africa 47% 56% Sub-Saharan Africa 33% 34% The difference is most significant for the East Asia and Pacific region, which includes China, where GDP per capita rose four-fold in the period. The differences in some other regions might be less pronounced, but they don’t change the overall thrust of Smith’s summary. Technically, the rise in Sub-Saharan Africa was 33 percent, while Smith said more than one-third. And for the record, we don’t have exactly the same kind of data for the South Asia region, which includes India. The World Bank doesn’t distinguish between developing and higher-income countries there. Overall, the gain in that region was 172 percent. Measuring per capita GDP growth is not the only yardstick to gauge economic well being. The World Bank also looks at per capita Gross National Income. We ran those numbers and the trends remain the same. We also checked how the trend lines have changed over the decades. While the largest gains took place between about 1995 and 2008, followed by some backsliding during the Great Recession, most regions have recovered since then. Still, the pace of growth is considerably slower than in the past. A caveat It is important to note that a growing economy at the national level doesn’t tell us how well those gains are spread across all members of society. While the World Bank does calculate the gap between the rich and the poor for most countries, it doesn’t aggregate the data at the regional level. We have explored the distribution of wealth in another fact-check. It’s possible to take Smith’s words to mean that incomes rose for every individual by at least a third. In that sense, the available data don’t support her statement, but GDP per capita is a common measure of economic well-being, and many analysts argue that growth is a necessary, if insufficient, quantity to lift fortunes at the lower end of the income ladder. Our ruling Smith said that since 1990, individual incomes have grown by more than a third in every region of the developing world. Using the yardstick of GDP per capita, the World Bank data back that up. It is a hair off to say "more than a third" when the change in Sub-Saharan Africa is a bit less than a third, but the numerical difference is small. It is also important to remember that the benefits of a rising economy are rarely spread equally throughout the population. Typically, the wealthy gain more than the rest. So Smith’s statement isn’t as accurate on an individual to individual basis. With that caveat in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08779	Says Bill White is refusing to debate.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/aug/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-bill-white-refuses-debate/	For months, Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, has been rebuking incumbent Gov. Rick Perry for refusing to debate him. So we were surprised to learn that Perry recently turned the tables. "Today is day 164 of liberal trial lawyer Bill White refusing to debate," according to an Aug. 18 press release from the Perry campaign. "He also continues to refuse to release his taxes from his years in public service." The White campaign fired back on its Twitter account devoted to lambasting the governor: "Perry claimed today that it's Bill White who refuses to debate. What's next, Perry says editorial boards refuse to meet with him?" On Aug. 12, the Austin American-Statesman reported that Perry won't meet with newspaper editorial boards, where political candidates answer questions from editorial writers and editors in an effort to win the newspaper's endorsement. White is meeting with editorial boards, including those at smaller papers like the Killeen Daily Herald. Is Perry's plaint that White is debate-averse justified? Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, told us that White "has accepted five televised debates," pointing to a July 21 press release calling on the governor to join him in those debates. Perry has said he wouldn't debate White until the Democrat makes public his tax returns for the six years he served as Houston's mayor, the two years he was deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration and from when he led the Texas Democratic Party. As of Aug. 18, 164 was the number of days the Perry campaign says have passed since it called for their release. "Once he releases his income taxes and tells the public how he made his money in public service and as a business person, we'll be more than happy to discuss debates," Perry spokesman Mark Miner said, according to an April 26 story on WFAA.com. Perry has made public his own returns going back to 1991, when he first became a statewide officeholder. White has since released his returns dating back to 2004, when he took office as Houston's mayor. Perry's campaign said it still wasn't enough. "Questions remain concerning income Bill White received while Deputy Secretary of Energy under President Clinton and as chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, and how he has profited from those positions," said Miner. White served in Washington from 1993 to 1995, and he led the party from 1995 to 1998. If one candidate does not comply with the ground rules set by his opponent, does that mean he is declining to debate? Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, said it does: "Bill White's refusal to release his tax returns is his refusal to debate. The issue is one and the same." Still, we couldn't find any instances of White flat-out refusing to debate Perry. If every debate sponsor statewide required the candidates to release their tax returns and White refused, Perry's logic would be more reasonable. But this is a precondition that only Perry has set, and, as we recently reported, a term to debate he hasn't made in the past. Plus, it hasn't stopped White from debating: on July 5, White joined Kathie Glass, the Libertarian candidate for governor, at the League of Women Voters forum in Kerrville — the first governor's debate after the primary. Perry was absent. Perry can rightly say that White hasn't made public all the tax returns Perry has sought, and he can score political points doing so. But he can't truthfully claim White has refused to debate him, because he hasn't — and by all accounts, will not. Somebody get a match. We rate Perry's statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-12243	Says it’s documented that City of Austin fees for building an apartment complex are nearly 10 times what Dallas levies.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/jul/13/paul-workman/paul-workman-mostly-right-apartment-development-fe/	An Austin Republican applauding Gov. Greg Abbott for trying to rein in regulations imposed by cities, including Austin, says municipal development fees for building an apartment complex in the capital run nearly 10 times ahead of what’s charged in Dallas. Readers asked us to check that. State Rep. Paul Workman said in his June 2017 commentary in the Austin American-Statesman: "I have received a document from an apartment builder that demonstrates the difference in total development fees for building a project in Dallas versus building the same project in Austin. Total fees in Dallas: $120,081. Total fees in Austin: $1,026,852 – nearly 10-times higher for the same project! There is no way to argue that these fees are not contributing to the affordability crisis in Austin." We zeroed in on the declared figures after Brian Mitchell in Workman’s state office emailed us an undated document showing fees attributed to the cities of Dallas and Austin, respectively, in each case to authorize construction of a four-story, 243,000-square-foot, 322-unit apartment project. Workman didn’t say who created or provided the document. But John Burnham, managing director of Argyle Residential, which develops multi-family projects in major cities including Austin and Denver, told us he created the document in June 2016 or so. Burnham said by phone the Austin figures on the document relate to a 322-unit project, anticipated at Gonzales and Tillery streets in East Austin, and the Dallas figures were based on adjusting up city fees associated with plans to build a 260-unit project on the east side of Dallas. Burnham said by email: "The purpose of my spreadsheet was to illustrate the difference in permitting costs associated with a 322-unit wrap-style apartment project in Austin vs that same project in Dallas. I was not attempting to display a summary of actual fees paid on a specific project. The fees that I outlined are accurate fees based on adopted ordinances and city codes. We have paid roughly these amounts on several projects in Austin and Dallas recently." Variation in figures Burnham didn’t provide more data. For our part, we asked Austin city officials to review the 23 fees listed in Burnham’s document for the described project in that city and we asked Dallas officials to check the nine fees listed for such a Dallas project. According to the respective officials, the presented dollar-for-dollar comparison missed some fees while overstating and understating a few. Still, it came out that there were far higher total fees likely in Austin than in Dallas. Dallas fees By email, a Dallas city spokesman, Richard Hill, provided a document showing what he described as the best estimate by city officials there of the fees likely associated with a 322-unit complex in that city in 2017. That Dallas document suggests total costs of $124,792.02, some $4,711 or 4 percent greater than the total fee costs estimated by Burnham about a year before. A big added cost, according to the city, would come from at least $23,000 for a base permit for the complex’s garage, compared with $16,645 in Burnham’s document. The Dallas document also specifies $1,500 in fees for up to three engineering reviews of paving/grading/drainage as well as $2,690.66 for a fire sprinkler review for the garage; the document cited by Workman did not specify those fees. The Dallas document also suggests some lower costs than estimated by Burnham such as $8,250 related to the city’s express review of the development plan compared with $12,000 estimated by Burnham. Similarly, the Dallas document indicates $2,714 in fees for two four-inch water meters and a wastewater connection compared with $7,380 in the document Workman touted, and $735 for irrigation meter permits compared with $2,650 in the other document. Austin fees By email and phone, a City of Austin spokeswoman, Sylvia Arzola, confirmed most of the city fees listed in the Workman-cited document in connection with the envisioned project, but she said the garage fees would be about $6,000 lower if that facility didn’t have plumbing and wasn’t heated or air-conditioned. Arzola noted that a major cost shown for Austin and not Dallas--a parkland dedication fee--increased as of October 2016 so the up-to-date charge on the described project would be $346,230, nearly $43,000 greater than the fee shown on what Workman cited. Arzola noted too that developers may donate land in lieu of paying the fee. Arzola wrote that the Workman-cited document appears to have missed a fee--the city’s Commercial Building Plan Review fee calculated based on a builder’s valuation of labor and materials. Working from the city’s web post of commercial review and permit fees, it looked to us like the fee on the project would start at $655.20 plus $1.30 for every $1,000 in labor-materials. Arzola further confirmed Austin doesn’t offer an expedited review like the one described for Dallas, but she said one is in the works; its target rollout date is October 2017. Water-wastewater fees We spotted another wide contrast. Both cities, the Workman-cited document says, charge a fee for domestic water and wastewater meters, but Austin’s fee, $380,000, greatly outpaces the Dallas fee, $7,380. A note on the document says the Austin figure assumes the development site requires a replat. If that’s not so, the note says, the Austin water/wastewater fee drops to $55,000. By phone, Joseph Gonzales, a finance administrator for the Austin Water Utility, said the document's Austin figures for water and wastewater meter and irrigation meter fees appeared accurate. Asked to speak to Austin charging considerably more than Dallas for such fees, Gonzales said: "We’re trying to balance the impact of development between the development community and our ratepayers." Dallas-Austin contrasts Next, we inquired generally into why the cities have dramatically distinct fee schedules in connection with building apartment complexes. By phone, Carl Wren, assistant director of Austin’s Development Services Department, told us some Austin fees reflect the greater complexity of the city’s municipal code. He said Dallas, for instance, doesn’t have the Save Our Springs limits put in place in the 1990s to protect waters flowing into Barton Springs. Austin developers told us the city’s development fees amount to one of various factors affecting affordable housing. Terry Mitchell, a veteran local developer, said by email: "On one affordable project of which I am aware, $3,000 per unit is being spent on tree replacement (even after preserving all heritage trees)." David Stauch, president of Capital Project Management, an Austin construction company, said he's helped build projects in both cities. Stauch said Austin’s plan review fees run considerably higher "likely owing to the greater number of departmental reviews required, and the greater level of scrutiny by each," perhaps a tradeoff for "quality of the built environment, but folks in Dallas like it just fine," he said. Stauch further said the "increased fees might also be due to Austin’s low density. The more spread out a city is, the more infrastructure needed to serve the residents." A 2015 U.S. Census Bureau report based on 2013 population estimates pegs the density of Dallas at 3,684 residents per square mile, 29 percent greater than Austin’s density of 2,855 residents per square mile. Brian Rodgers, an Austin civic activist and real estate investor, said it makes good sense for developers to pay for the impact of their development on public infrastructure. Rodgers further noted by email that it’s been state law since 1989 that cities may recoup water, wastewater, roads and drainage costs related to extending city services. "Austin doesn’t charge" developer fees "for roads or drainage," Rodgers added. Our ruling Workman said it’s documented that City of Austin fees for building an apartment complex are nearly 10 times Dallas’s fees. We found accurate multiple itemized entries in the 2016 document cited by Workman though there also were missing fees and some figures that weren't right. On balance, it looks like city fees for building the project in Austin could exceed Big D’s fees by eight times or more, still making for a considerable difference. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-09137	"Gov. Crist's veto also clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida."	false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/14/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-claims-gov-crists-veto-abortion-bill-c/	The highly-charged debate over a Florida abortion bill has turned to one of the most controversial aspects of the recently enacted federal health care law. While legislators for weeks focused on the issue of ultrasounds for women seeking an abortion, the law also would have prohibited women who get government subsidies for health insurance from purchasing insurance policies that cover abortions. When Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed the bill, former Florida House Speaker and Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio promptly released a statement that "Gov. Crist’s veto also clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida." The statement, however, is based on a misleading assumption about the national health care law. First, a few words about the federal law. It will create state-run health insurance exchanges in which private companies will compete for the business of people who do not get insurance through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get group rates enjoyed by those in big employer plans. People who cannot afford insurance will get government subsidies to offset the cost of purchasing a plan in the exchange. How to deal with abortion in the health care exchanges predictably became a thorny political issue that threatened the law's very passage, and several alternatives were considered. The final language signed into law, crafted by abortion opponent Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., will allow insurance companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson's provision specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account. The national health care law also gives states an opt-out. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose. That's what Florida's HB 1143 attempted to do. Section 101 of the bill states, "A health insurance policy or group health insurance policy purchased in whole or in part with state or federal funds through an exchange created pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may not provide coverage for an (elective) abortion ... A policy is deemed to be purchased with state or federal funds if it is a policy toward which any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied." Again, Crist vetoed that bill. But the rhetoric on this issue can be tricky. For example, Florida House Republicans were right when they said in a press release after Crist's veto that "Recent federal health care legislation gave states the opportunity to opt-out of federal provisions using tax dollars ... to subsidize insurance plans that fund elective abortions." Yes, the federal law would allow tax dollars to subsidize someone's policy even if the individual chose a plan that covers abortion. And so it would certainly be fair to say that many women who cannot currently afford health insurance will be given tax subsidies and many of them may choose plans that offer abortion services. But the House Republicans' release was wrong when it said the law would "force Florida taxpayers to pay for elective abortions." Any abortions would be paid through a separate account funded entirely through a portion of premiums paid by people who select a plan that covers abortion services, not from tax dollars. That's an important difference. Everyone who buys into a plan that covers abortion would have to pay into that abortion fund, even men. And for those with moral objections to paying a portion of their premiums for abortion services, the federal law requires that every region offer at least one alternative health plan that does not cover abortion. Before signing off on the abortion language in the national health care bill, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich, persuaded President Barack Obama to issue an executive order providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. And Stupak, who up until that point had been the champion of the abortion foes' position, declared, "There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation." We agree. That was the case before Crist vetoed the Florida bill. And it's true after. Abortion foes argue the federal rules are little more than an accounting trick, that if federal subsidies go to someone who chooses a plan that covers abortion, it's the same as taxpayer-funded abortion. But we think it's misleading to call it taxpayer-funded abortion when the law requires abortions be paid solely through a portion of the premiums (not tax dollars) paid by people who choose a plan that covers abortions. We rule Rubio's statement False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-06-14T19:51:33	2010-06-11	['None']

pomt-14722	"The Democrats in the Senate last year introduced a constitutional amendment to repeal the free speech protections of the First Amendment."	mostly false	/iowa/statements/2015/dec/22/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-overstates-effect-proposed-constitutional/	During a speech to a conservative crowd in Iowa this month, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz leveled a heavy charge against his colleagues across the aisle in the U.S. Senate. Democrats, he said, attempted to eliminate Americans’ right to free speech with a proposed constitutional amendment last fall. "The Democrats in the Senate last year introduced a constitutional amendment to repeal the free speech protections of the First Amendment," Cruz told the audience at the Rising Tide Summit in Cedar Rapids. Striking one of America’s most cherished and fundamental rights would certainly represent a controversial and historic change to the U.S. Constitution. But is that what Senate Democrats actually attempted to do? Cruz was referring to Senate Joint Resolution 19, a proposed amendment regarding campaign finance that Democrats pursued in the months leading up to the 2014 midterm elections. The measure failed to clear a procedural hurdle in September 2014 and faced a long road to ratification even if it had advanced. As a constitutional amendment, it would’ve had to pass with two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate and then win approval from three-fourths of state legislatures across the country. The amendment The text of the proposed amendment itself is pretty short and relatively straightforward. Here it is: SECTION 1.To advance democratic self-government and political equality, and to protect the integrity of government and the electoral process, Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections. SECTION 2.Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections. SECTION 3. Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the press. Supporters say the measure is meant to overturn Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, a pair of Supreme Court decisions that have sharply weakened existing federal campaign finance laws. It would do this by explicitly allowing Congress and the states to regulate and limit campaign fundraising and spending and to distinguish between "natural persons" and legal entities like corporations when regulating campaign spending. The text of the amendment makes no reference to freedom of speech or the First Amendment. So how does it represent an attack on free speech? The Cruz campaign referred us to a July 2014 op-ed Cruz wrote in the Washington Times. In it, the senator argues that political speech published or distributed by a corporation -- like an editorial from the New York Times or a skit on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" -- could be limited or banned by an act of Congress if the amendment were ratified. In a previous fact check, we found a similar Cruz statement about jailing Lorne Michaels to be half-true. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, offered a similar critique as the measure was being debated last September. "The proposed amendment would restrict the most important speech the First Amendment protects, core political speech," Politico quoted Grassley saying in a Sept. 11, 2014, story. "It’s hard to imagine what would be more radical than the Congress passing a constitutional amendment to overturn a dozen Supreme Court decisions that have protected individual rights. Free speech would be dramatically curtailed." But what do the experts say? We checked in with a range of constitutional law scholars — including Cruz’s old con-law prof at Harvard — who offered a range of views and interpretations. But while there is some scholarly disagreement on whether the proposed amendment threatens free speech, none of those surveyed shared Cruz’s assertion that it would amount to outright repeal of free speech rights. Several said Cruz has a point, but that he oversells it when he uses the term "repeal" with no caveats or qualifiers. "There is no question it would be a partial repeal of the First Amendment as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court since at least 1976," said Stanford Constitutional Law Center Director Michael W. McConnell. "Of course, some justices and academics disagree with many of the holdings of the court with respect to campaign finance, but this proposal would cut more deeply into First Amendment protections even than those dissenting justices have voted to permit." University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Kermit Roosevelt also described the proposed amendment as a "partial repeal" of constitutional speech protections. "What Cruz says is mostly accurate, with a couple of caveats," Roosevelt said. "Cruz could have been more clear if he’d specified that the proposed repeal was aimed at undoing the Supreme Court’s decisions thwarting campaign finance reform, not at speech more generally. And I think he failed to do so deliberately, because those decisions are not very popular, while free speech in general is." In his Washington Times op-ed, Cruz noted criticism of the proposed amendment from famed constitutional lawyer and First Amendment litigator Floyd Abrams. In remarks during a Senate hearing on the measure, Abrams argued that it "would limit speech that is at the heart of the First Amendment" and do so "in a sweepingly broad manner." Several prominent scholars, meanwhile, say Cruz is flat-out wrong. "I have read the amendment carefully. It’s about raising and spending money in political campaigns — nothing more," Harvard Law School constitutional law Professor Laurence H. Tribe told us in an email. "It has no effect at all on freedom of the press, freedom of assembly or peaceful protest. It does not allow the government to punish people for speaking their minds." Tribe also noted that he had Cruz, a Harvard Law graduate, in class. "Ted Cruz earned an A in my constitutional law course at Harvard, and I am a tough grader!" Tribe said. "I’m confident Ted knows his statement is false. No lawyer or student who can read English believes what Ted Cruz claimed to believe." The main sticking point for scholars is whether spending money is a constitutionally protected expression of free speech. That notion undergirds the recent Supreme Court decisions throwing out campaign finance regulations, experts said, but is far from a consensus view in legal circles or even on the court itself. "Citizens United recently overturned many decades of First Amendment jurisprudence that allowed law to distinguish corporate from individual speech when it comes to campaign finance regulations," Yale Law School Dean Robert C. Post told us in an email. "For the most part, the Court has only recently imposed strict constitutional limits on campaign finance regulations. Ted Cruz is referring in his comment to very recent and controversial interpretations of the First Amendment." Richard L. Hasen, a law professor and expert on elections law at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law, offered a similar assessment. "This is a controversial theory of the First Amendment, and some dissenting justices do not agree that these limits on elections violate the free speech or other First Amendment protections," Hasen said. "If the amendment passed," he added, "it does not seem likely it would have a direct effect on the Supreme Court's free speech decisions in areas other than those related to campaign financing." Andrew Koppelman, a professor of law and political science at Northwestern University, called Cruz’s statement "misleading." "The Court was deeply split in Citizens United," Koppelman said. "The bill proposes to amend the Constitution so that the four dissenters prevail. If, as the dissenters thought, Citizens United misinterprets the First Amendment, then the proposal restores the Amendment rather than repealing it. Cruz seems to think that Citizens United is an obviously correct interpretation of the Amendment, but if that were true, why was the Court divided 5-4?" Pepperdine School of Law constitutional law professor Douglas W. Kmiec dismissed Cruz’s assertion even more succinctly. "There is nothing in our history to suggest that the founders equated speech and money," Kmiec said. "That being so, there is no constitutional violation of freedom of speech to propose the amendment." Our Ruling Cruz told his audience that Senate Democrats proposed a constitutional amendment that would "repeal" constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights. The proposal actually allows state and federal legislators to regulate fundraising and spending in elections. Campaign finance has been linked to free speech in recent jurisprudence, but a wide range of constitutional law scholars say the amendment would have a limited or nonexistent effect on speech rights. Several scholars said Cruz has a point, but he oversells it by using "repeal" with no caveats or qualifiers. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04807	Says Bill Nelson "voted to raise our taxes 150 times."	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/connie-mack/connie-mack-bill-nelson-voted-taxes-150-times/	In the contest between Bill Nelson and Connie Mack for U.S. Senate, Nelson brought up Mack’s past work promoting Hooters and his altercations at bars about two decades ago. Mack’s response? Nelson voted to raise your taxes 150 times. Mack, a Republican congressman from Fort Myers, made the assertion in a video rebuttal to Nelson’s ad. Here’s the script: "Sad, 40 years in politics and this is what Bill Nelson wants to talk about. Even if it were all true, and it's not, who cares. After all, Bill Nelson and I are candidates for the United States Senate and there are real differences between us. Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare and voted to raise our taxes 150 times - I voted against Obamacare and to cut taxes. I want to talk about what really matters - fixing our economy, creating jobs and tackling our deficit. Bill Nelson, like a typical career politician, wants to talk about Hooters and what I did as a kid. Let’s get serious: Our country is in crisis. It’s time to debate the issues that matter, not this nonsense". There are a lot of interesting claims in Mack’s statement. But that big number caught our eye: Has Nelson voted to raise our taxes 150 times? We already fact-checked whether or not Mack worked as a promoter for Hooters and had a history of fighting at bars, a claim we rated Mostly True. And we’ve also picked apart a claim by a group that claimed Nelson, a Democrat, cast the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act and ruled that Mostly False. Here, we get serious and focus on taxes. Mack’s campaign sent us a list of what they characterized as at least 157 votes in favor of higher taxes during Nelson’s Senate career, which started in 2001. We sent the list to Nelson’s Senate office and asked if they disagreed with the characterization of any votes, and we did our own research. Double-counting votes and other tallying tricks About half of the votes on the list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law. Mack’s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan. Mack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments. For example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson’s votes on H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. That counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- but not 15 examples. Which brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as "voting to raise our taxes?" Mack’s list counts several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson’s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010. We sent Mack’s list to a few federal budget experts including Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think tank; Joe Rosenberg, research associate at the Tax Policy Center, an independent policy analysis group that includes tax analysts who have worked in both Democratic and Republican administrations; and Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. We asked the experts to look over the list and give us their general thoughts. All three generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut doesn’t equal a tax increase. Gordon called Mack’s list "ludicrous." "Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase," he said. "So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue." Nelson supported some tax cuts Mack’s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Here, we will focus on the Bush tax cuts. Nelson opposed a $1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 because he said it didn’t do enough to reduce debt or help low- and middle-income taxpayers. He also said that as a congressman he had voted for President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts and that led to huge deficits. "I don't want to see Congress make that mistake again," Nelson said in 2001. In 2003 on the second round of Bush tax cuts, Nelson voted against the $350 billion package on the conference report. But in 2006 and in 2010 Nelson, supported extending the tax cuts. This year, he went along with Obama’s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million. "His favored position, and one he still holds, is to let the Bush cuts expire on those making more than $1 million," said his Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin. Nelson called for other tax cuts at times. During his first Senate term he bucked his party in favor of repealing the estate tax and in 2007 he sponsored an amendment to reduce the tax on large cigars. Some of Nelson’s votes cited by Mack would only affect certain businesses -- for example he voted in favor of repealing exemptions for oil and gas companies in 2010. He took many votes in favor of eliminating corporate tax breaks to pay for projects such as port security. Mack’s spokesman told us that the largest tax increase Nelson voted for was "Obamacare." The health care law did raise taxes on the wealthy and health insurance companies. (Read about those provisions in a fact-check we did on a claim by Rush Limbaugh.) Our ruling Mack said Nelson "voted to raise our taxes 150 times." Mack jacks up the number by counting non-binding resolutions, which account for about half of those votes. He also counts duplicative votes on the same bill. And, he counts a vote against a tax cut as a vote for a tax increase, even though it’s not the same thing. Finally, Mack’s statement fails to acknowledge that there have been times that Nelson voted in favor of tax cuts or extending tax cuts. He recently supported extending tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000. The overall message here is misleading. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00969	"By spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core Tests."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/15/sheila-resseger/educator-says-60000-new-york-parents-refused-let-t/	Around the country, there’s a growing debate over Common Core, a set of national education standards adopted by more than 40 states, including Rhode Island. Among the complaints critics raise is that Common Core places too much emphasis on standardized testing. In many states, there are grassroots movements encouraging parents to refuse to allow their children to take the tests. Retired teacher Sheila Resseger raised that issue in a Jan. 10, 2015 Providence Journal commentary critical of standardized testing. In her piece, "Students can opt out of new tests in R.I," Resseger said that "by spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core tests." Resseger also said there would be no penalty for Rhode Island students who opt out of taking the state’s first set of Common Core-related tests, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), which are to be given this spring. Because the debate over Common Core has been so intense, in Rhode Island and elsewhere, we were curious if Resseger was right about the number of testing opt-outs in New York. The 60,000 number has been widely reported in newspaper and TV stories, almost always without attribution. It turned out to be a surprisingly difficult number to pin down. We started with Resseger, who referred us to a flier that included the 60,000 figure put out by NYS Allies for Public Education, a New York state group that opposes Common Core testing. Sure enough the flier read "In 2014, Parents of 60,000 Students Refused NYS Common Core Tests." She also referred us to Loy Gross, of Pavilion, N.Y., one of the parents involved in the anti-Common Core group. Gross, the mother of two daughters, participated in an effort last year to count the number of students boycotting the tests statewide. Gross, who now homeschools her children, told us that volunteers obtained figures from about half the state’s 698 districts on the number of students opting out of each of the two tests -- one in math and the other in English. We asked for the spreadsheet she used and samples of numbers from collectors. Gross never got back to us despite repeated phone calls and emails. We also contacted the New York State Education Department. A spreadsheet on the department’s website showed that 1.136 million New York State students in grades three through eight took the English language arts assessments and 1.08 million students took the math assessments in 2014. Jeanne Beattie, a spokeswoman for the department, said approximately 49,000 students didn’t take the English test for a "known valid reason," such as a medically excused absence for illness or injury. About 67,000 students didn’t test in math for the same reasons, she said. But those aren’t students who refused the tests. Beattie said the department doesn’t "directly collect test refusals." We also contacted the U.S. Department of Education, which also said it didn’t collect such data. We also reached out to the New York State Council of School Superintendents. Robert N. Lowry Jr., council deputy director, said his organization didn’t have refusal numbers either, but he forwarded a copy of an October 2014 study undertaken by the council that indicated that a sizable number of students were opting out of the tests. According to the report, Finding a Way Forward: Superintendent Views on the Impact of New York State Education Reform: More than 35 percent of superintendents estimated test refusals at 5 percent or more in their district. Eight percent of superintendents estimated that more than 20 percent of their students refused to participate in the English language arts or the mathematics assessments. More than half the superintendents reported an increase in test refusals since 2013, particularly on Long Island and in Central New York. Refusals were more prevalent in suburbs and the highest income districts, where achievement is not a problem. Conversely, 21 percent of superintendents reported having fewer than 1 percent of students refuse to take the ELA tests and 19 percent for mathematics. Ultimately, we got some help from Geoff Decker, a senior reporter at Chalkbeat, a nonprofit news organization covering educational change in New York and a handful of other states. Decker has covered the controversy over Common Core testing in New York. Decker forwarded to us the spreadsheet compiled by the NY State Allies for Public Education, showing its counting of test opt-outs, some by district, some by individual schools. The spreadsheet showed that 38,149 students refused to take the English test last April and 44,576 boycotted the math test a few weeks later. Since the group gathered numbers from only about half the state’s districts, the total number of opt-outs is likely much higher. Included in those numbers are figures from Long Island, a hotbed of opposition to Common Core. Jeanette Deutermann, a Bellmore, N.Y., mother who led the opt out in Long Island, provided us with her own spreadsheet that showed that 20,545 Long Island students opted out of the English test last spring, while 22,068 boycotted the math test. In some districts, more than 1,000 students opted out of tests. In at least one, more than 2,000 opted out of the math test. Deutermann told us that the numbers came from teachers, administrators and, sometimes, parents. All were confirmed by administrators, she said. "Our reports were by no means scientific, but I believe close," Deutermann said in an email. "If anything, our spreadsheets were low, as some districts refused to release their numbers." Our ruling Retired teacher Sheila Resseger wrote that "By spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core tests." While there’s no official tally of students opting out, the unofficial but detailed tallies by Common Core opponents show more than 38,000 students boycotted the English test and more than 44,000 students boycotted the math test. And those are numbers from just half the state’s districts. Those numbers and the other evidence we found suggest that the 60,000 is not only accurate, but perhaps understated.

pomt-10696	"He was a member of the Iraq Study Group and was either fired or quit from a very important commission that was trying to figure out the way forward in Iraq."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/04/john-mccain/this-attack-is-spot-on/	Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was indeed an original member of the Iraq Study Group, formed at the request of Congress to conduct a bipartisan assessment of the situation in Iraq. And he was either fired or quit from that panel after missing two official meetings. Here's what we know. Giuliani was appointed to the panel in March 2006, then missed two two-day meetings. On the dates of those meetings, he was paid for lucrative speaking appearances elsewhere. On April 11-12, 2006, the first official meeting of the Iraq Study Group was held in Washington, D.C. Where was Giuliani? On April 12, he was a keynote speaker at the FT Asian Financial Centers Summit in South Korea. His net fee: $160,000. The second official meeting of the group was May 18-19, 2006. Where was Giuliani? On May 18, he spoke at the Georgia 100 annual awards breakfast in Atlanta. His net fee: $80,000. Later that day, he attended a $100-a-plate fundraiser for former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed, then a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia. James Baker, secretary of state under the first President Bush, was co-chair of the Iraq Study Group, along with former U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. Baker declined to comment for this story. But his co-chair explains how Giuliani left the group. Hamilton says that after Giuliani told Baker he couldn't attend the second meeting in a row, "(Baker) said, 'I'm going to have to go to another person.' " On May 31, 2006, the group announced former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III would replace Giuliani. At the time, Giuliani said: "My previous time commitments do not permit me the full and active participation that the Iraq Study Group deserves." It's unclear whether he was fired or forced to quit, but consider this: During his two-month tenure on the panel, between March 15, 2006, and May 24, 2006, Giuliani made 30 paid appearances for a net revenue of $2.25-million, according to his financial disclosure forms. Pretty simple to us; McCain's attack is True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2007-12-04T00:00:00	2007-11-26	['Iraq', 'Iraq_Study_Group']

pomt-10765	"Fences have not worked. The Great Wall of China, the Berlin Wall. That's not good among peoples, especially friends like the United States and Mexico."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/23/bill-richardson/sometimes-walls-do-work/	In an Oct. 5, 2007, interview on CNN, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson reiterated his stand against the 700-mile fence under construction along the U.S.-Mexico border to slow the influx of undocumented immigrants. "Fences have not worked," he said. "The Great Wall of China, the Berlin Wall. That's not good among peoples, especially friends like the United States and Mexico." Whether fences are good or bad is a question for politicians, philosophers and policymakers. But history allows us to examine the world's epic fences and how they've performed. As a physical barrier, the Berlin Wall worked pretty well for 28 years after the East German government acted in 1961 to halt the steady flow of its citizens to West Germany. Twelve feet high and made of concrete in most places, the Berlin Wall had more than 300 watch towers, a network of bunkers and 65 miles of trenches to impede tanks. It split Berlin down the middle and snaked around the western half of the city, enclosing it. Armed guards shot scores of would-be escapees at the wall; estimates of the dead range from 80 to more than 200. Before the wall, some 2.6-million people had escaped East Germany since 1949. After that, the exodus slowed to a relative trickle. The wall helped hem in a nation of 17-million people for nearly three decades, doing what it was designed to do. It also may have worked in a larger sense. Ultimately, the wall only delayed the inevitable fall of East Germany, causing mass human suffering along the way, says Frederick Taylor, author of The Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961-1989 . But it also managed to stabilize a tense standoff between the Soviet bloc and the West over border issues, he says. When those two forces went toe to toe in those days, he said in an interview, "there was really very little alternative other than nuclear war." Richardson may have a point about the Great Wall of China, but not necessarily because it failed on any social and moral level. It was actually several walls of varying quality built over many dynasties — nothing close to the proud symbol and stalwart protector we often imagine. (You can't see it from the moon, for instance.) The Great Wall has a "less than glorious past," writes Julia Lovell in her 2006 book, The Great Wall: China against the World, 1000 B.C.-A.D. 2000 . "The forces that walls were designed to keep out — highly mobile nomadic tribes — tended to gallop along frontier walls until they found weaknesses in them or, less effortfully, simply bribe wavering Chinese generals to open key wall forts," Lovell said in an e-mail interview from Beijing. In her book she quotes Genghis Khan, who said: "The strength of walls depends on the courage of those who guard them." Sometimes walls have worked and sometimes they haven't, which is why we find Richardson's statement Half True.

pomt-01737	"It's been 17 years that we've had unemployment higher than the national average in Oregon."	true	/oregon/statements/2014/aug/04/dennis-richardson/has-oregons-unemployment-rate-been-above-national-/	Year in and year out, the economy plays a significant role in deciding important political races. That’s especially true now, as Oregon shakes off the lingering doldrums of the Great Recession. The claim: Republican gubernatorial challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, in a recent debate with incumbent Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, said Oregon’s economy has lagged behind the nation’s for years. "It’s been 17 years that we’ve had unemployment higher than the national average in Oregon," said Richardson, a state representative from Central Point. "When is that going to change?" Oregon’s unemployment rate hasn’t dipped below the national rate since 1997? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed Nick Beleiciks, an economist with the state Employment Department. The last time Oregon’s monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was lower than the U.S. rate, Beleiciks wrote, was February 1996, when Oregon was at 5.4 percent and the U.S. was at 5.5 percent. So it’s actually been 18 years since Oregon’s jobless rate was lower than the national average, he said. As with anything involving the intersection of politics and economics, however, the matter doesn’t stop there, Beleiciks added. In mid-2007, leading into the Great Recession, he wrote, the state’s jobless rate of 5.2 percent was just 0.2 percentage points higher than the U.S. average. As recently as February 2014, Oregon’s rate was a mere 0.1 percentage point higher, at 6.8 percent. Beleiciks’ point: "Statisticians don’t consider Oregon’s unemployment rate to be significantly different than the U.S. when our rate is just a few tenths of a percentage point higher or lower." The most recent numbers, for June 2014, showed a 0.7 percentage point difference, with Oregon at 6.8 percent and the U.S. at 6.1 percent. "Very close," Beleiciks said, "to the historical average difference." Richardson, in the debate, didn’t specifically blame Kitzhaber in making his claim, though Richardson’s staff later confirmed that was the implication. Kitzhaber is in his third term as governor, serving from 1995 to 2003 and since 2011. He’s now running for an unprecedented fourth term. We found an Oregon Employment Department report from February 2009 showing that the state’s unemployment rate had been higher than the national rate in 25 of the previous 33 years – meaning Oregon’s higher jobless rate long predates Kitzhaber’s first inauguration. We also called B. Starr McMullen, an Oregon State University economics professor, to ask how much sway any one politician might have to reverse those lines. "Not much," McMullen said. "If we could figure out why we are consistently remaining above the national average and the problem was solvable by government policy, we would have done that a long time ago." Tom Potiowsky, former state economist and now chairman of Portland State University’s Economics Department, agreed. "You’ve got rural areas facing long-term unemployment because there are few jobs there and nowhere near the military contracts in Oregon that, say, Washington and California have," he said. The ruling: Richardson, in a recent debate with Kitzhaber, claimed that Oregon’s unemployment rate has hovered above the national rate for 17 years. It’s actually been 18 years, but that covers the time frame of Richardson’s claim. Also, though a state economist said Oregon’s rate was sometimes statistically even with the national average, that feels like splitting hairs. Anyone looking up Oregon Employment Department statistics would find Oregon’s rate higher for the period Richardson cites. Though Richardson implied that Kitzhaber was at fault, he didn’t say so directly at the debate, so we didn’t evaluate that as part of Richardson’s claim. We find Richardson’s claim True.

pomt-03167	"Rep. Frank Wolf voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/06/mayors-against-illegal-guns/mayors-group-says-frank-wolf-voted-allow-terror-su/	U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-10th, was recently targeted by the Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group led by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. "Rep. Frank Wolf voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns," the group proclaimed on a web ad. We decided to look at this claim, which clashes with Wolf’s tough-on-terrorism record. The 32-year congressman has accused the Obama administration of covering up details about a terrorist attack last September on an American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. He has vehemently opposed efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and allow civilian trials for 9/11 terrorists. Kelly Steele, a spokesman for the mayors’ group, said the ad is based on a July 17 vote in the House Appropriations Committee on an amendment to the nation’s Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill. The amendment, introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., would have allowed the attorney general "to deny transfer of firearms to persons known or suspected to be engaged in conduct related to terrorism." It failed on a largely party-line 29-19 vote. The mayors’ group has targeted each of the representatives who voted against the amendment. "Under current law, someone can be too dangerous to board an airplane -- but can still legally buy guns and explosives," the group says in a web posting. "This dangerous loophole in our gun laws is called the Terror Gap." The group is focused on an omission in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which the federal government and most states use to screen those buying firearms from licensed dealers. People may be barred from buying guns for a number reasons, including felony convictions, fugitive status, drug addiction, adjudication as mentally defective, status as an illegal immigrant, stay in the U.S. on a non-immigration visa, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, a domestic violence conviction and criminal indictment. But the ban does not extend to those who are suspected of terrorist activity and are on the FBI’s terrorist watch list. That could include U.S. citizens, people in the U.S. on immigrant visas and people here from about 40 allied nations for which the U.S. does not require a visa. Since 2004, the federal government has kept data on the number of prospective firearm purchasers who are on the terrorist watch list. The 2011 cumulative figures showed of 1,453 people on the terrorist watch list who sought to purchase firearms or obtain an explosives license, 132 were denied for other reasons, while 1,321 were allowed to proceed. The FBI could not determine whether the purchase was actually made. The Bush administration in 2007 asked Congress to pass legislation to allow the attorney general to deny a firearm purchase or explosives license "when the background check reveals the purchaser is a known or suspected terrorist and the attorney general reasonably believes that the person may use a firearm or explosives in connection with terrorism." Every session since 2007, a bill to that effect has been introduced by Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where it has never come up for a vote. The National Rifle Association has strongly opposed the legislation, saying it could be used to persecute law-abiding gun owners. A 2009 report by the General Accounting Office said if Congress wants to ban firearm sales to suspected terrorists, it should require the Justice Department to establish guidelines to protect privacy and civil liberties. Wolf is open-minded to closing the "terror gap", but believes the thorny issues should be resolved in the Judiciary Committee, according to Dan Scandling, the congressman’s chief of staff. Scandling said the congressman’s vote against the bill reflected his dissatisfaction with the "gotcha" procedure of bringing it up in the Appropriations Committee. Matthew Dennis, a spokesman for Rep. Lowey, said the congresswoman sidestepped the Committee because the it was killing ground for the legislation. "Members of Congress who support closing this dangerous loophole have tried every avenue possible," he said. In 2011, Lowey offered an identical amendment in the Appropriations Committee that was defeated by a 27-18 vote with Wolf voting against it. An article in The Hill said Wolf offered to work Lowey to "refine the amendment," but the congresswoman rejected his offer. The article said, "Wolf said the amendment affected too many Americans since more than 500,000 people are on the terrorist list, according to the Justice Department. He noted that he regularly helps ordinary constituents get off the no-fly list after being put there by mistake." A few final notes: Tom Culligan, Wolf’s legislative director, said the congressman supports the federal background check system and has voted to expand its funding. We should also mention that Wolf was endorsed by the NRA in last fall’s elections and received a B+ rating from the organization. Our ruling There’s no doubt that Wolf, sitting in the House Appropriations Committee, voted against an amendments to budget bills that would have allowed the attorney general to deny firearm sales to those suspected of abetting terrorism. Wolf had concerns that the legislation could trample the civil liberties of innocent people and objected to the procedure of bypassing Judiciary Committee -- a panel that has quashed similar bills since 2007. Mayors Against Illegal Guns goes a step further in saying Wolf "voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns." That’s an inflammatory statement that suggests Wolf put gun rights ahead of protecting the nation from terrorists. It ignores Wolf’s spurned offer in 2011 to work with the sponsor of the amendment to find a compromise that could keep guns away from suspected terrorists while protecting the rights of those who have been unfairly placed on the government’s watch list. So the mayors’ statement has accuracy, but omits important details about Wolf’s position. We rate it Half True.	None	Mayors Against Illegal Guns	None	None	None	2013-09-06T13:45:38	2013-07-25	['None']
pomt-00690	The United States "is not building the aircraft, the long-range bombers, the additional aircraft carriers, the nuclear submarines."	false	/florida/statements/2015/may/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-united-states-isnt-building-aircr/	With leaders in Iran, Russia and elsewhere flexing their military muscles, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says the United States needs to ramp up its own military. "We are the only nation that is not building the aircraft, the long-range bombers, the additional aircraft carriers, the nuclear submarines that we need for our national defense," Rubio said at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Summit on April 25, 2015. We separately fact-checked Rubio’s claim at the same event that the United States is not modernizing nuclear weapons. Here, we wanted to know whether Rubio is correct that the United States isn’t building the other military equipment. We interviewed spokespersons for the Air Force and Navy and other military experts about the current status of building planes, bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. We contacted Rubio’s campaign and Senate offices and did not get a reply. We actually found a lot of evidence that the United States is spending on the types of military equipment Rubio mentioned. We’ll take it point by point. Nuclear submarines The Navy’s highest shipbuilding priority is the Ohio-Class Replacement program to build 12 ballistic missile submarines to replace the current force of 14. These submarines carry long-range missiles armed with multiple nuclear warheads. The Navy plans to replace the ships as they retire, beginning the first hull in 2021 and continuing to build through 2035. The Navy has budgeted $1.4 billion for research and design in fiscal year 2016 after a House panel authorized funding for it, but the challenge is funding the total program, which could cost as much as $139 billion. The Navy’s most recent budget request to Congress to build the first ship was for about $5.7 billion. Aircraft The Defense Department is in the middle of the largest aircraft procurement ever for different versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The government started acquiring new airplanes in 2007, and the branches of the service are testing various versions. Full-scale production is expected to start around 2018. Plans call for acquiring a total of 2,443 over about 20 years at a cost of nearly $400 billion. Through fiscal year 2013, the F-35 program has received a total of roughly $83 billion of funding. The Defense Department’s budget for the current year includes $8.6 billion for 38 joint strike fighters and $11 billion for 57 in 2016. "It is a quantum leap in technology compared to what we are currently flying," said Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman at the Pentagon for the F-35 program. "The F-35 from a budget financial point of view has the full support of the Pentagon, and the Marine Corps is funding it, the Navy is funding it, the Air Force is funding it. It is a massive amount of money, a massive amount of jobs and a massive capability that is being delivered to the warfighter." Aircraft carrier The Future Years Defense Program includes plans for one new aircraft carrier. The Defense Department budget for 2016 shows about $2 billion budgeted for this year and $2 billion for next year toward the cost of a Ford class aircraft carrier, which costs in total about $14 billion. "The Ford Class will feature an array of advanced technologies designed to improve warfighting capabilities and allow significant manpower reductions," states the Navy’s budget. The lead ship of the first new class of aircraft carriers has been under construction since 2008. Bombers The Air Force has started a new bomber program, known as long-range strike bomber. The Air Force anticipates awarding a contract in the late spring with "initial operational capability for the planned fleet of 80-100 aircraft in the mid 2020s," an Air Force spokeswoman told PolitiFact. But delays in awarding the contract prompted the House Armed Services Committee to reduce the funding by $460 million so the money could be reallocated elsewhere in 2016, according to an April 27 article in Military Times. The article stated that during the last few years, the Air Force has worked with defense companies on the research and technology phase and has made a $1 billion technology investment in the bomber. The 2016 budget also includes an array of modernization initiatives for different types of bombers that are used in nuclear and other missions. Experts The experts we spoke with agreed the United States is building aircraft, bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. "The U.S. is doing all of the things he says it is not doing -- literally all of them," said Todd Harrison, senior fellow of defense studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "These programs are (in many cases) works in progress, so they are not completed yet, but the programs are actively in progress." While these plans are at various phases, research and development is moving forward, said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the Cato Institute. A report by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies projected the total cost to modernize the nuclear triad at $1 trillion over 30 years raising questions about whether the government has a handle on the full costs and is willing to spend that much. Despite funding shortfalls, Friedman said that he thinks it is likely that the United States will proceed with plans to replace this equipment -- but will muddle through with "a combination of slowing procurement, ordering less platforms, dialing down requirements to keep down cost (especially for the nuclear armed submarines), maybe dropping the nuclear mission for the F-35s, and various other small steps to save." We did find debate among the experts whether the building plans are moving forward quickly enough. Thomas Donnelly, a defense expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the United States is building too slowly and not building enough. He said the most immediately shortfall is attack submarines -- during the Reagan years, the United States built four per year, but that has fallen to one or two a year. "Newer systems are more capable than the ones they replace, but they're not good enough to be in two places at once," he said. "The world is big, and we have gotten in the habit of operating all over it." Our ruling Rubio said that the United States "is not building the aircraft, the long-range bombers, the additional aircraft carriers, the nuclear submarines." The military has programs in place to build the types of equipment Rubio mentioned, including the largest aircraft procurement ever: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It will take many years and billions of dollars to complete the procurement, but Rubio’s statement could mislead voters into thinking that the United States has closed up shop in the area of military equipment and isn’t building anything, which isn’t the case. We rate this claim False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-05-05T10:41:42	2015-04-25	['United_States']
pomt-13808	Says Hillary Clinton "has been a champion of globalist trade agreements. ... Worst of all, they are now pushing the disastrous 5,000-page Obamatrade — the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/18/jeff-sessions/mostly-false-jeff-sessions-says-clinton-champion-g/	Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, one of the earliest congressmen to back Donald Trump, echoed Trump’s critique of Hillary Clinton’s trade agenda at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "She has been a champion of globalist trade agreements," Sessions said during the convention’s opening night. "But the facts are in. They have not worked for the American people. When those agreements were signed, Presidents (Bill) Clinton and Obama promised our dangerous trade deficits with China and Korea would be reduced. But, the deficit with China has increased fivefold and the deficit with Korea doubled. These are job-killing numbers. They are now pushing the disastrous 5,000-page ‘Obamatrade’ — the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement." This sounds like a variation of Trump’s claim (parroted from Clinton’s Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders): "Hillary Clinton voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs. " Both Sanders and Trump received Half True ratings for their claims, but Sessions’ claim is less accurate. He’s painting Clinton’s position on free trade with an overly broad brush and is just plain wrong on her supporting for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. In reality, Clinton has zigzagged through the years when it comes to free trade. From 1993 to 2016, she supported eight deals, opposed two, flip-flopped from opposing to supporting three, and flip-flopped the other way on two others. Clinton as first lady spoke favorably in the 1990s and 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement. (Sessions is right NAFTA was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, but he neglected to mention that the deal was envisioned by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and negotiated by George H. W. Bush). As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She said yes to six and no to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and a deal with Andean countries. She skipped the votes on agreements with Jordan and Peru, which came up when she was running for president the first time, but supported both deals. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had different opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA "a mistake" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. As secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But as a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Here’s a breakdown: Our ruling Sessions said Clinton "has been a champion of globalist trade agreements. ... Worst of all, they are now pushing the disastrous 5,554-page Obamatrade — the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement." Clinton has largely supported free trade deals, but calling her a "champion" of them goes too far. Out of the 15 trade deals that she’s commented or voted on from 1993 to 2016, she currently opposes four of them, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that Sessions singled out.

pomt-13426	Says eight Americans died in a knife attack at a Minnesota mall.	false	/colorado/statements/2016/sep/20/tom-tancredo/former-rep-tancredo-incorrectly-says-eight-america/	In a fundraising email for a "Secure Our Borders Gun Giveaway," former Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo's PAC incorrectly said eight people died in a knife attack at a Minnesota. Tancredo, a Republican who represented the 6th Congressional District from 1999 to 2009, is known for his hard-line crusade against illegal immigration and provocative comments. Fortunately, none of the 10 people who were injured died in the Sept. 17 attack at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud. All the victims -- including seven men, one woman and a 15-year-old girl -- have been released from the hospital, the Associated Press reported. The only person who was killed was the suspected attacker, a young Somali man dressed as a private security guard, who was shot by an off-duty police officer. A Sept. 19 fundraising email promoting Team America PAC's gun giveaway quoted Tancredo, the group's founder and president, saying: "I mentioned that we live in dangerous times -- and the events of this week only remind us of that fact once more." "The threat of radical Islam is higher than ever as the nation mourns the death of eight Americans at the hands of a Somalian refugee in Minnesota," the email inaccurately stated. "With these continued threats it's important that we do everything in our power to defend ourselves and our families," Tancredo said. "….I can think of no better way to defend yourself and your family than with an H&K P2000, the same gun used by Border Patrol agents." The email linked to a Team America PAC website where people could enter the "Gun Giveaway" sweepstakes for the .40-caliber Heckler & Koch handgun. A Tancredo statement on the contest page said it's being held to "To encourage Americans to elect candidates for office who will work to secure our border." "After you sign up for the giveaway, please consider making a donation of $100, $50, $25 or even $10," Tacredo said. "We can only continue the fight to secure our borders with your help!" When PolitiFact partner Denver7 notified Tancredo of the factual error in its fundraising email, he said he was aware of the error and issued this correction to PolitiFact and Denver7: "My email earlier this morning inaccurately portrayed that the attacks in Minnesota led to innocent deaths and not simply the death of the perpetrator. "Despite that error, the email was correct in stating that these truly are troubling times, a fact furthered by the shootout and arrest of the Afghani bombing suspect in New Jersey just moments ago. "Please read the email below for more information regarding how you can protect yourself and your family in the face of these attacks by entering Team America PAC's gun giveaway. I apologize for any confusion with the last email." In an interview, Tancredo told PolitiFact the PAC's two-man staff had made "apologies all the way around" for the error. "It's my fault too because I should have proofed it," he added. Our ruling Tancredo's PAC said that "the threat of radical Islam is higher than ever as the nation mourns the death of eight Americans at the hands of a Somalian refugee in Minnesota." He acknowledged the statement was incorrect and issued a correction. People were injured in the attack, but no one died.

pomt-12239	Says "Donald Trump was doing a rally in the state of Florida" the day Trump's son and others met with a Russian lawyer in New York.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/14/corey-lewandowski/lewandowski-wrongly-says-trump-florida-day-trump-t/	Questions continue to swirl around June 9, 2016, the day senior officials working on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign held a meeting with a Russian lawyer in hopes of gleaning derogatory information on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The timeline around this meeting is key because a central line of questioning for investigators probing possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government could likely be what did Donald Trump know about the meeting, and when did he know it? In an appearance on NBC’s MTP Daily, Trump’s campaign manager at the time recalled traveling with the candidate on June 9, 2016, for a Trump rally in Florida. "What I do remember on that particular day was that was a day that Donald Trump was doing a rally in the state of Florida, so I traveled with the president that day," Corey Lewandowski said July 13, 2017. Was Trump in Florida on June 9, 2016, the day his son, Donald Trump Jr., and others met with a Russian lawyer in New York? No. Trump was in New York. Trump attended a fundraising lunch at the Four Seasons in New York before spending the rest of the day at Trump Tower. He also engaged in a Twitter feud that day with Clinton. That morning he took to Twitter and called Clinton "Crooked Hillary," saying his Democratic rival would be a "disaster" on everything from the economy to the military to health care. The barbs continued throughout the day, with Trump lashing out at President Barack Obama over his endorsement of Clinton. "Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama — but nobody else does!" Trump tweeted. Clinton replied that afternoon, urging Trump: "Delete your account." Trump then fired back: "How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up — and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?" According to a schedule of Trump’s rallies released by NBC, Trump held no rally on June 9, and he did not appear for a Florida rally until June 11 — two days after Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner met at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer. The date of Trump’s Florida rally is backed up by a Tampa Bay Times photo taken at the Tampa Convention Center in downtown Tampa on Saturday, June 11, 2016. Our ruling Lewandowski said "Donald Trump was doing a rally in the state of Florida" the day his son and others met with a Russian lawyer in New York. That’s wrong. The Florida rally was two days later on June 11. Trump was in New York on June 9 and spoke at a fundraiser before returning to Trump Tower. We rate Lewandowski’s claim False.

pomt-05837	"Obamacare (hit) Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/16/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-commerce-ad-says-obamacare-hit-americans-o/	A new attack ad hitting Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, focuses on "government interference" and "more taxes." "Tell Jon Tester the Washington way isn't the solution," a folksy voice intones. "We need less government and lower taxes." The big number the ad uses to drive its point home: "Obamacare (hit) Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes." We wondered: Did the Affordable Care Act of 2010 contain a $500 billion tax increase? The ad Here’s the full wording of the ad, spoken over black-and-white images including worried faces and ominous dark clouds: "When it comes to fixing America's troubles, is the solution more government interference, more taxes? That's the Washington way. Sadly, it's become Jon Tester's way, too. Tester cast a deciding vote for Obamacare, even though Montanans oppose this massive government intrusion into their health care. And then hitting Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes to pay for it. Tell Jon Tester the Washington way isn't the solution. We need less government and lower taxes." We asked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which paid for the ad, for support for its tax claim. But we didn’t hear back. However, words on the screen show the source: "CBO Testimony, 3/30/11." We tracked down the March 30, 2011, testimony from the Congressional Budget Office, "Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010." It summarizes analyses by CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation from before and after the health care law was enacted. (And it looks at not just the Affordable Care Act, but also the Reconciliation Act, which contained some health care provisions.) The health care laws created a mandate for Americans to buy health insurance, created insurance exchanges and federal subsidies to make insurance more affordable and significantly expanded eligibility for Medicaid. To pay for that boost in Americans’ health care coverage, it reduced the rate of growth in Medicare payments, imposed a tax on health insurance plans with high premiums and raised some taxes on high earners, along with other changes to the tax code. How much money are the laws expected to raise? The 2011 CBO report shows the "estimated budgetary effects" of the laws in Table 1. The estimate from March 2010 — when Tester voted — shows revenue generated by the law from 2010-19 would be $525 billion. That’s certainly in the ballpark of the ad’s "more than $500 billion" number. Here’s the catch: That’s revenue from "taxes, fees and penalties," the CBO testimony says. How much of that $525 billion was estimated to come from taxes? The tax breakdown came from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which published its revenue estimates on March 20, 2010. Its total was $409 billion. The list includes a few small measures that not all experts agree are taxes (we’ve looked before at many of the health care law’s provisions to determine which are taxes and which aren’t) — which pulls that number closer to $400 billion. By the same token, it doesn’t happen to list revenue from the penalty payments that will be required of employers who don’t provide insurance and people who don’t buy insurance, which were estimated to bring in $65 billion, according Table 2 of a CBO estimate from March 20, 2010. That’s just as well, since the question of whether those penalties are taxes is the subject of legal challenges to the health care law and not something we’ll settle in this item. Still, the penalties are in the tax code — so there’s at least a scenario where the tax burden from the law is $465 billion, better supporting the Chamber of Commerce claim than $400 billion. Meanwhile, we’re not trying to weigh which of those taxes is "new" — certainly some of them are merely increases in existing taxes, experts told us. What it means Meanwhile, at least one expert we talked to said he found the distinction between taxes, fees and penalties to be overly picky. He finds it reasonable to cite the full $525 billion number from CBO. "Someone could quibble that some of the fees do not represent a ‘tax increase,’" said James Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "but I cannot fault anyone for saying that the ACA increased taxes by $525 billion." He had a different problem with the ad’s statement: "It lacks context because it does not talk about the benefits of the health care expansion that the increased revenues help pay for," he said. Henry Aaron, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, mentioned another piece of context: The health care law calls for sizable subsidies to help people buy health insurance. Some economists treat these transfers as "negative taxes." "So, if one wants to talk about what is 'hitting' American families, it would be appropriate to count increased payments made to them as well as increased payments they make to the government," he said. What’s that number? It’s not simple to say, Aaron pointed out — $1,1trillion is the net value of the insurance coverage provisions in the law. $504 billion of that is the number without counting Medicaid and CHIP spending that goes directly to states. Another portion, $777 billion, includes mostly spending for direct subsidies but also some other items. We found a CBO estimate that premium and cost-sharing subsidies would cost $350 billion. Bottom line? The tax burden on Americans increases — but it's offset by what taxpayers get in return. A Daily Finance article in 2010 called it a "myth" that heath care reform would raise "your" taxes, noting, "Most people will not see a tax increase." The AARP, which supported the health care law, pointed out that cost savings from the law would depend "on whether your income is on the high side, whether you have ‘Cadillac’ employer-sponsored health care coverage and how often you go to tanning salons ... among other things." Families USA, a liberal group that pushed for the health care law, pointed out lower taxes and lower premiums for 28.6 million Americans under the law. Our ruling A Chamber of Commerce ad attacking a Montana Democrat says, "Obamacare (hit) Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes." That’s a fair number for total revenue raised by the 2010 health care law as estimated when Tester voted — but the number for just taxes is lower, likely between $400 billion and $465 billion. Meanwhile, the ad talks about the tax bill "hitting Americans," but not the substantial federal subsidies headed their way under the same legislation. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That's our definition of Half True.

pomt-00536	Says U.S. Senate opponent Ron Johnson "is opposed to all government-assisted student loans."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/19/russ-feingold/ron-johnson-against-all-government-assisted-studen/	One of the first shots Democrat Russ Feingold took at Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, after announcing he would try to retake his old U.S. Senate seat, was over student loans. "Just because (college) costs keep going up, that doesn’t mean we can allow the four-year degree to become the sole province of the rich," Feingold said June 5, 2015 at the Wisconsin Democratic Convention in Milwaukee. "My opponent is opposed to all government-assisted student loans." Is he? Feingold’s evidence To be sure, Johnson has been critical of the government’s role in student loans. In May 2014, he said kids from affluent families are "taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants," while many middle-class families with no connection to college are picking up the tab -- a claim we rated Mostly False. But Feingold’s claim is absolute -- that Johnson opposes all government-assisted student loans. A Feingold spokesman referred us to Max Croes, a researcher for the Wisconsin Democratic Party. He cited three statements that go beyond Johnson criticizing the loan program. "Should never have gotten involved" At a May 2015 town hall meeting in Oconto, Johnson said: "I think we’ve done a huge disservice to our young people by enticing them into getting into debt. And, of course, college and universities, they’ve loved it. It helped fill their programs, it helped fill their campuses. It helped them build all kinds of beautiful campus buildings." After an audience member interjected, Johnson added: "I will say the federal government never should have gotten involved in student loan programs." "Shouldn’t be involved" In a videotaped interview in 2012 with the Daily Cardinal, a University of Wisconsin-Madison student newspaper, Johnson was asked if he supported extending what was then a 3.4 percent interest rate for student loans. (Congress had recently agreed to keep the discounted rate in place for another year on some federal student loans, rather than allowing the rate to double to 6.8 percent.) Johnson replied: "No. No. Why are we encouraging our young people to get into debt, first of all? Why is the federal government even making money off the loans? Why is the federal government even involved in the student loan program? I have multiple problems with that. "Again, for all you young people who agree with (former GOP presidential candidate) Ron Paul in terms of the limited constitutional government -- the federal government shouldn’t even be involved in granting student loans." "I’d like the government to get out" At a town hall meeting outside of Madison in May 2014, Johnson blamed the federal government for encouraging college students to take on debt they can’t afford, according to a report from Wisconsin Public Radio. "I'd like the federal government, over time, to remove itself from the funding mechanisms of college education," he said after the meeting. "I think it's done a great deal of harm – very unintended negative consequences." Johnson’s response Johnson’s staff responded to Feingold’s claim by telling us it "is patently and demonstrably wrong," but cited only Johnson’s support of one piece of legislation. In July 2013, Johnson voted for a measure, later signed into law by President Barack Obama, that ties the interest rates on federal student loans to the financial markets. That is, if rates on Treasury notes rise, so would student loan rates. The upshot was that the law reduced interest rates in the short term, but allows them to rise in future years if market conditions change, although the rates would be capped (at 8.25 percent for undergraduate loans). A New York Times news article noted that many liberals were upset that some Democrats backed the measure, since it eliminated fixed-rate federally subsidized loans. So, Johnson voted for a measure that helped student loan recipients in the short term -- although it took the government out of setting interest rates, creating the likelihood that the rates will rise in future years. Our rating Feingold said Johnson "is opposed to all government-assisted student loans." Johnson has said the government never should have gotten involved in student loans, shouldn’t be involved in it and should look to gradually get out of it. But one of his votes helped student borrowers in the short term, though that measure could lead to higher interest rates in future years, since the rates are tied to changes in the financial markets. Feingold’s statement is accurate but needs clarification, our definition of Mostly True.	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2015-06-19T10:27:25	2015-06-05	['United_States']

pomt-14620	A Texas law requires every high school to have a voter registrar "and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/29/paul-saldana/paul-saldana-says-texas-law-requires-high-school-r/	At a January 2016 "civic summit" hosted and aired by Austin’s KLRU-TV, Paul Saldaña, a member of Austin’s school board, responded to a question about improving voter turnout among Latino residents by saying participation starts within each family but also involves the schools. Saldaña made us wonder when he said: "We actually have a state law that requires every public and private high school in the state of Texas to have an actual voter registrar" on "campus and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote." The deadline to register to vote in the March 2016 party primaries is Feb. 1, 2016. Saldaña, asked about what he said, told us by phone he was reflecting on a 1980s-era law. However, the board vice president said by email, he’d meant to say only that each registrar’s responsibility was to make sure eligible students registered -- not that the students went on to vote. "What's interesting is that even though this has been part of our Texas election code," he wrote, "not too many folks seem to be aware of it." 1983 law Mark us guilty on that count. But an online search brought us to section 13.046 of the Texas election code, "High School Deputy Registrars," stating that each "principal of a public or private high school or the principal's designee shall serve as a deputy registrar" in the local county. Each registrar, the law says, "may distribute registration application forms to and receive registration applications submitted to the deputy in person from students and employees of the school only." The law goes on: "At least twice each school year, a high school deputy registrar shall distribute an officially prescribed registration application form to each student who is or will be 18 years of age or older during that year." So, there is a law requiring each high school to have a deputy voter registrar who makes voter registration applications available to eligible students. And, we learned, the law is unusual. Nationally, only North Carolina has a Texas-like statute, Michael Dolan of the National Conference of State Legislatures told us by email, though the organization knows of a dozen states that in some way regulate voter registration at high schools. Dolan said the North Carolina law requires every public high school to make voter registration forms available to students. We asked Sally Harlow of the Texas Legislative Reference Library about how the Texas law came to be. By email, she guided us to legislative records showing a Dallas Democrat, then-Rep. Paul Ragsdale, ushered the mandate into law in the 1983 legislative session. Few lawmakers voted against the deputy voter registrar requirement, the records show. At the time, Ragsdale described the action as necessary because "difficulties have been experienced" in some counties "in going onto high school campuses to register eligible students to vote." (Nationally, the voting age had been lowered from 21 to 18 by a constitutional amendment ratified by the states as of July 1971.) Texas rules The Texas law says each high school’s deputy registrar shall distribute the registration applications "subject to rules prescribed by the secretary of state," the state’s chief elections officer, "who shall prescribe any other needed procedures." We turned to the relevant rules, last amended in July 1998, which state that each principal may designate an employee to be the deputy voter registrar. In the last month of each semester, the rules say, each school’s deputy voter registrar shall distribute voter registration applications and instructions to those students who are or will be 18 years old that semester and on request, applications and instructions may be distributed at any time. Also, the rules say, the deputy registrar must deliver completed applications to the county’s voter registrar or elections administrator "as soon as possible after they are received." The rules say that if the deputy registrar fails to fulfill the mandate, the principal shall relieve him or her and the principal "shall resume the duties of high school deputy registrar until a new representative is designated." 2016 letter to principals To our inquiry, Alicia Pierce, spokeswoman for the secretary of state’s office, said by email the agency doesn’t know how many students end up registering because the agency categorizes such registrations in a way that folds in other originating locations such as libraries. Generally, she said that twice a year, the agency sends each high school principal a letter reminding them of the registration mandate. Pierce emailed us the agency’s latest letter, sent to principals Jan. 4, 2016. The letter said: "As a high school principal, it is your duty to register eligible high school students" under the law "as a high school deputy voter registrar, by distributing voter registration forms at least twice during the school year." The letter also noted the expectation that principals do so at the end of each semester. But with the March primaries looming, the letter went on, "we also encourage you to distribute and collect voter registration applications in time for the students to register before" Feb. 1. Also noted in the letter: A student may register if she or he is 17 years, 10 months of age, though the student must be 18 on or before election day to cast a ballot. We asked Pierce if the law goes so far as to require the deputy voter registrars to register eligible students. By phone, Pierce said a registrar isn’t expected to press students into registering though if a student returns a filled-in application, she said, the registrar must ferry the application along. Our ruling Saldaña said a Texas law requires every high school to have a voter registrar "and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote." A 1983 law requires every high school to have a deputy voter registrar tasked with giving eligible students voter registration applications. Each registrar also must make sure submitted applications are appropriately handled. However, the law doesn’t require registrars to make every eligible student register; it's up to each student to act or not. Also, as Saldaña acknowledged, registrars aren’t required to ensure that students vote. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-00945	Rhode Island "is one of the worst states" for income equality.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/22/george-nee/ri-afl-cio-president-george-nee-says-state-one-wor/	The growing income inequality in the United States -- the gap between rich and poor -- was one of the issues raised Feb. 5 when the House Committee on Labor listened to testimony on a proposal to raise the minimum to $10.10 per hour for most workers. George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, advocated for the increase, telling lawmakers, "We have some real serious issues in this country with income equality, and Rhode Island, unfortunately, is one of the worst states in terms of the gap." Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 in January, which would be the fourth increase in as many years, "is another way of helping to close that," he said. We've seen a lot of rankings for Rhode Island, but we apparently missed this one. So we asked Nee for his source. Meanwhile, we went looking ourselves. But first, let's acknowledge that there's no specific definition of how bad Rhode Island would have to be to make it "one of the "worst." Some might say being among the top five worst states would qualify. But we’ll draw the line at being in the top 10. We found a 2012 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank based in Washington, D.C. It gauged the income gap in each state and found that the richest 20 percent of Rhode Island households had incomes that were 7.5 times higher than the poorest 20 percent. But that put Rhode Island in the middle of the income inequality pack, not at the top. So by that assessment, Nee was wrong. Two days later, Nee responded by sending us other analyses. One cited the Gini coefficient, which measures the concentration of wealth using a number ranging from 0 (where everyone has the same amount of wealth) to 1 (where all of the wealth is held by one person). It's based on U.S. Census data. According to the Wikipedia page cited by Nee, Rhode Island ranked 12th worst in income inequality in 2010. New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, California, Texas, Tennessee, Mississippi and Georgia had more income inequality than we did. That still missed the top 10. We found 2013 state data from the Census Bureau put us even further away from the worst. According to those numbers, Rhode Island has dropped to 13th. If you take the three-year and five-year averages, we're 17th out of 50. Nee also directed us to a Jan. 26, 2015 report and data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute, another Washington, D.C.-based liberal economic think tank. It compared each state's highest earners -- the top 1 percent -- with everyone else. The Institute reports in Table 2 that in 2012, the average income of Rhode Island's top 1% was $966,071. That’s less than the $1.3 million U.S. average. The average income for the rest of Rhode Island was $44,563, a tad higher than the national average of $43,713. By that measure, Rhode Island had the 29th biggest gap between the top 1 percent and the rest of the state. Once again, if you think income inequality is bad, we're not even close to being the worst. (That report, by the way, concludes that your income needs to be at least $314,647 in Rhode Island to be in the top 1 percent.) Nee also cited a real estate blog that claims Rhode Island is 10th highest in terms of income inequality. That could make us one of the worst, but the blog item doesn't cite the sources of its data and uses a questionable statistical method -- creating four rankings and then averaging them to come up with a fifth ranking -- to reach that conclusion. Thus, we don't regard it as good evidence. Finally, Nee referred us to the "Executive Pay Watch" portion of the AFL.CIO's website. There, Rhode Island ranks 3rd when you compare CEO income to the minimum wage (before the minimum wage rose to $9 in January) and 2nd if you compare what those CEOs make compared to average workers' pay, the union says. Rhode Island certainly seems to deserve being called "one of the worst" by that measure. The problem: Rhode Island's ranking is based on the compensation for only 10 people -- the CEOs of 10 publicly-traded companies listed on the Russell 3000 index whose headquarters are based in Rhode Island. The growing gap between the pay of CEOs and the average worker may be indicative of income inequality, but this sample size is much too small to draw any useful comparisons between states. The rankings of Wyoming and New Mexico, to give an even better example, are based on the incomes of only one -- that's right, just one -- CEO. And when roughly 2,300 Rhode Island households report adjusted gross incomes of more than a half million each year -- or at least, that was the number for 2008 -- it's not clear that the pay of just 10 CEOs accurately represents all of Rhode Island's wealthy. Nee responded that he believes the data support his assertion. "It is clear that, even with the increase in the minimum wage from $8 to $9 per hour," he wrote in an email, "Rhode Island's lowest paid employees are falling further and further behind when compared to a sampling of Rhode Island's wealthiest. Rhode Island's minimum wage workers fare amongst the worst in the country in this regard." Our ruling Rhode Island AFL-CIO President George Nee said Rhode Island is one of the worst states for the gap between rich and poor. His organization's comparison of CEO pay in the country's top public companies with what the average worker makes shows that Rhode Island is close to being THE worst, but that conclusion is based on the pay of only 10 CEOs. The Census Bureau's Gini index and the analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities offers a better assessment of the gap. Yet in neither case does Rhode Island rank as a top 10 state. Because Nee's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07619	"If you look at the jobs lost in the private sector as opposed to the job gains in the public sector, it's out of whack. The government's growing and the private economy's shrinking."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/21/steve-latourette/rep-steve-latourette-says-government-growing-while/	Ohio Senate Bill 5 would restrict collective bargaining for state workers and severely limit it for local government employees. Rep. Steven LaTourette says won't endorse the bill as written, although he doesn’t have a say in it since it’s a bill in the state legislature. "Being a lawyer, I've never seen the legal system more efficient than sitting down and negotiating over wages and benefits," the former Lake County prosecutor said in an interview March 4 with The News-Herald. Even so, he said, "I get the fact that we're going to look inward and there seems to be a disconnect between public employment and private employment. If you look at the jobs lost in the private sector as opposed to the job gains in the public sector, it's out of whack. The government's growing and the private economy's shrinking." PolitiFact Ohio was interested because the congressman said something similar last summer, when he asserted that American Recovery and Reinvestment Act did little for private jobs while the federal workforce boomed. The statement is a popular claim among Republicans criticizing the White House and Democratic congressional leadership. PolitiFact has checked out several variations, including more than one from House Speaker John Boehner, and always concluded that the statement contained some truth but glossed over important information. We wondered if, and how, conditions had changed. LaTourette's office told us his comments were based on employment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and on a February report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service titled "Job Growth During the Recovery." We took benchmark dates from the CRS report, which identifies December 2007 as the start of the recession and June 2009 as the start of recovery. In December 2007, the BLS database of payroll statistics put total employment in the country at 137,983,000. The job losses that followed did not stop after the recovery started, and employment hit bottom in February 2010. In February 2011 -- the last month for which figures are available -- BLS says there were 130,515,000 jobs. That's a loss of 7,468,000 from the recession's start. Employment in the private sector, which BLS says was 115,606,000 jobs in December 2007, also bottomed out in February 2010. The number reached 108,298,000 in February 2011, a loss of 7,308,000 jobs. Total government employment in December 2007 was 22,377,000, according to BLS. That figure rose during the recession to 22,557,000 jobs in June 2009, but dipped by February 2011 to 22,217,000 -- a loss of 160,000. The total could be considered deceptive, however, because it includes federal, state and local workers. Budget problems have hit state and local payrolls, but BLS statistics say the federal workforce increased by 99,000 jobs from December 2007 to February 2011. Where does that leave us? Almost where we started. Employment is not the chief measure of a growing or shrinking economy. (The gross domestic product (GDP) is. It has been growing, but too slowly to do much for employment, which is why the CRS report cites a "jobless recovery.") But employment is the measure that concerns most people. LaTourette was correct in saying there are fewer jobs now, in total or in the private sector, than there were before the recession. But an important detail to know for context is that jobs have been increasing, not diminishing, for the past year. And while there are more jobs in the federal government, even without the temporary census workers who inflated earlier statistics, there are fewer government jobs in total. LaTourette's statement amounts to a verbal snapshot. But while it’s a recognizable picture, it lacks some important details. That's why we rate it, just as we have previous similar claims, as Half True.	None	Steve LaTourette	None	None	None	2011-03-21T06:00:00	2011-03-04	['None']

pomt-10456	Barack Obama "wants to nearly double the capital gains tax" increasing taxes on "mutual funds, 401(k)s" for "policemen, firemen, nurses."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/29/john-mccain/mccain-stretches-on-who-gets-hit/	Republican nominee Sen. John McCain criticized Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama for proposing a tax increase on capital gains. "Senator Obama says that he doesn't want to raise taxes on anybody making over $200,000 a year, yet he wants to nearly double the capital gains tax. Nearly double it, which 100-million Americans have investments in — mutual funds, 401(k)s — policemen, firemen, nurses. He wants to increase their taxes," McCain told interviewer George Stephanopoulos of ABC's This Week on April 20, 2008. McCain is right about Obama's position on capital gains taxes. Obama has proposed raising them to between 20 and 28 percent to help pay for other programs. That top rate would "nearly double them." He's also right that many Americans hold mutual funds and 401(k)s. About 96-million hold mutual funds, according to industry estimates, with about 84 percent holding mutual funds in 401(k)s and other defined contribution retirement plan accounts. But McCain strays from the path when he describes what capital gains taxes will affect and who will pay them. Let's stop here and explain exactly what a capital gains tax is. The Internal Revenue Service explains: "Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset." When you sell an asset for a profit, that profit margin is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the income level of the tax filer and the length of the investment, with separate tax rates for short-term vs. long-term capital gains. People who want low capital gains taxes say they should be low because they encourage investment and economic growth. People who sell stocks for a profit, for example, are often concerned about capital gains taxes. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush cut the capital gains tax rate, so people now pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than they do on their regular income. The long-term capital gains tax rate for higher income brackets now is 15 percent, considerably lower than their marginal income tax rates. (If you're making more than $32,000 a year, your income tax rates range from 25 percent to 35 percent. See a detailed income tax chart here .) But McCain's assertion about whom capital gains taxes would affect is another story. He says they would affect "mutual funds and 401(k)s." He's right on mutual funds, but not about 401(k) or mutual funds held under a 401(k) retirement plan. A 401(k) is a retirement account to which workers can contribute earnings without paying taxes on the earnings. People aren't taxed on their 401(k) accounts until they withdraw the money. When they do withdraw that money, it's subject to regular income taxes, not capital gains taxes. We asked McCain's campaign about his comments; a spokesman said increases to the capital gains tax would depress the stock market and thereby hurt people's 401(k)s. The idea is that investors would avoid the stock market because they have to pay a higher tax on their profits, stocks would go down, and then the value of 401(k)s would drop. But economists disagree about whether captial gains taxes have a significant effect on the stock market, and McCain's comments don't make it clear that he's talking about an indirect effect. McCain's comments imply that 100-million people would see higher tax bills due to capital gains increases. This significantly inflates the number of people who pay capital gains taxes, even at the lower rate. Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., pointed us to IRS data that show about 16.2-million taxpayers were subject to capital gains taxes in 2005, the most recent year for which data are available. Additionally, most of the gains reported in 2005 — about 81 percent — were claimed by taxpayers making $200,000 a year or more, the top 2.7 percent of tax returns. We don't think of them as "policemen, firemen, nurses." So McCain is right on Obama's position, but he takes a lot of liberties in explaining the potential effects of an increase in the capital gains tax rate. Capital gains tax increases would not directly affect most working people saving for retirement. We find his statement to be Half True.

pomt-05922	"Sheldon Whitehouse's failure of leadership, the adding of almost $8 trillion in debt in his first full term, is shameful..."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/31/barry-hinckley/us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-sen-sheldo/	Barry Hinckley, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has posted several short issue-oriented videos on YouTube, including "Era of disgrace," which attacks incumbent Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse for helping to grow the national debt. Hinckley says that "career politicians have spent us into the ground. They have taxed our children's future away. Sheldon Whitehouse's failure of leadership, the adding of almost $8 trillion in debt in his first full term, is shameful and shows he is unwilling to tackle the problem and go to work on behalf of our children." We’ll check two parts of this claim -- whether the debt will increase by $8 trillion by the time Whitehouse completes his first term and the degree to which Whitehouse is responsible. First, let's check the number. The U.S. government's Treasury Direct website regularly calculates the national debt to the penny and lets people track it over time. From Jan. 3, 2007, when Whitehouse took office, to Jan. 17, 2012, when Hinckley posted the video, the total public debt outstanding went from $8.68 trillion to $15.24 trillion. That's a difference of $6.56 trillion. That's almost $7 trillion but not "almost $8 trillion." So he's not there yet. How much is the debt likely to rise by January 2013 when Whitehouse's first term expires? We looked back and found that the increase can vary significantly from year to year. From 2007 to 2008 it went up by 6.1 percent but the next year, it increased by 15.4 percent. Last year it went up by 8.8 percent. So we used the yearly increase for the past five years since Whitehouse has been in office and projected them onto the debt on Jan. 3, 2012. Then we subtracted the amount the U.S. government owed when Whitehouse took office. The range: from $7.5 trillion to $8.9 trillion. In addition, the federal budget for 2012 predicts that by Sept. 30, the gross federal debt will be $16.6 trillion, $8 trillion more than when Whitehouse took office. So Hinckley's "nearly $8 trillion" is correct. Second, is the increase a result of Whitehouse's "failure of leadership?" When we asked the Hinckley campaign how Whitehouse could be held responsible for the increase, he issued a statement through his spokeswoman: "He's made no difference in terms of controlling our debt and has made a huge difference in compliantly increasing it." Neither Congress nor the president has complete control over the growth in government spending. Throughout his term in office, Whitehouse's party has controlled the Senate. But Republicans held the presidency during his first two years and Republicans will have controlled the House during the last two. In addition, Whitehouse is currently just one of 51 Democratic Senators and, under the current rules, a bill needs at least some degree of Republican support before it can pass there. To suggest, as Hinckley's statement does, that Rhode Island's junior senator is the leader who is destined to saddle the United States with an extra $8 trillion in debt is -- to put it mildly -- a stretch. A lot of other politicians, including members of Hinckley's own party, have played a significant role as well, including passing the budgets that have led to the debt increase. Our ruling The national debt is on track to possibly double since Whitehouse took his Senate seat in January 2007, increasing by roughly $8 trillion. Hinckley said it would be "nearly $8 trillion more," and that number may be conservative. That part of his statement is true. Whitehouse, as one among 100 Senators and a member of the majority party, bears some responsibility for that increase, but not nearly as much as Hinckley is trying to imply. We rate his statement Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

abbc-00245	Unemployment is shaping up as a key issue in the Queensland election campaign. The State Opposition is keen to portray Labor as a party of economic wreckers "costing Queenslanders jobs and opportunity".	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-22/fact-check-queensland-jobs-unemployment/9152266	The LNP's claim is misleading. Although Queensland employment did indeed fall by about 30,000 in 2016 — the biggest fall for any calendar year since the current employment series started in 1978 — the LNP has ignored the surge in jobs over the past ten months, which has offset the 2016 loss more than three times over. The most recent figures also show Queensland now has the strongest annual employment growth in the nation, although as one expert pointed out, after a year of relative weakness in 2016, the state's job market has been coming off a lower base. While the unemployment rate in Queensland, at 5.9 per cent, has been slowly trending down, it remains above the national average, and only slightly below Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment. Like some other states, the unemployment rate has been higher than it otherwise might have been because of an increase in the number of people actively looking for work. And, as a second expert noted, five out of six states are grouped in a relatively narrow band of unemployment, meaning Queensland's unemployment ranking could quickly change. Furthermore, as two experts noted, state government policy is only one of several factors that influence the jobs market. Others include federal politics, international economic conditions, exchange rates and interest rates. Given these dynamics, to suggest that a state government is solely responsible for the performance of the labour market is a stretch.

pomt-13527	"Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms" using "radical regulation," by raising business tax "rates as high as nearly 50 percent" and by taxing "family farms again at death by as much as 45 percent."	false	/iowa/statements/2016/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-explains-why-hillary-clinton-wants-sh/	Inch by inch, row by row, time to see if Donald Trump's claims will grow. At a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump proclaimed that he was "going to end this war on the American farmer" and accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to shut down family farms. "Almost 97 percent of farms in this country are family owned and family managed. It’s not only a great American tradition, but a vital component of America’s economic and national security," Trump said. "Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms just like she wants to shut down the mines and the steelworkers," he continued. "She will do this not only through radical regulation, but also by raising taxes on family farms — and all businesses — to rates as high as nearly 50 percent. Adding to the pain, she will tax family farms again at death by as much as 45 percent." There are four elements here. We'll take them in order. Clinton wants to shut down family farms? There is no evidence this is true. Clinton, in fact, talks about a strong agricultural economy on her website. "A strong agricultural economy remains a critical cornerstone of a vibrant rural economy," Clinton’s website says. "Farmers and ranchers supply food for America's dinner tables, invest in farm machinery and supplies, and provide domestic energy resources that fuel small businesses. The agriculture economy also drives America's larger economic success." Her site talks about "raising agricultural production and profitability for family farms," offering "support (for) the next generation of farmers," and providing "a focused safety net for farmers and ranchers." So what's Trump talking about? His campaign declined to offer details, but based on his speech, that's where regulations, the business tax and the death tax come in. 'Radical regulation' We asked the Trump campaign for specifics about what Trump meant by "radical regulations." They declined to cite specifics, saying it's been outlined in his speeches. We searched the Congressional Quarterly database of Trump speeches since January. We found two other instances where the candidate talked about "radical regulations." Like his speech in Iowa, neither said what they were. Raising taxes as high as nearly 50 percent Trump is plowing familiar ground here claiming that Clinton would raise taxes on family farms — and all businesses — to rates as high as nearly 50 percent We rated a different version of this statement Mostly False. The Trump campaign is talking about Clinton's proposal to raise the tax rate for taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of more than $5 million. Currently, taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $5 million have a tax rate of about 43.4 percent. Clinton wants to raise the rate by 4 percentage points, to 47.4 percent. Income above $5 million would potentially be subject to the additional 4 percent tax. And to be sure, that would not affect the vast majority of people who own small businesses or family farms. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, of the 2.1 million farms in the country in 2012, only 0.3 percent of family farms were large enough to have gross cash income of $5 million or more. The vast majority -- 88 percent -- reported less than $350,000 in income. Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said, "Very few people make enough to be affected by the surtax and only a tiny fraction, if any, are traditional family farmers." 'Death' tax This is another cornfield we've visited before. The "death tax" is formally known as the estate tax, which applies to inherited assets such as cash, stock and real estate. The problem with Trump's assertion is that only the wealthiest Americans are subject to the tax and only a tiny fraction of those are farmers. The tax doesn't kick in until an individual's estate is worth $5.45 million and the 40 percent tax only applies to amounts over that limit, which is indexed for inflation. At first blush, this would seem like an area where family farms might be hit particularly hard. Given the price of land and the expensive machinery used to farm it, it would seem that even the value of a small farm would likely exceed the $5.45 exemption. But in reality, in 2013 only 16 to 24 small businesses and farm estates owed any estate taxes, and the actual tax amounted to just 4.9 percent of the estate's total value, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Many of those may actually have been businesses, not farms. Not only that, the exemption doubles for a farm owned by a couple, there is an additional $1.5 million exception for closely held family farms, and the tax code allows farms to spread their payments over 15 years at a low interest rate. That number prompted comedian Bill Maher to joke that, "More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013," a statement we rated as Mostly True. But, as we reported in 2014, there are countervailing forces at work here. For example, if you want to take advantage of the tax breaks, the property has to be held and used for farming for 10 years, and using it as collateral for a loan becomes more difficult because the IRS places a lien on the property to make sure it's used for crops or livestock. The estate tax was more of an issue for family farms years ago when the exemption was much lower. In 2001, during the Bush administration, for example, only the first $1.5 million was exempt from the tax. Now it’s $5.45 million. President Barack Obama has tried to get the exemption brought down to $3.5 million. Trump, like most Republicans, wants to eliminate the estate tax entirely. That would leave the treasury short by about $19 billion. "Note that years ago, opponents of the estate tax who asserted that families had to sell their farms to pay the estate tax were unable to find a single case where that happened," said Williams, the Tax Policy Center expert. "I expect that finding family farms that would be driven out of business by the surtax would be just as hard." Our ruling Trump said, "Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms" using "radical regulation," by raising tax "rates as high as nearly 50 percent" and through a death tax as high as 45 percent. So let's harvest the arguments. Clinton wants to shut down family farms? We've seen no evidence she's ever said that. Radical regulation? Trump's not providing any evidence to evaluate. Raising taxes to nearly 50 percent? Clinton's proposing an extra 4 percent increase, but that's on the wealthiest Americans, and very few family farms will face it. Death tax? Family farms have been surviving with the death tax for years, and the best data suggest that it affects no more than about 20 estates nationwide per year, if that. We rate this combination of claims as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/114a083e-bf90-4b4b-90b8-cd9819ef30b9	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-31T12:00:00	2016-08-27	['None']

pomt-02419	"Georgia lawmakers are now considering passing the most extreme gun bill in America."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/05/americans-responsible-solutions/gun-bill-claim-under-fire/	The Georgia House passed and sent to the state Senate last month a controversial and sweeping bill that would lift restrictions on guns in houses of worship, bars, airports and college campuses, and it would allow schools to beef up security by arming front office staff, teachers and other employees. Passions are running high for and against House Bill 875, which supporters have named the "Safe Carry Protection Act" and critics call the "guns everywhere bill." But debates about measures such as this are often filled over-heated rhetoric Among those lobbying to kill the bill is Americans for Responsible Solutions, a national group that former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, founded after her near-fatal shooting in January 2011. In a press release and Iinternet video released Feb. 26, Giffords’ group urged Georgians to appeal to the state Senate and Gov. Nathan Deal to defeat the bill. "Georgia lawmakers are now considering passing the most extreme gun bill in America," Pia Carusone, the group’s executive director, said in the release. Knowing the many and varied gun measures that exist or are proposed across the nation, could Georgia really be looking at "the most extreme gun bill in America?" We wondered. We decided to run the statement through the Truth-O-Meter. On its website, the National Rifle Association calls HB 875 by state Rep. Rick Jasperse, R-Jasper, "the most comprehensive pro-gun reform legislation introduced in recent state history." We began by circling back to Giffords’ group to explain the claim that it is the most extreme legislation out there. Carusone said her group is tracking 200 gun bills in legislatures across the country, many of which "weaken common-sense gun violence prevention policies." But none of the bills has "as many extreme provisions as we see in this one Georgia bill," she said. "Not only does the bill invite guns into virtually every public space, reversing 100-year-old regulations, it allows teachers to carry guns while teaching class and airplane passengers to attempt to bring guns through (Transportation Security Administration) security without consequence," Carusone said. "It also would allow guns to be in courthouses. State legislation typically focuses on one of these issues, not all of them." Experts we checked with said there’s no evidence that, if the bill passes, Georgia would be considered to have the most lax gun laws. Four states, Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming, don’t even require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, they said. Jasperse, the bill’s chief sponsor, said labeling his bill as the nation’s "most extreme" is a typical tactic of groups that survive on fundraising and headline-grabbing. "That’s what they are supposed to do, I guess," he said. He said the provision of the bill dealing with airports is meant to help the licensed gun owner who forgets she has her gun in her purse until she’s going through TSA screening. With proof that she has a license, she’ll be turned away but not arrested, Jasperse said. Unlicensed gun carriers will still face arrest and a misdemeanor charge, he said. Giffords’ group questions why Georgia lawmakers would ease restrictions on guns at airports, especially when Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport had the highest number of firearms intercepted by the TSA in 2013, at 111. The airport is the world’s busiest. Carusone said it is viewed as a threat to public safety based, in part, on a provision allowing people who have been convicted of threatening others with guns to become permitted concealed- carry license holders. Other groups also oppose the bill. Area religious leaders, the Georgia chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and the Georgia Gun Sense Coalition are among its opponents. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and one of several experts we contacted, said "any claim of most extreme seems very hard to defend." David Mustard, an associate professor of economics at the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business who has done research on crime, sentencing and, gun control, agreed. Carusone’s statement is "a pretty hard one to test because to do so one would need to know all the laws on all these different issues in every single state," Mustard said. We did a cursory review of bills pending in five other states, including Idaho’s campus-carry bill and didn’t see any that appeared to go far beyond the weapons-carrying laws in many of the other 49 states. One provision of HB 875 would lower the age for active duty military in Georgia to carry a concealed weapon from 21 to 18. But the majority of Georgians would still fall under the age 21 requirement, and some states, including New Hampshire and Iowa, allow residents to obtain a concealed weapons permit at 18 or younger, Vokokh said. And the provision to allow places of worship and bars to decide whether to allow licensed gun owners to bring guns into their establishments is moving to the "national norm," said David Kopel, the research director at the Independence Institute in Denver. "Part of what has motivated this initiative in churches is that there have been some very interesting and important cases where someone with a carry license has disarmed ([a person)] who entered a house of worship or organization with a distinctly Christian purpose with the intent to kill many people and commit a mass public shooting," Mustard said. "To my knowledge, there are no examples of congregants using the guns in inappropriate ways in church." State Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said none of the provisions in HB 875 "are not already law in some other states." The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in 2013 gave Georgia an 8 on a 100-point rating scale based on 30 policies on gun and ammunition regulation. That placed the state 28th in the group’s ranking, a spokeswoman said. Jasperse and others sponsored a similar bill last year that ran out of time in the state Senate. Provisions of the current bill would: Remove the requirement of fingerprinting for renewal of weapons-carry licenses, saving applicants $45. A background check is still required; Prohibit the state from creating and maintaining a database of WCL holders; Remove the restrictions on legally carrying a registered firearm in churches and bars, leaving this decision to private property owners; Llower the age to obtain a concealed weapons-carry license for self-defense from 21 to 18 for honorably discharged veterans, with specific training; Authorize a licensed gun owner to carry a weapon in a government building that is not restricted or screened by security personnel. A person will not be guilty of a violation if he or she immediately exits the building when notified of a failure to clear security. School safety zones are exempt; Allow local boards of education to authorize in writing for its personnel to have weapons in possession while in a school safety zone, school function, or school bus. People with a history of mental or emotional instability would be excluded. Jasperse said the bill addresses "those law-abiding Georgians who are rule followers and have went through our process of obtaining a license." "Always remember the segment of our society that wishes to do you and me and our families harm does not care what we write in the paper or [what] laws we create," he said. NRA spokesman Jacqueline Issacs said all provisions are in bills across the country. The viewpoint of Giffords’s group is "out of the mainstream and in line with radical gun ban supporters such as billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who incidentally is a major benefactor to this particular group." Officials with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence echo the concerns of Americans for Responsible Solutions. "Of all the bills pending right now in state legislatures, this is the most sweeping and most dangerous," said Laura Cutilletta, a staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Among her group’s specific concerns is the change allowing a person to carry a concealed weapon after being convicted of a misdemeanor for pointing a gun at another person, Cutilletta said. Brian Malte, the senior national policy director for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said Georgia’s bill is "extreme in its scope of allowing loaded, hidden guns in sensitive areas." But he said Arizona’s law also fits into the extreme category. "No permit is required [in Arizona] to carry a loaded, hidden gun in public," Malte said. "Not even a background check is required." So where does this leave us? Georgia’s bill clearly would include a large number of changes, which is a flag-raiser for gun safety advocates. But there are pitfalls to calling anything the worst, the first or, in this case, the "most extreme." The biggest being: "Can you prove it?" All we really have is Carusone’s statement that her group is following 200 bills acros the country and hasn’t seen any that have as "many extreme provisions" as Georgia’s. Supporting evidence is lacking. We rate the statement Mostly Ffalse.	None	Americans for Responsible Solutions	None	None	None	2014-03-05T00:00:00	2014-02-26	['United_States']
pomt-12525	The conservative proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act "lowers premiums by giving New York the freedom to end Obamacare’s costly and ridiculous rules."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/apr/22/club-growth/new-conservative-health-care-proposal-would-have-l/	Some conservatives want to give states the option to waive certain insurance requirements enacted under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. One waiver would allow insurers to charge people with preexisting conditions more than healthy people for the same insurance plans. Less regulation would mean lower costs for consumers, they say. But some Republicans in Congress -- even those who supported an earlier Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act -- are apprehensive about the new effort to adopt the waivers. So the Club for Growth -- an advocacy group focused on conservative economic policy and which supports a full repeal of ObamaCare -- announced a $1 million ad campaign targeting 10 House Republicans to prod them to support the health care plan. One of them is Rep. Chris Collins, the Republican from Clarence. "President Trump and House conservatives have come together with a new plan. It lowers premiums by giving New York the freedom to end Obamacare’s costly and ridiculous rules," the ad’s narrator says. "So, who’s standing in the way? Professional politicians like Congressman Chris Collins." Club for Growth did not respond to our inquiry about the ad. Collins supported the Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act before congressional leaders pulled it off the table last month. The bill was dropped after conservative Republicans in Congress said they would not vote for it without more freedom for states. The new proposal may bring those members on board, but Collins has not said publicly if he supports the plan. Like President Donald Trump, Collins ran for office promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Club for Growth should "work alongside President Trump and Congressman Collins, not against them," according to a statement from a Collins spokesman. The new plan would reportedly allow states to waive two major requirements the Affordable Care Act imposes on insurance companies. The first requirement mandates equal premiums for people with pre-existing conditions. The new proposal would allow states to waive that requirement if they establish their own high-risk pool or participate in a federal high-risk pool for people with pre-existing conditions. The second mandate requires coverage for a set of standards called essential health benefits under the federal law. Under the new proposal, insurance companies could offer stripped-down plans to individuals on the open market at a lower price, conservatives say. The Club for Growth’s claim assumes that New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a major supporter of the Affordable Care Act, would seek a waiver for either requirement. That’s not likely, though a future governor may feel differently. Is the ad right that the conservative plan would lower premiums in New York state? Coverage for pre-existing conditions Before the Affordable Care Act in 2010, federal law allowed insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. But for almost two decades New York state already had a state law offering the same kind of protections for pre-existing conditions that Obamacare provided. The state adopted what’s known as a "community rating" model of health insurance in 1993. It remains law today. The law blocks insurance companies from charging different premiums based on a pre-existing condition, age, gender, occupation, or past tobacco use in a select region. If the federal regulations are repealed or waived, New York state still has its own law. It would have to be repealed for an insurance company to charge customers differently based on a pre-existing condition. Essential health benefits The Affordable Care Act also requires health plans to provide "essential health benefits" that range from ambulance service to maternity care. "Right now we don’t have a codification on the book, per say, in state insurance law that says here are these ten essential health benefits, you have to cover them," said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Serve Society of New York. Most of the benefits are already required under state law, but some are not, Benjamin said. State law does not mandate prescription drug coverage in all insurance plans, for example. State lawmakers passed legislation in 2013 that, among other provisions, requires insurance companies to cover the federal essential health benefits. It used the Affordable Care Act to define them. That part of the state law would become unenforceable if Congress repealed and replaced the federal health care law. The state has three options to preserve those standards if Congress allows waivers to the mandate. Cuomo, or any of his successors, could choose against seeking a waiver. That would leave the requirement in place at the federal level. Second, the New York State Legislature could pass a state law to establish minimum standards for insurance plans. The state Department of Financial Services, which regulates health insurance in New York state, may also be able to set minimum requirements for insurance plans through regulatory power, Benjamin said. The essential health benefits would only be scrapped in the case of a waiver for the state or a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. An earlier Collins health care fact check In a previous PolitiFact New York article, we checked Collins' claim that in New York state "you cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person" for health insurance. We rated his claim True. New York state has barred insurance companies from pricing based on age for more than two decades. Experts say the Affordable Care Act did not impact that law, and its would-be Republican replacement would not have either. Would that lower premiums? Conservatives backing the new proposal say the waivers would lead to lower premiums. Fewer mandates on insurance companies would allow them to offer lower-priced plans. But those plans may not provide the same coverage consumers see now. "Generally speaking, I do agree with the assessment that, all other things being equal, rates would go down as a result of not requiring essential health benefits," said Dave Dillon, a fellow at the Society of Actuaries. Milliman Inc., a leading cost-analysis firm in health care, agreed in its analysis last month. "Removing certain benefits becomes an area where insurance companies can compete," the report says. "Fewer services means a lower price." But that may not be the case in New York state. The state would still mandate most of the federally-defined essential health benefits, which could provide less incentive for insurance providers to drop prices. Our ruling An ad from conservative group Club for Growth says a new plan to replace the Affordable Care Act "lowers premiums by giving New York the freedom to end Obamacare’s costly and ridiculous rules." That is literally true, but ignores that New York state already enforces most of the same insurance regulations at the state level. There’s an element of truth in its claim, but it would take major actions at the state level to become a reality. That is unlikely. So we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14437	Says Marco Rubio "skipped 18 defense votes including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/08/keep-promise-1-pac/pro-ted-cruz-pac-says-marco-rubio-skipped-18-defen/	Marco Rubio has been repeatedly attacked for missing Senate votes while campaigning for president. Now a PAC supporting Ted Cruz has zeroed in on particular missed votes that relate to defense spending. "Did you know Marco Rubio skipped 18 defense votes, including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS?" asks the narrator in an ad from Keep the Promise 1, a PAC largely funded by a New York hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer. Those are fighting words in an ongoing battle between Cruz, the Texas senator, and Rubio, the Florida senator, about defense votes. But is it accurate? Yes, Rubio skipped the votes. But this ad misleads by failing to tell the full picture. It doesn’t tell viewers that all of Rubio’s skipped votes pertain to one bill, and that Rubio voted for the overall bill, while Cruz actually voted against it. A spokeswoman said the PAC didn’t have a plan yet regarding where the ad will run, but Politico reported that it will air in Florida, where voting by mail and at early sites is already underway leading up to the March 15 primary. Defense votes The ad cites a Feb. 17 article in Breitbart, a conservative website, about Rubio skipping 18 defense votes in 2015. These votes relate to a single bill: the National Defense Authorization Act, which sets spending and policies for the Defense Department, for military construction and for security programs within the Energy Department. Eleven of the 18 skipped votes cited by Breitbart were on amendments before the bill passed. Other votes were procedural or largely after the Senate passed the bill, for example, working out differences between the two chambers or on the conference report before the bill went to President Barack Obama. Rubio’s skipped votes included amendments to revise the definition of spouse for veterans benefits, reaffirm the prohibition on torture and to improve cybersecurity. (Cruz himself skipped three of the 18 votes that Rubio missed.) The ad emphasized that one of Rubio’s missed votes was to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS. Two days before the Senate voted on the final bill, Rubio skipped a vote on an amendment to provide weapons and training for the Kurdistan Regional Government. On June 16, the Senate voted 54-45 for the amendment, but that wasn’t high enough to meet the 60 votes threshold for passage. Although Rubio skipped the vote, he was a co-sponsor of the amendment. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the original co-sponsor along with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in a statement that the goal was to arm the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces "who are a critical partner in the fight against ISIS." The Obama administration urged the Senate to reject the amendment, and Defense Secretary Ash Carter wrote a letter saying it could push the government of Iraq closer to Iran, Politico wrote. On June 18, Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill, which passed the Senate by 71-25 about a month after the bill passed the House. The ad omits that Rubio voted for the defense bill, and that Cruz voted against it. Cruz said that although the bill will "increase military readiness," he said he could not vote for the bill because he promised, "I would not vote for an NDAA that continued to allow the president to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by indefinitely detaining them without due process." The rest of Rubio’s skipped votes were after the bill passed the Senate. Obama vetoed the bill on Oct. 22 in part because it prohibited funds to close Guantanamo Bay, one of his 2008 campaign promises. But after Obama signed a two-year budget deal, he signed the defense authorization bill on Nov. 25. Is it misleading to attack Rubio for missing 18 votes when they are the same bill? "On the 18 votes, it is sort of fair, although of course not quite the same severity in terms of negligence of missing votes on 18 separate bills," said Norm Ornstein, political scientist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "But the vast majority of the votes were on important things, and it is a key bill that is right in Rubio's self-proclaimed wheelhouse, so I see it as fair game." We sent a summary of our findings to Rubio’s spokespersons and did not get a reply. Our ruling A pro-Cruz PAC said that Marco Rubio "skipped 18 defense votes, including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS." The ad is misleading because it omits that the 18 votes related to the same bill: the National Defense Authorization Act, a comprehensive defense bill. The ad also omits that Rubio voted for the overall bill, which passed the Senate. The majority of the skipped votes were amendments, while many others were procedural or related to votes after the bill passed the Senate. The ad also omits that Cruz voted against the bill.

pomt-05734	While fighting a move to toughen penalties for workplace gender discrimination, state Sen. Glenn Grothman said "he didn’t believe women belonged in the workplace" but belonged "at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/04/christine-sinicki/state-rep-christine-sinicki-says-sen-glenn-grothma/	The night Republicans voted to curtail court awards for women claiming workplace gender bias, state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) bitterly denounced the motives of a GOP senator who led the move. Sinicki charged that Sen. Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) had openly pined for a bygone "Leave it to Beaver" world of stay-at-home moms during a Senate hearing. "His words were to the effect of, he didn’t believe women belonged in the workplace," Sinicki quoted Grothman as saying. "He believed that women belonged at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies." In her speech on the Assembly floor, she pointed to Republicans, who argued the law subjected business to frivolous claims. "Well, I just wonder how many women in this room, particularly on that side of the aisle, believe that. You worked hard to be here, didn’t you? But yet you’re about to go along with the notion that women don’t belong in the workplace, and women don’t belong making as much money as men." Sinicki co-authored the 2009 bill to allow people to seek punitive damages in state court while alleging employment discrimination. So her emotion as Republicans moved to overturn that law may be understandable. But that’s a strong claim about what Grothman said. To be sure, Grothman’s unvarnished attacks on welfare benefits, affirmative action, early sex education and many other government programs have endeared him to conservatives, while inspiring liberal scorn and even a blog that tracks his utterings. And we know Grothman thinks a "war on men" -- in the form of affirmative action -- is favoring women and discouraging job prospects for males, according to his 2010 speech at a tea party rally in Washington County. But did he endorse sending women back to the kitchen? Grothman told us he never said that. So we went to the tape … or tried to anyway. Sinicki suggested we seek out archived WisconsinEye video of an exchange between her and Grothman at a March 2009 Senate committee hearing, when the Sinicki-sponsored measure moved toward becoming law. We watched it. Twice. But there was no such statement. Turns out Sinicki’s memory betrayed her. With help from her staff, we found the dust-up at an August 2007 public hearing on the matter. The bill did not advance that session, when partisan control of the Legislature was split. At the time, Democrats pointed to equity studies showing Wisconsin women’s pay badly lagging males in similar jobs. Allowing punitive damages could help level the playing field, they said. Grothman, the leading critic on the other side, argued the pay statistics were skewed by instances in which women chose to take a break from working, and therefore fall behind males who keep working. Republicans also argued existing law already made discrimination illegal. This is how the 2007 exchange went: Grothman: "In my personal experience, the reason most men make more than most women is that most men set themselves up or view themselves as breadwinners in the family. So, frequently it’s not unusual to have a guy working 50 or 60 hours a week and the gal’s working 35 or 40 hours a week. So of course the guy makes more. "So when I view these sort of bills, I kind of view them as a hatred for that sort of family, or whatever you call it. "Do you view that (sort of family) as a problem, or do you view that as maybe one of the major factors as to why the average man makes more than the average woman in this country?" Sinicki: "I’m kind of appalled at the senators’ comments, to tell you the truth." Committee chairman Sen. Spencer Coggs, D-Milwaukee: "Yeah, I hear ya." Sinicki: "Sen. Grothman, I don’t know when the last time you looked at what a typical family looks like. The typical family is not the family of the 1950, '60s or even the 1970s. A lot of families now are single mothers. Women have made great strides in this country to get good education -- you know what we even go to college now. Isn’t that amazing? Women so many times do the exact same job as men. We have woman surgeons. We have woman lawyers. We have woman legislators. Thank God I’m a legislator because (that means) I get paid the same as you! "I don’t even know how to answer that question because I know if you look at any average city block, in any average city in America, you’re going to find a large percentage of households that are headed by women, that are the breadwinners. "This is the year 2007. Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver are very difficult to find nowadays." Grothman: "My concern is this. If there is a family who elects to live like Ward and June Cleaver, that you feel it’s up to the government to stick their nose in the thing … and find a way for there to be another woman who makes more money to compensate for it. It’s kind of social engineering." That is the crux of the exchange. Before we -- and Sinicki’s staff -- reviewed the exchange, Sinicki told us her clear memory was that Grothman said at the 2007 hearing that "women were never meant to make as much money as men, they belong at home." But we found no such comment. Sinicki told us she felt Grothman’s comments implied he felt a woman’s place was not in the workplace. Grothman told us he said nothing of the kind, and that Sinicki had missed his point. Our take is that at the hearing, Grothman made clear he thinks anti-female bias is trumped up, and he decried government intervention on pay. But he made no remarks about what role women should assume in society. We asked him to elaborate on his opinions. "Women are great workers," Grothman said, noting there are five women on his staff. "I love women working." Grothman said he objects that some people are hostile to the idea of women staying home. He personally sees value in it. "It’s nice if women can stay at home with their children," he said, adding: "It’s nice if guys can support their families." Our conclusion In arguing against repeal of an anti-gender-bias bill, Sinicki summoned up her memory of comments by Grothman when the Legislature debated the original bill in 2007. She didn’t quote Grothman directly but claimed he said, in effect, that women had no business in the workplace and should be at home "cooking and cleaning and having babies." Grothman did speak up for families where the woman has chosen to stay home to raise children. But that’s a far cry from him saying the whole world should do that, and that women "belong" at home. We rate Sinicki’s statement False.	None	Christine Sinicki	None	None	None	2012-03-04T09:00:00	2012-02-21	['None']
pomt-12908	The uninsured rate in California reached "a historic low of 7.4 percent in 2016."	true	/california/statements/2017/jan/19/jerry-brown/true-californias-uninsured-rate-has-hit-historic-l/	As Republicans in Washington D.C. move ahead with plans to dismantle Obamacare, California Gov. Jerry Brown is pushing back with claims the federal health care law has boosted health coverage in the state. Brown said California’s uninsured rate is at "a historic low." "The uninsured rate in California has gone down from 17.2 percent in 2013 to a historic low of 7.4 percent in 2016." Brown made this and other statements about the law’s effect on California in a letter to GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield on Jan. 13, 2017. McCarthy had asked Brown for recommendations on changing the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. We wanted to know whether Brown’s claim about "a historic low" was accurate. We set out on a fact check. Our research Gov. Brown’s office cited data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that confirm the uninsured rates cited for 2013 and 2016. The 7.4 percent uninsured rate was reported in a survey covering January through June of 2016 by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. It represents the rate for all ages in California. The same survey cites an 8.4 percent uninsured rate for Californians under 65 years of age. The ‘all ages’ uninsured rate is slightly lower because it includes the 65 and older population, the vast majority of which has health insurance through Medicare. The governor’s office also cited several sources as evidence that California’s uninsured rate has reached "a historic low." Those include a health care almanac maintained by the California Health Care Foundation. It shows the state’s uninsured rate from 1987 to 2015 for Californians under 65, though not the rate for all ages. In 1987, it was 17.6 percent. California's uninsured rate hovered near 20 percent during the 1990s and 2000s before declining sharply in recent years as the Affordable Care Act took effect. The foundation described the state’s 2015 uninsured rate of 8.5 percent for Californians under 65 as "a historic low." Deborah Kelch, executive director of the Sacramento-based Insure the Uninsured Project, noted there are many different ways to measure California’s uninsured rate. But no matter which source is examined, she said, "I think it’s fair to say we have reached a historic low of the uninsured." In an interview, Shana Charles, faculty associate at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, also described current uninsured rates as "historic lows." Charles said there wasn’t much tracking of the state’s uninsured rate before the 1990s, adding coverage "certainly wasn’t better" in past decades. She said there’s been "a slow expansion" of health coverage over time in California and across the country since Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in the 1960s. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown claimed California’s uninsured rate in 2016 was "a historic low" at 7.4 percent. As evidence, his office pointed to the 7.4 percent uninsured rate reported in a survey covering the first half of 2016 by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. That rate is for all ages in California. When discussing this topic, many researchers cite the uninsured rate for Californians under 65, which was slightly higher at 8.4 percent. Even at that rate, it would be an historic low. Data for that rate is more widely available. A health care almanac shows the state’s uninsured rate for Californians under 65 hovered near 20 percent during the 1990s and 2000s before dropping sharply in recent years. Its records go back to 1987 when that rate was 17.6 percent. Researchers who study California’s uninsured rate say this measurement was not closely tracked before the 1980s, but said the rate was certainly not lower in past decades. No matter how you measure it, they added, the uninsured rate in California has reached an historic low. We rate Brown's claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-11806	Iran’s regime "every Friday declares war on us."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/16/sebastian-gorka/fact-check-former-white-house-aide-says-iran-every/	A former aide to President Donald Trump has become known for his strong warnings about the threats of Islamic terrorism and Iran. Sebastian Gorka, who left the White House in August, has called on Trump and Congress to withdraw the United States from the nuclear deal it made with Iran. He has said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps should be listed as a terrorist organization. And, during a speech at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on Monday, Gorka took it a step further in saying that militant groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State whose leaders are fundamentalist Sunni Muslims are less dangerous than Iran, led by fundamentalist Shiite Muslims. "The far larger threat to America is, in fact, Shia jihadism – meaning Iran, and meaning the mullahs. Not the people of Iran or Persians, but the Iranian Republican regime," Gorka said. "Why? … this is a regime which every Friday declares war on us – war and destruction. That America and Israel must be destroyed." He raised his voice to emphasize "every Friday." Do Iran’s leaders declare war on the United States "every Friday," as Gorka suggests? Trump and Iran’s supreme leader have certainly engaged in a war of words recently, with Trump calling a branch of the Iranian armed forces the leader’s "corrupt personal terror force and militia." Ayatollah Ali Khamenei jabbed back, telling local media that Trump is "foul-mouthed" and "pretends to be an idiot." But PolitiFact wondered if it’s possible that Iran has been at war with the United States. (We feel like we would’ve heard about that by now.) We reached out to Gorka by email and Twitter to ask what he meant. He doesn’t appear to elaborate on Iran’s war declarations in a video of the speech posted by the Christians United for Israel Facebook group. Gorka responded by email after this fact check was published online. "Is this meant to be a joke?" he said. "‘Death to America’ is not a declaration of war? According to your ‘experts?" he continued. "Get real experts or just stop wasting my time." ‘Death to America’ It’s possible – even likely – that Gorka was referring to Iranian officials chanting "Death to America" during Friday prayers. This isn’t the first time PolitiFact has looked into the chants of "Death to America" by Iranian officials, or the country’s views on America. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2015 claimed that Iran celebrates "Death to America Day" every year – a claim we ruled Mostly False. Gary Sick, a scholar at Columbia University’s Middle East Institute, told PolitiFact at the time that the chant "is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran." In fact, experts say some Iranians have been chanting "Death to America" in Friday prayers for decades, dating back to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979. As recently as August, the Associated Press reported that members of Iranian parliament chanted it when they voted to increase spending on the country’s ballistic missile program and the foreign operations of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. But experts say the chant isn’t meant to project the country’s intentions to physically harm Americans. Interpreting chants Foad Izadi, an assistant professor in the Faculty of World Studies at the University of Tehran, told Public Radio International in 2015 that the slogan should be interpreted as "death to American foreign policy." Iranians "have problems with the American government, not the American people," he said. Kevan Harris, assistant professor at UCLA and author of a book on Iranian politics, agreed: "To me – and I've been to the ‘revolution day’ parades in Tehran as well as the Friday prayers in University of Tehran where the main political sermoning is given – it is political theater." Harris compared it to Trump’s claims in August that he’ll unleash "fire and fury" against North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States. Harris said there are "lots of Iranian politicians" who are moderates that favor diplomacy. But often the statements that make American news headlines are from "some politician in Iran with a megaphone who is trying to outcompete his rivals by saying something scandalous." Alireza Nader, senior policy analyst for the RAND Corporation, echoed Harris’ view. "While hostile, this does not mean Iran is declaring war against the U.S. every Friday," Nader said. "The U.S. and Iran may be rivals, but there is also a history of cooperation between the two as well, including on the nuclear issue." Declaring war It’s one thing to wish ill of your political enemies. It’s another to formally declare war on another country. Harris, the UCLA professor, says Article 110 of the Iranian constitution gives the powers of war to the supreme leader’s office – which has not declared war on the U.S. "In reality, Iran's Supreme National Security Council makes decisions on foreign policy -- even Foreign Minister Zarif points this out when he's asked by journalists," Harris said. And PolitiFact couldn't find news reports of the supreme leader declaring war. Could Iran’s actions be interpreted as war? Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council, notes that Iranian money and resources are involved in battles across the region. In fact, the U.S. State Department has listed Iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism for many years. Iran, PBS reports, has backed "anti-Israel groups as well as proxies that have destabilized already devastating conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen." The country has also "continued to recruit in Afghanistan and Pakistan for Shiite militia members to fight in Syria and Iraq." But Marashi points out none of that activity means the country has declared war on the U.S. "It’s fair to point out that Iran has participated in proxy wars, like in Syria for example," Marashi said. "But frankly in that regard they’re no different than Saudi Arabia or even the United States." Our ruling Gorka said the Iranian regime "declares war" on America "every Friday." The government-sanctioned prayers on Fridays sometimes include chants of "death to America." Experts say those chants are rhetoric and not serious declarations of war. Iran has never formally declared war on the US even once, let alone on a weekly basis. We rate Gorka’s claim False.

pomt-06117	Say "in November 2010, voters overwhelmingly supported the idea of creating a (library) district."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/30/judy-shiprack-diane-mckeel/did-multnomah-county-voters-favor-library-district/	There’s a battle brewing over at Multnomah County Board of Commissioners headquarters and it has to do with our vaunted library system. Chairman Jeff Cogen wants to ask voters to renew a multiyear levy this spring; in other words, maintain the status quo. Commissioners Diane McKeel and Judy Shiprack want the county board to go further and place before voters a measure that would create a new library district, raising property taxes to pay for it. In a guest column, the two commissioners wrote that voters should get the chance to call the question on a permanent funding mechanism for county libraries: "In November 2010, voters overwhelmingly supported the idea of creating a district. It is up to the board to decide which funding mechanism will be voted on in May 2012. We believe that Multnomah County commissioners should give voters the opportunity to support a true funding solution." We think it’s worthwhile to revisit that general election, to remind readers what happened with the library in November 2010. After all, McKeel and Shiprack are using the election to support their argument that county voters are willing to pay more for a library district. The stakes are high: If the board decides to go for a ballot measure that then fails with voters, the library is even more out of luck. So, what happened in November 2010? Well, in early 2010 a library subcommittee advised the county charter review committee to put Measure 26-114 on the ballot. The measure changed the charter to allow county commissioners to go directly to voters to create a permanent library tax district, sometime in the future, without seeking taxing approval from cities. The measure by itself did not create a library district. It’s accurate to say that voter approval was overwhelming, with 72 percent of voters saying yes. But consider that proponents pitched the measure as technical in nature. Backers went out of their way to say that passage of the measure itself would not mean approval of a library district or the increase in taxes that such a district would entail. Here’s a sampling from arguments in favor of the measure: "Measure 26-114 is not a tax increase. It lets voters decide whether, in the future, a special library district can be formed – to protect and ensure library funding," wrote local librarians. "The measure asks whether the county should be able to set up a special library district sometime in the future, with voter approval. Nothing would occur without voter approval," wrote local parents of young children. "Measure 26-114 is a change to the county charter on the November ballot. It is not a tax increase," wrote local library volunteers. And, finally, here comes local resident Amy Mamdouh: "The measure is not a tax increase. It simply allows the library to have the option in the future to be protected through the creation of a special library district. It only creates the option, not the actual district. And that would require voter approval." (our emphasis) Granted, a voter opposed to the possibility -- or the idea -- of a library district probably voted against the measure. But we don’t think the opposite is true. In other words, we’re not convinced that a person voting yes necessarily supported the idea of automatically creating a library district. We turned to Portland political analyst and lobbyist Len Bergstein for help. He said the November vote, no matter how overwhelming, doesn’t say much. Seriously, how hard is it to get people to say yes to the library without any of the pain? "You have to pause and say, ‘Am I hearing what the voters are saying, or am I hearing what I want to hear they’re saying?’" he said. "That measure did not answer the question; it gave an argument to someone who’s a smart advocate, like Judy Shiprack." We also asked Dan Meek, a Portland attorney with heavy ballot measure experience, for his opinion. He finds the statement worth correcting, but not significantly misleading. "So, technically, voters did not support ‘the idea of creating a district.’ They supported the idea of allowing Multnomah County to ask voters later for permission to create a district," he said. We agree. And in fact, a poll conducted in July shows that "only 40 percent of likely voters would support a new taxing district, which would cost a typical homeowner about $48 more a year than the existing levy." (The current levy maintains a tax of 89 cents per $1,000 in assessed value; a library district would raise that tax to $1.19.) Shiprack and McKeel both argue that the phrasing in the guest column -- voting on the "idea" of a district -- is broad enough to make the statement 100 percent accurate. Multnomah County voters "are discerning, and I think they are very aware that what they voted on was the possibility of a district and that’s, I think, the same as the idea of creating a district," Shiprack said in an interview. "What I am supporting is having them come back to the polls and vote on the idea." She added, "I don’t think Commissioner McKeel and I have a Pants on Fire." We don’t think the statement merits a Pants on Fire either. But we do think the characterization of what county voters approved in November 2010 needs fuller information. It’s not fair to conflate overwhelming support for a technical change in the charter with overwhelming support for a new, and pricier, library district. For that reason, we rate the statement Half True -- partially accurate but leaving out important details, such as the exact nature of the measure. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-13396	"I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that" climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-denies-saying-global-warming-chinese-/	Amid a discussion about how to boost the U.S. economy, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said her opponent Donald Trump "thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese." "I think it’s real," she said during a Sept. 26 debate in New York. "I think science is real." Trump interrupted. "I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that," he said. Well, it turns out he did say that climate change is a "hoax" of Chinese origin — as we’ve found in previous fact-checks. On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." So Trump clearly did say, at least once, that climate change was a Chinese hoax. The subject of this 2012 tweet came up during a Jan. 18, 2016, episode of Fox & Friends. In that interview, Trump indicated the tweet was a joke. "Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax," Trump said. "A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be — received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very — you know, their standards are nothing. But they — in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business." (Emphasis added.) Trump may call the mention of China’s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word "hoax" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated a claim that climate change is a "hoax" Pants on Fire.) Here are a few examples: On Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., "Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it." On Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, "NBC News just called it the great freeze — coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?" On Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: "Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!" That same day, he tweeted, "Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense." Trump also called climate change a "hoax" on the Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends. In addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN’s New Day, "I don’t believe in climate change." Our ruling Trump said, "I did not — I did not — I do not say that. I do not say that" climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. He certainly did say it — in a tweet four years ago. While he has since described that remark as a "joke," Trump has repeatedly called climate change a "hoax" in speeches, tweets and media appearances. And he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change "is done for the benefit of China." Because he hasn’t pushed this exact theory in recent years, as far as we’ve seen, there’s a tiny grain of truth to Trump’s claim. But it’s still inaccurate. For that, we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/04109c43-9130-4b0a-8d47-1f5166741fc7	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-26T22:03:15	2016-09-26	['None']
pomt-00592	"You can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-estonians-can-file-their-taxes-five-/	One of the more unusual claims to come up at the recent economic summit in Orlando was this one from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: "You can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes." Now, we knew that 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis supposedly read books on Swedish land use planning for fun, but does Bush really spend his time studying up on tax administration policies in Estonia, a Baltic nation with roughly 1.3 million people? More importantly -- five minutes? Really? With tax compliance in the United States estimated to cost upwards of $107 billion in 2005, we knew we had to take a closer look. We started by asking aides to Bush -- who is preparing to officially announce his candidacy on June 15 -- for supporting evidence. They sent us links to two articles. In 2012, the website Business Insider called Estonia’s tax system "scarily efficient," noting that "the process takes an average of five minutes." The following year, The Economist agreed, reporting that "filing an annual tax return online, as 95% of Estonians do, takes about five minutes." We decided to go a step further and check with actual Estonians. So we contacted four journalists in Estonia who have not only written about economic policy but have filed taxes there themselves. Here’s the kicker: It turns out Bush was over-estimating how long the Estonian system takes. • "Yes, it is possible to file a tax return in Estonia online in five minutes. And probably even in three to four minutes," said Tarmo Vahter, deputy editor of the weekly newspaper Eesti Ekspress. • "If you have only one, or maybe two or three, income sources, like a salary from your main job … five minutes may be even too long," said Argo Ideon, the political and business editor at the daily newspaper Postimees AS. "I have probably used just two minutes several times." • "It took me no more than five minutes," said Sirje Rank, the foreign editor at the business newspaper Äripäev. "Just push the send button. Done." • "Of course, it depends on the person and on the variety of incomes and the complications, but in general, the tax form may be filled even in one minute," said Kaja Koovit, the head of the business desk at the daily newspaper Eesti Päevaleht. "I can confirm it based on my own experiences." Okay, okay, so it’s an awesome system. But what makes it so good? It’s because Estonian taxpayers are presented with a tax form that is pre-filled with their data. All they have to do is add in any additional factors, make sure it’s correct, and press "send." "We have a simple tax system, a very high level of accessibility to the Internet, easy and secure electronic authentication, highly developed information-technology programs and certain tax laws that help us to gather the data from third parties in order to use it for pre-filling tax returns," said Mailis Peek da Costa Figueira of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board, Estonia’s equivalent of the IRS. Those third parties that submit financial information electronically to the tax and customs board include employers, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations, said Hannes Udde, another specialist with the board. "Forty percent of taxpayers submitted their return with one click, and it took less than one minute," Udde said. If there is additional data required, such as income from abroad, self-employment income or property sales, "it may take more than five minutes, but it is still very easy and convenient," Udde said. Once the taxpayer verifies and submits the data, the tax agency double-checks the declared information. If no problems come up, refunds are typically issued within five days. If a possible error emerges, the agency emails the taxpayer for additional information to reconcile the situation, Udde said. Sounds wonderful -- maybe it’s something the United States could benefit from? Well, as it turns out, President Barack Obama proposed something much like this during his 2008 campaign. Obama said he would direct the IRS to "give taxpayers the option of a pre-filled tax form to verify, sign and return to the IRS or online. This will eliminate the need for Americans to hire expensive tax preparers and to gather information that the federal government already has on file." But a funny thing happened on the way to enactment: Crickets. PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken. Why? According to the Sunlight Foundation, "companies that prepare taxes are throwing millions at Congress to oppose making tax filing easier." The foundation writes that the companies "warn that IRS-prepared returns will cost millions to develop and will result in more filing errors and missed refunds for taxpayers. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform … calls the system ‘a money-grab by the government’ and points out the conflict of interest that arises from a tax collector like the IRS preparing taxpayers' returns." If you win the presidency, Gov. Bush, you’ll get your chance to make it happen. Our ruling Bush said "you can fill out your tax return in Estonia online in five minutes." If anything, Estonian tax filers tell us, it takes even less than that. We rate Bush’s claim True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-06-04T16:00:36	2015-06-02	['Estonia']
pomt-14724	The only budget Ted Cruz "ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/dec/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-voted-defense-cuts-rand-/	Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press. "He talks tough on some of these issues," Rubio said Dec. 13. "For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it." Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians, who typically favor less defense spending. We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president. Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposal Rubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed. Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade. Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending: "This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century," Paul wrote. "It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment." Under Paul’s proposal, defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels. Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense? So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a "cut" if defense spending would rise? "We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military," Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said. But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a "cut." "Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase)," said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut." Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said. Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a "cut." "As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut," he said. "This is misleading." Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument. "So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year," Phillips said. "The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase." Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets. "This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point," Friedman said. Our ruling Rubio said that the only budget Cruz "ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it." Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a "cut." That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth. However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13452	"If Texas were a country our economy would rank # 10...in the WORLD."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/15/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-if-texas-were-country-its-economy/	CORRECTION, 2:50 p.m., Sept. 15, 2016: After this fact check posted, readers pointed out we'd presented Texas and California GDP figures in billions of dollars when relevant figures actually reflected productivity in the trillions of dollars. We made appropriate changes. Our rating of the claim didn't change. In a tweet adorned with images of a rocket, a wind turbine, a steer, a factory and a microscope, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared: "If Texas were a country, it would have the 10th highest GDP in the world." If so, that’s gained ground. When we looked into a 2012 claim comparing productivity in Texas versus the nations of the world, Texas ranked 14th internationally. So, we decided to put Abbott’s statement to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. The fine print in Abbott’s tweet states that it's based on information from Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, and from the International Monetary Fund and Bureau of Economic Analysis. When we asked, Lauren Willis of the comptroller’s office emailed us its chart indicating that in 2015, Texas had a gross domestic product of $1.59 trillion -- placing it 10th among countries behind the U.S. ($17.95 trillion) and eight countries including Brazil ($1.77 trillion). The chart shows Texas ahead of No. 11 Canada ($1.55 trillion) as well as Korea, Russia, Australia, Spain, Mexico and four other countries. GDP, the most-used measure of national economic output, is defined as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in country. SOURCE: Email, Lauren Willis, director of communications, Office of Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Sept. 6, 2016 For our part, we found 2015 GDP figures posted in April 2016 by the International Monetary Fund matching the GDP figures in the comptroller’s chart. Willis also pointed out a World Bank breakout of GDPs by nation for 2015; the presented figures didn’t perfectly align with the comptroller’s chart, we found, though the ranking of the top 10 countries did. Willis also sent a web link to the bureau’s U.S. and state-by-state GDP figures for 2015 and previous years. From the BEA, we downloaded figures indicating that in 2015, Texas had the GDP of $1.59 trillion that Abbott relied on. Then again, more populous California had a GDP of $2.46 trillion, which would have placed the Golden State No. 6 in the world if it were a nation, nudging Texas to No. 11. We recently found too that California in 2015 had greater per-capita productivity than Texas. SOURCE: Website, "Regional Economic Accounts, Gross Domestic Product, Interactive Tables" Bureau of Economic Analysis, last updated June 14, 2016 (GDP figures downloaded Sept. 6, 2016) Our ruling Abbott said that if Texas were a country, its economy would rank 10th in the world. That’s so, figures show, if you leave out a bigger state, California. Considering California, in fairness, Texas would rank 11th in the world. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11300	"Clinton Email: We must destroy Syria for Israel"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/20/yournewswirecom/hillary-clinton/	Hillary Clinton’s emails are back in the news — the fake news, that is. A false story claims that a Clinton email shows she ordered the war in Syria in order to benefit Israel. "Clinton Email: We must destroy Syria for Israel," read the headline on Your News Wire, a hoax website. The post says it was published about a year ago, despite its re-emergence on social media. We wanted to look into the claim. The article cites a message leaked by Wikileaks from when Clinton was secretary of state. "The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming that ‘the best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad." But Clinton did not write the message in the email. The message is a 2012 forwarded document from former diplomat James P. Rubin offering guidance on handling the situation in Syria. Clinton forwarded the message to an aide, asking him to print it out. Rubin’s email to Clinton says she may not agree with his proposal, in which he argues that a more aggressive policy on Syria would eliminate the pressure on Israel to become involved, sparking a larger war in the Middle East. Clinton’s actual policy proposals called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and "safe zones" on the ground for Syrian nationals. Her stance on Syria also included more airstrikes against the Islamic State. Another piece of information that was left out of the article was the conclusion of the document.

pomt-08407	"Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/21/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-carly-fiorina-against-banning-a/	A new ad from California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer takes a broad-brush approach in painting Republican opponent Carly Fiorina as extreme. "Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons, and that's reckless and dangerous. She's for risky new oil drilling that could threaten our jobs. Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, which would devastate seniors. And she'd make abortion a crime. No wonder Fiorina is endorsed by Sarah Palin. Carly Fiorina, just too extreme for California." The Fiorina campaign blasted the ad. "We demand that she immediately remove this ad from the airwaves and apologize to Carly, and California voters, for not only this deliberate and blatant distortion of reality, but also for her refusal to have an honest and serious debate about the issues during this crucial time for our nation," said campaign manager Marty Wilson in a written statement. The Boxer campaign said they're standing by the ad. Both campaigns invited us to fact-check it. Here, we wanted to look at whether Fiorina is against banning assault weapons. Generally speaking, Fiorina supports gun rights; she says on her web site that she is "a strong proponent of protecting Americans' Second Amendment rights." She's also received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. She received an ''AQ'' rating from the group, which the NRA Political Victory Fund says means she is "a pro-gun candidate whose rating is based solely on the candidate's responses to the NRA-PVF Candidate Questionnaire and who does not have a voting record on Second Amendment issues." (Fiorina was previously the chief executive officer for Hewlett-Packard Co.; this is the first time she has sought elective office.) The Boxer campaign pointed out that Fiorina has said she opposed a measure passed under the Clinton administration that banned assault weapons for 10 years. The ban started in 1994 and expired in 2004. It has not been renewed. The Fiorina campaign acknowledges that she opposed the 1994 ban. "Fiorina agrees with opponents of the 1994 semi-automatic gun ban that various provisions of the bill outlawing guns with military appearance characteristics such as conspicuous grip, bayonet mount and a folding or telescoping stock do not make those guns any more dangerous," said campaign press secretary Andrea Saul in a statement. But the campaign said Fiorina is not taking a stand on any future bans until she sees specific legislation. We searched to see if there was any current legislation under consideration and couldn't find any. Though President Barack Obama campaigned on an assault weapons ban, it doesn't appear to be a legislative priority for his administration. Still, it seems fair to think that Fiorina would oppose a ban that was the same as the 1994 ban. The NRA said it endorses her because she "opposes re-enacting the Clinton gun and magazine ban." In ruling on the statement "Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons," we find it compelling that she opposed the 1994 ban and that the NRA said she told them she would oppose re-enacting it. Is it possible some sort of new compromise bill might win Fiorina's support? It's possible, but there's little to indicate that's likely. Based on her previous opposition and the NRA endorsement, we rate Boxer's statement Mostly True.	None	Barbara Boxer	None	None	None	2010-10-21T15:45:52	2010-10-15	['None']

"Report: Kim Jong Un killed in (President Donald) Trump’s overnight black op attack on North Korea," read the headline on a July 28, 2017, ArmyUSANews.com post. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. The story said that 17 SEAL teams struck multiple targets, and that "in three hours time, the entire military infrastructure of that country has been eliminated," according to a reporter. Kim was reportedly killed, although state media played a "death to America" speech recorded years ago, the article said. Kim Jong Un’s death has not been reported widely because this coordinated attack did not happen. The story is fake. (The photo showing a North Korean city on fire is actually a British hospital burning.) It originated on July 23 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website run by a self-described liberal troll who creates absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservative readers. A footnote on the bottom of the website said that "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." The warning is repeated in the About Us section, where a disclaimer reads, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." This isn’t the first time TheLastLineOfDefense.org has posted a story that said Kim was dead. The site posted a story on July 6 that said an American sniper had killed the North Korean leader — we ruled that claim Pants On Fire! It’s not immediately apparent why the site would post essentially the same story just a couple of weeks apart. We attempted to contact TheLastLineOfDefense.org to see if a fictional assassination of Kim Jong Un would be a regular occurrence on the site, but didn’t get a response.

pomt-13686	Says Hillary Clinton wrote, "I believe the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/01/james-woods/actor-james-woods-uses-fabricated-hillary-clinton-/	Actor James Woods took aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on Twitter, using her own words against her to suggest she would create a "nanny state." Woods tweeted an image attributing to Clinton a quote from her 1996 book, It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us, asking viewers to "Read this. Twice." "I believe the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role," the quote reads. There’s just one problem. The quote is a complete fabrication, and we’ve shown this before. In March, we fact-checked the exact same image Woods tweeted. At the time, we looked at her book on Google Books and searched for the quote both on Google and on Lexis-Nexis. We did not find the quote then, and we didn’t this time after re-doing the search. The Clinton campaign declined to comment. We found quotes from the book making the opposite point. "Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and daughters — to feed them, to sing them to sleep, to teach them to ride a bike, to encourage their talents, to help them develop spiritual lives, to make countless daily decisions that determine whom they have the potential to become," the book says on page four. The word "secondary" does not even show up in the book, our search showed. It Takes A Village has been criticized for suggesting society was responsible for parenting children, and Clinton does argue that society at large — government included — has a role in a child’s development. "But I was also blessed with caring neighbors, attentive doctors, challenging public schools, safe streets, and an economy that supported my father’s job," she wrote. "Much of my family’s good fortune was beyond my parents’ direct control, but not beyond the control of other adults whose actions affected my life." She does not say, however, that "parents have a secondary role," as Woods alleged. Paul Kengor, a professor of political science at Grove City College and a Ronald Reagan biographer, said there is a typical divide in how conservatives and liberals (such as Clinton) view child care. He said it was conceivable Clinton would support a primary role for the state due to her liberal persuasion. William Chafe, a history professor at Duke University, disagreed. He said the book's message was to uphold a community commitment to the well-being of women and children, not to shift responsibility, calling the latter a "willful misreading." What societal role is too much is for readers to decide, but the quote is fabricated. Our ruling Woods claimed that Clinton wrote that "the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role." That’s a bogus quote attributed to Clinton’s book It Takes a Village.

pomt-02393	"Most young Americans right now, they’re not covered" by health insurance.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/11/barack-obama/between-two-ferns-interview-barack-obama-says-most/	The appearance by President Barack Obama on comedian Zach Galifianakis’ faux-interview show Between Two Ferns set social media ablaze. Galifianakis’ deadpan spoof of a cable-access TV interview show had already become a magnet for Web surfers, and especially for younger Americans -- the demographic that Obama has been trying to convince to purchase insurance at the healthcare.gov website. Just hours after the presidential "interview" went live on FunnyorDie.com, the humor site became "the #1 source of referrals to HealthCare.gov ," according to a triumphal tweet by White House health care spokeswoman Tara McGuinness on March 11, 2014. Like many Americans, we watched the video and thought it was pretty funny. Most of the exchanges between Obama and Galifianakis were clearly intended to be jokes -- nothing checkable there. But we did find one snippet to put to the Truth-O-Meter -- when Obama said that "most young Americans" are not covered by health insurance. It came during the meat of Obama’s pitch for young Americans to get covered, and it struck us as wrong. Here’s the exchange: Galifianakis: "So do you go to any websites that are .com’s or .net’s, or do you mainly just stick with .gov’s?" Obama: "No, actually we go to .gov’s. Have you heard of healthcare.gov?" Galifianakis: "Here we go. (Sigh) Okay, let’s get this out of the way. What did you come here to plug?" Obama: "Well, first of all I think it’s fair to say that I wouldn’t be with you here today if I didn’t have something to plug. Have you heard of the Affordable Care Act?" Galifianakis: "Oh yeah, I heard about that, that’s the thing that doesn’t work. Why would you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?" Obama: "Healthcare.gov works great now, and millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans. And what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable health care. And most young Americans right now, they’re not covered. And the truth is that they can get coverage all for what it costs to pay your cell phone bill." Galifianakis: "Is this what they mean by ‘drones’?" For answers, we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We found an age breakdown for Americans who were not covered by health insurance at any time in 2012. (That’s the standard yardstick for determining whether someone is "uninsured."): Age range Percentage in age group not covered at any time in 2012 18 to 24 years of age 25.3 percent 25 to 34 years of age 27.4 percent All ages 15.4 percent So the description Obama offered on Between Two Ferns was way off -- the actual rate of uninsurance among both groups that could be considered "young" (but who aren’t children) is only a quarter, not "most." These percentages are very similar to those found in the most recently released Gallup poll -- 23 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds are uninsured, and a little less than 27 percent of those are age 26 to 34. (The White House did not offer any additional data when we asked.) What Obama said is "absolutely inaccurate," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Wilensky said young people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans are -- something we explored in this fact check -- but she added that most are, in fact, insured. Our ruling Obama said, "Most young Americans right now, they’re not covered" by health insurance. That’s wrong -- only about a quarter of Americans between 18 and 24 and between 25 and 34 are considered uninsured. We rate his claim False.

pomt-02567	"It still had not gotten terrible on the roads" by 2 to 3 p.m. Tuesday.	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/31/charley-english/gema-chief-wrong-about-traffic-timeline/	The response from one state official at a news conference about the chaotic aftermath to Tuesday afternoon’s traffic-snarling snowstorm astounded many in the room. "At two and three o’clock (Tuesday), it still had not gotten terrible on the roads," Georgia Emergency Management Agency director Charley English said at a midday news conference Wednesday that was aired live on several television stations. Gov. Nathan Deal, standing nearby, was asked if he agreed with English’s assessment. The governor politely said he did not. "I was on the roads about that point in time, and it was getting to be gridlocked. The interstates were already experiencing major difficulties. Side roads that people were taking to get off were experiencing difficulties," Deal said at the Wednesday news conference. "So we all have some lessons we need to learn here." The PolitiFact Georgia team, like many, thought English had misspoken. But perhaps the GEMA director had a fact-based point. We searched for some answers. The snow began to fall over the Atlanta region shortly before noon Tuesday. According to Deal, area roads were showing green on real-time traffic maps at 12:15 p.m. Tuesday, meaning traffic was moving smoothly. At 12:36 p.m., the roads were red, meaning they were snarled, the governor said in Wednesday’s news conference. One important website supports the governor’s point. At 1:25 p.m. Tuesday, the Georgia Department of Transportation’s navigator site showed nearly every interstate in metro Atlanta as red. On the streets around Perimeter Mall, where The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and many large employers are located, firetrucks had trouble getting through. The roads were jammed with vehicles moving at a tortoiselike pace. In some parts of the region, such as Gwinnett County, traffic wasn’t as treacherous, officials said. But in others, motorists and their insurance companies would likely dispute that conditions were anything less than "terrible." Between noon and 3 p.m. Tuesday, the Georgia State Patrol reported being called to 341 crashes statewide and 91 in metro Atlanta. That was many times the number that state troopers worked just two Tuesdays before -- 28 statewide and six in metro Atlanta during that same three-hour period. Sandy Springs police Capt. Steve Rose said his city’s roads were gridlocked by shortly after noon Tuesday, and police were prioritizing and only working wrecks where people were injured. And it only got worse. At 5:39 p.m. Tuesday, the state Department of Transportation tweeted that motorists should "stay off of highways as conditions continue to deteriorate overnight." By that evening, the interstate highways were completely stalled, if you could drive on them at all. We contacted GEMA’s media affairs department around noon Thursday, asking for evidence to back up English’s statement. About an hour after our call, English was backing away from his earlier remarks in a news conference aired live on CNN from the governor’s office. "I made some inaccurate and regretful comments at the press conference Wednesday," English told reporters. The director added in response to a follow-up question about road conditions, "Sure it was bad. There was terrible traffic." English also said he waited too long to alert the governor’s office that the National Weather Service had issued a winter storm warning for metro Atlanta, conceding he put Deal "in an awful position." A GEMA spokesman left us a message late Thursday saying English doesn't have any additional comments. The spokesman, Ken Davis, suggested we reference English's remarks from Thursday's news conference. Traffic maps, reports from law enforcement agencies and what we witnessed show it was pretty bad on metro Atlanta roads by midafternoon Tuesday. The conditions were worse that evening. English might have had a better argument if he’d said the road conditions Tuesday afternoon were not as "terrible" as they were by nightfall. English said Thursday his earlier comments, which were broadcast to millions of viewers, were "inaccurate." He did attempt to walk back his initial error. That is the only thing that saves him from PolitiFact Georgia’s lowest rating. We rate English’s initial statement as False.

pomt-10129	Barack Obama voted against "born alive" legislation in Illinois that was "virtually identical to the federal law."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/national-right-life-committee/2003-legislation-had-neutrality-clause/	The hot-button issue of abortion is the subject of two recent political ads and a controversy centering on Barack Obama's votes in the Illinois legislature. An independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, launched an attack ad on Obama, and the Obama campaign responded with an attack on John McCain's abortion record. For more on these dueling ads, read our story here. As the controversy around the ads played out, the National Right to Life Committee disputed some of Obama's public comments about Illinois legislation concerning infants "born alive," particularly a crucial bit of the legislation that became known as the "neutrality clause." The committee said the legislation had a neutrality clause; Obama said it didn't. Here's the background: Opponents of abortion put forward legislation in 2001, 2002 and 2003 intended to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is "born alive" and "shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law." The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions. Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care. We'll state at the outset here that Obama, along with other Democrats in the Illinois legislature, opposed the "born alive" laws every time they came up, and this is not disputed. Why he opposed the legislation has become a controversial point during the presidential campaign, however. The controversy hinges on how the two sides interpret the "neutrality clause." In 2002, two years before Obama was elected to the Senate, the U.S. Congress took up its own version of "born alive" legislation, and passed it with a so-called "neutrality clause," which said the law would not change the legal status or legal rights of anyone prior to being "born alive." Abortion rights advocates said the clause was necessary to make sure the bill would not affect current abortion laws. Obama has said as far back as 2004 that he would have supported the federal bill and that he would have supported the Illinois versions if they had had a similar neutrality clause. The laws the full Senate voted on in 2001 and 2002 did not have such a clause, but 2003 is a different story. The National Right to Life Committee says the 2003 bill did have a neutrality clause, and contends that Obama is misrepresenting the bill. David Brody of CBN News, a Christian news group, asked Obama for his response to that in August 2008. "I hate to say that people are lying, but here's a situation where folks are lying," Obama said. "I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in, fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion." Read his entire answer on the CBN Web site . We requested documentation from the Illinois State Archives about the 2003 bill and found that it did have a neutrality clause, as the National Right to Life said. The clause was added at the committee level, and those records are not available online. But we have posted the documents we received via fax from the State Archives here. The records are from the Health and Human Services Committee. They show that on March 12, 2003, the committee voted unanimously to add a neutrality clause to the "born alive" bill. Then the committee voted down the bill on a 6-4 vote. All the Democrats on the committee, including Obama, voted against the legislation, while the Republicans favored it. But there is an important caveat to add here: We don't know what the discussion was at the 2003 committee because the proceedings weren't recorded, but it seems likely that the federal neutrality clause was not considered sufficient at the state level, because the 2005 Illinois law that eventually passed included a more extensive neutrality clause than the federal legislation. Let's compare the language of the various neutrality clauses. The federal born alive legislation has passed and was the law at the time of the 2003 vote. Here's what its neutrality clause states: "Nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being ‘born alive’ as defined in this section." The 2003 amendment that was before the Illinois Senate committee said this: "Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this Section." Except for minor punctuation, the clauses are identical. But here's the neutrality clause that was included in the successful Illinois "born alive" legislation of 2005. Note that it has two additional paragraphs. "Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affirm, deny, expand, or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive, as defined in this Section." "Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affect existing federal or State law regarding abortion." "Nothing in this Section shall be construed to alter generally accepted medical standards." So the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 legislation did have a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation. But the federal neutrality clause wasn't sufficient to reassure the Illinois legislators seeking to protect abortion rights. The law that passed had additional explicit protection for existing state law and generally accepted medical standards. The bill's sponsor said in 2008 that the extra language was included to satisfy "the most zealous prochoice legislators." But the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 version of the law did include a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation, and Obama voted against it. We rule its claim True.	None	National Right to Life Committee	None	None	None	2008-10-09T00:00:00	2008-08-11	['Illinois', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-15096	"The marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/16/carly-fiorina/fiorina-says-pot-stronger-today-past/	The Republican presidential candidates sparred over many issues in the CNN debate, including the potency of pot. On drug policy, there was talk about expanded rehabilitation and prison reform to reduce the number of nonviolent prisoners. When it came to marijuana, one candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the hardest line, saying he would enforce a federal ban nationwide. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul favored allowing states like Colorado do as they please. So did former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who explained his position by acknowledging his own use. "So, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it. I'm sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people. My mom's not happy that I just did." Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina shared the view that states should decide for themselves, but she offered an important caution. "The marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago," Fiorina said. We thought it would be good to explore whether pot has become more potent since the 1970s. This is something we’ve looked at before. The main psychoactive agent in marijuana is THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC. THC levels differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years. But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent? The answer is yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time. The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period. Back in the late 1970s , the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research with the monitoring project, told us in an interview for a prior fact-check. Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007. But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn’t likely to increase, ElSohly said. For the average adult recreational or habitual user, there’s uncertainty about what rising THC levels mean. Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level. In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs. Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don’t know everything about its potential impact. Our ruling Fiorina said the marijuana kids smoke today is not what it was 40 years ago. Studies back that up. THC potency is up, with a growing fraction of seized marijuana having a concentration of 9 percent or more. There is some evidence that users smoke less when the pot is more potent, but that doesn’t detract from Fiorina’s main point. We rate this claim True.

pomt-13748	Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz "has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/25/tim-canova/tim-canova-attacks-debbie-wasserman-schultzs-recor/	A nasty-looking toxic algae bloom on Florida’s coasts has oozed into political races, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s Democratic primary. Her opponent, Tim Canova, toured the mucky scene in Stuart wearing a surgical mask. He says that Wasserman Schultz shares in the blame for the algae that extends from Lake Okeechobee to Florida coastlines on the Treasure Coast and west coast. Canova said Wasserman Schultz, who represents South Florida, has sided with the main polluters of the water that flows into the Everglades: the sugar industry. Wasserman Schultz doesn’t "want us to know that she has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry and other agribusinesses, as well as for delays in cleanups, while failing to deliver federal funds for any real solution," he said on Medium July 9. Wasserman Schultz defended her environmental record to the Sun Sentinel, concluding, "I will continue to walk the walk on fighting to restore our precious River of Grass while my opponent just continues to talk." Time for PolitiFact Florida to weigh in. Algae and Big Sugar Everybody agrees that the algae is bad for the environment and business. But they disagree on who is to blame. Pollution from fertilizer, manure and septic waste from suburbs and farms poured into Lake Okeechobee. That pollution stimulated the growth of algae, so when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released water from the lake to avoid a breach of the surrounding dike, the algae-ridden water traveled to other waters in Florida. Some politicians blame the federal government for the water release as well as its failure to raise the dike. Others blame the state of Florida for siding with the sugar industry and resisting calls to redirect water through sugar land. In Florida, Big Sugar has given generously to state and local politicians and to federal candidates, including Wasserman Schultz. "The sugar industry is completely ambidextrous as far as its ability to penetrate the Republican and Democratic camps," said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for Audubon Florida. Everglades delay vote Canova’s campaign points to Wasserman Schultz’s vote in the state Senate to delay Everglades cleanup and to votes on two farm bills while in Congress. In 2003, then state Sen. Wasserman Schultz voted to delay for seven years the requirement for sugar companies to clean up polluted discharges that had hurt the Everglades. It passed the state Senate 38-0 and the House 96-18, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law. The well-financed sugar industry fought for the delay, while environmental groups opposed it. Two days later, Wasserman Schultz changed her vote to "no" because she said she was "betrayed and misled" about the facts. The Senate passed amendments that they believed were offered by the U.S. Justice Department but had actually been written by state environmental officials. Changing a vote is ceremonial only and carries zero practical effect -- except public relations. Ryan Banfill, Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman, said that she initially supported the bill because it included a provision to buy sugar lands for filtration and was better than a 20-year-delay alternative. Sugar votes in Congress Canova’s campaign also says Wasserman Schultz supported the sugar industry because of her votes to renew the 1981 Farm Bill in 2008 and 2014. The legislation is a sweeping bill that funds an array of nutrition and agriculture programs for multiple years. So if Wasserman Schultz voted against the farm bill, she would have also voted against food stamps, assistance to food banks and economic development programs in rural areas such as providing broadband internet service. But if Wasserman Schultz had opposed the sugar portion of the bills she could have said so and she didn’t, Canova’s campaign said. The farm bill gives lucrative benefits to the sugar industry. Specifically, it gives loans to processors and limits sugar imports to the United States. The government can also buy the surplus sugar and sell it for ethanol production. These benefits amount to market controls that reduce the supply of sugar, thus making it more expensive, said Josh Sewell, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of the sugar policy. The industry disagrees with the term "subsidy." "A direct subsidy -- a check -- we do not get that," said Ryan Weston, executive vice president of the Florida Sugarcane League. But Sewell said the price controls, marketing allotments and limits on imports are all government manipulations designed to provide an economic benefit to a set group and function as subsidies. "Any governmental action that reduces the cost of doing business or increases prices beyond the normal functioning of a free market is a subsidy," he said. "In this case consumers, food manufacturers, and sugar producers outside of the United States are on the losing end." The industry argues it needs the aid to compete globally with other countries that subsidize sugar and that the aid helps save jobs. Critics, including candy companies and consumer watchdogs, argue that it drives up prices for consumers and amounts to corporate welfare. In recent years, there have been several national proposals by Democrats and Republicans to change the sugar program, but votes are rare. In June 2013, however, the House and Senate voted on sugar amendments that would have scaled back the industry’s benefits. The amendments failed in both chambers with Wasserman Schultz voting "no." Most of the Florida delegation voted against the amendment, including both of Florida’s senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat. Banfill said Wasserman Schultz voted against the amendment because she said it would keep the market stable, protect American jobs and maintain the program allowing the government to buy and then sell surplus sugar to ethanol producers. Lee, of Audubon Florida, says Wasserman Schultz isn’t alone in her support of the federal government’s sugar policy: "The same attack could be applied to virtually every member of Congress from Florida and it could be applied to virtually every member of the Legislature." Banfill pointed to other efforts by Wasserman Schultz to clean up the Everglades and her 92 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters. She has supported a clean water rule proposed by the EPA and helped get the authorization included in the budget for multiple segments of the Tamiami Trail to restore natural water flow to part of the Everglades. She is one of many cosponsors of the Central Everglades Planning Project that includes restoration projects but hasn’t received a vote yet. Those are all steps that could help the Everglades and the environment, but the sugar industry’s benefits from the government remain in place. "Yes, these positions were important and significant," Lee said. "However, these positions did not really challenge the sugar industry. On core issues for ‘big sugar’ they have her support." This is no different from every other major political leader in Florida, he added. Our ruling Canova said Wasserman Schultz "has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups." In 2003, while in the state Senate, Wasserman Schultz was part of a unanimous vote for a seven-year delay to clean up the Everglades. Canova omits that two days later she changed her vote, but the vote had no practical effect and the measure passed anyway. Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when she voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didn’t contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry. The farm bill is a sweeping bill that benefits a long list of programs -- not just sugar. Wasserman Schultz has taken other steps to support Everglades cleanup. But Canova’s point about her specific actions is largely accurate.

pomt-01182	Thirty-eight states -- Georgia not included -- have appointed, rather than elected, state school superintendents.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/dec/06/mike-dudgeon/lawmaker-target-about-superintendents/	Georgia voters have twice refused to amend the state constitution to allow for an appointed -- rather than elected -- state school superintendent. But those votes took place roughly 30 years ago (1984 and 1988), and that old idea could have new legs if state Rep. Mike Dudgeon, a Republican from Johns Creek, has his way. On the eve of last month’s general election, Dudgeon announced on Facebook that he would be pushing a similar constitutional amendment in the General Assembly session that starts in January. "This is not about who is or is not elected to the position tomorrow but about governance," he wrote on Facebook. In 38 states, the state school superintendent is appointed by either the governor or the state school board, Dudgeon said in an interview published Nov. 18. It only makes sense that Georgia would follow the other states’ lead, he said. PolitiFact decided Dudgeon’s claim merited a closer look. First, a little background about the job of state school superintendent. In Georgia, it’s an elected position paying $127,000 a year with largely administrative duties -- mainly running the state Department of Education, which has 786 employees and a $9.6 billion annual budget. The superintendent also carries out policies set by lawmakers, the governor and the members of the state Board of Education who are appointed by the governor from the state’s 14 congressional districts. Some of the more recent superintendents have made headlines, including Linda Schrenko, who went to prison for stealing federal funds, some of which she spent on a facelift; and Kathy Cox, who proposed striking the word "evolution" from the state science curriculum. Cox was back in the headlines in 2008 as a $1 million winner on the popular game show "Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader?" She promised her winnings to schools for the disabled, but creditors in a bankruptcy related to her husband’s failed home construction business had other ideas. John Barge, the current Republican superintendent, sparred with Gov. Nathan Deal over a constitutional amendment on charter schools, then ran unsuccessfully against him. Barge made a rare cross-party endorsement of Democrat Valarie Wilson, who lost this year’s superintendent’s race to Richard Woods, a Republican and retired South Georgia teacher and school administrator. Dudgeon’s proposed constitutional amendment would not affect Woods. It would require approval of two-thirds of the state House and Senate and could not go before voters until 2016, Dudgeon told PolitiFact. But do most states really have appointed state superintendents? And is Georgia really in the minority with an elected one? We reached out to the Council of Chief State School Officers and the Education Commission of the States, two groups that keep such data. Their records show 37 states with appointed superintendents and 13 states with elected superintendents, including Georgia and Wyoming. Wyoming was not counted in an ECS PowerPoint that Dudgeon relied on from earlier in the year that’s recently been updated, ECS staff told us. Wyoming is currently debating whether to move from an appointed to an elected superintendent. The outgoing superintendent there was threatened with impeachment and lawsuits and removed last year, though her duties were later reinstated by the state Supreme Court, according to news accounts. Dudgeon said Georgia’s current system, with an elected state superintendent and an appointed state school board, doesn’t make sense. "We are electing an administrator and appointing the people (the state school board) who make the policy," he said. That’s opposite the way it normally works, Dudgeon said. His constitutional amendment would change the method for selecting state school board members, though the specifics are still being developed. "My preference is that they not all be appointed by the governor," Dudgeon said. A similar constitutional amendment was filed but not pursued in the General Assembly in 2001 by Phil Gingrey, then a state senator and now a member of the U.S. House. Georgia’s local school districts were traditionally run by elected superintendents, but that changed as of 1996. The Georgia School Boards Association is on record in support of an appointed state superintendent and nonpartisan state board with one member elected from each of the state’s 14 congressional districts. Our ruling: Dudgeon’s on target with his claim that the vast majority of states have an appointed state school superintendent. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04901	Says "About 7 in 10 of Oregon’s inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/03/steve-doell/are-about-seven-10-oregons-inmates-prison-violent-/	Frankly, PolitiFact Oregon was surprised to spot a press release for a new radio campaign ad designed to set the "record straight on Oregon’s prisons laws." We didn’t know there was a need. Was there another ballot measure pending? Was somebody spreading falsehoods about prison laws? Didn’t Oregonians vote on sentencing back in 2008? What was going on? Steve Doell is a longtime advocate of crime victims and president of Crime Victims United, which helped get Measure 11 passed in 1994. This ad campaign is his latest venture, a nonprofit that he says is separate from Crime Victims and one that he said is aimed at giving people the facts about prison statistics. He wants to remind voters through the "Truth in Sentencing Project" that fewer than one in four convicted felons is sent to prison. Less than one-half of one-percent are in prison for drug possession. And this: "About 7 in 10 of Oregon’s inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses including felony assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, manslaughter, child molestation, rape, attempted murder, and murder," he writes in the press release. In the accompanying radio ad, he says two-thirds of prisoners are violent criminals. In short, Oregon’s system works, he said. Doell got his numbers from the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, which administers Oregon's felony sentencing guidelines and serves as a statistical and data clearinghouse. Off we went, with a detour stop at the Department of Corrections. According to the agency’s July 2012 inmate population profile, 9,878 of the 14,186 people in prison were there because of crimes against a person. That is 70 percent, or more than two-thirds. Hold on to the idea of a person crime. The same population profile also tells us that nearly 9,300 of those inmates are in prison for crimes one could describe as violent: Assault, homicide, rape, kidnapping, robbery, sodomy and sex abuse. That’s about 65 percent, which is about two-thirds. We caught up with Craig Prins, the criminal justice commission’s executive director, who confirms that 70 percent of inmates have committed a crime against a person -- but he wanted to make sure we understand that that doesn’t mean they are all necessarily violent criminals, on par with murderers and child molesters. For example, a drunken driver who doesn’t kill anyone is categorized as committing a crime against a person, even though no one was hurt. A drunken driver who hits and kills another person has definitely committed a crime against a person, even though there was no intent to commit homicide. For Prins there is a distinction. For Doell, there isn’t. We offer the information for readers to assess. We also have another point that readers may want to keep in mind: More non-violent offenders are being admitted into prison -- which means that the ratio of violent offenders may drop in the future. That’s because in 2008, Oregon voters approved Ballot Measure 57, which increased sentences for drug and property offenders. It was a legislative proposal drafted in response to a more punishing measure sponsored by Doell and others. Property and drug offenders sentenced under Measure 57 are expected to add 1,000 beds to the prison system over 10 years with overall bed growth closer to 2,000. Prins and others on Gov. John Kitzhaber’s Commission on Public Safety have been tasked with finding ways to improve public safety and save money. The commission is to come up with ideas for the 2013 Legislature. And while Doell insists the Truth in Sentencing Project is not in response to an outside force, it’s clear this governor wants to make changes in state prisons. A June report by the Pew Center on the States, which is providing technical help to Oregon to review numbers and tease out prison growth drivers, states that Oregon in 2011 admitted more low-risk offenders than in 2000. Also, the share of property, drug and other offenders increased from 53 percent of new admits in 2000 to 59 percent in 2011. (p.20) In other words, trends are changing and they may change more with the approval of Measure 57, which went into effect in January. Doell says the state doesn’t have the greatest record on correctly projecting bed additions. He also doesn’t think Measure 57 will change the ratio that much. "I don’t think there’s going to be a significant change, I think it could be a percentage point or points here and there," he said. We think readers should be mindful that there is a forecast and new sentencing guidelines that may change the ratio in the future, but we don’t know for sure by how much, if at all. The state would not hazard a projection other than the overall increase of 2,000 beds, of which at least 1,000 come from Measure 57. As for a ruling? It is factually correct that as of now, 70 percent of inmates are in prison for crimes against a person, and that 65 percent are in there for crimes we can see are violent in nature. That is "about seven in 10" or two-thirds. We rate the statement True.	None	Steve Doell	None	None	None	2012-08-03T16:13:46	2012-07-19	['Oregon']
pomt-02751	The new Atlanta Braves stadium will require no tax increase for homeowners and provide $3 million annually for Cobb County schools.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/16/revitalize-cobb/pro-stadium-group-paints-incomplete-picture/	If you think Cobb County should spend more money on schools, not a taxpayer-funded home for the Atlanta Braves, a pro-stadium organization wants you to think again. A glossy mailer funded by Revitalize Cobb, a nonprofit interest group, says that a new stadium will bring more education dollars. Just do the math. "9,241 New Jobs + $295,000,000 in Wages + $0 Tax Increase for Homeowners + $3,000,000 Annually for Cobb Schools = 1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents," the ad said. Put this way, bringing the Braves to Cobb does seem like a no-brainer. But we here at PolitiFact Georgia know enough to question any number we meet. We asked the Truth-O-Meter to check Revitalize Cobb’s arithmetic. PolitiFact will check Revitalize Cobb’s jobs and wages figures in an upcoming story. The additional schools money would come from a $400 million retail and entertainment district that the Braves plan to build adjacent to the stadium, a representative for the group explained in an email. The group says there will be no tax increase for homeowners because the stadium won’t cause their tax bills to rise. Both estimates are conservative, the spokesman said, especially since the money for schools does not include income from sales taxes. First, let’s consider the claim that there would be no property tax increase. It isn’t as straightforward as it might seem. Before the Braves stadium plan, property taxes were set to decrease. Cobb homeowners currently pay taxes to pay for parkland. Once this bill is paid off in 2017 and 2018, these taxes are gone. If Cobb commissioners do nothing, homeowners’ yearly tax bill would drop by about $20 for a $200,000 home. But now that the Braves stadium is in the works, to pay the county’s $300 million share of the bill, commissioners will have to vote to increase property taxes for the general fund by the amount they would have decreased. Whether this counts as a "$0 tax increase for homeowners" is debatable. In 2019, a Cobb homeowner’s tax rate may be the same as it is now, but it will be higher than it would have been if the Braves had stayed in downtown. (The county plans to exempt homeowners from a special tax it will levy for properties near the new stadium, said James Pehrson, Cobb County’s finance director. Owners of apartment buildings will pay the special tax, and experts say landlords often pass such costs on to tenants.) Now, let’s consider the claim that the Braves will bring $3 million annually for Cobb schools. These funds would come from property taxes on the Braves’ planned retail and entertainment district, which is slated to open ahead of the 2017 season. Early plans for the first phase of the project describe a pedestrian boulevard with stores, restaurants and maybe a hotel. A second phase is supposed to have residences and office space. Revitalized Cobb made its education dollars claim based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Its calculations show that under current tax rates, a $400 million property would produce some $6 million each year in additional property tax revenue. Schools would receive about $3.02 million, which is some $3 million higher than the $143,000 the land currently produces for schools. But there is no guarantee in the Braves’ agreement with Cobb that the team will invest $400 million for the entertainment district. This could pose a problem. Early visions for other mixed-use projects near sports venues have proved to be too optimistic. The proposal for Brooklyn’s Barclays Center included 4.4 million square feet of residential property, 2.1 million square feet of commercial office space and 300,000 square feet in retail space, according to a 2003 news release posted on a watchdog blog devoted to the stadium project. Developers originally said it would take 10 years to build. The state has since agreed to give them decades more to finish the project. Construction has begun on only one of the apartment towers. On the other hand, there’s San Diego. In the 1990s, the Padres’ owner guaranteed $487 million in new real estate development for the struggling neighborhood surrounding the team’s planned ballpark. It would include features specified by the city. A 2012 study found that the number of higher-income residents has increased and real estate values were more stable than those in other intown neighborhoods. But the Padres’ impact on downtown San Diego may be nothing like the Braves’ impact on Cobb. As we mentioned previously, the Braves’ investment is not guaranteed. And the Padres invested in downtown development as inner-city neighborhoods across the country are revitalizing. The Braves’ planned development does not have this advantage. Another strike against Revitalize Cobb’s claim is that even if the Braves do invest $400 million into a development, the property’s tax value may not equal that amount. The value for tax purposes could be higher or lower, depending on sales values, rents and other factors. And if the Braves build it, will they come? Game attendance might tank if the team falters. Stadium goers might pass up the entertainment district’s restaurants if they fill up on hot dogs and beer inside the stadium, said Lake Forest College professor Robert Baade, an expert on the economics of sports. What’s worse, even the Braves’ most die-hard fans might think a condo by the stadium is not their idea of Home Sweet Home. "People do not want to deal with drunken louts on game day and people walking on their lawn. Or doing worse on their lawn," Baade said. In sum, Revitalize Cobb’s statement is accurate but leaves out loads of important details that would give a reader a different impression if known. The projected $3 million increase for schools is difficult to predict and depends on many factors all lining up. The tax increase angle is more clear-cut. A homeowner’s overall 2019 property tax rate may be the same as it is now. But a reasonable person may consider the Braves deal a tax increase over the amount he or she would have paid if the team had stayed in downtown Atlanta. By PolitiFact’s definition, this amounts to a Half True.	None	Revitalize Cobb	None	None	None	2013-12-16T07:45:03	2013-11-22	['Atlanta_Braves']

pomt-09632	"Americans admire Glenn Beck more than they admire the pope."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/04/dana-milbank/milbank-says-americans-admire-glenn-beck-more-they/	Since 1948, the Gallup polling organization has been asking Americans what man and woman "that you have heard or read about, living today in any part of the world, do you admire most?" This year, the polling firm stirred up more interest -- and in some circles, horror -- than in years past. The reason: More people mentioned Glenn Beck, the conservative radio and television host, than the pope. Granted, it was close: In the final tally, Beck and Pope Benedict XVI both were named by 2 percent of respondents. But Beck earned a few more mentions than the pope -- enough, by Gallup's reckoning, to edge His Holiness by a nose. The runaway winner was President Barack Obama, with 30 percent, followed by former President George W. Bush with 4 percent and former South African President Nelson Mandela with 3 percent. Beck, on his Jan. 4, 2010, syndicated radio show, expressed mystification at the poll results and joked that they are "a sign of the apocalypse." "It is so disturbing," he said. "It's so wrong. ... When somebody phoned me up [with the news], I said, 'Shut the hell up!' ... None of it's good news for the world." Dana Milbank -- a columnist for the Washington Post who's generally considered liberal -- thought much the same about Gallup's finding. In a Jan. 3, 2010, column, Milbank analyzed Beck's role in the national discourse, concluding that while he is "more parasite than host," Beck has, "by any measure ... had a huge impact on the body politic." As his Exhibit A, Milbank cited the Gallup findings. "It's official: Americans admire Glenn Beck more than they admire the pope," Milbank wrote. "This news, at once unsettling and unsurprising, came from the Gallup polling organization on Wednesday. Beck, the new Fox News host who has said President Obama has a 'deep-seated hatred for white people' and alternately likens administration officials to Nazis and Marxists, was also more admired by Americans than Billy Graham and Bill Gates, not to mention Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. In Americans' esteem, Beck only narrowly trailed South Africa's Nelson Mandela, the man who defeated apartheid." It was a striking result, so we wondered whether Milbank was using the Gallup result accurately. Polling experts we contacted said Milbank was making too big a leap with the Beck-Pope comparison. First, some background on the poll. Gallup asks the same question at the end of each year. The 2009 version is based on telephone interviews with 1,025 adults nationwide, conducted between Dec. 11 and Dec. 13. The sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points -- far greater than the difference between Beck's number and the pope's. And that's just the beginning of the problems with comparing the two men's stature using this poll. Frank Newport, Gallup's editor in chief, said the primary problem is that the "most admired" poll is based on an open-ended question -- one in which the poll-takers asked respondents to volunteer names of the people they most admire, rather than providing them with a list of individuals to choose from. Using this poll, Newport told PolitiFact, "I think it's not accurate, for example, to say that Beck is more admired than the pope." Given the enormous universe of possible answers facing someone asked an open-ended question, even most of the individuals who crack the top 10 in the "most admired poll" account for only a percentage point or two of all the responses. That means people with a passionate base of supporters -- but also a large group of detractors -- can find themselves high on the list. And it's not clear that someone who fits this description is clearly "more admired" than someone else who is more consistently, if less passionately, admired. As it happens, other recent surveys have shown Beck with almost as many detractors as he has fans, and a sizable plurality of respondents say they don't know enough about him to have an opinion. In the September NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 24 percent had a positive opinion of Beck, 19 percent had a negative opinion and 42 percent said they didn't know or weren't sure. Meanwhile, an October Pew poll found that just 40 percent could identify Beck as a TV and radio host. A better way to compare the two men, Newport said, would be to ask respondents directly whether they admired Beck and whether they admired the pope. Such a question would capture negative sentiment as well as positive sentiment. But no one has done such a poll, he said. Offering pure speculation, Newport suggested that the pope, leader of 1 billion Catholics worldwide, would score fairly well in this sort of test. Other polling experts largely agreed that Milbank drew too glib a conclusion. Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, said that "we have to take these low rankings in the most admired poll with a grain of salt. More popular than the pope? I can’t see that." And Mark Blumenthal, who edits the Web site Pollster.com, said that "if the question posed were, 'Who do you admire more, the pope or Glenn Beck?' the results would likely be very different." Blumenthal added that he'd judge Milbank's claim "as more of a minor failure of semantics and copy editing than an effort to intentionally mislead." Because Milbank made a commonsense deduction from widely disseminated poll data, we're not going to call his claim False. But he's made a sweeping conclusion from a small amount of data. Because polling experts -- including the leader of the firm that did the poll in the first place -- believe that Milbank has drawn too sweeping a conclusion from complicated data, we're rating his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08191	"More people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the... games of the Dallas Cowboys, the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Texans and the Houston Rockets combined."	true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/25/todd-staples/todd-staples-says-any-year-more-texans-hunt-or-fis/	Seeking re-election earlier this year, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples threw a wake-'em-up line at the Austin American-Statesman's editorial board: "More people hunt and fish in Texas in a given year than attend the... games of the Dallas Cowboys, the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Texans and the Houston Rockets combined." We figured Thanksgiving (ahem, New Orleans Saints vs. Dallas Cowboys, mid-afternoon, Arlington) would be fitting for checking Staples' Aug. 31 comparison of hunting's appeal in Texas to the drawing power of several major sports franchises. Cody McGregor, Staples' campaign manager, told us via e-mail that Staples based his statement on statistics in a December 2007 report from the National Shooting Sports Foundation. He pointed us to a press release accompanying the report, which states: "More people hunt and fish in Texas than attend Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Texans and Houston Rockets games combined (2.68 million vs. 2.6 million)." And where did these figures come from? Lance Lemmonds, spokesman for the sportsmen's foundation, told us the hunting and fishing totals for Texas were drawn from a 2006 national survey for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Next, we learned from the agency's website that it commissions the survey every five years (the next one will be taken in 2011). According to the 2006 survey results, 2.64 million Texans went fishing or hunting in 2006. Lemmonds said an outside firm researched attendance totals for the four sports teams. He said he did not have additional information. That left us to search for attendance totals. And online, we found home-field attendance figures for each of the franchises for the time period on websites kept by ESPN, the sports cable TV network, and DatabaseBasketball.com, which posts many sports statistics. Anyway, the combined attendance for the franchises approached 2.6 million, a total we reached by adding up attendance for the Cowboys in 2006 (506,308), the Mavericks in 2006-07 (814,009), the Texans in 2006 (561,469) and the Rockets in 2006-07 (678,262). The basketball season extends from fall to summer, so attendance numbers for basketball franchises aren't limited to a single calendar year. This curve ball: The National Shooting Sports Foundation comparison leaves out attendance at professional baseball games. The Houston Astros drew nearly 2.8 million home fans and the Texas Rangers nearly 2.5 home fans in 2005, according to Baseball Almanac web posts. Swap in the Rangers, say, for the lowest attendance figure that we found (Cowboys, 506,308) and the four-franchise total would be about 4.5 million--far more than the Texans fishing or hunting in the state in 2006. Then again, in his first-blush response to us, McGregor of Staples' campaign counseled against taking franchise attendance figures at face value. "The game attendance numbers count a ton of season ticket holders as 'people' attending a game each time they go to a game, but really you should only count a person one time if they attend multiple games of the same franchise in order to make it apples to apples with the hunt/fish number," his e-mail said. Regardless, it looks like a few years ago the state's hunting and fishing enthusiasts exceeded the combined home turnout for the four selected sports franchises. Next, we tried to corral updated numbers to see whether the statement still held true when Staples spoke to the Statesman. We added up the home attendance figures for the latest completed seasons for each of the franchises, getting 2.78 million. Next, we contacted the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department in search of an estimate of the people who went fishing or hunting in Texas more recently than the federal survey year of 2006. Harvey said there is no post-2006 count that the agency touts. With the agency's help, though, we divined a way toward a ballpark estimate for Texans who went hunting or fishing last year. First, we determined that the number of hunting and fishing licenses sold to Texans increased 11 percent from 2006 to the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2010. We then multiplied that rate increase by the 2006 federal estimate of Texans who fished and hunted in the state (2.6 million) and added the result to the 2006 figure. Our calculation: More than 2.9 million Texans went hunting or fishing in the state last year. All told, it's risky business to stake a claim, as Staples did, on a nearly five-year-old federal survey. But more recent numbers suggest that the claim still holds true: More people hunted and fished in Texas than attended home games for the four selected Dallas and Houston sports franchises in their latest completed seasons. We rate the statement True.	None	Todd Staples	None	None	None	2010-11-25T06:00:00	2010-08-31	['Texas', 'Dallas_Cowboys', 'Houston_Texans', 'Dallas_Mavericks', 'Houston_Rockets']
pomt-11811	Says Chuck Todd said the Roy Moore story "felt completely orchestrated."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/15/steve-bannon/behind-stephen-bannons-misrepresentation-chuck-tod/	Breitbart head Steve Bannon took a Chuck Todd audio clip out of context to discredit allegations of sexual assault against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. "The more I think about this Roy Moore story the more it does feel like a total orchestrated, colluded hit between the Republican establishment, the establishment media, the Democratic party, the Washington swamp uni-party," Breitbart editor Alex Marlow said to Bannon on Breitbart News Daily, a Sirius XM radio show. Marlow’s talking about a Washington Post report that four (and now five) women said Moore inappropriately touched, kissed or tried to date them in their teens. "100 percent," Bannon agreed. "Even Chuck Todd, the swampiest creature of swamp creatures, he walked through it yesterday on Meet the Press. He said it felt completely orchestrated." To prove his point, Marlow played the following clip from the Nov. 12 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press. "Charlie Cook, is Mitch McConnell, the way he's been-- this clearly felt almost orchestrated, Todd said. "The minute, within an hour, this came out, many of the McConnell allies came out and said, 'He's got to go.' Sounds like Mitch McConnell has decided it's worse if Roy Moore wins." Marlow said that clip was "all you need to hear," and Bannon agreed, saying "You’ve got to play that 20 times now til the end of the show." But Todd wasn’t referring to the report about Moore's alleged actions when he said "it felt completely orchestrated." In fact, he never questioned the allegations. Instead, Todd was asking pundit Charlie Cook about the implications for the Republican Party. The "orchestrated" comment was in reference to the Senate Majority Leader’s condemnation of Moore a little over an hour after the report went live. "If these allegations are true, he must step aside," McConnell said to reporters on Nov. 9. Other Republican senators echoed McConnell’s sentiments that day, including Richard Shelby, Tim Scott, Rob Portman, John Cornyn, Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Steve Daines, Mike Lee, Lisa Murkowski, David Perdue, Ben Sasse and John McCain. Unlike Bannon, Cook caught Todd’s drift. "I think Mitch McConnell thinks that this is just so horrible that it's not under his control, so he's got to live with whatever happens," Cook said. "I think if the voters of Alabama, if they choose to vote for Roy Moore, I think the Senate's obliged to seat him." Our ruling Bannon said Chuck Todd said the Roy Moore story "felt completely orchestrated." But the Meet the Press clip Bannon cited showed Todd was talking about the Republican response to the Washington Post report on sexual assault allegations against Moore, not the report itself. Todd never questioned the report’s validity. We rate this statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Steve Bannon	None	None	None	2017-11-15T17:21:31	2017-11-15	['None']

pomt-10915	Says Scott Walker "has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million and he's calling that progress."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/01/mahlon-mitchell/mahlon-mitchell-has-point-mostly-misses-his-attack/	After Republican Scott Walker dubbed himself the "education governor," many Democrats, figuratively speaking, started baying for blood. To them, Walker slashed and burned school funding in 2011 with his first state budget. They are galled by the notion of "education governor," even if Walker has since been adding back funding. So, let’s sort out the Republican governor’s record on school funding. We’ll use a claim by state firefighters union president Mahlon Mitchell, one of the eight Democrats hoping to win the Aug. 14, 2018, primary to run against Walker. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. The claim Mitchell made his claim June 19, 2018, on the "Devil’s Advocates," a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. He declared that Walker "has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million, and he's calling that progress." It’s a claim Mitchell has made repeatedly, in one form or another, and one we’re likely to hear again before the primary and the Nov. 6, 2018, general election. Based on previous fact checks we’ve done, there is an element of truth in Mitchell’s claim. But he gets into trouble, partly by mixing apples and oranges in the two figures he uses. ‘Cut’ $1.6 billion -- not really a cut Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. On saying Walker cut $1.6 billion, Mitchell’s campaign cited a 2013 report by the Forward Institute, a Madison-based think tank that operated for several years. The report doesn’t state, though, that Walker made a $1.6 billion cut in education funding. Rather, it says he reduced by that amount the maximum that school districts could increase their property tax levies. The report’s author, Scott Wittkopf, who is advising the campaign of another Democrat for governor, Mike McCabe, told us Mitchell has a point but his statement reflects a common misunderstanding of the complexities of school funding. To flesh this out, here’s what we found in a 2011 fact check on a similar claim — that Walker’s 2011-’13 budget "cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion." We rated it Mostly False. The 2009-’11 state budget, the one just prior to Walker’s first budget, cut state aid to schools and slowed the growth in how much school districts could raise from property taxes. That 2009-’11 budget, approved by a Democratic governor and Democratic-run Legislature, also directed the next Legislature to reset the property tax limit in the 2011-’13 budget (Walker’s first) to what it was before it was reduced. But Walker and the Legislature, which had turned Republican, did not abide by that directive. Instead, the 2011-’13 budget imposed a lower limit on how much school districts could increase their property taxes than what the 2009-’11 budget called for. In sum, some Democrats argue that by not abiding by the 2009-’11 budget directive, school districts were prevented from levying $1.6 billion more in property taxes. But that figure assumes that all school districts levy the maximum allowed in property taxes, which never occurs. And that calculation doesn’t take into account some school districts’ ability, under Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining legislation, to save money by requiring employees to pay more for their health and pension benefits. Bottom line: The $1.6 billion refers to a limit on school districts’ ability to increase how much they collect in property tax revenue, but it is not an actual funding cut. As we found in April 2018, in a fact checking a claim by another of the Democratic candidates, Tony Evers, the actual reduction in state funding of schools over the two-year period of Walker’s 2011-’13 state was $784 million. ‘Put back’ $630 million -- no, more than that The other part of Mitchell’s claim is meant to convey that, even though Walker touts recent increases he’s made in school funding, those increases don’t come close to making up what was cut. But Mitchell gets into trouble because, while the first part of his claim refers to the ability of school districts to raise taxes, the second part of his claim refers to actual cash that the state gives to school districts. Moreover, in saying that only $630 million has been put back, Mitchell’s campaign cites only Walker’s 2017-’19 state budget, which increases state funding to schools by $639 million. It provides for an additional $200 per student in the first year and additional $204 in the second year, as Walker now touts in his re-election campaign. But that wasn’t the first time Walker has increased state funding to schools. In fact, in each budget since the 2011 budget that reduced school funding, he has increased state funds to schools. The total restored is about $1 billion. That being said, as we found in the Evers fact check, during Walker’s tenure school districts have collected about $183.6 million less in state money than they would have had funding levels remained where they were when Walker took office. Our rating Mitchell says Walker "has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million and he's calling that progress." Walker’s first state budget in 2011 did reduce by $1.6 billion the maximum amount that school districts had expected they would be allowed to increase their property tax levies. So, that was not a cut, but it did curtail how much additional money school districts could raise on their own. On actual state funding of schools, Walker did cut about $784 million with his first state budget. But he has been adding back funding with each of his subsequent budgets, to the tune of about $1 billion in total. Mitchell’s statement contains an element of truth, but mixes apples and oranges and ignores facts that would give a different impression. Our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-09529	On the new dollar coins, "'In God We Trust' is gone!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/11/chain-email/e-mail-claims-god-we-trust-removed-dollar-coins/	We're constantly reminded that falsehoods continue to ricochet around the Web long after they've been discredited. The latest example comes from a chain e-mail claiming that newly released dollar coins do not contain the words "In God We Trust". The e-mail has the standard ingredients of an Internet falsehood -- sloppy punctuation, an abundance of exclamation points, a plausible story ("I received one from the Post Office as change and I asked for a dollar bill instead"), a request to spread the e-mail far and wide ("Please send to all on your mailing list!!!") and screaming capital letters ("'IN GOD WE TRUST' IS GONE!!!") . The people forwarding the e-mail included some snarky comments such as "Don't know anything about this, but it does not surprise me. Typical of todays (sic) government." A simple Google search reveals the e-mail was debunked long ago by our friends at FactCheck.org and Snopes, a Web site dedicated to investigating Internet rumors. Judging from the comments in the latest e-mail, it appears that the bogus claim has been rekindled since President Barack Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. So we'll add our voice to the debunkers. The "new" dollars actually aren't that new. The U.S. Mint says dollar coins have been minted intermittently since 1794, and there are three in production: the presidential series, the Sacagawea Golden Dollar, and the Native American dollar. The Sacagawea Golden Dollar was first issued in 2000; the presidential series began in 2007, and the Native American coin, which features Sacagawea on the front, was released in 2009. The chain e-mail includes a picture of a hand holding a dollar coin with a picture of President George Washington, so we'll begin with that series. Each year the U.S. Mint releases new coins to honor four U.S. presidents in the order that they served. (For 2010, Presidents Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan and Lincoln are featured.) The law that authorized the coins called for the U.S. president to be on the front, the Statue of Liberty on the back, and, on the edge of the coin, the year of minting and the inscriptions "E Pluribus Unum" and "In God We Trust." The law changed in 2007 and specified that "In God We Trust" appear on the front of the coin (the "heads" side) rather than the edge. That took effect with coins minted in 2009, starting with the release of the coin honoring President William Harrison. The U.S. Mint Web site says all of the subsequent coins will follow this design. We should note, that it is possible -- though extremely rare -- to find one of the original 2007 coins without the "In God We Trust" side inscription. According to a 2007 Associated Press story, due to what the U.S. Mint called complications in the quality control process, "an unknown number" of new George Washington dollar coins were mistakenly produced without their edge inscriptions, including “In God We Trust." In a March 2007 press release, the U.S. Mint wrote that these coins were released inadvertently, and that it "understands the importance of the inscriptions 'In God We Trust' and 'E Pluribus Unum,' as well as the mint mark and year on U.S. coinage. An expert who follows coin collecting estimated more than 50,000 coins were mistakenly minted that way. But that is of 300 million of the coins produced by 2007. "In God We Trust" also appears on the front of the Native American and Sacagawea dollars. Since 2009, all of the coins in the presidential series have had "In God We Trust" inscribed on the front. The e-mail was as wrong in 2007 (except for those rare coins mistakenly minted with no inscriptions), and it is wrong in 2010. You can see "In God We Trust" on the presidential, Sacagawea and American Indian dollars. So we find the claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-02-11T17:00:20	2010-02-05	['None']

pomt-07474	George Allen voted to add $3 trillion to the federal debt, voted to raise the debt ceiling four times and voted for the No Child Left Behind Act while he was a senator.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/15/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-george-allen-voted-raise-debt-ce/	With federal budget deficits in the news, Tea Party activist and Republican Senate candidate Jamie Radtke has been painting primary opponent George Allen as a spendthrift. Allen spent one term in the Senate before being defeated by Democratic Sen. Jim Webb in 2006, who will not seek reelection next year. After Congress reached a late-night budget agreement April 8, avoiding a government shutdown, Radtke and Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate, called on Allen to state how he would have voted on the deal. Kaine said he favored the agreement; Radtke said she would have voted against it. On April 12, Allen said he would have "reluctantly voted for this small effort to reduce spending increases in order avoid a government shutdown." Hours after he made the statement, Radtke pounced. "He reluctantly voted yes to add $3 trillion to the debt, he reluctantly voted yes on the federal takeover of education called No Child Left Behind, he reluctantly voted yes to increase the debt ceiling four times, he reluctantly went along with the rest of the D.C. establishment as the federal debt went up $16,000 every second he was in office." We aren’t mind readers, so we can’t look back and determine Allen’s reluctance at any given moment. But we can tell you whether Allen really did make those votes, as Radtke claims. Let’s start with the claims on debt. The statements -- that the nation added $3 trillion in debt, or $16,000 for every second of Allen’s six-year term -- are identical to charges Radtke made in January. Though Radtke’s math was off a touch when she made the original claims, we found she actually underestimated the debt added by the budgets approved by Allen and other members of Congress during his tenure. Under the budgets approved during Allen’s term, debt climbed by $3.202 trillion. Congress sets budgets through a series of appropriations bills, and Allen supported all of the roughly four dozen bills to hit the Senate floor during his term. Allen served 2,193 days in the Senate, or 189,475,200 seconds. He voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 per second. That’s almost $497 a second more than Radtke credited to Allen. But consider this: The debt has risen by $51,856.89 a second since he left office. So Radtke’s right about the total debt. What about the debt ceiling, the limit on U.S. federal borrowing that is set by Congress? Chuck Hansen, Radtke’s director of communications, pointed us to four votes, which occurred in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006. On each occasion, according to Senate records of the votes, Allen voted to raise the debt ceiling. Virginia’s senior Senator at the time, Republican John Warner, also voted for three of the bills. Warner voted "Nay" in 2002 along with 14 other Republicans and 14 Democrats. So this part of Radtke’s statement also is valid. Let’s move to our final check: that Allen supported No Child Left Behind, former President George W. Bush’s program into install education standards in public schools across the nation. Sure enough, Allen voted for it. The legislation swept through the Senate on a bipartisan 85-10 vote. Radtke’s right again. Let’s tally all the votes together. Radtke said debt increased by $3 trillion during Allen’s Senate term, a figure equal to $16,000 per second. The actual figures were $3.202 trillion, or $16,896.68 per second. She also said Allen voted to increase the debt ceiling four times, and she’s right. John Warner voted with Allen three of those times, and most of Virginia’s House Republicans supported the the increases as well. Finally, Radtke is correct in noting that Allen supported the No Child Left Behind Act. Eighty-four other senators backed the bipartisan bill. We rate Radtke’s statement True.

pomt-14673	Boston is just 60 minutes away and it’s offering subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent than you can get in Providence while construction costs are more or less equal. As a result, the Boston skyline "is completely dominated by the cranes."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2016/jan/17/david-sweetser/superman-developer-why-he-needs-subsidies/	After another year of vacancy for the iconic downtown high-rise known as the Superman building, Providence Journal columnist Edward Fitzpatrick had a question for the owners of the building at 111 Westminster St.: Why do they think they can’t redevelop the landmark without aid from taxpayers? The building’s principal owner, David C. Sweetser, fielded the question with help from Bill Fischer, a Rhode Island lobbyist who serves as a spokesman for the Massachusetts-based company that Sweetser founded, High Rock Development LLC. A major component of their answer involved a comparison of the development environment in Boston and Providence. In his column, Fitzpatrick wrote that Sweetser, of Wellesley, Massachusetts, told him that Boston is just 60 minutes away and it’s offering subsidies to developers who can charge higher rent than developers can get in Providence while construction costs are more or less equal. As a result, Sweetser told Fitzpatrick, the Boston skyline is "completely dominated by cranes." The statement from Sweetser, who wants tens of millions in public aid, seems to suggest that Providence would see more construction if it could provide sufficient help to offset lower rents. We set out to break down the claim. Our first stop was subsidies. Is Boston giving them to developers? Fischer referred us to the Boston Redevelopment Authority. The authority’s spokesman, Nicholas Martin, confirmed that yes, Boston gives subsidies, in the form of tax relief, to certain "impactful" projects. One prominent example is the $25 million in property tax relief offered to General Electric, which is moving its headquarters to Boston from Connecticut. There are other smaller-scale examples. However, lots of projects in Boston, including many with derricks swiping the skyline, are not getting subsidies, said Martin. "I would not hesitate to say that the majority of construction that’s going on in the city of Boston is not subsidized," Martin said. (It should be noted that Sweetser never said that all, or most, Boston projects get subsidies.) The disparity between rents in Providence and Boston was next on our list. Can Boston developers, the same ones getting subsidies, charge more than developers can charge in Providence? Yes. This is well-known. Two sources that Fischer provided highlight the disparity. Researchers at Transwestern recently calculated average rent per square foot for Boston’s "Class A" office space at $52. Transwestern is a global real estate services company that provides research on office space for Boston and New York, but not Providence. A 2015 analysis by MG Commercial, which sells and leases commercial real estate in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts, says Class-A office space in Providence ranges from $25 to $32 per square foot. CBRE is another worldwide firm that provides real estate services, including market research for both Boston and Providence. CBRE’s market outlook for 2015 showed Class-A office space in Boston ranging from $53 per square foot to almost $63 while asking rents for Class-A properties in Providence were about $31 per square foot. Now we needed to check on construction costs. We reached out to Gilbane Building Co. an international construction company based in Providence. At our request, the construction firm’s Rhode Island team leader, John Sinnott, analyzed construction cost data from the MS Means City Cost Index, a standard industry tool. "While there is a slight overall difference in costs between Boston and Providence — when it comes to larger more complex projects costs are roughly the same," said Sinnott. A rehab of the Superman building would be in the larger, more complex category. We were finally near the end, the part about cranes "dominating the skyline." There are so many that the Boston Business Journal has a "Crane Watch" graphic on its web site. The current graphic lists more than 85. Our ruling When he was asked why he needs public aid to do something with the Superman building, Sweetser pointed to the boom in Boston and cited a number of factors for it: Boston’s higher rents, comparable construction costs and subsidies. As a result, the Boston skyline is "completely dominated by cranes," Sweetser said. Because Sweetser wants subsidies and says he can’t begin work on the old Industrial National Bank Building without them, it’s hard not to focus on subsidies when thinking about the two cities, even though many projects in Boston aren’t getting them. He could have said more simply: Boston’s skyline is filled with cranes because its economy is booming. As a result, Boston rents, a reliable economic indicator, are appreciably higher than those in Providence. The Boston real estate market is responding to that demand with lots of new construction. We rate his claim as True.	None	David Sweetser	None	None	None	2016-01-17T00:00:00	2016-01-03	['Boston']
pomt-09603	"The Trans-Texas Corridor is dead."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/18/rick-perry/perry-campaign-says-blog-trans-texas-corridor-dead/	Eight years after Gov. Rick Perry proudly introduced his plan for the future of transportation in Texas, his campaign declared that vision null and void in a blog post during the Republican gubernatorial debate Thursday night. "The Trans-Texas Corridor is dead," said the post, which was entered at 7:26 p.m. The TTC -- unveiled in January 2002 as an approximately $200 billion plan for 4,000 miles of toll roads, rail lines and utility lines criss-crossing Texas in bundles -- has become an issue in the GOP primary contest between Perry, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Debra Medina, a businesswoman from Wharton. Hutchison has released online ads alleging that the controversial initiative, which drew the wrath of Perry opponents and some allies, is alive and well. One of the most vocal critics of the corridor idea was the Texas Farm Bureau, because it would have required the state to acquire a considerable amount of farmland. We decided to investigate the health of the Trans-Texas Corridor. The Texas Department of Transportation pronounced the TTC dead, in concept and in name, in January 2009. But some remnants of the project are still on the books. For one, the Trans-Texas Corridor concept remains in the state’s Transportation Code and other official documents, which Hutchison says is evidence that the project endures. An attempt to remove those references failed during the 2009 legislative session with the death of a measure regulating the Texas Department of Transportation. As for the road projects that were envisioned under TTC, only two were still kicking after January 2009: the centerpiece, a tollway twin to the Interstate 35 corridor that would run from Dallas to San Antonio, and Interstate 69 between the Rio Grande Valley and Texarkana. But the I-35 twin was buried in October 2009 when a state environmental study of several years’ duration concluded with a "no-build" recommendation. The only vestige of that plan is the 49 northernmost miles of the Texas 130 tollway, which skirts the Austin area’s eastern edge from Georgetown to Mustang Ridge, and another 40 miles south from there to Seguin that are under construction by a private consortium. However, that project was under way before Perry proposed the TTC. The I-69 project lives on and is currently in the planning stages. However, two years earlier, in 2007, the Legislature dealt a major blow to one of the main tenets of the TTC — for the state to issue long-term leases to private companies to build and operate toll roads — by placing a moratorium on new public-private toll road partnerships, with several exceptions. That moratorium in effect became permanent last year when the Legislature failed to extend the authority for such leases beyond Sept. 1, 2009. The roads in the corridor plan technically could be built without public-private partnerships, but the state doesn’t have the money to do so. In any case, rural opposition to building any sort of twin roads to interstates was at the heart of the plan’s collapse. The I-69 initiative was one of the exceptions to the moratorium, but only a section of the approximately 600-mile road, the piece south of Refugio, can be a public-private partnership. And Chris Lippincott, a TxDOT spokesman, said that the decisions about exactly where the road will go and whether it will be tolled have not yet been made. The Texas Transportation Commission ordered that the road be laid down over existing highways, with free frontage roads alongside, except in areas where there is not an existing highway. This is much different from the original Perry concept of entire new road, rail and utility corridors. Texas still has a long-term transportation plan, but it’s not the TTC. In a January 2009 statement describing the changes being made to TTC, Amadeo Saenz, executive director of TxDOT, said that the new plan would be called Innovative Connectivity in Texas/Vision 2009 and that any projects that had existed under TTC, such as an I-35 twin, would be developed individually, if they happened at all. Summing up: We found that some language in the state Transportation Code and the much-altered highway I-69 project survive from Perry’s original TTC vision. But its centerpiece paralleling I-35 is truly dead, and beyond that, the corridor plan retains only a faint statutory pulse. We rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-02735	Says Marco Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his own family.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/18/charlie-crist/marco-rubio-endorsed-obamacare-his-family-charlie-/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat and a 2014 candidate for governor, wrote an op-ed thanking U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a one-time Senate race opponent of his. Sound nice? It isn’t. It’s a thinly veiled dig at Rubio. "Senator Marco Rubio’s endorsement of Obamacare for his own family should end the rhetoric coming from Governor Rick Scott and other tea party groups," Crist wrote, adding, "The rollout of the Affordable Health Care Act has clearly been flawed, but that doesn’t mean that our work towards affordable health care should end. It should continue." We wanted to sort through the rhetoric and clarify Rubio’s stance on President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. First things first: Rubio did purchase insurance for his family on the Washington marketplace. Rubio and others are signing up for insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces to comply with the law’s individual mandate. Federal lawmakers will stop getting government-provided coverage. Instead, they’ll purchase insurance alongside small businesses and the uninsured. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced that rule in an amendment to the law so that legislators would see firsthand what average Americans would experience on the marketplaces. Federal legislators make up the only group of people to get kicked off employer-provided insurance. When they sign up on the marketplaces, they’ll get a subsidy that covers up to 75 percent of their premium costs. That subsidy they get is similar to the deal many Americans get through employer-provided benefits. Some of Rubio’s fellow Republicans have refused the federal subsidy, or refused insurance on the marketplaces altogether in favor of choosing a policy directly through a private insurer. Crist is highlighting that Rubio didn’t do the same. But does taking the subsidy mean Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family? Crist’s spokesman offered us one Merriam-Webster definition of "endorse" to support his point: "to publicly say that you like or use (a product or service) in exchange for money." But there’s another definition that applies here, one that’s at least equally common: "to publicly or officially say that you support or approve of (someone or something)." Rubio is publicly saying he’s using a product, but it’s not quite right to say it’s in exchange for money. The money is awarded to any U.S. legislator who buys insurance on the exchanges, whether or not they make that decision public. He’s getting the money because that’s what the law stipulates, not because he’s promoting Obamacare. And that second definition of "endorse" rings false. Rubio has been vocal in his criticism of Obamacare, as Crist’s column itself acknowledges. "Senator Rubio is following the law, even though he opposes it," said Brooke Sammon, Rubio’s spokeswoman, after the senator enrolled in Obamacare. Rubio has even called the individual mandate a "disaster," and pushed for getting the entire law repealed and replaced. In response to Crist’s column, Rubio said Monday, "I don’t endorse Obamacare. I much rather would have a vibrant private market where individuals like myself and others can buy health insurance from any company that will sell it to us." It is worth repeating the Miami Herald’s observation, though, that when Rubio served as Florida House speaker while Crist was governor, Rubio pushed to open an exchange that would help small businesses offer insurance. So he’s supported that sort of concept before, even if he emphatically doesn’t support something similar on the federal level. Our ruling Crist said Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family. He did sign up for insurance on the Washington marketplace, but we think calling that an endorsement is too strong. Rubio certainly doesn’t support Obamacare, and has pushed for its repeal. He’s signed up through the marketplace simply to abide by the law. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2013-12-18T16:55:50	2013-12-13	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-15165	"To vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram."	true	/texas/statements/2015/aug/26/sid-miller/sid-miller-says-voters-mexico-must-have-tamper-pro/	Texan Sid Miller, who's lately gotten attention for an online post about dropping a nuclear bomb in the Middle East, drew our gaze with a closer-to-home meme defending the Texas voter identification law under court challenge that requires voters at the polls to present government-issued photo identification. The meme placed on Miller’s Facebook page Aug. 16, 2015, shows what looks like a voter registration card issued by Mexico under this text: "To vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram." The meme goes on to say all citizens must enroll and show proof of birth or citizenship and must personally fetch their voting credential. Above the meme, Miller commented: "The federal government and the courts are fighting to overturn Texas’ voter ID laws saying they are racist. Voter ID laws seem to be working well in Mexico and they worked well in Texas. Our elections should be free from fraud and abuse. The people of Texas deserve no less." Sid Miller posted this meme on his Facebook page Aug. 16, 2015. Miller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, piped up after a federal appeals panel directed a U.S. district judge to reconsider plaintiff claims that the Texas ID mandate, passed into law in 2011, was crafted by the Republican-majority Legislature with a discriminatory purpose. The three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also affirmed the district judge’s finding that the law’s discriminatory effects violate a U.S. Voting Rights Act provision barring voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, skin color and ethnicity. The panel directed the judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi, to consider an "appropriate remedy." A previous fact check It wasn’t news to us that Mexico’s government issues voter IDs featuring each voter’s photo and personal information. In checking a 2011 claim about birth certificates in Mexico, we noted that then-state Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, brought one of the voter cards from Mexico to an interview on "Capital Tonight," a weeknight news show produced by Time Warner Cable News. Berman said then: "If you don’t have this card in Mexico, you don’t vote." The legislator, who died in 2015, added that each card has a photo, fingerprint and "your life’s history." By telephone, Todd Smith, a political consultant to Miller, told us Miller, a former Texas House member, had seen the photo ID brandished by Berman. Government spells out ID requirement We checked information posted online by Mexico's government. To vote in Mexico, according to Mexico’s National Electoral Institute, adult citizens must apply to the "Electoral Roll" by personally submitting an official form that includes their signature, fingerprint and photograph to a field office of the Federal Electoral Registry. There’s an office in every electoral district. There are some exceptions, such as for citizens who physically can’t go to the offices. For about two decades, the institute has issued free "photo-voting cards" — "an essential document to exercise the right to vote," according to the site. They include the owner’s address, electoral district, full name, age and ID number. Mexico experts concur By email, Kenneth Greene, a University of Texas associate professor of government, told us Miller was correct in that "Mexico has an excellent voter registration system that was created to overcome decades of fraud (i.e., multiple votes, voting by dead people)." Greene cautioned, though, it would be a mistake to compare Mexico’s history of fraud with the 31 credible incidents of U.S. voter fraud that could have been headed off with photo ID from 2000 through 2014 — in a period more than 1 billion ballots were cast in primary and general elections. That tally was detailed in August 2014 by Justin Levitt, a Loyola University election-law expert, for The Washington Post’s Wonkblog. Also by email, Eric Olson of the Latin American program at the Washington, D.C.-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said: "Historically there has been so much electoral fraud in Mexico (not by immigrants but by the long-ruling governing party PRI) that Mexico undertook a major electoral reform in 1996 that included the creation of an electoral ID card that has become a default national ID card." Olson said the card hasn’t ended voter fraud, "but it’s much more difficult." Mindful of Miller’s mention of a hologram and thumbprint on each card, we checked the institute’s website, which says the front of each card has a hologram that changes color depending on the angle of light. The hologram is imprinted with the institute’s name, the agency says, and the agency’s initials, "INE." Also there: an element that enables the ID to be verified by a radio frequency, the agency says. We looked at a sample voter card on the website which showed on its back the voter’s signature and what looked to us like a thumbprint: SOURCE: Web page, "Modelo Actual de Credencial para Votar," Mexico National Electoral Institute (accessed Aug. 24, 2015) Meantime, Olson put us in touch with Carlos Heredia, an associate professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City. By email, Heredia responded with a copy of his voter ID and advised that the card "does include a thumbprint (back side) and hologram of the voter's picture (front side)." A six-day delay in 1988 Next, we looked briefly at how the ID cards came to be. Blame Mexico’s disputed 1988 presidential election, which was won by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the nominee of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Against two foes, Salinas drew a record-low 48.8 percent of the vote. But after the results weren’t announced until six days after the election day, a reform push flowered, culminating in the birth of the electoral institute, which was handed the duty of creating a "fraud-proof" voter ID card that would show each voter’s photograph, Vikram K. Chand said in his 2001 book, "Mexico’s Political Awakening." Chand said the government had "lamely ascribed" the six-day lag "to computer crashes, heavy voter turnout, and even ‘atmospheric conditions.’" In 1994, Chand wrote, the institute’s director revealed the government in 1988 had suspended the vote count amid panic about early returns suggesting a non-PRI hopeful, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas of the National Democratic Front, was ahead. In the end, Cárdenas carried Mexico City and four states, placing second. By phone, Christopher Wilson, a Wilson Center expert on Mexico, told us that through the 1990s, the institute was strengthened to give more legitimacy to national elections. Now "there are a lot of issues about the legitimacy of the electoral process in Mexico," Wilson said. But "none are focused on the legitimacy of the physical process of voting itself, the identification of the voters, the getting of voters" or "the immediate counting of votes." Our ruling Miller said: "To vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram." Mexico has required secure photo IDs at the polls for nearly 20 years. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-10662	Huckabee "granted 1,033 pardons and commutations . . . more clemencies than the previous three governors combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/28/mitt-romney/yes-huckabee-pardoned-many/	In a TV ad, Mitt Romney tries to portray Mike Huckabee as soft on crime because Huckabee "granted 1,033 pardons and commutations." The ad says Huckabee's number is "more clemencies than the previous three governors combined" and says that Romney himself has not issued any pardons. We find Romney is accurately describing Huckabee's record. The 1,033 total for Huckabee's 10 years in office comes from an Associated Press examination of Huckabee's pardons and commutations. The Arkansas Secretary of State's office told PolitiFact the count was 1,058, which is not significantly different. Romney's claim that Huckabee granted more clemencies "than the previous three governors combined" also is correct according to the totals from the Secretary of State. State officials in Massachusetts confirm Romney's record. He had about 150 applications for pardons and 80 applications for commuting sentences in his four-year term. He granted none. The result is a striking difference: Huckabee has granted more than 1,000, while Romney hasn't granted any (although he has said he would consider pardoning White House aide Scooter Libby because the case involved an overzealous prosecutor). Huckabee, a Baptist minister, says he was trying to give a second chance to people who had been convicted of minor crimes. "A lot of (the pardons) that I gave were for 35-year-old single moms with kids who wanted to get a job anywhere in a nursing home emptying a bed pan, but because of the background check couldn't because when they were 18 they'd written a hot check," he said in a Dec. 19 interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Huckabee even pardoned Keith Richards, a guitarist for the Rolling Stones who had an outstanding ticket for reckless driving. By contrast, Romney has a zero-tolerance approach. "I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury," he said during a June 2007 debate. When he was asked about his policy in December 2006, Romney replied "We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity." He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process. In interviews, Huckabee has portrayed Romney as a political opportunist who took a hard line on pardons to appear tough on crime, while Huckabee's pardons were politically risky but better for the people of Arkansas. "Now, if I'd played politics with all those people, I wouldn't have ever granted one single clemency, not one," Huckabee said on MSNBC. "But this shouldn't be about playing politics with people's lives. It ought to be about looking at every case with honesty, making decisions. And, yes, sometimes they don't turn out so brilliantly. I've made mistakes. But I've tried to make the mistake on the ledger of thinking what would be in the best interest of all of us. Do I want this person unemployed for the rest of their life?"

pomt-09088	The national debt "has gone up by $1,729,000,000 during the Isner v. Mahut match."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/24/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-estimates-debt-growth-during-maratho/	The mind-bogglingly long Wimbledon tennis match between John Isner of the United States and Nicolas Mahut of France finally ended on June 24, 2010, after 11 hours and 5 minutes. Isner prevailed 70-68 in the fifth set. Leave it to Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla. -- who represents a Sarasota-area district not far from Isner's Tampa home -- to turn this sports oddity into a political point. Not long after Isner finally won, Buchanan tweeted, "Think Wimbledon tickets are expensive? Our National Debt has gone up by $1,729,000,000 during the Isner v. Mahut match." We couldn't resist checking his math. We first decided that what Buchanan meant by "during the Isner v. Mahut match" was the time between the first serve on June 22, 2010, and the final point on June 24, 2010. That was roughly 48 hours, or two days. One way to look at it is to use the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the president's budget, which was released in March. This predicts a $1.368 trillion deficit for 2010. If you divide this by 365 days, you get an incremental, daily addition to the debt of $3.748 billion. Over two days, the total is $7.496 billion. That's more than four times of Buchanan's estimate. Another way is to turn to the historical tables for federal debt published by the Office of Management and Budget. These tables list the federal debt as it stands every year on Dec. 31. We took the debt estimate for the end of 2010 ($13.787 trillion) and subtracted the debt as it stood at the end of 2009 ($11.876 trillion) to determine the amount of debt increase over the course of 2010 ($1.911 trillion). Dividing by 365, you get a daily debt increase of $5.234 billion, or $10.470 billion over two days. That's about six times more than what Buchanan had said. Why so different? We contacted Buchanan's office and an aide clarified that what they'd actually meant in the tweet was how much the debt had risen during the 11-hour, 5-minute match itself. (The match was suspended for darkness twice and there were delays on the third day to give extra rest time.) So, using our first method, the 11-hour debt increase works out to $1.718 billion, while using the second, it's about $2.4 billion. Of these two, the first is spot-on. Since the size of the federal debt is a moving target, and since economists periodically re-evaluate its size, we'll grant Buchanan leeway here. While we think the wording of his tweet suggests the full, 48-hour period, his 11-hour number strikes us as a reasonable estimate. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-02602	Under President Barack Obama, "We’ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/26/ted-cruz/labor-force-participation-its-lowest-point-1978-sa/	President Barack Obama’s upcoming State of the Union address gave Republicans and Democrats on the Sunday news shows another chance to make their case about the country’s economic performance over the past five years. On Fox News Sunday, Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer pointed out the country has added 8 million jobs since the health care law passed in March 2010. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, offered a different take on the state of the labor force on Face the Nation. "Why are jobs and economic growth so dismal?" he asked. "We’ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978. And if President Obama wants to give an honest, candid State of the Union address this week, he’ll address the fact that his economic policies are not working." It's difficult to say how Obama's policies are causing the economy to stall or succeed, but we can examine Cruz's specific claim about labor force participation. Cruz, whose press office did not respond to our request for comment, is correctly breaking down data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The "labor force participation rate" is another measurement of the health of the labor market. The unemployment rate is the number of people who are not working as a percent of the labor force. There are multiple lenses through which to view jobs data. Another measure, the labor force participation rate, refers to the percentage of Americans who are considered to be in the labor force as a part of the overall population. To be counted in the labor force, someone must be working or actively looking for work. In December (and also October), the labor force participation rate was 62.8 percent. In January and March of 1978, it was also 62.8 percent. We know what you’re thinking: Cool numbers, PolitiFact, but what do they mean? Take a look at the trend. The labor force participation rate had been increasing since 1948, the first year the labor force participation rate was calculated. Then, it was 58.6 percent. It peaked in the late 1990s and 2000 to just more than 67 percent, before more recently hitting its lowest point in 36 years. It’s fallen 2.9 percentage points since Obama’s first month on the job in January 2009. What’s happening is the subject of an ongoing debate. There is understandable concern about the country’s long-term unemployed and discouraged workers. The economic recovery from the 2007-09 recession has been slow, which may have propelled people to go back to school, stay at home with their kids or give up on a search altogether when they could not find jobs in their field. Still, many economists attribute at least a portion of the drop to an unsurprising reason: the retirement of baby boomers, which does not exactly qualify as an American horror story. "The trick is to determine how much of the drop represents the impact of a lagging economy, which is worrisome, and how much is due to non-worrisome factors, such as the aging of the adult population," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, in a 2013 PolitiFact interview. There’s no reason to believe things will change anytime soon. The labor force will become older, slowly add workers as the overall population grows and become more racially diverse in the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS researchers say the labor force participation rate will continue to slowly fall until hitting 61.6 percent in 2022 -- a projected decline of 1.2 percentage points since December 2013. The past decade saw a much more dramatic drop, declining 3.6 percentage points since December 2003. Our ruling Cruz said, "We’ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978." We’re pretty confident Obama isn’t asking Cruz for State of the Union talking points, and he’s especially not interested in one that may suggest today’s economic policies aren’t working. Cruz has his statistics right. But we’ll note at least part of the trend has been years in the making and appears strongly tied to the inevitable aging of the baby boomer population. In other words, it’s not all Obama’s fault, and it’s not going to change the minute he leaves office. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-06066	"[If] you apply for a job, the chances are 1 in 7 that you are going to be denied that job unfairly if everybody is forced to use E-Verify."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/10/thomas-sgouros-jr/columnist-thomas-sgouros-jr-says-federal-e-verify-/	The panelists on the Dec. 30 edition of Rhode Island PBS's "A Lively Experiment" were reviewing 2011 when the topic of Gov. Lincoln Chafee's first year in office came up. It's an only-in-Rhode-Island phenomenon, said Thomas Sgouros Jr., a columnist with GoLocalProv.com. "We can have a governor who is sensible, apolitical and owes nothing to nobody and he gets completely trashed by the very same people who say, 'You know, we need a governor who is apolitical, sensible and owes nothing to nobody.'" As an example, he cited Chafee's decision in January 2011 to stop requiring the state and companies doing business with the state to use the federal E-Verify system to make sure potential employees are not in the United States illegally. Sgouros defended Chafee’s decision: "Well, E-Verify is a system that, when it is tested, comes back with something between 10 and 15 percent of people that are false negatives. Right? So [if] you apply for a job, the chances are 1 in 7 that you are going to be denied that job unfairly if everybody is forced to use E-Verify. Now that seems to me like a system worth punting, and Linc Chafee agrees with me, and I applaud him for doing it, but he gets trashed for it." We had heard criticism that E-Verify has had problems with accuracy, but we wondered if it is really wrong so often. PolitiFact Georgia addressed the overall accuracy of E-Verify on Feb. 23, 2011, when the system was being criticized for, among other things, incorrectly giving the green light to people who were in the country illegally. That claim got a Half True. But Sgouros is making a different assertion -- that 10 percent to 15 percent of those looking for work will be initially rejected by the system. That's what we'll examine here. First, a little background. Checking the status of a potential employee through E-Verify involves having a newly hired worker fill out a form that asks basic information and show one or more documents to prove his or her identity. The employer then goes on line and sends the information to E-Verify. E-Verify usually responds with notification that the worker is allowed to hold a job in the United States. The rest are given a "temporary nonconfirmation" designation, which means there's a problem or discrepancy that must be corrected. Although Sgouros said these are the false negatives he was talking about, they're not necessarily false. Some may be "true" negatives because they're not actually authorized to work. How big is each category? From 2004 through early 2007, the rate of temporary nonconfirmations had been about 8 percent. But by December 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office was reporting that the rate had shrunk to 2.6 percent, far from the 10 percent to 15 percent Sgouros reported. Among those nonconfirmations, only 0.3 percent were found to be clearly false negatives. An independent assessment by the social science research firm Westat, commissioned by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, found that in 2008, 4.7 percent of workers were rejected by the system. But 99.3 percent of the people who should have been approved by the system right away actually were. And in June of 2011, the immigration agency reported that the rate of nonconfirmation during the 2010 fiscal year had dropped even further, from 2.6 percent down to 1.7 percent, or 1 in 59, again a far cry from 1 in 7. When we asked Sgouros for his evidence, he sent us two documents. One was written in 2008 by an official at Intel Corp. who reported that 143 of the 1,363 hiring inquiries it made to E-Verify incorrectly warned that the employee might not be legally eligible to work there. The report pegs that as a rejection rate of 12.21 percent. It's not. It's actually 10.49 percent. The other was Congressional testimony from 2008 by Mitchell Laird of MLC Enterprises, owner of 24 Burger Kings in Arizona, which was hiring about 900 people per year. He told a U.S. House committee that "in over 14 percent of our queries, the initial response is something other than 'employment authorized.'" He did not say how many of the people who received a nonconfirmation deserved it because they didn't have a right to work. Sgouros said the experiences of Intel and the Burger King franchise, involving a few thousand job seekers, is more significant than the government assessments of the E-Verify program that involve more than 15 million cases. The "GAO study doesn't reflect the experience of any particular employer. I'm not sure that a broad area average is going to be a better reflection of the accuracy of the system in the places where it really matters than the experience of this employer or that one," he said. Looking at the average instead of specific cases "is a way to wash out the shortcomings of the system. . . The error rates are going to be highest in the areas where it matters most." We checked with Intel, where spokeswoman Lisa Malloy said that in the past three years the initial rejection rate, once in the double digits, has consistently dropped to below 2 percent. In some years it has been less than 1 percent. Why the improvement? Intel hires a lot of students as interns; in 2009 E-Verify upgraded its database to add information to include more information about the students. "When that information was added we saw our experience dramatically improve," she said. So Sgouros' first example is no longer true. But even when we told him about the latest Intel data, he said his concerns remain. "I'm still with Chafee on this," he said. Calls to the Burger King franchise in Arizona to get updated information were not returned. There's another twist to this story. Sgouros suggested that flunking an initial E-Verify test means "you are going to be denied that job unfairly." In fact, if E-Verify -- which can only be done on someone who has just been hired -- can't find evidence that you are authorized to work in the United States, federal law requires the employer to keep you on the job and continue your training until you contest the finding and get a final determination. Workers have eight business days to appeal. If they don't appeal, the employer can fire them. Cases are typically resolved within 10 days, according to Paula Grenier, spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. (The number of problems could get even lower. Residents of 21 states can go online to see their status through the agency's E-Verify Self Check system. It's available for Massachusetts residents and should be online for Rhode Island and the rest of the United States sometime in March, Grenier said.) Our ruling Thomas Sgouros said that 10 percent to 15 percent of people screened by the E-Verify system are falsely found to be ineligible to work. His evidence is two small company studies from 2008 involving a few thousand workers. He claims that those anecdotal cases are more important than the national average. But the Sgouros statement we're checking would lead viewers to believe that he was talking about the overall accuracy of E-Verify, not just two examples out of more than 300,000 employers who use the system. Not only that, his examples are outdated. In the case of Intel, the initial rejection rate he cites hasn't been true for three years. Much larger and more recent government analyses, one by the GAO, found that the initial rejection rate is closer to 2 percent. And some of those people are being told they are not eligible to work in the United States because, well, they're not. That makes the actual rate of mistaken rejections even lower. The element of truth in his claim is so small, it doesn't even warrant a Mostly False. We rate it False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-08760	President Obama is a Muslim.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/26/18-percent-american-public/obama-muslim-no-hes-not-evidence-has-not-changed/	President Barack Obama is a Christian, but a minority of the American public keeps telling pollsters he's a Muslim. The Pew Research Center recently reported that 18 percent of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim, up from 11 percent in March 2009. A Time magazine poll found even more -- 24 percent -- said he was a Muslim. PolitiFact has done extensive fact-checking on Obama's faith and has debunked false claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire. Our fact-checking also showed clear evidence that Obama is a Christian. According to the president's memoirs and independent biographies, Obama was not raised in any particular faith. He became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. "It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith," Obama said in a 2006 speech. "It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth." The pastor of Trinity then was Jeremiah Wright, the minister from whom Obama distanced himself in the 2008 presidential campaign, after video of some of Wright's more controversial sermons were aired on television and the Internet. The break between the two men was over Wright's comments about American foreign policy and race relations, not tenets of Christian doctrine. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. "Along his Senate campaign trail (in 2004), Obama would never fail to carry his Christian Bible. He would place it right beside him, in the small compartment in the passenger side door of the SUV, so he could refer to it often," reported journalist David Mendell in his 2007 biography Obama: From Promise to Power. After the falling out with Wright, Obama said he intended find a new church once the campaign was over. In office, though, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington, D.C., area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. Obama regularly seeks spiritual guidance from a group of pastors and called them recently from Air Force One for a prayer session, according to an account in the Washington Post. Last week, when the Pew poll was released, presidential aides said Obama remains a practicing Christian and prays daily. In April this year, Obama hosted an Easter prayer breakfast at the White House, and spoke of being inspired by Christ's resurrection, particularly in light of the human failings of selfishness and pride. "It's not easy to purge these afflictions, to achieve redemption," Obama said. "But as Christians, we believe that redemption can be delivered -- by faith in Jesus Christ. And the possibility of redemption can make straight the crookedness of a character; make whole the incompleteness of a soul. Redemption makes life, however fleeting here on Earth, resound with eternal hope." So why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? A benign explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion like to associate him with something they perceive to be negative. (Read more about these perceptions in our report, "Why do so many people think Obama is a Muslim?") But all evidence points to the fact that Obama is a Christian. The members of the public who say he is a Muslim -- 18 percent, according to the Pew poll -- are wrong, and we rate their statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-12919	The federal government is prohibited "from negotiating lower prescription drug prices for our senior citizens."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/17/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-federal-government-prohibited-negoti/	In the heat of her historic run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin traded charges with Republican rival Tommy Thompson over prescription drug prices for senior citizens who are on Medicare. After defeating the former governor to become the nation’s first openly gay U.S. senator, Baldwin largely scaled back her public statements. But in recent months, as a 2018 re-election campaign looms, she has returned to being more vocal. With potential GOP challengers lining up, Baldwin revisited the Medicare issue on Jan. 5, 2017, declaring on Twitter: "We have a broken system in D.C. that prohibits the fed gov from negotiating lower Rx drug prices for our senior citizens. Let’s change it." The tweet clearly alluded to Medicare, in that it was accompanied by a graphic that referred to legislation known as the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. So, is a behemoth like the federal government not allowed to use its leverage to attempt to negotiate lower prescription drug prices in Medicare? And while we’re asking: What impact would such negotiation power have? Part D Medicare Part D is a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare proposed by Republican President George W. Bush. It became law in 2003 and has been in place since 2006. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. In 2016, nearly 41 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Part D. Democrats have complained that Part D was a huge giveaway for the pharmaceutical industry because, although the insurance plans can negotiate prices with drug makers, the government cannot. President Barack Obama vowed to change the program to allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices, but then backed away from the pledge during negotiations over his Affordable Care Act, earning a Promise Broken on PolitiFact National’s Obameter. Three 2016 presidential candidates -- Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders -- supported federal negotiation. And in January 2017, Baldwin and other Democratic senators introduced a bill to allow negotiation. So, the issue is back in play. During the Baldwin-Thompson race, we rated True a claim by Baldwin that federal law prohibits the government from negotiating for "better prices" in Medicare Part D. That law remains in place. So, what impact would federal negotiation have? Views vary. Lower prices? Fewer drugs? The current law says that "in order to promote competition," the health and human services (HHS) secretary "may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and prescription drug plans." Jack Hoadley, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, told us the federal government might have more leverage than individual insurance plans to negotiate lower prices, if it were allowed. A 2015 federal report found that Medicaid, for example, has negotiated larger rebates from drug manufacturers -- which reduce drug costs to the government and to senior citizens -- than the private plans in Medicare Part D "by a substantial margin." In contrast, American Enterprise Institute health care and retirement policy scholar Joseph Antos told us that if the government negotiated for lower prices in Part D, "there will be an attempt to push up prices paid by everyone else." Grace-Marie Turner, president of the pro-free market health reform Galen Institute, said federal negotiation would really mean "price controls" that might would discourage drug makers from investing in research that produces new drugs. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation summarizes it this way: Proponents believe that giving the secretary of HHS the authority to negotiate drug prices on behalf of millions of Medicare beneficiaries would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs, particularly for high-priced drugs for which there is no competition and where private plans may be less able to negotiate lower prices. Opponents believe the secretary would not be able to get a better deal than private plans already do and that plans have greater leverage with drug companies because of their whole line of business, but, if the secretary were able to negotiate lower prices, pharmaceutical companies would reduce their investment in pharmaceutical research and development. Our rating Baldwin says the federal government is prohibited "from negotiating lower prescription drug prices for our senior citizens." Her reference is to Medicare Part D, a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Views differ on whether seniors ultimately would benefit if the federal government could negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies on prescription drug prices for Part D. But current federal law does prohibit that. We rate Baldwin’s statement True.

pomt-11227	Says Adam Putnam "opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/may/07/ron-desantis/did-adam-putnam-oppose-putting-troops-border-using/	In Florida’s Republican primary for governor, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis challenged Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam’s credibility on illegal immigration. DeSantis cast Putnam as not being conservative enough on immigration in a chat May 2 with radio host John Fredericks, a supporter of President Donald Trump. Trump said DeSantis, a frequent guest on Fox News, would make a "GREAT" governor back in December. "Well, we are very different in our approach to illegal immigration," DeSantis said of Putnam. "When he was in the Congress, he supported the McCain amnesty, he even supported the gang of eight Schumer-Obama amnesty when he was ag commissioner. He didn’t even have to vote on it but he supported it. He opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard." Whether Putnam supported "amnesty" is a complicated question. We previously rated that attack as Half True, because he has supported some initiatives that would benefit undocumented immigrants (including the 2013 "Gang of Eight" legislation) and others that wouldn’t have. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Putnam opposed "putting troops on the southern border using the National Guard." We learned that Putnam did take a similar vote in 2004, but experts said the underlying policy — putting troops on the border — was not a major policy consideration in the early 2000s. More importantly, though, the talking point doesn’t account for Putnam’s general support of Trump’s immigration policy. Putnam’s 2004 vote Putnam served in the U.S. House for 10 years before he started two terms as agriculture commissioner in 2011. DeSantis’s claim is rooted in Putnam’s 2004 vote against an amendment to the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act. The amendment authorized the defense secretary to assign members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps to assist the Department of Homeland Security with border patrol duties, in some circumstances. The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Virgil Goode, R-Va., did not say anything about the National Guard, as DeSantis said. The amendment ended up passing with a vote of 231-191. Putnam and 19 other Republican lawmakers voted against it (Putnam being the only Republican from Florida to vote no). News coverage of this amendment was miminal. Still, some lawmakers went on the record to say the amendment would have stretched military personnel too thin. "Border security is and continues to be a top priority for me and for the Congress as a whole," then-Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said at the time. "But the Goode amendment would militarize our border and stretch the resources of our Army." In the early 2000s, deploying the military to help control the southern border was not discussed as a major immigration enforcement strategy by either party, said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. "The idea has surfaced from time to time, but it has never been a key component of any administration's strategy," he said. Putnam’s support for similar measures We asked Putnam spokeswoman Amanda Bevis why Putnam voted against the amendment. Instead, she reiterated Putnam’s support for the White House’s policy on immigration, which as of April includes sending National Guard troops to the southern border. "Adam Putnam supports President Trump’s actions to secure our borders, including activating troops for this critical purpose," she said. "Without strong border security to prevent illegal aliens from unlawfully entering our country, the lives of American citizens are endangered." This is the same quote Bevis gave Florida Politics earlier this year when reporters asked Putnam about his 2004 vote. We could not find any recent instances of Putnam speaking directly in support of sending the National Guard to the border. On his campaign website video about immigration, Putnam speaks broadly of supporting Trump’s policies. "As governor we will work with President Trump to cut funding for sanctuary cities, we will support tighter border security and vetting for refugees from Muslim countries," he said in a video posted May 2017. We also found several votes Putnam took in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement. For example, he voted in favor of a border security bill in 2005 that would have required improving surveillance technology, training more agents, and upgrading border infrastructure. He was one of multiple cosponsors of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and voted for the legislation. The law signed by President George W. Bush authorized about 700 miles of fencing between the border of the United States and Mexico. Putnam also voted for legislation in 2004 that appropriated $34.2 billion for Homeland Security, including funds to increase the number of border agents. Our ruling DeSantis said Putnam "opposed bringing troops, putting troops on our southern border using the National Guard." Context is key. In 2004, Putnam did vote against an amendment that authorized the secretary of defense to assign members of the military under certain circumstances to assist the Department of Homeland Security in securing the border. What the claim leaves out is Putnam’s overall support for Trump’s immigration policy. While Putnam has not commented on Trump’s specific plan to send National Guard to the border, he is generally enthusiastic about Trump’s approach to immigration. It’s also worth noting that as a member of Congress, Putnam took several votes in favor of border security measures and funding enforcement. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08085	"Since January 2008 the private sector has lost nearly 8 million jobs while local, state and federal governments added 590,000."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/16/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-repeats-questionable-statistic-growth/	In the Dec. 13, 2010, edition of the Wall Street Journal, outgoing Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- a potential contender in the 2012 Republican presidential primary -- wrote a column that blasted public-employee unions. Pawlenty wrote that government employees, especially those who are unionized, have become unfairly advantaged compared to private-sector workers, through a "silent coup, an inside job engineered by self-interested politicians and fueled by campaign contributions." "Across the country, at every level of government, the pattern is the same: Unionized public employees are making more money, receiving more generous benefits, and enjoying greater job security than the working families forced to pay for it with ever-higher taxes, deficits and debt," Pawlenty wrote. He even repeated what has become a major Republican talking point -- that "federal employees receive an average of $123,049 annually in pay and benefits, twice the average of the private sector." (In November, we ruled a less precisely worded version of this statistic False.) "The majority of union members today no longer work in construction, manufacturing or 'strong back' jobs," Pawlenty wrote. "They work for government, which, thanks to President Obama, has become the only booming 'industry' left in our economy. Since January 2008, the private sector has lost nearly 8 million jobs while local, state and federal governments added 590,000." We thought we'd take a look at one of the cornerstones of Pawlenty's column -- his contention that the private sector lost nearly 8 million jobs while government added 590,000. To see if he was right, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates a wide range of labor and employment statistics on a monthly basis. In January 2008, total private-sector employment in the United States stood at 115,562,000. By November 2010, the most current month available, that number had sunk to 108,278,000 -- a drop of roughly 7.3 million jobs. That pretty close to the "nearly 8 million" figure that Pawlenty cited. (Almost two-thirds of those job losses, incidentally, happened while George W. Bush was president.) But Pawlenty's public-sector figures were problematic. The BLS has a category called government employment -- which encapsulates local, state and federal employment, just as Pawlenty had defined it. Over the same period, the number of government jobs went from 22,379,000 to 22,261,000 -- a decrease of 118,000, rather than an increase of 590,000, as Pawlenty had written. At first we were flummoxed about how Pawlenty got the numbers so wrong. We called BLS to make sure we weren't overlooking another data set that measured the same subject, and spokesman Gary Steinberg confirmed that we were using exactly the same numbers he would use. We also looked at federal employment trends over the same period, on the guess that Pawlenty might have meant to refer to federal jobs, rather than all government jobs. By this calculation, the number of jobs did increase, rather than decrease, but the amount was only one-sixth of what Pawlenty had indicated. Over that period, federal employment rose from 2,739,000 to 2,837,000 -- 98,000 jobs in all. After a bit of online research, we found a reference to the mysterious 590,000 number in -- of all places -- a fact-check by our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio. It turns out that on Aug. 10, 2010, they analyzed a statement by Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio, that "since the president became the president, we have lost 3.3 million jobs in the private sector. But you know who's done okay and who's not complaining today? The public sector. We've gained 590,000 public sector jobs." LaTourette's number for private-sector job losses at that point was spot-on. But PolitiFact Ohio found fault with his public-sector numbers. Here's what they wrote: "In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By May, there were 3,396,000 federal workers. That’s a gain of 593,000, putting LaTourette on the money. But here’s the problem. BLS makes clear, the White House makes clear, and every major news report makes clear when these numbers are released each month that the stimulus had little to do with the growth of the federal workforce. Most of it -- 559,000 new jobs from January 2009 through May – came entirely from the temporary buildup of Census workers. And many of those jobs have already disappeared. ... Exclude all the Census workers hired from January 2009 through May 2010 and total federal hiring comes to only 34,000, not the 590,000 figure that LaTourette cited." Assuming that Pawlenty was drawing his number from the same source as LaTourette did -- and we don't know for sure, because his spokesman did not respond to an inquiry -- then the Minnesota governor has even less justification for using the 590,000 figure than his Ohio colleague. Here's why: • When we see Pawlenty saying "since January 2008," we assume he means from January 2008 to the present. But the numbers he used appeared to be based on the change from January 2009 to May 2009. • Pawlenty specifically wrote that his job numbers referred to "local, state and federal government" employment, but LaTourette's 590,000 only counted federal workers. • Pawlenty's statement doesn't account for the tremendous -- and now vanished -- bump from hiring Census workers. The closest we could come to a 590,000 job gain using a legitimate statistic was a measurement suggested by Rea Hederman Jr., a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. He suggested looking at the federal workforce minus U.S. Postal Service employees. Postal workers are a different enough category of employee that the BLS does calculate a statistic that excludes them from the federal workforce, and that statistic shows an increase in federal employment since January 2008 of 215,700 employees. But that's still barely one-third of the total Pawlenty cited, and to get to it, you still have to directly contradict the definition of government workers that Pawlenty used in his column. The question of whether government employees, because of public-employee unions, are compensated too generously or enjoy too much job security strikes us as a fair topic for debate. But Pawlenty did his cause no service by using the 590,000-employee statistic. Not only did he apparently mangle the time frame, contradict his own definition of federal workers and fail to acknowledge the huge caveat of Census worker hiring, he also repeated a statistic that had been criticized as inaccurate as long as six months ago. (Another politician who got caught by PolitiFact Ohio was the incoming House Speaker, John Boehner, R-Ohio.) And in the context of his column, the job numbers comment was more than a throwaway line. The comparison of job growth he made -- which showed the size of the federal workforce going in exactly the opposite direction as it did in reality -- is a key pillar supporting the premise of his column, that government work is "the only booming 'industry' left in our economy." Pawlenty's number is so compromised that we rate his statement Pants on Fire! UPDATE: After we posted our story, a spokesman for Pawlenty, Alex Conant, contacted PolitiFact to report that the source for Pawlenty's 590,000-job figure was a June 24, 2010, post by Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, on the Big Government site run by conservative activist Andrew Breitbart. After looking at what de Rugy wrote, we stand by our analysis that the 590,000 number doesn't encapsulate the time frame or definition set out by Pawlenty in his Wall Street Journal op-ed, and that it is still skewed by a large bump in temporary Census jobs.

Activists and lawmakers in the United Kingdom want to revamp the corporate tax law there, too. They argue, it wouldn’t just benefit British taxpayers, but it also would help some of the poorest nations. Thanks to treaties in the United Kingdom they say, multinational companies do a dandy job of avoiding taxes on their operations in developing countries. This makes it even harder for these nations to meet the basic needs of their people. ActionAid UK, an international anti-poverty group, drove home the point with a tweet that said "Malawi has just 300 doctors for 16 million people." For the record, the tweet appears to slightly undercount the population of Malawi -- a country surrounded by Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique. The World Bank estimated the nation's population at 16.7 million in 2014. The CIA World Factbook estimates a 2015 population nearing 18 million. The heart of this claim, however, is the number of doctors in the country. That’s worthy of a deeper look. The doctor tally We contacted ActionAid UK but did not hear back. The most likely source behind the group’s statement is the World Health Organization’s Global Health Observatory. But the WHO’s most recent data for Malawi comes from 2008. The Medical Council of Malawi has lists of every person licensed to practice in Malawi. They include doctors, nurses, physician assistants, dentists and more. You can see a list of new registrations here, and a longer list that goes back many years. Taken at face value, there are more than 620 doctors, surgeons, pediatricians and other specialists in Malawi. (This includes some foreign doctors, and excludes physicians who applied solely on a temporary basis.) But that’s at least a little bit off. Some of the names have been on the list for over 20 years. While those people might still be practicing in Malawi, there’s no guarantee that they are and research shows that after about five years of working in the country, some doctors decide to leave, or shift into work that doesn’t involve treating patients. Still, Adamson Mulla, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Malawi, told us while the list has its flaws, it’s more accurate than ActionAid UK’s estimate. "The wisdom that there are 300 doctors in Malawi looks silly," Mulla said. Now whether the number is 300 or closer to 600, the count pales relative to the country’s 16.7 million people. But the claim further ignores trained medical professionals who are not doctors. Malawi’s clinical officers and medical assistants Helen de Pinho, an assistant professor of public health at Columbia University, has studied Malawi’s health care system. De Pinho takes issue with the simplicity of the ActionAid message. "If you are trying to assess availability of clinical skills then just looking at doctors is misleading," de Pinho said. "We should also look at the number of medical assistants and clinical officers trained and deployed." Medical assistants provide basic primary care in clinics. Clinical officers have at least four years of training in internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology and surgery. "They are able to do basic and emergency surgery including caesarean sections, and in rural districts, perform over 95 percent of the c-sections," de Pinho said. "The clinical officers really are the backbone of the clinical services, especially in the more rural district hospitals." The Medical Council rolls show 925 clinical officers. If we add their ranks to the number of doctors, there would be about 1,400 doctors and clinical officers. If we include the 836 medical assistants, the number rises to over 2,000. Another researcher of Malawi’s health care system, Kate Mandeville at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told us that unlike physicians, clinical officers and medical assistant are far more likely to stay and work in Malawi. So the Medical Council roster is more accurate for these health care providers. A shortage remains The ActionAid tally of doctors overlooks the bulk of the health care workforce in Malawi, but to be sure, at the end of the day, the country still lags far behind other nations. In round figures, Malawi has 0.12 health care workers for every 1,000 people ( totalling doctors, clinical officers and medical assistants.) Roughly speaking and relying on WHO data, Kenya has about 10 times as many skilled professionals as Malawi (about 1.1 health care workers for every 1,000.) Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, has about 2.1 workers for every 1,000. South Africa, the second largest economy, has 7.6. Mandeville told us that the number of doctors, along with other clinicians, is "far too low." Yet she urged caution in putting too much stock in that yardstick. "The 300 figure has the most shock value, but scaling up the number of doctors alone is unlikely to have much impact on population health outcomes," Mandeville said. Our ruling ActionAid UK said that Malawi has 300 doctors to treat 16 million people. A current estimate puts that figure closer to 600. And as experts note, the statistic overlooks the clinical officers and medical assistant who play at least as important a role as physicians, especially in Malawi’s rural areas. That said, relative to the size of the population, Malawi suffers from a critical shortage of health care workers -- of any sort. The numbers ActionAid offered might not be perfect. But the broader point the group is making is largely accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	ActionAid UK	None	None	None	2016-02-25T20:56:05	2016-02-02	['None']

"Obama secretly flees U.S. - leaves stunning evidence behind," read the headline on March 22 on Viral Truth Wire, a website promoting sensationalized headlines. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The Viral Truth Wire story claimed Obama’s recent trip to New Zealand was because he wanted to go into hiding due to evidence that he has colluded with Russia and attempted to spy on Trump. The article noted the timing of the trip was also due to the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. But Obama’s trip to New Zealand was already confirmed in late February, long before McCabe’s firing. Obama visited the country to meet with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and discuss topics such as climate change and social media’s impact on politics. The article also claimed that Obama left a "trail of proof" through the presidential daily briefings inside the White House proving that he plotted with Russia to obstruct Trump amid the presidential decision. The hero of the article is depicted as U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, who compiled a memo that accused top FBI officials of alleged wrongdoing. It concluded that Nunes was the one who found that Obama’s presidential daily briefings included illegal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) activity and "spy games" targeting Trump. We found no evidence that Nunes has ever made such allegations against Obama. In March 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign, an accusation that the heads of both the NSA and the FBI denied. What actually happened is that the FBI and the Department of Justice put together an application to the FISA court that approves surveillance warrants pertaining to national security and foreign intelligence. Obama himself, however, would have no role in authorizing or requesting wiretaps. Our ruling A hoax website claimed that Obama fled the country due to new evidence that he was involved with spying on Trump and responsible for colluding with Russia. We found that Obama’s trip abroad to New Zealand was to speak about issues with the prime minister, and he was not involved with ordering any wiretaps to spy on Trump during the election.

pomt-02007	Judging by a recent vote, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz "thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jun/10/americans-safe-access/ad-says-debbie-wasserman-schultz-wants-send-medica/	If you’re a South Florida senior citizen suffering from a deadly disease and you’re hoping to ease your pain with a puff of marijuana, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, has a prescription for you: federal prison. At least that’s the impression created by a TV ad launched in June by Americans for Safe Access, a group that supports medical marijuana. The ad airing through June 10 in Broward and Miami-Dade counties attacks Wasserman Schultz for her recent vote against a medical marijuana amendment. The visuals include a photo of an elderly woman who has ALS alongside her husband, who’s wearing a veterans cap. (Here’s some separate information from PolitiFact Florida about that ALS patient, Cathy Jordan, featured in the ad.) "Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison," the narrator states. "On May 30, she voted against an amendment that would respect Florida’s new laws and protect Florida’s patients. Even though 88 percent of voters support medical marijuana, why would Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz vote to send patients like this to prison? Is Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz out of touch with Florida?" The group is running a similar TV attack against U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland. Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, represents a large elderly population in South Florida. So an ad suggesting that she wants to send ailing seniors to federal prison packs a punch. We decided to take a look at the vote cited in the ad. The medical marijuana amendment The ad cites a vote on an amendment to H.R. 4660, an appropriations -- or funding -- bill for departments of Commerce and Justice and science agencies. The amendment, offered by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., bans the use of federal money to prevent certain states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws. The amendment states: "None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana." These are largely the states where some form of medical marijuana is allowed or pending -- or in the case of Florida, is on the ballot this fall. The language was designed to expire at the end of fiscal year 2015, so a similar amendment would have to be offered each year, at which point additional states considering medical marijuana laws could be added. Wasserman Schultz was one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment, which ended up passing, 219-189, on May 30. All told, 49 Republicans and 170 Democrats supported the amendment. "I voted against the Farr-Rohrabacher amendment because I do not believe, regardless of the issue, that it is appropriate to limit the executive branch’s ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion," Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, in which she also raised concerns about Florida’s ballot initiative to allow medical marijuana. (Her concerns about the ballot measure have drawn the wrath of John Morgan, a major Democratic donor who is funding that amendment.) A Wasserman Schultz spokesman sent us the statement but declined to comment specifically on the ad’s claim that she wants to send patients to prison. Though proponents of medical marijuana cast the House’s affirmative vote on the amendment as a major victory after years of efforts, it still has to clear two major hurdles: the Senate and President Barack Obama. As of June 9, the amendment had no Senate sponsor, though Americans for Safe Access said it was courting senators to introduce a similar amendment when the spending bill goes to the floor later this month. Current legal situation As PolitiFact Florida has previously written, the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Proponents of decriminalizing marijuana strongly disagree with that definition. The law imposes strict penalties on marijuana users, growers and sellers. A first misdemeanor offense for possession in any amount can result in a $1,000 fine and a year in prison. Meanwhile, selling cannabis is considered a felony and can send a defendant to five years of prison, or even longer, depending on the amount and the circumstances. Cultivating cannabis plants carries similar penalties, based on the volume. Even with federal law on the books prohibiting marijuana, there are reasons that users and distributors aren’t constantly being busted by the Drug Enforcement Agency amid debate in many states about loosening laws governing medical uses -- or even recreational uses -- of marijuana. The 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case Gonzales vs. Raich established that the federal government has the right to use the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to regulate homegrown marijuana, even when it’s for approved medicinal use. The case addressed whether it was proper for DEA officials to destroy Oakland, Calif., resident Angel Raich’s homegrown marijuana plants in 2002, even though California’s medical marijuana law, passed in 1996, made them legal under state law. Since then, other states have continued to shrug off federal guidelines, with voters in Colorado and Washington state going so far as to decriminalize cannabis use outright last year. This has led to a recent softening of the federal government’s stance on the drug. In 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys that included new guidelines focusing on cartels or other criminal organizations -- for example, distribution to minors, cultivating plants on public land, committing violence to distribute the drug or using state-regulated operations as a cover for illicit activities. Beyond that, the Justice Department said it’s content to allow state and local agencies "to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws." Indeed, raids of growing operations have grown infrequent, and federal prosecution of individuals in those states is nearly unheard of. Some argue that the House amendment merely codifies the Cole memo or still leaves prosecutors with wiggle room. However, proponents hope it will influence the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. "It could provide for the opening to enact legislative language that would be much more specific," Jeff Vanderslice, Rorhabacher’s legislative director, told PolitiFact Florida. Examples of federal prosecution We asked Kris Hermes, a spokesman for Americans for Safe Access, if he could cite examples of medical marijuana patients being sent to federal prison. Hermes cited examples of marijuana busts in Montana, Michigan and California, but most of the cases involved large-scale cultivators and distributors. In some cases, prosecutors accused defendants of cultivating more plants than allowed under state law or selling for non-medical reasons. For example, Aaron Sandusky, who operated multiple dispensaries, was found guilty in 2012 of conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute hundreds of pounds of marijuana. The Press Enterprise wrote that federal investigators alleged Sandusky’s company used California's medical marijuana laws as a cover for an illegal grow-and-sell operation instead of a nonprofit cultivation collective for those with a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana. He was sentenced to 10 years. Rohrabacher’s staff cited the case of Jerry Duval who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Michigan. Duval and his children were state-registered caregivers and their lawyers argued that they raised it for Duval, an organ transplant recipient. But federal prosecutors argued that they used medical marijuana as a front while peddling marijuana to non-patients. A jury found Duval, a convicted felon, and his son guilty of conspiracy to manufacture more than 100 marijuana plants, manufacturing marijuana plants with intent to distribute and maintaining a place to distribute marijuana under federal law. One case headed to trial that has drawn considerable attention involves the Kettle Falls 5, named for the defendants who grew about 70 plants in eastern Washington. Prosecutors say the five defendants were conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana and they were also charged with possessing firearms. The Safe Access group brought one codefendant, Larry Harvey, to D.C. to lobby Congress. Harvey, 70, told USA TODAY Network that he never sold any marijuana -- "not a bit of it" -- and the pot he grew was for personal medical use. He has a bad knee from years of long-haul trucking and his wife suffers from arthritis. Experts say prosecution permitted but rare We sent the ad to a few academic experts who study marijuana laws and asked about the likelihood of patients going to prison. "I know of no patient-only person sent to federal prison for use of marijuana," Ohio State University professor Douglas Berman said. But he said the "Kettle Falls Five" case may be the closest, since it involves patients -- rather than distributors -- facing possible prison time. Even before states started legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational use, the federal government didn’t throw defendants in prison simply for using marijuana, Vanderbilt law Professor Robert Mikos told PolitiFact Florida. Prosecutors are focused on suppliers and distributors, he said. "The way the ad is set up -- that the federal government is going to go after elderly people with chronic illnesses for using marijuana for medical purposes -- it’s just ridiculous," Mikos said. "It never happens, and furthermore to say because someone voted a certain way on this amendment and therefore they support that (people going to prison only for using medical marijuana) is just a ridiculous stretch of logic." That said, prosecution of patients is permitted under current federal law, said George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin. "Even if such prosecutions rarely occur, the fact that they are possible is a deterrent for legitimate medical providers and suppliers from getting involved in the process. It also often deters banks from giving them financing." Somin argues that while the Justice Department memo might cut back on prosecutions, it didn’t completely bar them. He added that "this administration or a successor could reverse or modify those guidelines at any time. A new federal statute could prevent such a reversal." Our ruling The ad by Americans for Safe Access says that, judging by a recent vote, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz "thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison"-- even the elderly ALS patient shown in the ad. We can't measure what Wasserman Schultz believes in her heart, but we are able to take a closer look at what her voting record shows. She did vote against an amendment to prevent the federal government from using money to keep certain states from decriminalizing medical marijuana. And laws that could theoretically send medical marijuana users to prison remain on the books. Still, it’s an exaggeration to say that Wasserman Schultz’s vote means she wants to send ailing seniors to prison for smoking a joint. The reality is that today, even without the amendment in force, federal prosecutions of medical marijuana users are exceedingly rare. Most of the prosecutions we found involved users who were also accused of dealing marijuana. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. CORRECTION, June 11, 2014: An earlier version mischaracterized a summary of the medical marijuana amendment. The amendment bans the use federal money to prevent certain states from implementing their own medical marijuana laws.

pomt-01939	Says Barack Obama is the "first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/25/chain-email/obama-appointed-45-czars-replace-elected-officials/	A chain email that’s been circulating for years -- listing what it claims are President Barack Obama’s "accomplishments," except they’re all negative -- has recently gone into heavy rotation again, judging by reader requests to fact-check it. By now, we’ve fact-checked three of the dozens of "accomplishments" listed in the email, and each has earned a rating of Pants on Fire. The claim we will check here is that Obama is the "first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office." We took a look at Obama’s czars back in 2009, when Sen. John McCain asserted that Obama had more czars than the Romanovs. We concluded that Romanovs had 18 and Obama had 28, so we rated it True. That said, no one should conclude that the chain email’s claim is correct. So what is a czar, anyway? The term "czar" is unofficial -- something that is more often used by the media than by the government itself. As best as we can tell, it’s a title that the media likes to use to shorthand someone’s real position. Officially, a government employee may be "chairman of the Recovery Act accountability transparency board," but it’s much easier for journalists to refer to the "Stimulus Czar." Ditto for the "acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability and Chief Troubled Asset Relief Program Counsel," often called "TARP Czar." How many czars does Obama have? The claim that Obama has 45 czars appears to come from a 2011 report by Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group. The group counted 45 czars appointed by Obama and 18 other unfilled or planned czar positions. By our count, that number is inflated. For example, Valerie Jarrett is listed as the "Special Advisor Czar." The president has numerous special advisers like Jarrett. This suggests one could theoretically label every special advisor to the president a "czar." A few others, such as the "Safe Schools Czar" and "War Czar," are positions started under President George W. Bush. The "Oil Czar" is listed as Ray Mabus, who is Senate-confirmed Secretary of the Navy. We contacted Judicial Watch to get a response to these more questionable positions. Czars are identified and become a problem when there is a lack of transparency and when they oversee statutory government positions, said Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch. This raises questions of constitutionality, he said. Fitton acknowledged that czars have been a longstanding, bipartisan practice. The czars created under the Bush administration were included in the list because Obama also appointed officers to these positions, he said. From what we can tell, the term is subjective enough that the Judicial Watch number is a rough estimate, too -- including any appointed position they see as potentially damaging to the system of checks and balances. Czars don’t replace elected officials, they’re appointed The biggest flat-out inaccuracy of the email’s claim is not the number of czars, but that any of these czars replaced elected officials. There are only two people in the executive branch who are elected -- the president and the vice president. To the extent that anyone is a czar at all, they are not replacing an elected official. They would either be filling a new job that didn’t exist before, or occupying an existing appointed position. We should also note that Obama is hardly the first president to appoint czars. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 2) states that officers of the United States must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. A position is an office if it is "invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign powers of the federal Government" and "continuing" in nature. Commissioned military officers and cabinet secretaries fall under this definition. But Congress may also allow the president alone to appoint "inferior officers" -- advisers and directors often working in the White House who are not vetted or confirmed by the Senate. "Czars" often fall into this category. Since at least President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s terms, each president has created new positions for various policy issues. A video released by the Democratic National Committee in 2009 cheekily titled, "Dancing with the Czars," claimed George W. Bush appointed 47 czars. We asked some experts what they thought of the list of Obama-appointed czars. Paul C. Light, New York University professor of public service, said "Obama has set the record" for appointing czars and has "defined czar down to the point that the term no longer has any punch." John Palguta, vice president for policy at Partnership for Public Service, agreed that "simply attaching the term ‘czar’ to someone in a position of responsibility doesn’t mean anything." However, his opinion on czars differed. "There are about 2.1 million civilian positions in the government, not counting the Postal Service or the military ... and the president needs people in leadership positions to help manage this very large and complex enterprise," said Palguta. "Frankly, 45 appointments seems to be a relatively small number, especially since at least some of those appointments are to positions that the president is expected to fill." Our ruling A chain email said Obama is the "first president to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office." Perhaps two dozen Obama administration officials have been genuinely referred to as czars -- a smaller number than the email claims -- but it’s important to note that "czar" is more a term of the media than it is of the government. Most important, though, is that not a single one of these czars replaced an elected official. We rate this claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-06-25T09:42:16	2014-06-18	['None']
pomt-15163	Says Ron Johnson "opposes entirely a federal minimum wage," except perhaps for "guest workers."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/27/russ-feingold/us-sen-ron-johnson-wants-no-general-federal-minimu/	During a campaign speech in Milwaukee, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold called for gradually raising the federal minimum wage to $15. It is now set at $7.25 an hour. And without mentioning Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson by name, the Democrat attacked Johnson. The two are poised for a rematch in 2016. "Now, my likely opponent, the incumbent senator, opposes entirely -- get this, opposes entirely -- a federal minimum wage," Feingold said Aug. 18, 2015. "At least for Americans -- apparently he has some openness about guest workers -- disrespecting the hard work and dignity of too many working Wisconsinites." Johnson has often spoken against raising the minimum wage. But does he oppose there being any general federal minimum wage law? Hot topic -- $10, $12 or $15 Raising the federal minimum wage is a common campaign plank among Democrats. A month before Feingold’s speech, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, introduced legislation for an increase to $15 an hour. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential contender Martin O’Malley also backs $15, while front runner Hillary Clinton, like President Barack Obama, has expressed support for $12. Many Republicans -- including Johnson and one of the leading GOP candidates for president, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -- oppose a raise. Walker argued in 2014 that minimum-wage jobs are overwhelmingly for young people starting out in the work force, a statement we rated False. We found the best estimates were that 24 percent to 55 percent of such jobs are held by teenagers and young adults. But later in the year, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a claim by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would "destroy" between 500,000 and 1 million jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had said that "roughly" 500,000 workers could lose their jobs, but that most likely the range was between very few to 1 million. What Johnson said To back Feingold’s claim, his campaign cited comments Johnson made more than a year earlier, at a July 2, 2014 WisPolitics luncheon in Milwaukee. A member of the audience asked Johnson: "What should the federal minimum wage be? Or should there not be a minimum wage?" Johnson replied: "Shouldn’t be one. The only area that I would agree with minimum wage is in immigration reform, the guest worker program. I'd be 100 percent supportive of a minimum wage -- kind of industry specific, maybe regionally specific -- for guest workers, so that we're not creating incentives for employers to bring in immigrants to lower the price of labor." He added: "In the general economy, you get government involved in making market decisions -- first of all, they're going to get it wrong. For a minimum wage, you will actually reduce the number of jobs available. What you don't want to do -- if you're concerned about poverty, if you're concerned about providing opportunity -- you don't want to rip the bottom rung of the ladder of opportunity away from people. And that’s what you do." (The federal government has so-called guest worker programs that allow foreign nationals to fill temporary jobs, both agricultural and non-agricultural.) Johnson did not dispute Feingold’s claim. His campaign emailed us a statement that said in part that Johnson worked for minimum wage on his first job and "knows minimum wage laws are here to stay and we should design them to make sure they don’t hurt the very people they are designed to help." Johnson opposes a raise to $15, the statement added, but "does not seek to get rid of the federal minimum wage -- it's here to stay." Our rating Feingold says Johnson "opposes entirely a federal minimum wage," except perhaps for "guest workers." It may not be a position Johnson has stated often, but when asked in July 2014 whether there should be a federal minimum wage, Johnson said there should not be one, other than perhaps one for guest workers. And while he may not be trying to repeal the wage, Johnson didn’t dispute the accuracy of Feingold’s claim -- that he is against having a federal minimum, except perhaps for guest workers coming in from outside the United States. We rate Feingold’s statement True.	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2015-08-27T10:00:00	2015-08-18	['None']
pomt-01917	The "9-0 decision last week was the 13th time the Supreme Court voted 9-0 that the president had exceeded his constitutional authority."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/29/bob-goodlatte/gop-leader-supreme-court-has-ruled-13-times-obama-/	President Barack Obama received a strong rebuke from the Supreme Court last week for his attempt to make appointments when Congress was still technically in session. The 9-0 decision in National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning came just as Speaker John Boehner announced plans to sue Obama for executive overreach. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who defended Boehner’s lawsuit, said the Supreme Court’s ruling was emblematic of Obama’s term. Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the "9-0 decision last week was the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority." Has Obama really had such a tough time with the high court? We decided to review the record. Goodlatte isn’t the only person to make this argument. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made a similar claim in a press release last week and it was also the subject of a column in the National Review, a conservative news website. A spokeswoman for Goodlatte gave us a list of the 13 cases he referenced. We reviewed the evidence his office offered enlisted the help of a few experts to help us parse through the legalese. Goodlatte’s assertion doesn’t seem to hold water. Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University, said the NLRB case is very different than the rest of the cases on the list, in that the court actually was ruling on a separations of power issue and a presidential overreach. "That’s a fair case of the president’s use of executive authority getting rejected," she said. But the rest of the claim? "It’s a total overstatement," Bloch said. Why? For starters, in eight of the cases, the alleged overreach occurred under President George W. Bush, as did the court cases that challenged the administration (United States vs. Jones, Sackett vs. EPA, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School vs. EEOC, Gabelli vs. SEC, Arkansas Fish & Game Commission v. United States, PPL Corp. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Horne vs. USDA, and Bond vs. United States). Bush’s Justice Department handled the initial court proceedings in most instances. Obama’s Justice Department in many of the cases handled the appellate process and ultimately defended the actions to the Supreme Court. But that’s commonplace, experts we spoke with said. Goodlatte spokeswoman Jessica Collins contended that doesn't make the chairman's statement untrue. "Regardless of who started the policies that were overturned by the courts unanimously during the Obama administration, President Obama decided to continue those policies which were struck down," she said. But that isn't really what Goodlatte claimed. He said Obama "exceeded his presidential authority," not that Obama defended executive overreach. Additionally, in many of the cases, executive overreach wasn’t really even at issue. For example, in United States vs. Jones, the court was ruling on whether the FBI had the power to use a GPS to track a suspect and gather evidence. Technically, the FBI is a federal department under the Justice Department, a department in the executive branch. But the court was not reeling in an administration that was abusing power. Rather, "it gave us some guidance about how new technology and the Fourth Amendment should interact," Bloch said. "It has nothing to do with presidential authority." Another case on the list, Arizona vs. United States, surprised our experts. Why? Because many saw it as a partial victory for Obama. This is the case surrounding Arizona’s tough immigration laws that many civil rights groups said amounted to racial profiling. In 2012, the Supreme Court released a complicated 5-3 ruling, in which the court actually sided with the Obama administration on three of four counts. On the fourth provision, which allowed Arizona authorities to check the immigration status of anyone suspected of being an undocumented immigrant, the court basically said it’s too soon to tell, and unanimously decided to send the issue down to the lower courts to monitor for further challenges. "The Supreme Court struck down three of the four because they interfered with federal immigration enforcement, which was defended by the Obama administration to advocate for the laws passed by Congress," Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University. Another case on the list was last week’s ruling in United States vs. Wurie, which was decided along with Riley vs. California. The court ruled that police could not search your cell phone without a warrant if you were arrested. Wermiel said it was "absurd" to include the Wurie case on the list. It also originated prior to Obama taking office and was the result of a Boston police effort. Like the Jones case, it dealt with technology issues, not executive overreach. Another case on the Goodlatte’s list and decided last week, McCullen vs. Coakley, dealt with state laws, particular whether a Massachusetts law that put no-protest zones around abortion clinics was constitutional. While the Obama administration filed a brief supporting the Massachusetts law, the issue decided had little to do with executive authority. The last case included, Sekhar vs. United States, did originate under the Obama administration. It’s complicated, but basically the FBI sought extortion charges against a Massachusetts venture capitalist, who was accused of trying to force a legal adviser to the New York state comptroller to persuade the comptroller to invest in his company. The Supreme Court said the FBI couldn’t arrest him under federal extortion laws. In all, how does Goodlatte’s assertion hold up? Not well, our experts said. "This is a concocted statistic," said Tom Goldstein, publisher of the Supreme Court blog SCOTUSblog.com. "It's just saying that the government lost cases unanimously. The government participates in roughly 60 cases a term. Every administration loses cases unanimously." "It's true that the Obama Administration's views have been rejected repeatedly in the Supreme Court. But this way of putting it overreaches considerably." Our ruling Goodlatte said, the "9-0 decision last week was the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority." A thorough review of the 13 cases found many instances where presidential authority was not at issue. Further, most of the cases originated under and were first litigated by the Bush administration.

pomt-14764	"Up until recently, 75 percent of all the sorties that left the base came back without dropping their ordnances, because there was such a concern about making sure that there were no civilian casualties."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/dec/10/jeb-bush/until-recently-pilots-didnt-use-weapon-against-isi/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush blasted President Barack Obama’s response to Islamic State advances in Iraq and Syria, saying the White House has been creating too many bureaucratic hurdles for the military to clear. The Obama administration must "take the lawyers off the war fighters' backs and let them go do the job and do it in concert with the neighborhood," Bush told George Stephanopoulos on the Dec. 6, 2015, episode of This Week. "Up until recently, 75 percent of all the sorties that left the base came back without dropping their ordnances, because there was such a concern about making sure that there were no civilian casualties," Bush said. "The United States will always adhere to the international standards of war, but this administration has imposed even greater challenges." We wanted to check whether Bush was correct about airstrikes on Islamic State. Inherent Resolve The U.S. Air Force tracks how many individual flights, or sorties, are carried out for Operation Inherent Resolve, the campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS or ISIL. They track weapons use during each combat sortie, which are counted separately from other flights like airdrops and refueling missions. Between August 2014 and June 2015, there were 18,042 combat sorties over Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. Air Forces Central Command. Weapons (guns, bombs or missiles) were used in 4,175 of them, or 23 percent. That ratio varies per month, but overall, weapons were not used in 77 percent of sorties. Some critics have used the statistics to say the Obama administration is not properly conducting its air campaign in Iraq and Syria. Defense policy experts told us that weapons use during sorties against Islamic State was low compared with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "There has never been an offensive air campaign in U.S. military history that has had anywhere near as low of an ordnance expenditure rate as has (Operation Inherent Resolve)," Christopher Harmer, senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told PolitiFact Florida. But the experts also said that the Obama administration had been making an effort to avoid civilian casualties as much as possible. This was in part because ISIS forces purposely try to blend in with civilians, and because the United States did not want to alienate the local population. "We were perhaps overly concerned about collateral damage," said strategy analyst Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "I would say that we did allow ourselves to be over-restrained when dealing with the possibility of civilian casualties." It is clear that Bush was right to use the qualifier "up until recently," because weapons use has increased quite a bit since the summer as strategies have shifted. Special Operations forces have been called up to aid Kurdish and Iraqi ground forces, and the United States has begun targeting oil supplies controlled by ISIS. The Air Force told PolitiFact Florida that about 50 percent of all strike missions had one or more aircraft drop weapons in July and August. October was up to about 60 percent and in November it was 65 percent. That has increased the overall total or weapons use. Statistics through November 2015 show that out of 25,860 sorties, weapons were employed 10,932 times. That means since August 2014, aircraft engaged targets during a mission 42 percent of the time. There are several reasons weapons are being used more freely, according to a statement from Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Brown Jr., Combined Forces Air Component Commander. Forces are gaining understanding of Islamic State tactics, and the coalition is sharing intelligence more effectively to improve targeting ability. Planes also have been on the lookout for targets of opportunity as they return to base after sorties. "It’s the impact and the effect we have on Da’esh that we’re most focused on, not the amount of weapons released," Brown said in the statement. (Da’esh is yet another name for Islamic State.) "The numbers are interesting, but the effect we have on Da’esh is what is important." Some analysts agreed with Brown that weapons use statistics can be somewhat meaningless. Matthew Fay, defense policy analyst at the libertarian Niskanen Center, said in any case, the figures don’t convey whether the military’s true goals are being met. High body counts in the Vietnam War didn’t truly show America’s progress, he noted. "If civilian deaths in American airstrikes in Iraq and Syria aid ISIS recruiting, increasing the percentage of ordnance dropped with no account for the collateral damage it will inevitably produce is counterproductive to American strategy," Fay said. Our ruling Bush said, "Up until recently, 75 percent of all the sorties that left the base came back without dropping their ordnances, because there was such a concern about making sure that there were no civilian casualties." That 75-percent rate was accurate until this summer, when sorties against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria saw an uptick, so Bush is right to qualify his statement. Experts said the Obama administration did want to avoid civilian casualties, but fighting an unconventional force like ISIS has made airstrikes more difficult than in previous conflicts. Analysts also noted that even at a low rate, citing weapons use as an indicator of achieving strategic goals does not necessarily signify success the way Bush implies.

pomt-00315	Says U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema "voted to cut ICE."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2018/sep/21/martha-mcsally/martha-mcsallys-claim-kyrsten-sinema-voted-cut-ice/	Immigration enforcement is a top issue for the border state of Arizona, and one that Republican congresswoman Martha McSally has elevated during her campaign for the U.S. Senate. In an interview with Fox News, McSally said that Democratic rival and U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema voted to weaken the federal agency responsible for executing immigration laws within the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "This is a dangerous agenda coming out of the Democrats, and again my opponent voted to cut ICE. ... I support ICE and my opponent voted for cuts to ICE, voted not to support the Department of Homeland Security," McSally said in the interview that aired Sept. 16. "She is associated with this dangerous agenda, don’t be fooled by it. And that’s a real contrast in this race as well." McSally is on the House Homeland Security Committee and chairs the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. Is it true that Sinema "voted to cut ICE"? There’s truth to McSally’s claim, but it leaves out important details. Key takeaways • Sinema voted to shift funds from ICE to other agencies. • However, Sinema also voted to increase ICE’s funding in fiscal year 2018 and, like McSally, voted in favor of a resolution supporting ICE. • Sinema said abolishing ICE "isn’t realistic and it doesn’t make any sense." McSally spotlights Sinema’s September 2017 votes McSally’s campaign said Sinema was among Democrats who voted in favor of an amendment to an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018. That amendment, sponsored by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., sought to reduce ICE funding by $100 million and give that money to the U.S. Coast Guard. (The amendment failed.) Correa argued on the House floor that the Coast Guard should use the money for additional ships to interdict drugs coming to the United States by sea. Despite record-breaking efforts against drug trafficking, the Coast Guard’s cocaine seizures accounted for less than 10 percent of all attempted shipments, Correa said. The $100 million represented "additional support for our border security, our high seas," Correa said. He was responding to Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, who argued that the Coast Guard program was already robust and ICE money should go toward the detention of immigrants. Sinema’s campaign argued that the $100 million redirection would have reduced an overall increase in ICE funding, but not necessarily cut it. That September, Sinema also voted in favor of a motion introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, to recommit a bill to the House Appropriations Committee. The intention was to get the committee to amend the bill by allocating $2.4 billion to FEMA’s National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. About $840 million would have come from ICE’s budget and $1.6 billion from U.S. Customs and Border Protection's allocation for border barriers. (The motion failed.) Jackson Lee argued that instead of funding a border wall and ICE detention facilities, more money was needed for pre-disaster funding, especially in light of Hurricane Harvey's aftermath in Texas and Louisiana. "We do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention centers; but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters," said Jackson Lee. Sinema’s counter argument In spite of those votes, Sinema’s spokeswoman Helen Hare said McSally’s claim ignores a big part of the story. Sinema voted in favor of a 10 percent funding increase for ICE, compared to fiscal year 2017. Sinema over her years in Congress also has voted in favor of other appropriation bills funding ICE, her campaign said. Moreover, Sinema was one of 18 Democrats who voted in favor of a July resolution stating explicit support for ICE officers and personnel and denouncing calls to abolish the agency. Most Democrats voted "present." That measure came to the floor as Republican House leaders sought to put Democrats on the record regarding their position on ICE. Sinema in July also told azfamily.com that "abolishing ICE isn’t realistic and it doesn’t make any sense." While the agency removed criminal immigrants, Sinema said, "most Americans would agree that we could use some reform." Our ruling McSally said Sinema "voted to cut ICE." McSally’s evidence are votes Sinema cast on measures seeking to take funds away from ICE to give them to FEMA and the Coast Guard. But McSally’s claim ignores Sinema’s broader voting record. Sinema has also voted to increase funds for ICE and cast a vote supporting ICE and denouncing calls to eliminate the agency. McSally’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-00251	Says Brendan Kelly "spent his career" supporting Nancy Pelosi.	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/oct/05/mike-bost/illinois-race-congress-mike-bost-makes-head-scratc/	To hear U.S. Rep. Mike Bost tell it, his 2018 election challenger in Illinois has "spent his career" supporting Nancy Pelosi. Not only that, says Bost, a Republican, in a TV ad, but Democrat Brendan Kelly has spent that career also supporting Mike Madigan, the speaker of the Illinois House. This seemed puzzling. Kelly started his post-Navy career as a county employee. Since 2010 he has been state’s attorney — the top prosecutor — for St. Clair County, Ill., a county bordering St. Louis, Mo. Prosecutors don’t get votes in the state Legislature. They don’t vote in Congress. So how has Kelly "spent his career" supporting the top Democratic legislative leaders? We asked the Bost campaign, and the answer is still puzzling. The ad The ad has two parts, first telling voters what Bost wants them to know about his opponent, then saying what he wants them to know about himself. Bost was in the Illinois House for 20 years until winning his congressional seat in 2014. Seated at a table and wearing an open-collar, button-down shirt, he says: "Folks, they’re at it again. I’ve spent 20 years fighting Pelosi and Madigan; my opponent has spent his career supporting them." He then says, "I’ve never stopped fighting for our families. Whether it’s creating a stronger economy or bringing our steel jobs back or reforming the VA to ensure better care for our veterans, or fighting for fair trade and a level playing field, I’ve never wavered." The "support" So how has Kelly, a prosecutor, spent his career supporting Pelosi and Madigan? Bost’s campaign sent PolitiFact several articles on Kelly’s fundraising. The articles pointed out that even though Kelly says he wants someone other than Pelosi to be the next U.S. House Democratic leader, he has benefitted from Pelosi’s fundraising. That was the very headline in a Real Clear Politics article in April: "Non-Supporter of Pelosi Benefits From Her Fundraising." An article in the St. Louis American in late April said that U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), came to East St. Louis to stump for Kelly. The DCCC tries to get Democrats elected to Congress, and Lujan was Pelosi’s pick for the chairmanship, making him part of her team. Pelosi, Lujan and a number of incumbent Illinois congressional Democrats, including Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, sponsored a Washington fundraiser on April 25 for four Illinois Democrats -- including Kelly -- hoping to join them in Congress if elected, according to another piece of backup material the Bost campaign sent us. Finally, there was an article on June 1 in the Illinois Review: "Pelosi to raise funds for Democratic contenders." What this means From these and other articles, we know that Kelly wants someone else to head the Democratic caucus in the U.S. House. Pelosi wants him elected anyway and is raising money for him and other Democrats. This has been a theme in 2018 congressional coverage, with Republicans saying these Democrats are hypocrites. Kelly told Real Clear Politics for its story that he doesn’t support Pelosi as his party’s leader but that the Washington fundraising invitation came from the Illinois Democratic congressional delegation, not Pelosi. We asked the Bost campaign again: How does Pelosi’s fundraising help show that Kelly, a county officeholder, "spent his career supporting" Pelosi and Madigan? "We might be arguing over semantics here," Bost campaign spokesman George O’Connor answered in an email. "Brendan Kelly's liberal record and fundraising speaks for itself and shows that he's already in Pelosi's pocket." Had Bost said as much in the ad, we might find ourselves examining that claim. But that is not what Bost said in an ad to voters in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District. Kelly’s campaign, of course, disagrees with Bost. Here is what Kelly campaign spokesman Sam Barrett said: "Brendan has been the state's attorney in St. Clair County for the past eight years. Before that he was the county clerk and before that he was an assistant state's attorney. And before law school he served in the U.S. Navy. "He has never voted for Nancy Pelosi, has vowed in multiple interviews that he won't and hasn't taken a dime from her campaign account nor her leadership account." Our ruling You can make a case that since Kelly is a Democrat, he supports the general ideals of top Democrats, be they in Washington or Springfield. But to single out Pelosi in particular, and even Madigan, and say Kelly has spent his career supporting them is a stretch. He has never had a vote on legislation, Democrat- or Republican-sponsored. Much of his career has involved prosecution, and occurred about 800 miles from where Pelosi presides over her party. Pelosi has raised money for Kelly, not vice versa. Even if her fundraising assistance was a sign of reciprocal support from Kelly — which is a reach — it occurred in 2018, a single year in Kelly’s significantly longer career. Turn up the flames.

The phrase "1year only" in Mr Rudd's tweet does not reflect the timing set out in the 2013 arrangement he signed. The document says the deal with PNG was for "an initial" 12-month period, which was to be followed by annual reviews. The arrangement could, and in fact did, continue beyond 12 months. And this timeframe relates only to the processing and resettlement arrangement with PNG. The Rudd government's overarching policy that asylum seekers arriving by boat without visas would not be settled in Australia was not described during key announcements at the time as being only for a short period. Mr Rudd's repeated message in the run-up to the September 2013 election was that "from now on" the business model of people smugglers wouldn't work "any more" because people arriving by boat without visas would "never" be permanently settled in Australia.

pomt-13166	Says an election clerk in Green Bay refused to allow early voting on the UW-Green Bay campus because she "was afraid it would help Democrats," showing "outrageous partisan bias."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/28/our-democracy-2020/did-wisconsin-election-clerk-block-early-voting-be/	When The Nation revealed what it described as a Republican effort to suppress voting in Green Bay, news outlets around Wisconsin and across the country quickly responded with their own versions of the story. The article from The Nation, a magazine that describes itself as the flagship of the political left, called out the Green Bay city clerk for being opposed to opening a special early voting site at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Featured was an email in which the clerk, who is responsible for administering elections, expressed concern about giving an advantage to Democrats. A group called Our Democracy 2020 responded to the article the next day, Oct. 26, 2016, with a news release that made this charge: "To refuse to allow early voting on the UW-Green Bay campus because the clerk was afraid it would help Democrats not only shows outrageous partisan bias, it also interferes with the exercise of our most basic right." The clerk did express fear that opening a satellite location for early voting on campus would help Democrats. But in rejecting the campus site -- which would have been the only satellite location in the city -- was the clerk trying to avoid giving an unfair advantage to any political party, as election clerks by state law are supposed to do? Or was she showing "outrageous partisan bias?" The group and the backstory This is the first time we’ve checked Our Democracy 2020, a Madison-based coalition that formed in January 2015. The group, whose members include Common Cause Wisconsin and an affiliate of One Wisconsin Now, says its priorities include seeking changes in voting rights by the year 2020. The early voting at issue here is more formally known as in-person absentee voting -- that is, casting a ballot in person before election day. In July 2016, in a lawsuit involving One Wisconsin Now, a federal judge struck down limits on early voting that were approved by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers. As a result, cities were allowed to offer early voting in more locations, not just at City Hall. Milwaukee and Madison added satellite locations, but so far, Green Bay and most other communities in Wisconsin have not. (On election day, you must vote at the designated polling place near your home. But early in-person voting can be done at any location in your city that offers it.) The Green Bay situation The email featured in The Nation’s article, as well as related emails, were provided to the magazine by the One Wisconsin Now affiliate, which the article said obtained the emails through a public records request. The liberal advocacy group later provided the emails to us. They show that on Aug. 23, 2016, in the weeks after the court ruling, state Rep. Eric Genrich, D-Green Bay, began asking Green Bay City Clerk Kris Teske what her plan was regarding Green Bay offering early voting. He said he would like to see the city offer multiple satellite locations; UW-Green Bay was not mentioned. Teske said in her first reply: "I’m very reluctant to have a satellite location for (ballot) security purposes and it is not budgeted for." Two days later, more emails were exchanged. Teske told Genrich the city would offer early voting at her office, leading Genrich to ask her again about multiple satellite locations. Teske replied: "I don’t know what else there is to discuss," she began, reiterating that she lacks staff and money for satellite voting, and adding: "There is no reason why anyone can’t either vote in our office, ask for an absentee ballot to be mailed to them, or vote on election day." Genrich persisted, asking for a meeting with Teske, and he evidently somehow conveyed to Teske that he wanted satellite voting at UW-Green Bay. (Long lines at the UW-Green Bay polling site for Wisconsin’s April 2016 primary election were cited as one reason for opening an early voting site on the campus.) Teske's reply, in the email featured in The Nation article, was sent the next day, Aug. 26, 2016, to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission. It read: I have a state representative who is being very persistent about having an alternate polling location at UWGB. I don’t like the idea at all for many reasons: Staffing, ballot security, budget, etc. He is on the ballot for 25 of our wards. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on election day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the Democrats and he is a Democrat. I have spoken with our (mayoral) chief of staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn't going to happen. A response came two weeks later, on Sept. 9, 2016, from Nathan Judnic, legal counsel for the Wisconsin Election Commission. He wrote that budget and ballot-security concerns are legitimate reasons for not offering satellite locations. But he also told Teske that if the UW-Green Bay polling site "is OK for election day, and there is no political advantage then, I’m not sure what the difference is for in-person absentee voting at that same location." Teske, in turn, told Judnic that if she could open a satellite location, it would not be at UW-Green Bay because the campus is difficult to navigate and therefore students would likely be the only early voters in the city using it. A final note on the partisanship part of the claim regarding Teske: Teske does not show up in a database of donor to state political candidates. She was appointed city clerk by Green Bay Mayor James Schmitt. The mayor’s position is nonpartisan, but Schmitt backed the controversial move by Walker to strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees. And in March 2016 he attended a Donald Trump presidential campaign rally in Green Bay. Our rating Our Democracy 2020 says Teske refused to allow early voting on the UW-Green Bay campus because she "was afraid it would help Democrats," showing "outrageous partisan bias." Teske did express concern about giving an advantage to Democrats because of her belief that the site would be in area with more voters who support Democrats, and because the site was requested by a Democratic state lawmaker. But Teske also cited other reasons for not supporting the campus site for early voting -- including a lack of funding, a concern for ballot security and a concern for a state law that prohibits offering a satellite site that gives an advantage to any political party.

pomt-01400	"We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/12/john-mccain/mccain-we-were-told-thered-be-no-ebola-united-stat/	Early Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a second person had contracted Ebola in the United States. The patient is a female nurse in Dallas, who had treated the first patient diagnosed in the United States -- Thomas Eric Duncan, who came into contact with Ebola in Liberia, fell ill in Dallas and died there Oct. 8. The CDC believes the nurse, who had been taking CDC-mandated precautions, was exposed to Ebola because of a "breach in protocol." The new case is fanning the fears of those who think the government is not doing enough to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the United States -- despite the CDC’s repeated assurances that it is highly unlikely the disease would spread here. In light of the news, the Sunday talk shows shifted from their scheduled topics to discuss the case. On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- invited on the show to talk about U.S. military activity in Iraq -- said it’s not obvious to the public that anyone in the government is taking charge over Ebola. "Americans have to be reassured here," McCain said on Oct. 12, 2014. "I don’t think we are comforted by the fact that we were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States, and obviously that’s not correct." At a press conference Sunday, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said there’s a risk that the Dallas area might see additional cases in coming days because of this possible "breach in protocol." However, the organization remains "confident that wider spread in the community can be prevented." We decided to look back and see if any official said that a case of Ebola would "never" come to the United States. Although many media outlets and health care officials have urged people not to panic about Ebola, we could not find a single instance where someone said it would "never" get here. As far as we can tell, the CDC and the President Barack Obama’s message has been the same throughout the epidemic, which began in Africa in December: It’s possible a case might make its way to the United States, but a full-fledged outbreak is highly unlikely. (We reached out to McCain’s staff, but they never got back to us.) The administration’s reasoning: America’s health system is much better prepared to fight diseases like Ebola than those in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the disease has been spreading. Here’s some of the CDC’s statements: July 28, after two Americans contracted the disease in Africa: "There is no significant risk in the U.S. While it is unlikely that the disease would spread if imported into the United States, the recent infections in U.S. health care workers working abroad highlight the need for vigilance." (The CDC has issued periodic updates on Ebola since March, but this was the first one we could find that addressed the disease spreading to the United States.) Aug. 13, press release: "A disease threat anywhere in the world is a threat everywhere in the world, and CDC is preparing for any possibility, including that a traveler might become ill with Ebola while in the United States. Although Ebola poses very little or no risk to the U.S. community at large, CDC and health care providers in the United States need to be prepared." Sept. 17, testimony at congressional hearing: "We do not view Ebola as a significant public health threat to the United States. … It is possible that infected travelers may arrive in the United States, despite all efforts to prevent this; therefore we need to ensure the United States' public health and health care systems are prepared to rapidly manage cases to avoid further transmission." The White House: July 31, press briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest: "The CDC has concluded that there is no significant risk in the United States from the current Ebola outbreak. And while it is unlikely that the disease would spread if the virus were detected in the United States, the CDC is taking action to alert health care workers in the U.S. and remind them how to isolate and test suspected patients while following strict infection control procedures." Sept. 16, Obama’s remarks at the CDC: "First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low." Oct. 8, Obama’s statement to state and local officials, after Duncan (the first Dallas patient) died: "Because we’ve got a world-class medical system, because we’ve put in place tough safety measures, because of the work that many of you have done in conjunction with organizations like the CDC and dealing with infectious disease generally, and because of the nature of Ebola and the fact that it’s not something involving airborne transmission, the chance of an Ebola outbreak in the United States remains extremely low. … I’m confident that so long as we work together, and we’re operating with an appropriate sense of urgency that we will prevent an outbreak from happening here." The common refrain in all those comments? A widespread outbreak is extremely unlikely in the United States. But individual or isolated cases were possible, hence the need for the CDC to be ready. Our ruling McCain said, "We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States." Based on public statements, Obama and CDC officials have repeatedly said there’s a chance an Ebola case could appear in the United States, but the possibility of an outbreak is extremely low. We found no instance in which an official said Ebola would "never" make it here -- rather, it has always been acknowledged as a possibility. We rate McCain’s claim False.

pomt-03777	Says that Secretary of State Jon Husted and former secretary Jennifer Brunner both have supported a provision in Senate Bill 47 that would limit the days organizers have to collect signatures for initiative and referendum petitions.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/01/bill-seitz/says-secretary-state-jon-husted-and-former-secreta/	Legislation signed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich on March 22 has infuriated Democrats and advocacy groups who say it will make it harder for voters to repeal laws and introduce their own. Senate Bill 47, sponsored by Sen. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, sets strict rules on the time organizers have to collect signatures when mounting a petition drive to strike down laws. The bill, which passed swiftly through the legislature, will essentially cut at least two weeks from the existing timetable. Part of SB 47, which Seitz affectionately calls the "Stop in the Name of Love Provision," would prohibit organizers from collecting signatures while the secretary of state verifies submitted petitions. Under current law, organizers have 90 days to collect signatures before submitting the petition to the secretary of state. Organizers now can collect signatures to bolster their petition while the secretary of state reviews the initial petition, which has taken between 16 and 58 days. SB 47 will put a stop to that. Seitz says his bill would prevent potential malevolence by secretaries of state who could game the system in their favor -- quickly verifying a petition they hope will fail, or slow-walking a petition they hope will succeed. The Republican senator’s efforts riled the liberal side of the aisle and advocacy groups like the League of Women Voters of Ohio, We Are Ohio and the Ohio Fair Elections Network, which fear SB 47 would infringe on the constitutional right to initiative and referendum Ohioans granted themselves more than a century ago. The senator brushed off the opposition on March 13 during his sponsor testimony before the House Policy and Legislative Oversight Committee, saying his bill had major bipartisan allies: Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted and his Democratic predecessor Jennifer Brunner. "The current secretary of state supports this provision, and the previous secretary of state supported this provision," Seitz said. PolitiFact Ohio decided to get to the bottom of it. A call to Husted quickly propelled the Truth-O-Meter in a positive direction. "Sen. Seitz is on the right path," Husted said. "There is certainly the potential for the secretary of state to slow down or speed up the process. The lack of guidance in the revised code certainly allows for that to happen." Proponents of the bill have not been able to cite an instance in which the secretary of state has taken advantage of the current system. But Husted’s support of the "Stop in the Name of Love Provision" is clearly bubbled in. Brunner, on the other hand, said she is no such booster. The former secretary of state testified against SB 47 on March 19 during a House committee meeting in which she told legislators "If you pass this lickety-split, it’s going to make you look very bad." Brunner, who served as Ohio’s secretary of state from from 2007 to 2011, said Seitz misled the House committee when citing her as an advocate of the contentious provision. "No, I don’t support it," Brunner said in an interview with PolitiFact Ohio. However, Brunner’s explanation as to why she may have been lassoed into the SB 47 debate fogs the Truth-O-Meter glass. Brunner had worked with Seitz in 2010 on a now-abandoned compromise bill that would have made numerous changes to election laws. Seitz said those talks birthed the "Stop in the Name of Love Provision." The bill aimed to set the same restrictions as SB 47 on the number of days voters could use to collect signatures for a referendum. The language in SB 47 is cut from the same cloth as the 2010 bill, with a difference: SB 47 speaks to referendums and initiatives, whereas the old bill only addressed referendums. Seitz said Brunner approved the referendum measure in 2010. Brunner doesn’t deny that, although she has a different view now. "I had agreed to it two-and-a-half years ago," Brunner said. "I think I should not have agreed to it because it limits what is granted in the Constitution." So, let’s account for the facts. Seitz said Husted supports the controversial SB 47 provision, which is accurate. Seitz also said Brunner supported it -- the past tense being paramount -- which is partially correct. The old provision didn’t include language about initiative petitions addressed in SB 47. In addition, the senator failed to fully explain Brunner’s past endorsement of petition restrictions, and might have left the impression that she was a current supporter of the provision.

pomt-01163	"According to HUD, it is patently unfair and socially unjust that wealthy people can live in an exclusive neighborhood."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/14/mike-stenhouse/mike-stenhouse-according-hud-its-unfair-unjust-wea/	For more than three years, the Rhode Island Division of Planning has been working on RhodeMap RI, a long-term economic development plan meant to help guide efforts to improve the state’s economy. The process, partly financed by a $1.9-million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), didn’t get much notice until a nearly 200-page draft of the plan was released in mid-September, igniting a firestorm of controversy. Critics of the plan denounced it as a thinly disguised blueprint for social engineering. If it is implemented, they say, local communities will be forced to cede authority to the federal government on issues such as affordable housing and land use, and individual property rights will be under threat. Supporters, including Governor Chafee and the planners and community leaders who drafted the plan, say it’s a well crafted, comprehensive guide that will help move the state’s economy forward over the decades ahead. They say there’s nothing in the plan that would infringe on individual property rights or local home rule. The debate grew so heated at one meeting a shouting match broke out, with charges of racism and bigotry hurled. And last week, at a meeting of the Statewide Planning Council, opponents called it unconstitutional, socialist and even treasonous. Nonetheless, the council voted unanimously to adopt it. Mike Stenhouse, CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, a conservative research group, has led the opposition. A few weeks ago, he talked about the plan on WPRO-AM’s "The Dan Yorke Show." Yorke asked Stenhouse to cite a component of the plan "that highlights what you think is problematic." "I’m going to give you my interpretation," Stenhouse responded. "I don’t have their plan in front of me. What we believe, for instance, take Poppasquash Point in Bristol. According to HUD, it is patently unfair and socially unjust that wealthy people can live in an exclusive neighborhood." We wondered whether Stenhouse was right about HUD’s view of wealthy neighborhoods such as Poppasquash Point, one of the state’s priciest enclaves. When we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he told us he was not directly quoting HUD, but said that his statement was "an accurate interpretation of HUD’s openly stated intent." He provided links to multiple documents to support his position. While we don’t view Stenhouse’s statement as a direct quote of HUD policy, we do believe that listeners who heard Stenhouse’s preface -- "according to HUD" -- would assume he was summarizing HUD’s policy. Stenhouse’s backup is comprised primarily of links to a news story and an editorial in Investor’s Business Daily and links to various legal documents and HUD regulations. The Dec. 13, 2013 news story quoted an official from New York’s Westchester County -- more on Westchester in a moment -- as saying that, in HUD’s view, "even quarter-acre (lot) single-family zoning …may very well be discriminatory and perpetuate 'segregation." Stenhouse characterized those comments as "HUD’s words," but they are actually the words of a HUD critic, not the agency itself. The June 20, 2014 editorial criticized HUD’s proposed "Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing" rule, characterizing it as a mechanism to force communities to change zoning laws to allow construction of "subsidized and other affordable housing to bring more low-income minorities into `white suburbs.’" But again, these are the words of a HUD critic, not the agency. The other documents largely come from a long-running legal dispute in Westchester County. In 2006, the Anti-Discrimination Center, a fair housing advocacy group, sued Westchester County in federal court, arguing the county had defrauded taxpayers by accepting $50 million in HUD grant money while failing to remove barriers to fair housing as required by law. A federal judge ruled in the group’s favor. In 2009, the county reached a landmark settlement agreeing to spend some $50 million to build or acquire 750 affordable-housing units, 630 in communities in which African Americans comprise less than 3 percent of the population and Hispanics make up less than 7 percent. The conflict continues as Westchester County has yet to complete an analysis of local zoning and, thus, has lost more than $20 million in federal grants. Stenhouse highlighted passages in the Westchester settlement agreement that show HUD seeking to enforce the Fair Housing Act by requiring wealthy communities, such as Bedford and Scarsdale, to take steps to increase housing availability for Hispanics, African Americans and low-income residents. The act, adopted in 1968, prohibits discrimination by housing providers, such as landlords and real estate agencies, based on race, religion, sex, national origin, whether a family has children, or disability. Any community that accepts HUD funds must comply with the act. Stenhouse also refers to the federal Community Development Block Grant program regulations and to HUD’s proposed Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. Under the rule, communities that receive HUD grants would be required to certify that they’ll work toward analyzing and removing barriers to fair housing. None of the documents, however, show HUD targeting wealthy people or describing exclusive neighborhoods as "unfair" or "unjust." After reviewing the documents Stenhouse provided, we came to two conclusions. First, it is clear that HUD and the federal government say it is illegal for communities to enact zoning and other ordinances that, in effect, exclude low-income, minority and other protected groups. Second, HUD’s policies relate to the planning and zoning actions of governing bodies, not the personal actions of individuals. We found nothing in the documents to support Stenhouse’s claim. We also reached out to national housing experts and academics specializing in housing law. Four got back to us. None agreed with Stenhouse’s characterization of HUD’s regulations. "I’ve never seen that language used by HUD or anyone at HUD," said Daniel Lauber, past president of the American Planning Association and of the American Institute of Certified Planners and current president of Planning/Communications, a national firm that assists communities with land-use issues. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule and Community Development Block Grant regulations "are all aimed at removing barriers to fair housing that artificially force segregation on us," Lauber said. Such obstacles include discriminatory real estate practices; zoning policies imposing large lot sizes; and artificially increasing the cost of housing. "When they enter into these contracts to take HUD money, they know they are going to have to further fair housing." (Bristol, home of the wealthy neighborhood Stenhouse mentioned, received $655,615 Community Development Block Grants through HUD from 2011 to 2013, according to the state Division of Planning.) According to David Reiss, a professor of real estate and housing policy at Brooklyn Law School, "HUD does not interpret the FHA [Fair Housing Act] to mean that `wealthy people’ can’t `live in an exclusive neighborhood.’" "An exclusive neighborhood is an expensive one – the FHA does not ban expensive neighborhoods." Reiss continued in an email statement. "What it does do is ban exclusionary practices. Exclusionary practices are those that exclude people based on certain of their characteristics such as their race, sex or religion. To my knowledge, HUD has never taken the position that merely living in an exclusive – that is, expensive -- neighborhood violates the FHA." We also asked HUD whether Stenhouse had accurately characterized its rules. "There are simply no policies, practices, regulations or anything that can validate such hyper hyperbole," Brian Sullivan, a public affairs officer with HUD, said in an email statement. Our ruling Mike Stenhouse said "According to HUD, it is patently unfair and socially unjust that wealthy people can live in an exclusive neighborhood." There’s no doubt that HUD has challenged what it considers to be discriminatory practices at the community level, including exclusionary zoning ordinances. But that’s not nearly the same as objecting to the right of wealthy people to live in expensive neighborhoods. We rule Stenhouse’s claim False.

The headline on story posted Sept. 24, 2017, on TheLastLineOfDefense.org read, "Breaking: Fox Sports cancels all NFL broadcasts ‘until players respect the flag.’ " Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The post noted that President Donald Trump had demanded on Twitter that NFL players "stop disrespecting our Flag & Country" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand. "Fox Sports took things a step farther Sunday morning with a bombshell announcement that until players either stop disrespecting our country or are fired to do so, they will not be airing any games," the story read. The story linked to footage from Fox News Channel showing on-air personalities discussing the row between the president and the league. Fox didn’t really boycott any games, of course, because the story is fake. More than 200 players across the NFL chose not to stand to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism, and Fox still broadcast games on Sept. 24. The network has paid $1.1 billion for the rights to show National Football Conference games, plus playoff games and the Super Bowl every three years. The same article also was reported in posts on several other websites, without any indication it was from TheLastLineOfDefense.org. That can cause confusion, because TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs only made-up stories. A footer note on the bottom of the page said "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." The site’s "about us" page included a disclaimer that read, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." TheLastLineOfDefense.org was created by a man named Christopher Blair, who has told PolitiFact he writes absurd claims to fool conservative readers into believing wild stories. It’s not clear who wrote the story about Fox Sports. The author, who is only identified as "Freedom" on the site, replied to an email we sent, but would not provide their real name. In any event, it’s clear that Fox did not shun the NFL as part of a punitive campaign against players protesting the national anthem. We rate this bogus claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-08083	"Every student paying out-of-state tuition actually covers more than the cost of instruction."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/17/james-jolly/university-system-official-says-out-state-tuition-/	As leaders of the state's public higher education system mulled whether to bar illegal immigrants, money was on their minds. Is this financially troubled state paying for illegal immigrants to go to college? they asked. They're not, according to a State Board of Regents fact-finding committee. Illegal immigrants pay out-of-state tuition, and "every student paying out-of-state tuition actually covers more than the cost of instruction," Regent James Jolly said in a newsletter issued by the board. More than the cost of instruction? That sounds like a lot. AJC PolitiFact Georgia contacted the University System of Georgia Board of Regents, showed the regents' data to experts and talked to other experts to check out this claim. The debate over illegal immigrants in Georgia public colleges flared with the March 30 arrest of Jessica Colotl, a Kennesaw State University student who was found guilty last month on a misdemeanor charge of driving without a license. It turned out Colotl, a political science major, had been brought illegally to the U.S. from Mexico as a child. College officials disclosed Colotl was charged in-state tuition, even though state rules required that illegal immigrants pay much higher out-of-state rates. The Board of Regents created the Residency Verification Committee to find out more about illegal immigrants in state schools. In October, the State Board of Regents voted to ban illegal immigrants from Georgia's top public colleges starting next fall. But the debate won't end there. During the upcoming legislative session, lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to bar these students from all public colleges in the state. And so we return to the question of whether out-of-state tuition covers more than the cost of educating students at Georgia's public colleges. The subject is more complicated than you would expect, experts told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. College tuition is not strictly based on how much it costs to educate a student. It's often not even clear to experts what that cost is. That's because professors do more than teach. They also conduct research and use their expertise to help the public. One estimate placed teaching time for professors at research-oriented institutions at best at 40 percent of faculty workload. Even though professors spend much of their time on other things, their salaries get classified as an instruction cost, said Robert Toutkoushian, a professor with the University of Georgia's Institute of Higher Education. This can artificially inflate how much a college spends on educating its students. You can underestimate the cost, too, Toutkoushian said. A professor's research and public service experience can improve his teaching, but it's hard to assign a dollar value to that. The Board of Regents' committee did not dwell on these complexities. Instead, it added all expenditures for teaching and related activities, plus state-funded school repair, renovation and infrastructure costs to figure out the total cost of educating the system's students. The total cost of instruction: $3.62 billion for fiscal year 2011. To get the cost per student, it then divided that $3.62 billion by 280,078, which is roughly the number of full-time students in the system. The regents found that for every category of school, the average cost of educating a student is significantly lower than out-of-state tuition. For research universities such as Georgia Tech, it's $18,310. Average out-of-state tuition and fees there total $25,859. For regional universities such as Kennesaw State, the cost is $10,955, while out-of-state tuition and fees are $17,230. For two-year and state colleges such as Georgia Perimeter, it's $8,632. Tuition and fees are $10,147. Tuition and fee figures do not include room and board. College finance experts agreed that these results are not surprising. "In general, that's true," said Jane Wellman, executive director of the Delta Project on Postsecondary Education Costs, Productivity, and Accountability. The nonprofit group studies higher education spending and affordability. While in-state tuition at public universities is typically lower than the cost of educating a student, out-of-state prices often exceed it, Wellman said. In Georgia, this is by design, according to Atlanta Journal-Constitution articles dating from the mid-1990s. The state's public colleges increased out-of-state tuition after complaints at the time that state money was being used to educate students from elsewhere. Still, to check out these numbers, we looked at other estimates. The Delta Project placed the 2008 average cost for education and related spending in Georgia's public research universities at $12,707. This is below the Board of Regents' estimates, which include certain operation and buildings costs that researchers at the Delta Project do not. For another perspective, we also looked at raw data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, a program of the U.S. Department of Education that collects numbers from more than 6,700 higher education institutions across the country. For fiscal year 2009, the combined cost of instruction, academic support and student services at the University of Georgia was $10,619. Again, that's less than UGA's out-of-state tuition and fees, which were $22,342 that year. Students who pay out-of-state tuition frequently receive scholarships and other money from their college to help them with costs, but if they cannot document their lawful immigration status, they are not eligible, said John Millsaps, a spokesman for the Board of Regents. Multiple approaches conclude that the cost of educating students in Georgia's public colleges is less than full out-of-state tuition and fees.

pomt-00223	Capital punishment is a "specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/oct/11/jeff-bartos/lt-gov-hopeful-jeff-bartos-says-death-penalty-dete/	Jeff Bartos, the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania lieutenant governor, said in a debate Saturday that there isn’t yet consensus on whether the death penalty serves as an effective criminal deterrent. "In terms of capital punishment and my views on capital punishment, the jury is very much still out about whether it’s a deterrent factor or not, but what I am certain of is a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes — what we see happening on school grounds and when we see people slaughtering children, and we see certain people sitting on death row who have wantonly just destroyed families and lives, they deserve the death penalty and to take that away from a judge and a jury, in my opinion, is wrong," Bartos said during a pre-recorded debate filmed Saturday afternoon aired that evening by WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh. The preceding question mentioned gubernatorial running mate Scott Wagner’s proposed policy of a mandatory death sentence for school shooters in asking Bartos about his position on the death penalty. Asked to clarify Bartos’ answer Wednesday, Andrew Romeo, a spokesman with the Wagner-Bartos campaign, said by email, "Since (the proposed policy) has not been tried yet in Pennsylvania, there is no way to tell whether or not it will be a deterrent, but Scott and Jeff believe it will be." But is there evidence to support their belief? And does 60 years of research support the notion that the death penalty has any role in deterring criminal activity? A lack of evidence Both death penalty advocates and abolitionists have troves of competing data on the effectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent, to say nothing of the ethical, moral and religious arguments around its use. Some studies point to comparable or nearly identical murder rates between states with the death penalty and those without it. Others argue a statistical correlation between the death penalty and reductions in murder rates. But the 30,000-foot view offers no such assurances and certainly doesn’t support the notion of the death penalty as a significant factor in preventing crimes, the most heinous included. "I don’t know empirically that anyone can demonstrate it’s a deterrent," said John Rago, an associate professor at the Duquesne University School of Law. "The death penalty has always struck me as an expression of society’s condemnation of a particular act, as opposed to an attempt to deter others from doing it." Rago pointed to a June 2018 report on the death penalty for the Pennsylvania Joint State Government Commission. In it, a task force and advisory committee reports to the commission that research on the subject of the death penalty as a deterrence factor is severely lacking. "In a state like Pennsylvania with a relatively large number of death sentences but almost no executions, the deterrent effect of the death penalty is attenuated, regardless of whether a more vigorously applied death penalty would have a deterrent effect" the study states, citing decades of research in supporting this conclusion. ‘Nobody thinks they’re going to get caught’ In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf imposed a moratorium on executions shortly after taking office in 2015. The Pa. Department of Corrections reported a 0.6 percent decrease in murders the following year. But Department of Health records show 48 more homicides in 2016 — the most recent year for which data are available — than in 2015. Decades earlier, in the midst of a de facto four-year moratorium on executions imposed by the Supreme Court, FBI data show Pennsylvania murders and nonnegligent manslaughters rose each year before falling to a five-year low in 1976, the year SCOTUS reinstated the death penalty. 1972: 721 1973: 754 1974: 795 1975: 808 1976: 719 In that same time, the national total of murders and nonnegligent manslaughters rose before also falling in 1976. 1972: 18,670 1973: 19,640 1974: 20,710 1975: 20,510 1976: 18,780 The numbers in Pennsylvania and nationwide have fallen and risen in the decades since. But, again, experts say causality between the death penalty’s status and murder rates has not been convincingly demonstrated. Marshall Dayan, an assistant federal public defender in the capital habeas unit of the federal public defender’s office for the western district of Pennsylvania, was one of 30 advisory committee members behind the June report to the Pennsylvania Joint State Government Commission. He said he’s represented people charged with or convicted of capital crimes for more than 30 years and that anecdotally he’s found "the death penalty isn't a deterrent because nobody thinks they're going to be caught." "So over the course of 30 years my clients have told me ‘Of course we didn't care. It made no difference to us whether it’s death or life without parole or boiling us alive in hot oil," Dayan added. Daniel Nagin, a researcher and professor of public policy and statistics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College, said of this outlook in a 2014 piece by the Washington Post, "It’s the certainty of apprehension that’s been demonstrated consistently to be an effective deterrent, not the severity of the ensuing consequences." In a phone conversation Wednesday, Nagin, who was chair of the Committee on Deterrence and the Death Penalty, the group behind a 2012 report for the National Academy of Sciences on this subject, said the conclusion of their review was that the research on the death penalty was so flawed that it was "uninformative on the question of whether there was a deterrent effect of the death penalty, that is whether the death penalty increased [crime], decreased [crime] or had no effect…" Nagin said the body of research was deemed flawed, in large part, because it failed to take into account whether the death penalty was a greater deterrent than other options available to the criminal justice system. He said to his knowledge that hasn’t changed in the six years since. Dayan said the question of whether the death penalty is a more effective deterrent than other penalties is crucial when considering the death penalty’s role in preventing crime. "The question is not whether the death penalty deters in a vacuum," he said, "the question is whether there's any additional deterrent effect of threatening to kill somebody versus threatening to incarcerate someone for a long period of time or forever." Dayan added, "It’s not like the options are either you get sentenced to death or we give you the key to the city." Advice for policy makers From a public policy perspective, the question may be doubly relevant. While pro-death penalty advocates have pointed to the sense of closure it can offer victims’ families, the underpinnings of state-sanctioned killings is that they preserve life by looming over criminal deliberations and, when effective, preventing atrocities. And while it also hasn’t been conclusively determined that the death penalty does deter crime, it also hasn’t been demonstrated that it doesn’t, Nagin explained. "Policy makers should not look to this scientific community or scientific evidence to make judgements about effectiveness of death penalty as a deterrent," he said. As for Bartos, if he’s hinging his support for a mandatory death penalty for school shooters on the penalty’s ability to prevent these shootings from happening, his personal conviction may be the only thing conclusively linking the two. "I want to stress that really smart social scientists have been looking at this for 60 years and have pretty consistently concluded that it can’t be proved one way or the other," Dayan said. "Sixty years with no conclusion suggests to me there is a conclusion, that is we can't either prove or disprove deterrence and so if you want to rest public policy on the deterrence rationale — the research just doesn’t support that." Our ruling Bartos had a point that the jury is still out on whether the death penalty is an effective deterrent. But he also says he’s certain it is "a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes." Most experts disagree, saying there is no convincing scientific evidence supporting this conclusion. Bartos’ statements also conflict with each other. For these reasons, and given the emphatic testimony of experts and the dearth of evidence they point to, we rate his claim about the death penalty being "a specific deterrent with the most heinous crimes" Mostly False.

pomt-08292	"Congresswoman Kathy Castor voted to spend $2.6 million to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/01/mike-prendergast/mike-prengergast-mailer-says-kathy-castor-voted-sp/	As attack ads go, the claim in a last-minute mailer (and accompanying radio ad) in a Florida congressional race is certainly an attention-grabber. It features a picture of two martinis behind the text: "Congresswoman Kathy Castor voted to spend $2.6 million to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly." The ad from Florida Republican Mike Prendergast also states on the front, "The more of our taxpayer dollars Castor and Pelosi waste on outrageous spending, the more jobs we lose in Tampa Bay-St. Petersburg." On the back, the ad lists "Examples of Kathy Castor's Spending Votes" and lists a bunch of outrageous-sounding programs. The source is listed as H.R. 1. That's the Democrats' economic stimulus package -- approved in March 2009. The list includes some projects that have frequently been cited by Republicans as prime examples of wasteful stimulus spending. For example, the mailer says Castor voted to spend "$2 million to capture and study exotic ants. " In Oregon, Republican Senate hopeful Jim Huffman claimed Democratic incumbent Sen. Ron Wyden voted to fund said study of exotic ants. Our partners at PolitiFact Oregon checked it out and found that Wyden’s vote for the stimulus did eventually lead to the funding of a study of exotic ants, but he never voted specifically for the project. He voted, through the stimulus, to direct more money to the National Science Foundation, which then distributed the funds as it saw fit. We rated Huffman's claim False. But the Prendergast claim that the stimulus included $2.6 million to teach prostitutes in China to drink responsibly was a new one to us. The Prendergast campaign directed us to a story about the project in CNSNews.com (The Right News. Right Now). The story ran under the headline, "U.S. Will Pay $2.6 Million to Train Chinese Prostitutes to Drink Responsibly on the Job," but that's a summary contested by the agency that awarded the grant. The 5-year, $2.6 million grant awarded by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health to Wayne State University in Detroit will allow Dr. Xiaoming Li, professor and director of the university's Prevention Research Center, to "establish and evaluate whether an alcohol and HIV intervention center can assist in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS among sex workers in China," according to a university press release announcing the grant. According to the release, "The findings could have ramifications for at-risk populations throughout the world." The research will take place specifically in Guangxi, China, where the sex trade is prevalent and the rate of HIV is ranked third among the country's provinces, the release states. A spokesman for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health told us the ad distorted the aim of the project. The grant "was not awarded for that purpose," John Bowersox told us via e-mail. "Rather, the researchers will use the grant to develop, implement, and evaluate an alcohol use and HIV risk reduction intervention program among female sex workers in China. This is in line with previous studies showing that social norms and institutional policy in commercial sex venues greatly influence alcohol use and sexual behavior among the sex workers in those venues. Studies such as these are needed to translate and adapt interventions that have proven to be effective in the U.S. to other settings and to learn from other conditions and cultures to inform our understanding of the causes, consequences, and differences in HIV-related risks, morbidity, and mortality in diverse populations. Preventing HIV infection is NIH’s highest priority for HIV-related research. We need to explore a range of research avenues in vulnerable populations around the world to learn the best ways to control the transmission of HIV." Bowersox noted that the grant went through the NIH's two-tier review process, "which includes a scientific and technical review as well as consideration by an Advisory Council that includes public representatives. The Council makes recommendations based on alignment of the grant application with the research priorities of the NIH." In an interview with CNSNews.com, Li said, "The purpose of the project is to try and develop an intervention program targeting HIV risk and alcohol use. So basically, it’s an alcohol and HIV risk reduction intervention project." "We want to get some understanding of the fundamental role of alcohol use and HIV risk," Li told CNSNews.com. "We use the population in China as our targeted population to look at the basic issues. I think the findings will benefit the American people, too." The CNSNews story ran on May 11, 2009. That was about the time that a lot of Republican members of Congress were putting out lists of stimulus projects they said were wasteful or unrelated to job creation. But, as the CNSNews.com story noted, the grant for the project was awarded in November 2008. That's pre-stimulus. It's also pre-Obama administration. So which vote actually led to the funding for the grant? That's a tricky question. Again, the grant was awarded in November 2008. That's part of the 2009 fiscal year (which began in October 2008). But the omnibus appropriations bill for 2009 wasn't approved until March of 2009. Castor voted for it. Castor also voted for the Fiscal Year 2008 consolidated appropriations bill, (H.R. 2764) in June 2007. But it is arguably another vote, a "continuing resolution" to continue funding programs at the same levels of the 2008 budget until an appropriations bill passed, that funded the grant. The resolution passed easily -- with scores of Republicans and most Democrats voting for it -- as a vote against would have meant a vote to cut off disaster and war funding. Castor voted for that, too (H.R. 2638) in June 2007. Again, these are all massive spending bills. It was one of those spending bills that actually funded the grant in question in Prendergast's mailer (contrary to the ad's claim that it was part of the stimulus). By e-mail, Robert J. Winsler, press secretary for the Prendergast campaign, told us that it didn't matter whether it was part of the stimulus. "While several reputable news sources reported the funds as part of stimulus, all reports have proven taxpayers funded the over two-and-a-half million dollar study, and none investigated how the money for the five-year grant was actually appropriated -- be it the stimulus bill or the 2009 budget for the NIH, both of which Rep. Castor voted in favor," Winsler said. It was "irrelevant" how many Republicans may have also supported the spending bills, because "Mike is a free-thinking candidate," Winsler said. "Let's not digress too far: the study existed, and one way or another the Congresswoman approved taxpayer money for it," Winsler said. "The real story here isn't the tiny print on the bottom of one of our mailers but rather why a representative who has let the unemployment rate rise so atrociously under her time in office is sending money overseas to study an illegal practice instead of working for the people she represents." But Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense called the ad's claim "an enormous stretch." Congress voted to allocate funding to the National Institutes for Health, to spend according to its discretion. The NIH, in turn, appropriated money to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which then decided to fund the grant in question. It wasn't an earmark, Ellis said. And, he noted the grant was awarded during the Bush (Republican) administration. "They are trying to make it seem like she voted on a bill about spending the money on that program, and in reality, that's not the case," Ellis said. One could argue that part of the problem with Congress is that legislators sign off on spending bills without knowing how every dollar will be spent. But, said Ellis, that's "too much information for anyone to maintain," and so spending is left to the discretion of various government departments. "They are trying to draw a direct line," Ellis said. "But it's a vote at 10,000 feet, and the decision was made on the ground." We have two problems with the ad's claim. No. 1, the ad distorts the purpose of the grant. More importantly, though, it was a grant awarded by the National Institutes for Health based on its own internal review process and was determined to be within the institute's mission and priorities. Castor voted to allocate money to the National Institutes for Health, but she had nothing to do with selecting the grant, and there was no mention of the grant in the bill she voted on. And it wasn't -- as the fine print of the mailer suggests -- even part of the economic stimulus. In fact, it was a grant awarded by a department of a Republican administration. We rate the ad's claim Pants on Fire.	None	Mike Prendergast	None	None	None	2010-11-01T17:54:32	2010-10-29	['China', 'Kathy_Castor']
pomt-01900	Dan Patrick was the only state senator "who voted against the Veteran Entrepreneurship Program, a program that assists veterans in successfully starting up their own businesses."	true	/texas/statements/2014/jul/03/leticia-van-de-putte/dan-patrick-was-sole-senator-oppose-veterans-progr/	Democrat Leticia Van de Putte told her party’s state convention her Republican opponent for lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, is so out of step, he stood alone against a program to help veterans. Van de Putte, of San Antonio, and Patrick, of Houston, both are members of the 31-member Texas Senate. In her speech, Van de Putte declared she’s watched Patrick’s Senate votes. "I mean," Van de Putte said, "Dan was the only vote, the only one in the entire Senate who voted against the Veteran Entrepreneurship Program, a program that assists veterans in successfully starting up their own businesses. That’s not putting Texas first." We wondered about this program and whether Patrick indeed was alone in opposition among the senators. On Van de Putte’s behalf, Manny Garcia, a Texas Democratic Party spokesman, pointed out by email that according to the state’s Senate Journal, which tracks Senate actions, Patrick voted April 18, 2013, against approval of a proposal related to the creation of the veteran entrepreneur program by the Texas Veterans Commission. According to the journal, Patrick asked to be recorded as voting against even taking up Senate Bill 1476. Patrick then voted against preliminary and final approval of the measure, according to the entry, which advanced to the House by a 29-1 margin; one senator was absent, according to the journal. To our inquiry, Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, emailed us that Patrick voted against the proposal "because it expanded the state's bureaucracy with a new function that would be more efficiently absorbed in a different agency." Separately, the non-partisan House Research Organization said in its May 2013 description of the proposal that opponents considered the legislation "unnecessary because it would spend state dollars for assistance already offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Patrick wasn’t the only legislator to oppose the measure. According to legislative records, Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, was the "no" vote on the proposal when it cleared the House Committee on Military & Veterans Affairs by 7-1. And on May 14, 2013, five House members asked to be recorded as voting against preliminary approval of the legislation, according to the House Journal. House members gave their final approval by 125-19, the journal shows, but afterward, five members reported intentions to vote "no" even though they were recorded as voting "yes." The proposal, signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry, required the Texas Veterans Commission to establish the "veteran entrepreneur program to perform outreach functions to improve veteran entrepreneurs' and business owners' awareness of federal and state benefits and services," according to an analysis by the Texas Senate Research Center. The effort, which relied on lawmakers ponying up funding, was projected to cost more than $210,000 a year, according to the legislation’s fiscal note. By email, commission spokesman Duncan McGhee told us the program fielded about $257,000 in funding for the two budget years starting September 2013. Since the law took effect, he said, it has helped nearly 1,300 veterans "toward entrepreneurship." Day to day, he said by phone, three staff people organize seminars around the state and give one-on-one business advice to veterans. Our ruling Van de Putte said Patrick was the only senator to vote against the Veteran Entrepreneurship Program. Ten-hut! We rate this claim as True.

Claire McCaskill and Attorney General Josh Hawley have traded allegations of being cozy with dark money — political money with an unknown source — during their Senate contest. McCaskill has tied Hawley to Citizens United, the group behind the famous Supreme Court case that redefined rules for campaign finance. "The people who got unlimited anonymous money from corporations into elections is a group called Citizens United," McCaskill said during a Q&A on Sept. 10 at Truman State University. "My opponent is endorsed by Citizens United. He is all down for the dark money." We decided to investigate the claim. Context, court cases, conservative organizations Citizens United is an interest group for conservative causes. According to its website, Citizens United performs a number of functions — including production of documentaries pushing conservative ideas, advocacy campaigns for issues and contributions to candidates. The 2010 Citizens United vs. Federal Election CommissionSupreme Court decision established corporations as people and money as speech. PolitiFact wrote in 2010: "While corporations are still barred from giving directly to federal candidates, they are no longer forced to create political action committees in order to spend money on electioneering. A corporation, the justices held, may simply spend funds from its own accounts." The Citizens United Political Victory Fund has donated $10,000 to Hawley’s Senate campaign (two $5,000 donations), per its website and FEC data. David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, wrote an op-ed favoring Hawley’s 2016 attorney general bid in USA Today entitled "Josh Hawley for Attorney General." "I was proud to be an early supporter of Josh Hawley for Attorney General and will support him again in his race for the Senate," Bossie wrote in a Fox News story published Oct. 23, 2017. The story detailed his support for a variety of conservative Senate candidates. Bossie was adamant that he hoped Hawley, someone he sees as outside the Republican establishment, would triumph over McCaskill, and he was particularly impressed with Hawley’s "fine work fighting for religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case at the U.S. Supreme Court." Hawley campaign spokeswoman Kelli Ford pointed out that McCaskill has benefitted from the dark money that she decried. In another fact-check, we found that dark money group Majority Forward has spent nearly $3 million opposing Hawley. Our ruling McCaskill said, "My opponent is endorsed by Citizens United." Campaign donations and writing from the group’s president confirm the statement. We rate the statement True.	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2018-10-25T11:48:12	2018-09-10	['None']

pomt-09780	"Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy" as Medicare Advantage.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/24/barack-obama/difference-medicare-medicare-advantage-maybe/	President Barack Obama defended plans to cut funding for a program called Medicare Advantage in an interview on This Week with George Stephanopolous . Stephanopolous cited defenders of Medicare Advantage, such as Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who say cutting the program isn't fair to people who are currently enrolled in the optional Medicare program. Obama vigorously defended his plan. Medicare Advantage programs, he said, get "about 14 percent more (in) overpayments, basically subsidies from taxpayers for a program that ordinary Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy. "Now, they package these things in ways that, in some cases, may make it more convenient for some consumers, but they're overcharging massively for it." Obama added that he would use the money to close the so-called "doughnut hole," a gap in prescription drug coverage for seniors. We know from our previous reporting that Medicare Advantage is more costly than regular Medicare. But we were curious if it had been proven that Medicare and Medicare Advantage produced the same patient outcomes. For those who need a little help on Medicare basics: Traditional Medicare is health insurance that the government offers to senior citizens. Seniors go to their regular doctors (as long as the doctors agree to accept Medicare), and Medicare picks up the bills. The billing system is called fee-for-service, which means that doctors bill for every service they provide. Anyone who is eligible for Medicare can choose to sign up for Medicare Advantage, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. It was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened. Some people prefer Medicare Advantage plans, though, because of convenience or because some plans offer extra benefits, such as additional coverage or even cash back through rebates on co-pays. About 23 percent of Medicare beneficiaries choose a Medicare Advantage plan. Medicare Advantage includes several types of programs, everything from HMOs to PPOs to traditional fee-for-service plans. The details of each plan tend to differ depending on geographic location. All this diversity means it's hard to talk about one set of outcomes for Medicare Advantage. We asked the White House what evidence it had to show that "Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy" as Medicare Advantage. Staffers pointed us to a March 2009 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, an independent congressional agency that advises Congress on Medicare policy. We read MedPAC's report, and it seemed pretty down on Medicare Advantage, primarily because of its expense. "Paying a plan more than the cost for delivering the same services under the FFS (fee-for-service) system is not an efficient use of Medicare funds, particularly in the absence of evidence that such extra payments result in better quality compared to FFS," the report said. But the report also noted how difficult it is to compare Medicare Advantage with traditional Medicare. The indicators of quality "differ greatly among plans and across plan types in MA (Medicare Advantage), and we currently do not have a basis for comparing plan performance with the quality of care in FFS Medicare." MedPac said it plans to study the topic and issue a report in March 2010 under a mandate from Congress. MedPac was able to report, however, that Medicare Advantage HMOs, especially established HMOs, tend to have better outcomes than other Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, a report from America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said that Medicare Advantage HMOs in California and Nevada reduced hospital days and readmissions compared with traditional Medicare. But HMO plans are not the areas of Medicare Advantage that are growing the most. "While payment policy in the MA program has led to growth in the number of plans available, growth in access to plans across the country, and increased enrollment, the additional funding has not necessarily resulted in cost containment or better quality of care for enrollees," MedPac concluded. "Much of the enrollment growth is in new plans, which are not showing improvement in quality." MedPAC is an independent agency, but we wondered if there was any other research on the topic. We checked with two independent policy experts on Medicare — Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund and Marilyn Moon of the American Institutes for Research — and they both said the information was limited. "There's not a lot of good data to compare, so there's not really good evidence to say one way or another," Guterman said of Medicare versus Medicare Advantage. "All the plans have to provide the same benefit package that traditional Medicare provides." Moon said that while Medicare Advantage is open to everyone, there is evidence that the oldest and sickest beneficiaries tend to stay in traditional Medicare, probably because they are more change-averse. So it's possible that Medicare Advantage is paid more to take care of healthier seniors. "That bothers me considerably," Moon said. We also reviewed consumer advice on Medicare plans. Most of the advice says that individuals should research and select their plans carefully based on their own health conditions and preferences. We didn't see any advice that drew broad conclusions about which was better, Medicare or Medicare Advantage. Finally, the White House sent us a statement emphasizing the president's point and renewing his promise to curtail extra payments to Medicare Advantage. "There is no evidence that this extra payment leads to better quality for Medicare beneficiaries," said White House spokeswoman Katherine Bedingfield. "Insurers, not beneficiaries or the Medicare program, determine how these overpayments are used — and this includes marketing and other administrative costs. This means that seniors do not always get the full overpayments back in the form of extra benefits. Additionally, some plans offer lower cost-sharing for drugs and vision care but higher cost-sharing for services such as hospitalizations and home health services. As a result, seniors can end up spending more out of pocket under a Medicare Advantage plan, not less. "Reducing these Medicare overpayments will affirm President Obama’s promise to strengthen the Medicare program, extend its solvency and reduce premiums for all beneficiaries." President Obama said, "Medicare does just as good, if not better, at keeping people healthy" as Medicare Advantage. We found little statistical evidence that would definitively confirm or refute this. MedPAC, the independent agency that reports to Congress, said it had no reason to think that Medicare Advantage overall was superior to regular Medicare. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty that merits further study. We rate Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-24T11:53:35	2009-09-20	['Medicare_(United_States)']

pomt-10839	Guantanamo detainees "get taxpayer-paid-for prayer rugs…they had honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/10/duncan-hunter/yes-chicken-and-rice-on-the-menu/	At the Fox News Republican debate in Durham, N.H. on Sept. 5, 2007, Rep. Duncan Hunter said the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are being coddled. Here's his full quote: "Those guys get taxpayer-paid-for prayer rugs. They have prayer five times a day. They've all gained weight. The last time I looked at the menu, they had honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf on Friday." Hunter accurately described the treatment of the detainees. Indeed, the Joint Task Force Guantanamo, which runs the camp, provides prayer rugs to the detainees that are paid for by taxpayers, according to Lt. Col. Edward Bush, a spokesman for the task force. "Detainees are given the opportunity to practice their religions," Bush said, which means that the Muslim call to prayer is sounded five times a day and played over the loudspeakers in the camp. Bush said the detainees are served three meals a day that meet their "cultural dietary requirements," and chicken and rice pilaf is one of the offerings. He could not confirm that the chicken dish was served on a Friday, as Hunter specifically claimed, but Hunter's point remains valid. Bush said that while it's not possible to know if "all" of them gain weight, it is common for them to do so, he said.	None	Duncan Hunter	None	None	None	2007-09-10T00:00:00	2007-09-05	['None']
pomt-09480	Challenger Tim Tuggey "is a lobbyist who donated over $41,000 to Democrats who support abortion and same-sex marriage."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/01/ken-mercer/ken-mercer-member-state-board-education-says-chall/	Ken Mercer, a Republican on the State Board of Education facing a challenger in the March 2 primary, popped a double-edged audio ad online earlier this month. The spot opens with Mercer’s two daughters calling him a rock-solid conservative. "But what about Dad’s opponent?" one says, without naming the foe, lobbyist Tim Tuggey. The other replies: "Dad’s opponent is a lobbyist who donated over $41,000 to Democrats who support abortion and same-sex marriage." Mercer closes: "You bet, I approve this message." But would the Texas Truth-O-Meter approve? We decided to appraise Tuggey’s donations and the viewpoints of Democrats who fielded his contributions. Mercer shared with us a list indicating Tuggey has given nearly $43,000 to 19 Democratic candidates and three pro-Democratic political committees since 2001. He's right. Our check of state and federal records shows that Tuggey's donations to Democrats amounted to $33,616 to nine candidates for federal office and three national political committees plus $9,100 donated to 10 Democratic candidates for state office. Tuggey doesn’t deny he’s helped Democrats. But he also says that since 2004, he and his law firm have given about three times as much money to Republicans. On his campaign Web site, he notes that his firm has represented the Bexar County Republican Party at no charge. The site says his firm also represented the state’s Republican U.S. House members in the last round of redistricting litigation and it represents only Republicans in campaign and ethics disputes. Tuggey initially told us all his Democratic donations occurred because he was helping clients advance issues such as keeping taxes low or funding veterans’ care. He later conceded that in some cases, he pitched in for candidates simply because they asked for a donation. Mercer said the second part of his blast—that the Tuggey-assisted Democrats "support abortion and same-sex marriage" is based on the Democratic Party platform. "The Republican platform is clearly pro-life (and anti-abortion) and pro-traditional marriage," Mercer said. "The Democrat Party platform is not." Mercer didn’t say so, but his ad's reference to Democrats supporting abortion was a shorthand stab that absurdly suggests Democrats want abortions to occur — a claim that's not the same as favoring a woman's right to have an abortion. Besides, not all Democrats support abortion rights. "We are a big-tent party," said Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the state Democrats. "There are Democrats who support the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy and there are Democrats who don’t." As for where Democrats stand on same-sex marriage, we didn't check with every Democrat who got a Tuggey donation. But one of them, state Sen. Carlos Uresti of San Antonio, said he’s never supported same-sex marriage. "Absolutely not," Uresti said. "I’m a Marine, damnit." (Uresti said he voted in 2005 in favor of placing a proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage before voters, who later approved the proposal. In the official House record, however, Uresti is listed as absent from the floor vote that advanced the measure.) Mercer's reasoning presumes that every Democrat who fielded a Tuggey donation hews to the party’s state and national platforms, statements of beliefs drafted and adopted by party convention delegates every two years at the state level and every four years at the national level. So we looked for language relating to abortion and same-sex marriage in the latest Democratic platforms. What we found: The state party platform of 2008 states Texas Democrats "trust the women of Texas to make personal and responsible decisions about when and whether to bear children, in consultation with their family, their physician, personal conscience or their God, rather than having these personal decisions made by politicians." Texas Democrats also "support prevention measures which have proven effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, and which would reduce the rate of abortion when made affordable, accessible, and available as effective long-term programs," the platform states. The national Democratic platform of 2008 states: "The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade (the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion) and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right." Same-sex marriage isn't mentioned in the state Democrats’ platform. But there is language indicating the party believes in protecting personal privacy and opposing discrimination in "all forms." The national Democratic platform states: "We support the full inclusion of all families, including same-sex couples, in the life of our nation, and support equal responsibility, benefits, and protections. We will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non-discrimination act. We oppose the Defense of Marriage Act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us." The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman for purposes of all federal laws, and provides that states need not recognize a marriage from another state if it is between persons of the same sex. So does Mercer’s ad hold up? Mercer got the math part right. Tuggey actually gave more than $42,000 to Democrats or Democratic committees, though Mercer's ad overlooks Tuggey's donations to Republicans and the history of Tuggey’s firm representing the Bexar County Republican Party and GOP candidates. But the second part of Mercer's advertising statement doesn't add up. For starters, Mercer doesn't back up his presumption that every Democrat hews to the party's platform. It also doesn't stand to reason that support for same-sex marriage amounts to non-support of traditional marriage, as Mercer said. In Mercer's favor: Both the state and national Democratic Party platforms signal Democratic support for abortion rights. But the 2008 state platform doesn't address same-sex marriage while the national platform backs equal protections for same-sex couples with no reference to marriage. Mercer accurately tallied Tuggey's donations to Democrats, but made sweeping judgments unsupported by facts. We rate his statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05842	You may have driven the length of a football field in the five seconds it takes to check a text.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/15/greg-walden/can-you-drive-length-football-field-time-it-takes-/	U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., is part of a central Oregon campaign to encourage drivers not to text and drive. The campaign is called "TXT L8R." "When you take your eyes off the road for up to, just to look at a text for five seconds, you may have covered the distance of a football field," Walden said while shooting a commercial for the campaign. As a public service to you, PolitiFact Oregon decided to verify the statement. We, too, know the mystery and allure of an incoming text message. Or how hard it is to to resist the urge to send just one more text -- for example, "on my way" -- to that person who won’t stop texting, just to find out if you’re on your way. So does it take up to 5 seconds to send or read a text? Personal experience tells PolitiFact Oregon that this is entirely possible. And apparently, this is a repeated fact in the distracted driving world. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s distracted driving website -- www.distraction.gov -- says this on its page of frequently asked questions: "Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 4.6 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field, blindfolded. It's extraordinarily dangerous." Next, how long is a football field? According to the NFL rule book, a field is 360 feet, or 120 yards, long. (By the way, did you know that NASA’s International Space Station is about the size of a football field? Neither did we.) However, we hear from sports experts in the newsroom that most people, when they think of it at all, think of football fields as 100 yards, or 300 feet. So let’s do some math. A person driving at 55 m.p.h. would cover 80.7 feet per second. Multiply that by 5 and the person would drive 403 feet over 5 seconds -- or more than the 300 feet or 360 feet length of a football field. Finally, we checked to see how the U.S. Department of Transportation had derived its 5-second figure. In its "Facts and Statistics" section, the department states that "sending or receiving a text takes a driver's eyes from the road for an average of 4.6 seconds." Click on that link and you go to a 2009 study about driver distraction in commercial vehicles. We can’t say we understand all 285 pages of it, but at page 99 we see that in incidents where there was a crash or near crash involving a text, the mean duration of eyes off roadway was 4.6 seconds. We even talked with Richard Hanowski, director of the Center for Truck and Bus Safety at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, to make sure we had it right. Now, most people probably aren't driving 55 while texting. Most likely they are driving at lower speeds, say 20 miles per hour, which would be closer to half the length of a football field, if you think of one as 100 yards. Walden didn’t specify speed in his statement, but he hedged it to say that the driver may have covered the length of a football field while texting. We find his statement True. And the message remains: Don’t text and drive.	None	Greg Walden	None	None	None	2012-02-15T17:32:47	2012-02-09	['None']

pomt-12705	"Cost of iPhone: $399 - Cost of healthcare for 1 year: $10,345 - Hearing @jasoninthehouse compare the 2 as if they are the same: priceless"	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/mar/10/gavin-newsom/debate-over-iphone-vs-health-care-costs-gavin-news/	California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom seized on comments by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, this week after the congressman made a controversial comparison between the cost of an iPhone and healthcare. Here’s what Chaffetz said in a CNN interview on March 7, 2017 when asked about the potential that the GOP’s Obamacare replacement plan could leave lower-income Americans uninsured: "Well we're getting rid of the individual mandate. We're getting rid of those things that people said they don't want. And you know what? Americans have choices. And they've got to make a choice. And so, maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They've got to make those decisions for themselves." After his comments caused a stir, Chaffetz said on Fox News later the same day that he could have made his point a different way. "What we're trying to say -- and maybe I didn't say it as smoothly as I possibly could -- but people need to make a conscious choice and I believe in self-reliance. And they're going to have to make those decisions." In response to Chaffetz’ iPhone-to-healthcare comparison, Newsom sent out a tweet that’s since garnered quite a bit of its own attention: Newsom’s tweet had received more than 20,000 retweets, or shares, and more than 33,000 likes on Twitter as of the time we published. The Democrat is running for California governor in 2018 and has strongly opposed GOP plans to replace the Affordable Care Act. We wanted to know if Newsom got his numbers right and whether he accurately described the iPhone vs. health care comparison made by Chaffetz. Our research We started with Newsom’s $399 figure for iPhones. Apple’s iPhone SE, one of the company’s smallest iPhones with a 4-inch display, is listed at $399 on apple.com. It’s the cheapest of the five iPhone models featured on Apple’s website. The most expensive is the new iPhone 7 Plus listed at $769. Newsom’s campaign spokesman told us the lieutenant governor was referring to the SE model. Of course, iPhones require a monthly service charge. Neither Chaffetz nor Newsom, however, made any specific claims about that cost. Health care costs To back up Newsom’s claim that one-year of healthcare costs $10,345, his spokesman pointed to a 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It projected that the nation’s overall health care costs would hit hit $3.35 trillion in 2016. In turn, that meant the nation’s health care costs would surpass $10,000 for every man, woman and child for the first time ever, landing at $10,345, according to a summary of the report by the Associated Press. That figure, however, is not the end of the story. Like so much in the healthcare industry, it’s complicated to determine how much the average American actually spends on healthcare. Here’s how the Associated Press further explained the figure: "The $10,345-per-person spending figure is an average; it doesn’t mean that every individual spends that much in the health care system. In fact, U.S. health care spending is wildly uneven. About 5 percent of the population — those most frail or ill — accounts for nearly half the spending in a given year, according to a separate government study. Meanwhile, half the population has little or no health care costs, accounting for 3 percent of spending." Experts weigh in Two health care policy experts pointed to the $10,345 figure as the best available. "That’s an accurate number," said Joy Melnikow, director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research. "That number is as good as any." While the government and private business pay for the bulk of the nation’s health care costs, Melnikow noted the government gets its money from taxpayers: "That’s all of our money. We’re paying for it." A spokesman at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health policy, also pointed to the $10,345 figure as the best available. The Washington Post’s Wonkblog looked at the iPhone vs. healthcare cost another way, by examining the cost of the most expensive iPhone (about $800 with tax) against the cost of a health plan through Obamacare’s individual market. Here’s what it found: "... (A) year of individual insurance coverage on the open market will run you about $393 per month, or $4,617 per year, per eHealth. For the purpose of this comparison we'll assume you're a healthy individual who doesn't have to worry about deductibles (which run over $4,000 for these plans), and that that $4,617 is all you have to pay. Even in this expensive-iPhone no-deductible scenario, the typical annual cost of an individual market plan costs is about six times as costly as Chaffetz's "new iPhone." Of course, not everyone is so healthy and many pay high deductibles before their insurance kicks in. Combining the annual $4,600 in premiums with $4,000 in deductibles under the Obamacare plan cited in the Washington Post would total about $8,600. That’s less than Newsom’s figure, but it’s in the ballpark when considering additional out-of-pocket expenses such as co-payments We also examined Newsom’s final claim that Chaffetz had compared the iPhone and health care costs "as if they are the same." Chaffetz’ comments, particularly his phrase "Americans have choices. And they’ve got to make a choice," leave the impression that obtaining health care is as simple as sacrificing the purchase of a smartphone. Our ruling Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom caused a stir with his response to a controversial comparison of the costs of an iPhone and healthcare made by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. Newsom claimed iPhones cost $399 while one-year of health care costs $10,345. The lieutenant governor is right about the phone cost, though he selected the cheapest iPhone featured on Apple’s website. In coming up with his health care cost estimate, Newsom’s spokesman cited a federal report showing the nation’s overall health care costs were expected to surpass $10,000 per capita for the first time in 2016. That figure does not necessarily mean everyone is spending $10,345 on health care. Costs vary greatly among individuals. About 5 percent of the population — those who are most frail or sick — accounts for nearly half the spending in a given year, according to the Associated Press. Still, two health care policy experts told us the $10,345 figure is the best available for assessing average health care costs. Another look at the iPhone vs. health care cost comparison by the Washington Post shows plans in the Obamacare market would cost an individual about $8,600 in premiums and deductibles annually, which when combined with out-of-pocket expenses might not be far from is the $10,345 figure Newsom cited. In the end, we found evidence to back up Newsom’s figures. We also found Chaffetz made enough of a connection between iPhones and health care costs to back up Newsom’s claim that the congressman compared them "as if they are the same." Newsom’s overall statement is accurate, though it needs some clarifications or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-04991	Says no city comparable in size to Austin or smaller was broken into as many congressional districts.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/20/daniel-rodriguez/seguin-activist-says-austin-only-city-country-b/	Daniel Rodriguez of Seguin emailed us asking us to check, uh, his self. We typically scrutinize statements by officeholders, candidates and individuals and groups in the public square, so to speak. But we were intrigued by Rodriguez's claim: "No city of comparable size (or smaller) has as many congressional representatives as does Austin, due to the Republican-made 2012 districts for the city." His email says Austin was left with four or five U.S. House members, each one representing only part of Austin. Was no city comparable to Austin or smaller cut up so much? In a telephone interview, Rodriguez said he meant to refer to how congressional districts were drawn in an interim plan imposed for the 2012 elections by a San Antonio panel of federal judges. Their Austin-area districts align with how those districts were drawn by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature. Rodriguez told us he initially drew on results from the 2010 U.S. census -- which played into how legislatures across the country redrew districts -- to identify cities with about the same number of residents as Austin including, he said, Las Vegas, Detroit, Baltimore and San Francisco. Most of the other cities have two House districts, he said, though Las Vegas appears to have three. We took a similar tack, starting from a 2010 census breakdown of the nation’s most populous cities that listed Austin as the 14th-largest city. Next, we were surprised to see that on the interim map, Austin takes in portions of six districts -- the 10th, 17th, 21st, 25th, 31st and 35th, according to figures posted online Feb. 27, 2012, by the Texas Legislative Council, which provides legal advice and technical assistance to legislators. That total was jarring because news accounts including a February 28, 2012 Austin American-Statesman news article pegged the number of districts in Travis County, which includes most of Austin, at five, compared to three districts much of the past decade. Explanation: The 31st District, which takes in two counties to the north, sweeps in 4.5 percent of Austin’s population. Those 36,000 residents live in Williamson County. Four of the other Austin-tied districts rope in 19 to 24 percent of the city’s population as of 2010 -- 153,000 to 188,000 Austin residents each, according to the council’s breakdown. The 17th District, which extends north to Waco and northeast to Freestone County, takes in 7 percent of Austin’s residents, 56,000 people. Each Texas congressional district contains about 698,488 residents, according to the council, which means Austin residents comprise as little as 8 percent up to 27 percent of the populace in the Austin-tied districts. Among the other like-sized Texas cities, El Paso takes in the 16th and part of the 23rd congressional districts, according to the council information, while Fort Worth takes in all or part of five districts -- the 6th, 12th, 24th, 26th and 33rd, up from four districts before redistricting. (The 25th District takes in part of surrounding Tarrant County, though none of Fort Worth.) So, Rodriguez slightly understates how many districts take in at least a smidge of Austin. Also, Fort Worth lays claim to nearly the same number, or portions, of districts. Sidelight: Parts of the largest Texas cities, Houston and Dallas, are absorbed into nine and seven House districts, respectively. And San Antonio, also larger, has portions of five districts. But Rodriguez limited his claim to cities Austin’s size or smaller. To gauge the impact of congressional redistricting on out-of-state cities comparable to Austin, we considered the four cities the census shows as bigger than Austin plus the next seven smaller cities, which enabled us to include Rodriguez’s choice of Baltimore but not Las Vegas, which was the nation’s 30th largest city. The cities more populous than Austin, which had 790,390 residents, were San Jose, Calif., with 945,942 residents, Jacksonville, Fla., Indianapolis and San Francisco, with 805,235 residents. The less populous cities were Columbus, Ohio, with 787,033 residents, Charlotte, Detroit, Memphis and Baltimore, with 620,961 residents, plus Fort Worth and El Paso. Next, we looked into each state’s congressional districts starting from a redistricting website overseen by Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Among the non-Texas cities, San Jose, Charlotte, Baltimore and Columbus appear to be represented by all or part of three districts. Memphis has parts of two districts, Doug Himes, a legislative attorney with the state of Tennessee, told us by email. Indianapolis, in Marion County, is represented by the state’s 7th District and a portion of the 5th District, according to a map of all the state’s House districts posted online by the Hoosier State. Similarly, Detroit residents are split between two districts, Michigan state demographer Kenneth Darga told us by email. And Florida’s Duval County, home to Jacksonville, and San Francisco each has two congressional districts, though information from the California Citizens Redistricting Commission indicates a third district stretches into San Francisco without taking in a sizable share of residents. So, every like-sized city except Fort Worth appears to have two or three House districts. In an email, Levitt agreed that Austin is cut up under the interim map. Still, he speculated, that might not be bad politically if Austin voters end up controlling who gets elected within most of the districts. The impact of voters everywhere remains to be seen given that the first general elections using the redrawn districts will occur in November 2012. That said, all but one of the Austin-tied districts were initially designed to elect a Republican, though much of the city that has long leaned Democratic. Barring unforeseen turns, voters in the 10th District, which stretches east, seem likely to re-elect Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin, though the district is home to more Harris County than Travis County residents. Voters in the 35th District extending south into Bexar County will likely favor Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin. But he made it to the general election only after defeating two San Antonio primary foes in May 2012 despite the district sweeping in 329,000 Bexar County residents compared to nearly 216,000 Travis County residents, according to population analyses of the Texas districts posted by the legislative council. Nearly 317,000 San Antonio residents live in the district, outnumbering its 187,000 Austinites, according to the council. The 25th District, which extends north from Austin, is Republican-leaning; former Texas Secretary of State Roger Williams and Wes Riddle are vying for the Republican nomination in a July 31, 2012, primary runoff. About 22 percent of the 13-county district’s residents live in Austin, according to the council. In the same vein, the Republican-leaning 21st District seems likely to re-elect GOP Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio; Bexar County accounts for about 36 percent of the district’s population. And the 17th district, dominated by McLennan and Brazos counties, and the 31st District, which takes in all of Williamson County, seem stable for GOP Reps. Bill Flores of Bryan and John Carter of Round Rock. Next, we took a close look at Fort Worth. Do its residents have less sway than Austin counterparts? The GOP-leaning 12th District, represented by Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth, appears solidly in the control of city voters, who account for about half the district’s residents. Also, the incumbent-free 33rd District could end up with a Fort Worth House member, depending on results of the July 2012 Democratic runoff between candidates from Dallas and Fort Worth and the November election. About 30 percent of the district’s residents live in Fort Worth. The other three districts with Fort Worth elements, each represented by a non-Fort Worth Republican seeking re-election, take in 9 percent of the city’s residents or less. In a telephone interview, we asked Matt Angle, director of the pro-Democratic Lone Star Project, a political group, for his opinion on whether residents of Austin or Fort Worth were hit hardest by how the districts were drawn. Angle replied that Austin is worse off because the city has no districts from which, by itself, the majority of its voters are likely to fill a House seat. Finally, we asked Levitt, the law professor who tracks redistricting, if it's possible that a smaller city somewhere ended up, like Austin, being inked into six congressional districts -- or more. Possible, but unlikely, Levitt replied by email, adding that he is unaware of any researchers who have broken down how every little city was affected by congressional redistricting. Our ruling Among 11 cities of comparable size to Austin or smaller, only Fort Worth -- with five House districts -- comes close to experiencing the slice-up of the Texas capital, whose residents are spread among six districts. But Fort Worth voters appear to control one district and might control another. Austin’s Democratic majority will likely preserve Doggett, but he is running in a district where San Antonio residents outnumber those from Austin. Broadly, both Texas cities were cut up more than like-sized cities nationally. We rate the claim as Mostly True.	None	Daniel Rodriguez	None	None	None	2012-07-20T10:00:00	2012-05-30	['Austin,_Texas']

pomt-07449	"The facts show that approximately 40 persons on death row have had all of their appellate review completed and await only the governor's signature on a death warrant to end the case."	true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/20/geraldine-thompson/some-40-death-row-inmates-awaiting-death-warrant-g/	Speaker Dean Cannon's proposal to create separate criminal and civil divisions of the Florida Supreme Court passed the House 79-38 on April 15, 2011, but not before Democrats and Republicans argued over an alleged purpose of the court expansion -- the handling of death penalty cases. Cannon wants to expand the Supreme Court from seven to 10 members, and then separate them into two five-member panels. One panel, including the three most senior judges (appointed by late Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles) would serve on the criminal side, while the four justices appointed by Republicans would serve on the civil division. Gov. Rick Scott would appoint nominees to fill the other three slots. Republicans argue the expansion is needed to help settle death penalty cases more expeditiously -- 393 people currently are waiting on Florida's death row. "Unreasonable delays plague state post-conviction review, and there is little Florida's current Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process," Cannon, R-Winter Park, wrote in an April 14 op-ed article in USA Today. (We previously checked -- and rated True -- Cannon's claim that more people die on death row of natural causes than are executed.) But Democrats say the appeals process isn't necessarily what's slowing down death penalty cases. In remarks on the House floor, Rep. Geraldine Thompson, D-Orlando, said the governor's office is as much, if not more, to blame. "The proponents argue that the Florida Supreme Court should be split because it will allow them to expeditiously resolve capital cases that have languished in the court," Thompson said. "The facts are the Florida Supreme Court has a capital caseload that is lower this year than last. The facts show that approximately 40 persons on death row have had all of their appellate review completed and await only the governor's signature on a death warrant to end the case. "Perhaps the proponents should pass legislation requiring a governor to sign a death warrant within 60 to 90 days after all appellate review has been denied, if their concern is 'disposing' of death penalty cases." Are 40 people, more than 10 percent of the current case back-log, waiting on the governor to sign a death warrant? After checking with several agencies, including the Supreme Court and the Department of Corrections, we were directed to the state Commission on Capital Cases, a body created in 1997 by the Legislature to provide oversight on the administering of death penalty cases. Legislators and judges serve as members of the commission, which also has a full-time staff. (Interestingly, another bill passed by the House would eliminate the commission.) The commission keeps a list of what it calls warrant-eligible inmates, said commission executive director Roger Maas. He explained to us that the list covers inmates who have exhausted both their state and federal appeals. That makes the next step toward execution the signing of a death warrant and setting of an execution date, Maas said. A note: For the most part, the governor has discretion over issuing death warrants. In other words, he picks who and when. In fact, the governor can sign a death warrant for any prisoner sentenced to death, though those warrants likely will be stayed until the state and federal appeals process is complete. And the signing of a death warrant can and often does trigger potential additional appeals -- though if no new information is presented, the appeals are more delay tactics. (The Supreme Court can issue a death warrant, based on an application from the attorney general's office, if the governor has committed an "unjustified failure" to issue a warrant). Maas provided us with his warrant-eligible inmate list as of April 7, which you can see for yourself here. According to the commission, 47 inmates currently have exhausted their appeals and the next step is for the governor to sign a death warrant. The list includes Gary Alvord, for instance, who has been on Florida's death row since April 1974 and is awaiting a death warrant. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, has been awaiting execution for 37 years. But many experts say he will never be executed. Alvord has a history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts. Since 1979, 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. Craig Waters, a spokesman with the Florida Supreme Court, said there is no limit to how many death warrants a governor can sign. But governors have signed just a handful a year despite the backlog of inmates awaiting execution. Gov. Charlie Crist signed six death warrants in his four years in office. Gov. Jeb Bush signed 24 death warrants in the preceding eight years. Of those 30 inmates, 26 were executed. Of the other four, two inmates had their death sentences vacated, one died while awaiting execution, and one inmate's execution was stayed by Bush. Scott has yet to sign a death warrant since taking office. During arguments against a proposal to expand and split the state Supreme Court, Thompson said "approximately 40 persons on death row have had all of their appellate review completed and await only the governor's signature on a death warrant to end the case." According to the Commission on Capital Cases, the number sits at 47. We rate this claim True.	None	Geraldine Thompson	None	None	None	2011-04-20T10:05:52	2011-04-15	['None']

pomt-13342	Says that during President Barack Obama’s tenure, the United States has created "15 million new jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-during-obama-administration-15-mill/	Tim Kaine and Mike Pence sparred over job creation at the vice presidential debate. Pence, the running mate of Republican Donald Trump, said, "The policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Sen. Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We're in the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression." Kaine countered, "15 million new jobs? 15 million new jobs?" Is Kaine right that during President Barack Obama’s tenure, the United States has created "15 million new jobs?" To be able to get that number, Kaine has to cherry-pick the time frame. Getting to 15 million requires choosing the low point of the job market under Obama. Specifically, the number of employed Americans bottomed out in February 2010 with 107.3 million jobs and rebounded, as of August 2016, to 122.4 million jobs. That’s an increase of about 15.1 million jobs, pretty much what Kaine said. But it’s important to note that February 2010 was just over a year after Obama and Biden were sworn in. Essentially, Obama and Biden took office as the recession was spiraling to its low point, but it took a while to hit bottom. So after they were sworn in, the number of jobs continued to fall for a year as they worked to stop the economic freefall. If you start counting instead at the beginning of Obama’s presidency, the number of jobs rose from about 111.5 million in January 2009 to 122.4 million in August 2016. That’s an increase of 10.9 million jobs, only about two-thirds of the nearly 15 million figure Kaine touted. We should note that starting the count in February 2010 is something economists have told us is not an unreasonable decision, since the recession began under George W. Bush and Obama can’t reasonably be blamed for job losses in the earliest part of his tenure, when the die was already cast. We’ll also note that using private-sector jobs as the benchmark boosts the numbers a bit compared to total jobs, because widespread budget-cutting in states and localities has led to a smaller government workforce. If you look at total employment gains rather than private-sector gains, the increases would have been a little lower -- an increase of 10.5 million jobs (from the start of Obama’s term) or 14.9 million jobs (from the low point in February 2010). Finally, we’ll note, as we regularly do, that no elected official deserves full credit (or blame) for economic results on their watch. Policies pursued by a president can help the economy, but other factors beyond the reach of a president -- from technological change to improvements in the global economy -- also play a role. Our ruling Kaine said that during Obama’s tenure, the United States has created "15 million new jobs." To reach a number that high requires some creative calendar work -- starting the count at the low point in the job market, which was just over a year after Obama took office. That’s not an unreasonable place to start, but it’s also not the only one, and for Kaine to cite that figure amounts to a bit of cherry-picking. In addition, it’s always worth a grain of salt when allocating credit to an elected official for good economic news. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/79dcc34d-5ba4-45f9-b5c4-467f925f01db	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-10-04T22:37:48	2016-10-04	['United_States']

pomt-01673	"The number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400 percent since the 1980s."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/18/john-oliver/segment-ferguson-john-oliver-says-swat-raids-are-1/	The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., has continued to reel following the police-shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, on Aug. 9, 2014. Among other things, the shooting has prompted heightened public and media scrutiny of police tactics, particularly a trend toward "militarization" of policing, which is widely seen as exacerbating mistrust between residents and police officers in Ferguson. On the Aug. 17 edition of his HBO show Last Week Tonight, John Oliver aired a segment about some of the problems spawned by police departments acquiring armor and other military-grade equipment in recent years. During his monologue, Oliver used television clips to punctuate his argument that police departments have turned themselves into virtual military units. At one point, Oliver used a clip from Al Jazeera to offer a statistic that quantified the shift: "The number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400 percent since the 1980s." That sounds like a lot. We wondered: Is it correct? We checked with both Oliver’s staff, which is on a two-week break and unable to respond, and Al Jazeera correspondent Sebastian Walker, who did not get back to us. But we located what appears to be the source of the statistic -- research by Eastern Kentucky University justice studies professor Peter Kraska. Kraska didn’t get back to us either, but we were able to piece together an understanding of his work through several of his published academic papers. Starting in the 1990s, Kraska conducted academic surveys of a sample of police departments in the United States. He asked for current data, as well as historical figures going back to 1980, his baseline year. Here’s what Kraska wrote in a 2007 paper, which referenced statistics published in his 2001 book, Militarizing the American Criminal Justice System: The Changing Roles of the Armed Forces and the Police: "There has been more than a 1,400 percent increase in the total number of police paramilitary deployments, or callouts, between 1980 and 2000. Today, an estimated 45,000 SWAT-team deployments are conducted yearly among those departments surveyed; in the early 1980s there was an average of about 3,000. … The trend-line demonstrated that this growth began during the drug war of the late 1980s and early 1990s." Kraska’s math is correct: An increase of 3,000 to 45,000 is indeed a 1,400 percent jump, as long as you consider the terms "callout" and "raid" to be equivalent. This increase stemmed from two related trends. First, more police departments deployed SWAT-style teams for the first time. The percentage of larger departments that had such a unit doubled between the mid 1980s and the late 1990s, according to Kraska’s data, while the percentage of small departments rose even faster, quadrupling over a similar period. Second, those units were deployed more frequently -- and for purposes well beyond the traditional SWAT realm of hostage, sniper and terrorist incidents. Kraska found that more than 80 percent of deployments were for drug raids, especially at private residences, where officers were looking to seize drugs, guns and money. Such units "had changed from being a periphery and strictly reactive component of police departments to a proactive force actively engaged in fighting the drug war," Kraska wrote. So Oliver is on solid ground here by relying on academic research. But some of the nuance of that research was lost in the sound bite aired on Oliver’s show. Saying that "the number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400 percent since the 1980s" makes it sound like a current statistic, or at least pretty close to current. But that’s not the case. The data ended in 2000 -- which is 14 years ago. In reality, we don’t have a good idea of how the data stacks up today, since Kraska’s surveys aren’t ongoing and because no government entity tracks SWAT raids systematically. Our ruling Oliver, in deciding to use the Al Jazeera clip, claims that "the number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400 percent since the 1980s." In a field short on comprehensive data, these are the best figures available. Still, it’s worth noting that the data ends in 2000, and we don’t know for sure what the level is today. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	John Oliver	None	None	None	2014-08-18T17:12:07	2014-08-17	['None']
pomt-05512	Says a bill requiring ultrasounds before abortions "was supported by Republicans and Democrats."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/apr/13/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-say-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-abortions/	Gov. Bob McDonnell spent the first few minutes of a recent interview on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" discussing jobs and Virginia’s improving economy. Then, as often is the case with McDonnell these days, the subject switched to abortion. Luke Russert, a member of the interview panel, noted that polls in swing states including Virginia are showing that President Barack Obama has forged ahead of Republican Mitt Romney in support by independent women voters. "How much do you feel the invasive ultrasound abortion bill in Virginia is responsible for this phenomenon?" Russert asked. He was referring to legislation passed by the House of Delegates in February that would have required women to have a transvaginal ultrasound before getting an abortion in Virginia. Amid a national outcry, McDonnell convinced fellow Republicans to amend the bill to mandate solely a non-invasive, abdominal ultrasound before an abortion. When the measure passed the GOP-led General Assembly, the governor signed it into law. McDonnell replied to Russert by predicting Romney will carry Virginia in November’s presidential election. Host Joe Scarborough broke in. He said McDonnell’s amendment was a "good move." Then he added, "I just don’t think it’s going to help us with women votes. When my wife -- my conservative, pro-life wife who’s never voted for a Democratic president in her life -- goes, `What in the hell is going on in the Republican Party?’ you know we’re in trouble." McDonnell noted that the ultrasound measure was the only abortion bill approved by the General Assembly this year. "I think there’s a majority of pro-life legislators, so this bill was supported by Republicans and Democrats." We wondered if the ultrasound bill really did pass with bipartisan support. So we went to the voting records. The amended measure requiring non-invasive ultrasounds passed the House, 61-35, on March 1. Republican voted 59-4 for the bill. Democrats voted 31-1 against it (Del. Joe Johnson, D-Washington, was the only "aye"). The chamber’s one independent -- Del. Lacey Putney of Bedford, who caucuses with the GOP -- supported the legislation. The measure passed the Senate, 21-19, on Feb. 28. Republicans voted 19-1 for the bill. Democrats voted 18-2 against it. Does that really qualify as bipartisan support? Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, defended the governor’s claim. He noted the 21-19 tally in the Senate and said the bill would not have have survived were it not for the vote of one of the two Democrats who supported it -- Chuck Colgan of Prince William and Phil Puckett of Russell. If there had been a tie vote in the Senate, the bill would have been approved because Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, supported it. Our ruling McDonnell said the bill requiring an ultrasound before an abortion was approved with bipartisan support. It’s true that the measure would not have passed the Senate without one of the two Democratic votes it received to complement near unanimous Republican support. But we have to consider the context of the governor’s statement; it came in response to a question about whether the abortion bill is contributing to some dissatisfaction with the GOP among independent women voters. It’s a stretch to tell a national TV audience that the legislation had bipartisan backing when, in fact, 49 of 52 Democrats in the General Assembly voted against it. The governor’s statement, while technically accurate, leaves a faulty impression. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04713	Says a federal judge "sanctions Tennessee ‘birther’ lawyer … for bringing a frivolous lawsuit."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/02/tennessee-democratic-party/birthers-sanctioned-federal-judge-frivolous-lawsui/	The "birthers" – people who contend President Obama is not a "natural-born citizen" and therefore ineligible to be President -- are back in the news, right here in Tennessee. The Tennessee Democratic Party issued a press release Tuesday, just as the Republican National Convention was getting underway, noting that sanctions were imposed against the plaintiffs in a federal court lawsuit in Memphis that essentially sought to block Obama’s name from this year’s election ballot in Tennessee. The lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge S. Thomas Anderson in Memphis on June 20 after he concluded that none of the plaintiffs had established sufficient legal standing to assert their claims. On Aug. 24, Judge Anderson granted a motion by the defendants, including the Tennessee Democratic Party, to sanction the plaintiffs for bringing a case in which their attorney, Van Irion of Knoxville, "knew or reasonably should have known that the claims in this case had no basis in law," according to the judge’s order. That order of sanctions was the subject of the party’s press release, which reported that not only had the judge dismissed a "birther" lawsuit but had sanctioned Irion "for bringing a frivolous lawsuit." Irion is a Knoxville lawyer who, according to its website, co-founded Liberty Legal Foundation, which operates out of the same West Knoxville office suite as his law office. Irion is also listed as the foundation’s president and lead counsel. The website says the foundation has three big issues: "Obamacare," immigration and the President’s legal status as a citizen. Liberty Legal and three plaintiffs – John Dummett, Leonard Volodarsky and Creg Maroney – originally filed a lawsuit in state court in Memphis against an entity called the National Democratic Party of the USA Inc. (which apparently doesn’t exist). Irion later added as defendants the Democratic National Committee, the Tennessee Democratic Party, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (current chair of the Democratic National Committee) and state Democratic Party Chairman Chip Forrester. Irion charged that the defendants violated state fraud statutes by falsely representing that Obama is qualified to be President, because he is not a natural-born citizen, and they should be blocked from filing papers with the secretary of state that will place his name on the Tennessee ballot. The defendants successfully moved the case into federal district court in Memphis, where, after several months, Judge Anderson dismissed it in June. The defendants then filed the motions for sanctions against the plaintiffs. The judge issued his ruling on the motions Aug. 24, holding Irion personally accountable for a share of the defendants’ attorneys fees. Irion says he will ask the judge to reconsider and, failing that, will appeal the sanction order. The Democrats’ press release is correct as far as it goes. A federal judge did sanction a Tennessee lawyer who argues that the President’s birth disqualifies him from serving – a "birther" in the current highly polarized political environment. But the judge denied two of the defendants’ three motions for sanctions. However, both of the denials were made on more or less technical grounds – one because the defendants’ attorneys did not serve Irion with a copy of the sanction motion at least 21 days before it was filed with the court, as required by court rules, and the other because it addressed legal issues that the court did not need to rule on in dismissing the case. The press release accurately described the tone of Judge Anderson’s sanction order, which concludes: "Having determined that counsel for Plaintiff reasonably should have known that all Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this suit, the Court holds that Plaintiffs’ claims were frivolous and without any arguable basis in law. As such, counsel for Plaintiff has multiplied the proceedings in this case unreasonably and vexatiously and should therefore be required to satisfy personally the attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by Defendants because of such conduct." The Liberty Legal Foundation website added an item Aug. 30 that accused Judge Anderson of lying: "Judge Anderson not only did not address the outright lies of the DNC attorneys, he piled on his own lies in order to personally sanction Van Irion." Our ruling The Tennessee Democratic Party wanted to bring attention to Tennessee "birthers" challenging President Obama’s citizenship, and did so by pushing a press release claiming the judge found the claims so "frivolous" that he sanctioned the plaintiffs who brought them.

pomt-07850	"Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-tells-cpac-more-are-out-work-us-employ/	At the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual pep rally for the political right, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney complained that the economy had not recovered under President Barack Obama. He said, "Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did." We’ll look separately at these two claims, which came from his CPAC speech on Feb. 11, 2011. In this item, we’ll analyze the claim that "today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada." We began by looking at the number of people employed in Canada. According to the most recent Canadian government statistics, there were 17.2 million Canadians with either full- or part-time employment. South of the border, the number is a bit harder to pin down. If you use the official unemployment level as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Romney is clearly wrong. In January 2011, there were 13.9 million Americans who were unemployed -- well below the 17.2 million who have jobs in Canada. But there’s a way to enlarge the U.S. number. There’s a separate BLS data category for workers who are "marginally attached to the labor force." According to the official definition, that means people who "currently want a job, have looked for work in the last 12 months (or since they last worked, if they worked within the last 12 months), and are available for work." For January 2011, a total of 2.8 million people fell into that category. (There’s a well-known subset of this category called "discouraged workers," who are not currently looking for work for one of a variety of reasons. But this group is part of the 2.8 million rather than a separate category.) So, if you add the 13.9 million unemployed to the 2.8 million who are marginally attached to the labor force, you get 16.7 million people who can be broadly considered "out of work." And that’s still a smaller number than the 17.2 million employed in Canada. So Romney is wrong by both of these counts. Is there a way to calculate the numbers that makes his comment correct? We contacted Romney’s office, and a spokesman explained how they calculated the statistic. For the Canadian number, they used the figure for the "labor force" (18.7 million, which actually includes both employed and unemployed Canadians) rather than the 17.2 million employed Canadians. This error hurts Romney’s case because it actually raises the bar for making its comparison correct. As for the U.S., Romney cited statistics from a paper by economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal, labor-backed think tank. Shierholz wrote that there are 25.1 million Americans "who are jobless, have given up looking for work, or who have settled for part-time work but actually want to work full-time." (Romney’s fact sheet actually said, mistakenly, that the number Shierholz cited was only 21.9 million, but this error also isn’t one that bolsters the accuracy of Romney's claim.) We think that Romney is inaccurately describing the data in Shierholz's paper. Using the 25.1 million number assumes it is correct to include 8.4 million Americans who are working part-time for economic reasons. While these people are certainly suffering in the current economy, we don't think it's appropriate to call them as "out of work," as Romney does, since they are indeed working and earning income. We sought comments on Romney's statement from a conservative economist, the Heritage Foundation's J.D. Foster, and a liberal economist, the Brookings Institution's Gary Burtless, and both of them said Romney's comparison had serious flaws. Both economists agreed that it would be incorrect to count part-time workers as "out of work." As Foster put it, "These folks may not be doing what they want and getting paid what they want, but if they are working then they are not out of work." Both also questioned the value of the comparison. "Frankly, I don't see that Romney's comparison makes much sense, whether it can be backed up or not," Foster said. "No doubt the total number of people out of work in the United States exceeds the total workforce of Luxembourg. The U.S. and Canada have similar land masses and languages, but otherwise, the comparison strikes me as, let's be diplomatic, ill-chosen." Foster suggested one remote scenario that the comparison might be correct: if you add the number of Americans who have left the work force involuntarily to the ranks of the unemployed. The problem is that there is no official count of involuntary work force departures. He did a rough calculation that it is 4.4 million, which could produce a total of 18.3 million "out of work" Americans -- higher than the 17.2 million employed Canadians. However, not only did Romney not use this calculation, it’s also an unofficial estimate with an unknown margin of error. It could just as easily be 3 million as 4.4 million. So we are not persuaded. Ultimately, Romney’s comparison doesn’t work for the official unemployment figure, nor for the numbers that include Americans who are marginally attached to the labor force.

pomt-08168	New food safety legislation will regulate backyard gardening.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/01/blog-posting/food-safety-law-regulate-your-backyard-garden-no-i/	We've received several e-mails from readers asking us about new food safety legislation pending in Congress. They wanted to know if it is true that the bill would regulate backyard gardening. They sent us several claims promoted by various bloggers. Here's how a website called NaturalNews put it "Senate Bill 510, the Food Safety Modernization Act, has been called 'the most dangerous bill in the history of the United States of America.' It would grant the U.S. government new authority over the public's right to grow, trade and transport any foods. This would give Big Brother the power to regulate the tomato plants in your backyard. ... This tyrannical law puts all food production (yes, even food produced in your own garden) under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security. Yep -- the very same people running the TSA and its naked body scanner / passenger groping programs." This kind of statement takes a real concern about the bill -- that it might impose excessive regulation on small farmers -- and blows it up into a fabrication. First, a bit about the legislation: Congress decided to act after several notable cases of people being sickened by contaminated foods, such as eggs that were subject to a major recall earlier this year. One out of four Americans are sickened by tainted food each year and 5,000 die, according to the National Center for Infectious Diseases. The bill gives the Food and Drug Administration -- not the Department of Homeland Security -- expanded powers to inspect facilities and trace food-borne illness. (The Department of Homeland Security is mentioned in the bill in respect to regulating food imported from overseas and in preventing intentional poisoning of the food supply.) It also allows the FDA to impose mandatory recalls after illness outbreaks, instead of asking companies to comply voluntarily. Consumer advocates said the bill was a common-sense step forward. Others expressed concern that the law was too broad: it asks the Secretary for Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, to develop specific regulations about how the increased inspections would work. Peter Van Doren of the Cato Institute reviewed a similar bill passed by the House of Representatives last year, and said he was concerned that the language in the House bill was overly broad. "The question of how much or little is encompassed by this language seems open to differing interpretations and would be the subject of much jockeying when the actual regulations implementing the law were written," he said. The Senate took up the issue more recently, and, to allay concerns about small growers, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., offered an amendment exempting most local food providers and small farmers from new federal regulations as long as the growers complied with local rules and their produce was not connected to active outbreaks of illness. The Senate accepted the amendment and approved the overall bill 73 to 25 on Tuesday. The House must now approve it, either outright or through conference committee, and the President must sign it before it becomes law. So will Big Brother be trailing around behind you in his Wellingtons next spring as you set out your seedlings? We reviewed the Senate version of the bill carefully and read ongoing news coverage of the food safety law. Nowhere could we find mention of backyard gardens being included. In fact, the Senate version, even prior to Tester's amendment, said regulations must be developed that prioritize food facilities that pose the highest risk to public safety. That would imply that not all facilities would receive the same level of scrutiny. Additionally, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill makes no mention of widespread inspections in its cost estimates. "Based on the inspection schedule specified, CBO estimates that this bill would require about 50,000 domestic and foreign food facilities to be inspected in 2015," said a CBO report. Meanwhile, the National Gardening Association estimates that 36 million households participated in food gardening in 2008. Finally, we checked in with a few groups that followed the legislation's development closely. We interviewed Scott Openshaw, director of communications for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents major food companies and tracked the legislation closely. He said the pending legislation will not apply to home gardeners. "Backyard gardens will NOT be affected in any, way, shape or form by the food safety bill. Zero, zilch, zip, nada," Openshaw told us via e-mail. Another person who followed the bill closely was David Plunkett, a senior staff attorney for food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest; he too said that backyard gardens were not part of the bill. Plunkett pointed us to a line in Section 105 the Senate bill that said the rules "shall not apply to produce that is produced by an individual for personal consumption." In rating this statement, we see no evidence to support the claim that backyard gardens would be regulated under the food safety bill. There might be legitimate concerns about small growers, but even those have been addressed in the Senate version of the bill. At any rate, concerns about small growers are quite different then the claim that backyard gardens will be regulated. We find no evidence to support the claim and rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-06762	Says that Wall Street hedge fund managers "pay a lower tax rate than does a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/22/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-wall-street-hedge-fund-mana/	The bipartisan plan to raise the nation’s debt ceiling included formation of a 12-member congressional committee to consider cuts in spending and tax reform. After voting in support of the plan, Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown said in an interview that Congress needed to turn its focus to job creation exclusively. And he said that tax reform should close loopholes that the debt-ceiling deal didn't touch. For example, he said, "They didn’t close the tax loopholes for Wall Street hedge fund managers who pay a lower tax rate than does a sheet metal worker in Parma or a school teacher in Cleveland." That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Could wealthy Wall Street investors have a lower tax rate on their compensation than average workers? We asked Brown's office how he supported his remark. Press secretary Allison Preiss responded with a pile of sources. Let's start the review by identifying our subject. Hedge funds are investment funds similar to mutual funds, but are not subject to the same rules and regulations, are typically more aggressive, and traditionally have been limited to wealthy investors. Most set very high minimum investment levels. Managers of hedge funds typically charge investors 2 percent for managing their money, meaning that a $10 billion hedge fund takes in $200 million in fees. Managers also can collect a percentage of the profits from trades they make, usually 20 percent. AR Magazine, the hedge fund trade publication, began estimating compensation in the industry a decade ago, the Reuters news agency said earlier this year, noting that "calculating the earnings of top hedge fund managers involves a degree of guesswork and alchemy, since funds don't publicly disclose compensation." AR's annual report on the 25 richest hedge fund managers said they collected about $22 billion in compensation last year. Topping the charts in hedge fund pay was John Paulson of Paulson & Co., who earned a reported $4.9 billion. That is billion with a B, and that is for the year 2010. A study by the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the top 25 hedge fund managers combined appear to have earned more than all the CEOs of the companies in the S&P 500 combined. That study put the average pay at hedge funds for "highly compensated employees" -- not just the managers at the top of the scale -- at $3.2 million a year. Using the federal income tax rate schedule for 2010, a single individual earning $3.2 million (or $4.9 billion) would fall in the top tax bracket that applies to wages, bonuses and other compensation, which is 35 percent. That rate starts at income of about $370,000. But hedge fund managers typically don’t pay taxes on their income the same way other Americans do, as PolitiFact has noted before. The bulk of hedge fund managers’ income is typically considered "carried interest" -- that is, their share of profits from the funds they manage. When a fund has capital gains and those gains flow to the manager, they are taxed as a capital gain, not as ordinary income. The tax rate on capital gains is 15 percent, rather than the 35 percent on compensation that would be paid by everyone else, including other types of Wall Street managers. (The taxpayers with the top 400 incomes paid an average rate of 18.11 percent in 2008, according to the most recent update of the Internal Revenue Service, which issues an annual report on the top 400 taxpayers.) Hedge fund managers don't necessarily pay even 15 percent, however. They can pay no current income tax at all, by leaving their carried interest money in the hedge fund and deferring the tax bill to a later date -- even decades later -- when they eventually cash out of the fund. What about the other two individuals in Brown's statement? According to the most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in May 2010, the average salary for a sheet metal worker in the Cleveland area, spanning Elyria to Mentor, is $47,200. According to a May 2010 survey by The Plain Dealer, using information from the Ohio Department of Education, the average teacher salary in Cleveland is $65,575. Using the federal income tax rate schedule, both single individuals and heads of households at those income levels would fall in the tax bracket of 25 percent. That 25 percent is higher than the capital gains rate of 15 percent that the carried interest tax loophole allows hedge fund managers to pay on their income. On the Truth-O-Meter, that gives Brown's statement a rating of True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2011-08-22T06:00:00	2011-08-02	['Cleveland', 'Parma']
pomt-14439	Like Marco Rubio, Sen. Barack Obama had "one of the worst attendance records in the Senate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/08/right-rise/right-rise-right-raise-criticism-candidates-rubio-/	A commercial by the super PAC Right to Rise USA shows a silhouette of Sen. Marco Rubio and criticizes him for his lack of foreign policy experience. "Way too often, Rubio didn't even show up," the announcer says as a box on the screen tags Rubio as having "one of the worst attendance records in the Senate." Almost imperceptibly, the silhouette morphs into President Barack Obama as the announcer asks, "What other junior senator had the same resume?" Right to Rise USA is the super PAC that supported Jeb Bush, who has given up on his quest for the White House this year. According to the TV Political Ad Archive, it ran at least 400 times, mostly in South Carolina before Bush dropped out. We decided to see if both Rubio and Obama have had similar attendance records in the Senate. First, a word about terminology. In political circles, attendance is usually determined not by the number of days you show up for work in the Senate, but by the number of votes you miss. We'll use that standard. Rubio has been dealing with the attendance issue since the summer, when he had been missing more than half of all Senate roll call votes. Here's the rundown as of March 4, according to GovTrack.us, which has a running tally of voting records for members of Congress. Rubio has missed 14.9 percent of the votes since taking office in January 2011. The typical senator currently serving has missed just 1.7 percent. His record has never been exemplary, but it really deteriorated starting in the first quarter of 2015, when he missed 18.5 percent, then 32.9 percent in the second quarter, 53.8 percent in the third and 58.2 percent in the fourth. Since January he has missed more than nine in 10 votes. Obama, during his four years as a senator, missed 24.2 percent of his votes. During his time in the Senate, the median for missed votes was 2.2 percent. Sen. Obama had a great voting record until the second quarter of 2007, when he missed 17.9 percent of the votes, followed by 56.3 percent in the third quarter. By the end of the fourth quarter, with the election a year away, he was missing 89.4 percent. This chart shows the percent of missed votes for comparable quarters during the campaign season for both senators as the clock ticked down to election day. We've highlighted who missed more votes in each quarter. Quarters before election Obama in 2005-08 Rubio in 2013-16 15 0.0% of 81 votes 0.0% of 92 votes 14 6.7% of 89 votes 1.3% of 76 votes 13 1.3% of 76 votes 9.3% of 43 votes 12 0.8% of 120 votes 5.0% of 80 votes 11 0.0% of 83 votes 12.9% of 93 votes 10 1.9% of 107 votes 13.0% of 123 votes 9 1.4% of 73 votes 3.7% of 54 votes 8 0.0% of 16 votes 6.3% of 96 votes 7 2.4% of 126 votes 18.5% of 135 votes 6 17.9% of 112 votes 32.9% of 85 votes 5 56.3% of 119 votes 53.8% of 52 votes 4 89.4% of 85 votes 58.2% of 67 votes 3 36.5% of 85 votes 90.3% of 31 votes 2 84.4% of 77 votes -- 1 87.2% of 47 votes -- Election quarter 0.0% of 4 votes -- More to the point for this fact check, GovTrack has ranked Rubio compared to his colleagues based on the number of votes he's missed in the past year and the year before that. The Florida senator is in the 100th percentile — the worst — for the 12-month period and in the 95th percentile — almost as bad — for the previous 12 months. At this stage of Obama's campaign, the Illinois senator's record for missed votes in the previous 12 months put him in the 98th percentile. He was in the 32nd percentile the year before that. Our ruling Right to Rise USA said that both Rubio and Obama had "one of the worst attendance records in the Senate." The data show that both missed a lot of votes while running for president. Rubio started skipping votes a lot earlier than Obama did, but at this stage of the campaign, Rubio has missed more votes than any other senator in the past year, and Obama was missing more votes than 98 percent of his colleagues. Their attendance records certainly qualify as "one of the worst." We rate the statement True.	None	Right to Rise	None	None	None	2016-03-08T12:51:40	2016-03-01	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-03915	Felony crimes in the city of Atlanta are the lowest they have been since 1969.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/26/kasim-reed/mayor-says-felonies-atlanta-lowest-decades/	Kasim Reed successfully campaigned for mayor in 2009 with the goal of making Atlanta a safer city. In his recent State of the City speech before hundreds of business leaders and elected officials from across the region, Reed was very specific about the drop in major crimes last year. "Felony crimes are at the lowest they have been since 1969," the mayor said. This claim was listed second in a glossy pamphlet called "30 Accomplishments in 3 Years" with Reed’s picture on it. Since public safety is such an important issue and Reed has highlighted this as an accomplishment, PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be worthwhile to fact-check whether the claim is correct. Felony crimes consist of murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, larceny and auto theft. The FBI keeps data on felonies and other crimes that are collected from police agencies nationwide, and it puts them into an annual report. They are included in the FBI’s Part I crimes category. Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said the claim was focused on the total number of felony crimes in the city in 2012. He forwarded us a report full of statistics that included felony crime totals from 1960 to 2010. Campos also gave us felony crime totals for 2011 and 2012. The Police Department’s and FBI’s totals matched most years. The FBI does not have complete Atlanta data for 2012. In 1969, Atlanta had 32,095 felony crimes. The total rose to slightly more than 40,000 in 1970 and nearly 50,000 by 1976. Felony crimes hit their zenith in 1989, when the total was 88,241. The annual totals have steadily declined since then. There have been a few years in the past decade in which the total was below 40,000. None, though, were as low as the 2012 total of 34,581. As far as the annual totals, the city’s numbers are correct. Why is there a decrease? Police departments across the country have reported a drop in crime in recent years. Washington, for example, was on pace in 2012 to have its lowest number of murders in nearly 50 years. New York City police report a major decline in homicides from 2,262 in 1990 to 515 in 2011. In 2011, the most recent year available, FBI data show violent and property crimes nationwide declined for the fifth year in a row. Atlanta Police Chief George Turner told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his department, like many law enforcement agencies, uses computer mapping to determine crime trends and deploy officers to areas where there is a spike in criminal activity. The department also reconfigured the boundaries of its beats so officers would have less territory to cover, used video surveillance as a crime-fighting tool and has more cops on the force, which Turner believes are additional factors in the drop in crime. PolitiFact Georgia has examined Atlanta crime statistics before, and we note that crime statistics are difficult to cross-check. Independent researchers or agencies don’t typically do separate tallies or check the quality of crime statistics. For a period starting in 1999, the department failed to count about 6 percent of rape reports. In 2003, an audit found that police were unable to find about 20,000 reports from the prior year. Rapes and robberies went unreported in the late 1990s as well. We do note that there is no evidence that the city is currently underreporting its crime statistics. One news site, Business Insider, analyzed the FBI crime data for 2011 and ranked Atlanta as the eighth-most-dangerous city in the U.S. by calculating Atlanta’s violent crime rate and comparing it with other cities. The FBI advises against ranking agencies "[s]ince crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors." We did decide to take a closer look at Atlanta’s felony crime rate to see whether it is also at its lowest level since 1969. We used the FBI’s formula for calculating the felony crime rate. We divided the number of felony crimes by the city’s population for a particular year and multiplied that by 100,000. PolitiFact Georgia must note a caveat about Atlanta’s population estimates. As estimates, they can vary. We all believed Atlanta’s population rose sharply between 2000 and 2009, particularly after 2005. In 2009, Atlanta’s population was estimated at nearly 553,000 residents. Then the U.S. Census Bureau released its 2010 population estimate for Atlanta, which was done with the help of more counters than prior years. The total? An estimated 420,000. In 2011, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigated why there was such a huge change in one year. The AJC found that a successful appeal by Fulton County government to the Census Bureau resulted in its 2005 population estimate rising by nearly 100,000 residents. Atlanta’s population estimate rose that year by about 55,000 residents. The city appealed its estimate in 2006, and the Census Bureau agreed to increase its population by an additional 12,000 residents. For our fact check, we used the adjusted census population estimates from 2000 to 2009, which were more conservative than the information used after the appeals. The Atlanta Regional Commission estimates the city’s population at 421,600 in 2012. Using that estimate, we found two years (1970 and 1971) in which there was a lower felony crime rate than 2012. The differences between those two years and 2012, though, was pretty small. The most recent census population estimate for Atlanta was 432,427 in 2011. If we use that population estimate for 2012, that year wins as the city’s lowest felony crime rate. The Census Bureau’s 2012 estimate will not come out until March, we were told. Census estimates usually rise each year. Our conclusion: The mayor and city officials say felony crime is at its lowest since 1969. Indeed, the number of reported felony crimes is at its lowest since 1969. It’s possible the felony crime rate was slightly lower in 1970 or 1971. It’s possible, though, that the felony crime rate was lower in 2012. Since it is possible the felony crime rate was lower in 2012, we’re not going to quibble about 1970 or 1971. Our rating: True.

pomt-14504	"The people that perpetrated that travesty in San Bernardino had never been to the Middle East."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/22/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-wrongly-says-san-bernardino-attackers/	America requires an especially robust defense, given how porous the world’s borders are today, former President Bill Clinton said at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton. "Keep in mind, the people that perpetrated that travesty in San Bernardino had never been to the Middle East," Clinton said in Greenville, S.C., Feb. 16. "They were converted over the social media." This is incorrect, as Buzzfeed first pointed out. The husband and wife pair who carried out the Dec. 2 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14, spent significant time in the Middle East. A spokesman for Clinton told us that he misspoke. Here are the facts about where the couple traveled: The wife, Tashfeen Malik, was born in Pakistan but moved to Saudi Arabia at a young age. She returned to Pakistan in 2007 to study pharmacology. The husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was born and raised in the United States, but he traveled to the Middle East on multiple occasions in recent years. Farook met Malik online. He traveled to Mecca, Saudi Arabia in 2013 to meet Malik in person and to complete the annual Muslim pilgrimage known as the hajj, according to the Los Angeles Times. Farook returned to Saudi Arabia in 2014 to bring his new wife to his Southern California home. (The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol photo to the left shows the couple in Chicago in 2014.) Malik got into the United States on a K-1 visa, which allows someone to enter the country in order to marry a United States citizen. There is evidence the couple was radicalized and might have been inspired by foreign terrorists. However, FBI Director James Comey said in December that there isn’t yet evidence that Farook and Malik were working with larger terrorist organizations, though they did send private messages over email and social media that referred to jihad and martyrdom. While the couple communicated privately with others about their commitment to radicalism, there is not yet evidence that they posted publicly on the topic. "So far, we’ve seen no indication that either of these two killers came across our screen, tripped any trip wires, anything that either brought them to our attention or should have brought them to our attention," Comey said. The FBI is trying to get more information on what led to the attack by accessing an iPhone belonging to the couple, but so far they have been unable to penetrate it. A judge ordered Apple to devise a way for the government to unlock the phone, but the company has refused, citing privacy concerns on its customers’ behalf. Our ruling Clinton said, "The people that perpetrated that travesty in San Bernardino had never been to the Middle East." This is incorrect. The wife lived her entire life in the Middle East until 2014, and the husband traveled to Saudi Arabia on at least two recent occasions to meet with her. We rate Clinton’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00661	Annual precipitation "has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/14/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-precipitation-rhode-island-/	People who warn that humanity is dramatically changing Earth's climate invoke several indicators to prove their point. They note the rise in sea levels, the increase in global temperature and the growing acidification of the oceans. In a May 1, 2015, commentary in The Providence Journal, U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, along with Michael Shank, director of media strategy for Climate Nexus, a group devoted to warning about climate change, invoked those warning signs, and more. "Global warming is happening, here and now. Its impact is already being felt in coastal states like Rhode Island, and greenhouse gas emissions are undeniably responsible," they said. Cicilline and Shank argued that, "Greater annual precipitation, which has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century, also means movement and mixing of pollutants, nutrients, contaminants and salinity levels, all of which can critically undermine marine productivity." We know we've seen some wet years recently, but we also know how variable weather can be from year to year. So the statistic in that paragraph made us wonder -- has precipitation in the state actually increased by more than a foot over the past 100 years? When we contacted Cicilline's office to ask for the source of the claim, spokeswoman Alex Macfarlane directed us to two publications. The first is a four page fact sheet from the University of Rhode Island's Sea Grant program which says, "In Rhode Island, precipitation has increased by over 12 inches since 1905, mostly during non-summer months." Because the undated sheet refers to a weather event in 2012, it's clear that the "over 12 inches" is referring to a time span of at least 107 years. The second piece of evidence was from a 2008 book, "Science for Ecosystem-Based Management: Narragansett Bay in the 21st Century." In the second chapter, Michael Pilson of URI's Graduate School of Oceanography reports that annual precipitation data from Providence and Warwick from 1905 to 2006 show an increase of 13 inches. That's over 102 years. So Cicilline was citing a good source, although the data are eight years old. To determine if the trend is true today -- and the congressman made it sound like he was talking about current precipitation numbers -- we downloaded the National Weather Service data through 2014. Rainfall and melted snow totals can vary dramatically year to year, so we used Microsoft Excel to calculate a trend line using the last 100 years, beginning in 1914. The increase: 11.9 inches. And if you take the data back to 1905, a longer time than Cicilline was citing, the increase is 13.5 inches. The trend line (not the actual precipitation amounts) goes from 36.3 inches in 1905 to 49.8 inches in 2014. That's a 31 percent increase in precipitation in the past century; 37 percent since 1905. The months that have seen the greatest precipitation increases are March, October and November. The only month with a decrease has been July, and it's been slight. In summary, David Cicilline said annual precipitation "has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century." Reliable but slightly out-of-date sources back him up.

pomt-13213	Russia has "tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded, and we didn't."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-says-russia-has-upped-its-nuclear-warheads-w/	Donald Trump says Russian President Vladimir Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton, as evidenced by advancements in Russia’s nuclear program. At the final presidential debate Oct. 19, Clinton said Trump’s supposed Russian sympathies would turn him into Putin’s "puppet" in the White House. Trump shot back at Clinton: "You’re the puppet!" "(Putin) has no respect for her," Trump said. "He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded, and we didn't. 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken." We decided to take a look at Trump’s claim that Russia has 1,800 nuclear warheads, expanding their arsenal while the United States did not. We found that Trump’s 1,800 figure refers to deployed strategic nuclear warheads, meaning long-range nuclear weapons that are out in the field rather than in storage or retired. Trump is correct that Russia has slightly increased its deployed strategic nuclear warhead count over the past five years while the United States has not. However, Trump overstates the significance of this growth in Russian deployed nuclear warheads, and his claim omits the fact that Russia and the United States are estimated to have about the same number of nuclear warheads when non-deployed stockpiles are included. By the numbers New START, an agreement between Russia and the United States designed to limit both countries’ deployed strategic nuclear weapons, went into force in February 2011. Since then, the State Department has published select data about both countries’ arsenals twice a year. This is the source of Trump’s claim. Russia began New START with 1,537 deployed strategic nuclear warheads in February 2011. As of Oct. 1, 2016, it has 1,796. The United States, conversely, has gone from 1,800 deployed nuclear warheads to 1,367 in the same time frame. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com At first glance, this might seem like Russia is building up its deployed nuclear arsenal. But experts told us that this spike is actually a result of Russia modernizing its nuclear program. Essentially, Russia is in the process of replacing old missile launchers and submarines with new ones that can hold more warheads per vehicle. But they haven’t yet retired all the old vehicles, so the deployed warhead count temporarily reflects the doubling up of new and old launchers currently deployed. "That increase is not a sign of an expanding arsenal but a temporary fluctuation caused by newer launchers replacing older launchers," said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, adding that he expects Russia to complete this process by 2018, when it has to fully meet New START limits. Trump didn't say this at the debate, but the United States is also in the process of modernizing its nuclear arsenal, spending about $35 billion a year on the project. Kristensen said that at any given time, the New START numbers can fluctuate by a few hundred warheads as launchers go in and out of service, and it does not cause concern among the U.S. military and intelligence community. He cited a 2012 Defense Department report that concluded Russia "would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty." The number of deployed strategic warheads is a significant figure because it refers to warheads that could, potentially, target the United States or other long-range adversaries of Russia. But in citing this 1,800 figure, Trump leaves out how many non-deployed warheads the two countries have in their reserves. As of May 2016, Russia has 4,490 nuclear warheads deployed and in reserve, and the United States has about the same at 4,500, according to Federation of American Scientists estimates. Both countries have steadily reduced their nuclear stockpiles since the 1990s, when Russia and the United States had a combined 60,000 warheads. In the past decade or so, however, the decline has nearly stagnated for both countries. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Over the same five-year period during which Russia added 259 deployed warheads, reaching Trump’s approximately 1,800 total, its total warhead stockpile, deployed and reserves combined, shrunk by 368. So Trump’s number, while accurate in isolation, misses the big picture: Russia and the United States have reached a point, through mutual drawbacks, where their nuclear stockpiles are about equivalent, according to the best estimates available. Our ruling Trump said Russia has "tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads — 1,800, by the way — where they expanded, and we didn't." Between 2011 and 2016, Russia has expanded its deployed strategic nuclear warheads from 1,537 to 1,796, while the United States decreased its deployed strategic nuclear warheads over the same period. But that statistic ignores that Russia’s total number of warheads, deployed and in its reserves, is about the same as the United States’. Both have about 4,500 nuclear warheads in their total stockpiles. And experts said the recent spike in Russia’s deployed weapons is temporary, rather than indicative of an upward trend.

pomt-08437	Says "Scott Walker tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/18/planned-parenthood/planned-parenthood-says-scott-walker-tried-pass-bi/	Planned Parenthood Advocates, the lobbying and political action arm of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, says it made more than 1.1 million "voter contacts" in the 2008 elections. The Madison-based group, which supports pro-choice candidates, has also been working to influence voters in 2010 -- including pushing them to support Democrat Tom Barrett in the Nov. 2, 2010 election for governor. The group is painting Barrett’s rival, GOP nominee Scott Walker, as "just too extreme." In a flier mailed to voters, it frames Walker’s views this way: "Scott Walker tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control." Is that really the case? Planned Parenthood Advocates spokeswoman Amanda Harrington said her organization’s statement about Walker is based on Assembly Bill 168, a measure Walker sponsored in 2001 while serving in the state Assembly. It would have applied to pharmacists and other health care providers, but it did not become law. The bill would have: Expanded the definition of employment discrimination. Specifically, it would have prohibited discriminating against a health care provider who refused, based on moral or religious grounds, to participate in certain medical procedures or health care-related activities. Prohibited state regulatory agencies from disciplining a health care provider who made such a refusal. Asked to respond to the Planned Parenthood Advocates flier, Jill Bader, spokeswoman for Walker’s gubernatorial campaign, said it was "completely false" that the bill had anything to do with birth control. But news stories at the time described how Walker’s bill targeted RU-486, an abortion pill, and the "morning-after" pill, which prevents a pregnancy. The articles also told how the proposal could have allowed pharmacists to refuse to dispense most other forms of birth control. "Could" and "most" are the operative words. But both Harrington and Matt Sande of Pro-Life Wisconsin say the protections for pharmacists in Walker’s bill would have applied to the dispensing of all types of birth control. Back to the claim about Walker. The claim does not address pills or devices, but rather how pharmacists would have been allowed to function had the bill become law. Planned Parenthood says flatly: Pharmacists would have been able to block women from getting birth control. In truth, the effects would have been more limited. An individual pharmacist could have refused to fill a particular birth control prescription. But women could have gotten the prescription filled by another pharmacist, perhaps at the same counter, or at another pharmacy. In many places, that might have amounted to an inconvenience, though in areas with few pharmacies, a refusal by one pharmacist could have created a bigger burden. As for the 2010 race, both candidates have given their views on the issue: Barrett says he opposes efforts to allow pharmacists to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions; Walker says he supports allowing pharmacists to refuse to fill emergency contraception prescriptions on moral grounds. The claim by Planned Parenthood is still off the mark. In an effort to paint Walker as extreme, the group’s lobbying arm says in a direct mail piece that Walker "tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women’s access to birth control." That bill might have made it more difficult for some women to get contraceptives at some pharmacies, depending on who was on duty. But words matter -- the possible narrowing of access to birth control in some cases isn’t the same as blocking it in all cases. We rate the claim as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02509	A government report shows that alternatives to the Keystone XL pipeline "are worse" for the environment.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/13/ralph-reed/ralph-reed-says-alternatives-keystone-pipeline-are/	Republicans are rejoicing over a new government report about one of the biggest controversies of the day. Nope, not Obamacare, but good guess. It’s on the Keystone XL pipeline. As liberal CNN Crossfire host Van Jones argued against President Barack Obama approving the project in a recent show, conservative activist Ralph Reed said a U.S. State Department study clears the air about the project’s long-term effect on the environment. (We rated Jones’ statement about the project creating 35 permanent jobs True.) "What the report shows, Van -- and this is irrefutable; the science is clear -- is that the alternatives to the pipeline are worse," he said. "If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher." "So if you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline." We wanted to check out his claim that the pipeline is better in terms of fewer climate emissions than the alternatives, including doing nothing. Read this if you’re kind of late to Keystone The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would stretch from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., ushering 830,000 barrels of heavy, diluted Canadian tar sands per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast with help of existing pipelines. TransCanada’s project crosses international borders, so the company had to file an application for a presidential permit. As part of the process, the president directs the Secretary of State to determine whether the project "serves the national interest." Secretary of State John Kerry has not yet issued his recommendation. The issue splits environmentalists and labor unions, putting Kerry and Obama under unusual pressure from a divided Democratic Party. Republicans and labor unions tout the pipeline’s construction jobs, reduced dependence on oil from other continents and continued friendliness with Canada, while environmentalists want Obama to send a strong message about climate change. Back in June, Obama said the country’s national interest "will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution." Many headlines about an 11-volume State Department report about the pipeline’s environmental impact focused on its finding that the pipeline project would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution, which some see as giving Obama an opening for approval. That does not mean the project is without impact. The report examined the greenhouse gas effect of the project, finding that the emissions primarily from electricity use to power pump stations, fuel for vehicles and vented or leaked methane would be comparable to about 300,000 cars operating per year, or more than 70,000 homes using electricity for one year. An important thread in the debate is an assurance from Canadian officials and oil producers that oil will reach the American marketplace even if the pipeline is not built. So the State Department compared the environmental impact of other methods of moving the oil south from Canada. What could happen without the pipeline? Producing crude oil from oil sands is complicated. The sands are comprised of clay, sand, water and a substance called bitumen, a thick, soft asphalt-like material that is too dense to traverse pipelines on its own. It is diluted with lighter substances and heated to make it easier to move, resembling more of a heavy crude oil called dilbut. The process is energy-intensive, and the transportable material is corrosive and difficult to clean up, opponents say. By law, the department had to consider the environmental impact of reasonable alternatives to the pipeline. The State Department investigated three alternative transportation methods: Rail and pipeline: Heavy crude oil extracted from western Canada and the Bakken rock formation would be transported via railroad to Oklahoma. From there, it would be transported to refineries near the Gulf of Mexico using existing pipelines. Rail and tanker: Heavy crude would be moved by rail to a western Canada port, where it would be then be loaded onto tankers and sent through the Panama Canal to a Texas port. Bakken crude, meanwhile, would be shipped via rail. The report says it would be cheaper for a tanker to deliver oil from the Pacific Coast to Asia markets rather than the Gulf Coast. Rail to the gulf: Oil would be shipped from Saskatchewan and North Dakota using some existing railroads to the Gulf Coast. If you had a hard time visualizing how all of that would work, consult the State Department’s map laying it out (or read the 100-page description). Our focus is on how these alternatives affect carbon emissions. We modified a chart in the State Department report for annual greenhouse gas emissions from crude transport from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast. (MTCO2e = Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents) Proposed Keystone XL pipeline Rail/pipeline scenario Rail/tanker scenario All rail to coast scenario MTCO2e/Year per 830,000 barrels per day 3,123,859 4,428,902 4,363,611 3,991,472 MTCO2e/Year per 100,000 barrels per day 376,369 533,603 525,857 480,900 Percentage difference from proposed Keystone n/a 41.8 percent 39.7 percent 27.8 percent Reed’s numbers for carbon emissions from the alternative scenarios pretty much align with the report, but he mixed them up. He said, "If you use primarily tanker trucks to transport this shale gas, climate emissions will be 28 percent higher than the pipeline. If you use primarily rail, they'll be 40 to 42 percent higher." In reality, using primarily rail raises carbon levels 28 percent more than the pipeline and using primarily tankers raises carbon levels 40 percent, the report said. Reed also said tanker trucks, when the report is actually speaking of tanker ships. Using a combination of rail and existing pipeline would yield 42 percent more carbon emissions. Not exactly a clean bill of health Reed is broadly onto something with the report, but environmental activists criticized his statement, saying the science on the climate safety of shale oil is hardly clear. Reed’s statement dismisses the fact that the project would generate more greenhouse gases than the alternative desired by environmentalists: doing nothing to expand tar sands production. "It’s all worse" for the environment than doing nothing, said Eddie Scher, a spokesman for the Sierra Club. "The argument here is that crack is somehow worse than heroin. We think that you should do neither." Extracting oil from tar sands is more "carbon intensive" than other crude oil. It’s 13 percent more carbon intensive than other heavy crudes and 17 percent more than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the U.S. in 2005. If Keystone XL is rejected, "tar sands expansion will slow," said Anthony Swift, National Resources Defense Council international program attorney. Even the Environmental Protection Agency raised concerns with the State Department about the possibility of tar sands being easily shipped by rail instead of the pipeline. In April, the EPA argued in response to a State draft environmental assessment that the department should improve its energy-economic modeling strategy and dig in deeper to rail capacity and costs. Basically, their assumptions are too rosy, EPA says. Our ruling Reed said the State Department report shows "the science is clear" that "alternatives to the pipeline are worse," pointing to higher emissions from alternate transportation options of tanker trucks and rail. Reed didn’t pull the numbers out of anywhere, although he did mess them up a bit, for instance by saying "tanker trucks" instead of sea "tankers" described in one of the report’s alternative scenarios. As to his general point that the pipeline option is better in terms of CO2 emissions than projections for other options, yes, those alternatives are worse. But besides getting his numbers crossed, he was also a bit clumsy in describing "alternatives" and saying that if "you're protecting the environment, you should build the pipeline." Reed assumes that the pipeline should be built, but environmentalists say the best alternative for the environment would be to do nothing and slow tar sands production. Reed’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Ralph Reed	None	None	None	2014-02-13T10:36:32	2014-02-03	['None']
pomt-09983	"The Geneva Convention did not apply, until 2005, to the war on terror."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/28/lindsey-graham/sen-lindsey-graham-claims-geneva-conventions-didnt/	Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has strongly urged President Barack Obama not to prosecute government officials who provided legal advice related to controversial interrogation techniques. On April 26, 2009, Graham said on CNN's State of the Union that he doesn't believe there is any basis to pursue legal action. "The Geneva Convention did not apply, until 2005, to the war on terror," Graham said. "So I can't conceive of a statute that you could prosecute anyone under because their endeavor was not to commit a crime but to look at the law and come up with aggressive interrogation techniques to get information from an enemy that we all thought was coming after us again." "So I think it's ridiculous to say the lawyers were trying to break the law," Graham said. "They were trying to interpret the law to protect the nation." We won't try to settle the debate of whether the lawyers should be prosecuted, but we wondered if Graham was correct that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the "war on terror" until 2005. We found that there is no consensus. It's been the subject of intense legal debate dating back to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks. At that time, the question was whether al-Qaida or Taliban fighters were truly combatants in an international war who are expressly covered by the Geneva Conventions. The Bush administration said they were not. A Feb. 7, 2002, memo signed by Bush declared that the Third Geneva Convention — which sets standards for the treatment of prisoners of war — did not apply to al-Qaida or Taliban detainees. But the memo said the United States should "continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of the Geneva Convention." In 2006, the Supreme Court disagreed. It ruled in the case of Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld that detainees were entitled to the full protections of the Geneva Conventions, specifically Article 3, which prohibits "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment" of detainees. Graham contends that until the Supreme Court made that decision, the Geneva Conventions did not apply. But legal experts have a wide range of opinions about whether that is true. "Bottom line, the Geneva Conventions were in effect when the planes went into the buildings and throughout Bush's so-called war on terror," said David M. Crane, a law professor at Syracuse University and onetime chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, an international war crimes tribunal. Linda Malone, director of the Human Rights and National Security Law Program at William and Mary Law School, agrees. When the United States invaded Afghanistan, "certainly there was an international conflict and certainly we had combatants," she said. And even if there was a question about the status of prisoners, she said, under the Geneva Conventions, an international tribunal is supposed to be convened to determine their status. But Bush claimed he had the power to make that decision. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which seeks to ensure humanitarian protection and assistance for victims of war and armed violence, offers a more mixed view of the controversy. Florian Westphal, a spokesman for the group, said in an e-mail to PolitiFact that "fundamentally, the Geneva Conventions as a whole apply to any international armed conflict. However, what has commonly been described as the 'war on terror' does not wholly correspond to the definition of an international armed conflict as put forward by the Conventions." The ICRC's position is that the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that started in October 2001 was an international armed conflict as defined under humanitarian law, and that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were fully applicable. However, the group said, things get murkier when talking about "terrorist" activity around the world perpetrated by loosely organized groups that, at best, share a common ideology. "'Terrorism' is a phenomenon. Both practically and legally, war cannot be waged against a phenomenon, but only against an identifiable party to an armed conflict," the ICRC stated in a fact sheet. Still, the ICRC concludes, "Persons detained in relation to a noninternational armed conflict waged as part of the fight against terrorism — as is the case with Afghanistan since June 2002 — are protected by Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and the relevant rules of customary international humanitarian law." Graham is right that the Supreme Court decision clarified the law (though he was off by a year when he said the ruling came in 2005 instead of 2006). But he goes too far by suggesting it was not the case before that decision. Some legal experts say that the prisoners have always been subject to the Geneva Conventions.

pomt-08082	Right-to-work states "have higher rates of income growth."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/17/robin-vos/state-rep-robin-vos-says-right-work-states-have-hi/	The new leadership in Wisconsin brought by the November 2010 elections are now bringing proposals for bold changes in policy. Republicans will take over the governorship, as well as control of the state Senate and Assembly, on Jan. 3, 2011. Governor-elect Scott Walker, in the run-up to his inauguration, has gone so far as to suggest stripping state employee unions of their rights to bargain contracts with the state. Unions -- for both public and private employers -- are also the target of Robin Vos, a Republican state representative from Rochester in Racine County. He is poised to become co-chair of the Legislature’s powerful Joint Finance Committee. Vos said Dec. 8, 2010 he may introduce a bill to make Wisconsin a "right-to-work" state. As a freshman lawmaker, Walker supported right-to-work legislation in 1993. In a Dec. 12 Milwaukee TV interview, Vos touted the virtues of such a policy change. "From my perspective, I think that if you look at all of the data that has been collected," Vos said on WISN’s "Upfront with Mike Gousha," "states that have non-forced, compulsory union membership when you want to work somewhere have higher rates of income growth, have higher rates of manufacturing -- actually, over time, have seen much greater increases in their standard of living." We decided to examine the question of whether right-to-work states are better off. We’ll start by taking on the terminology. A state is considered a "right-to-work" state if it prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that provide for a "union shop." A union shop is a workplace in which all employees are required to pay union dues. A state that allows union shops is considered by unions to be a "free-bargaining" state. Currently, 22 states, including Iowa in the Midwest, are right to work, according to a map provided by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which says it defends America’s workers "from the abuses of compulsory unionism." Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota are among 28 free-bargaining states, most of which are in the northeast quadrant of the country. In his TV interview, Vos made three claims about the benefits of right to work, but two are too vague for us to measure. Vos said right-to-work states have a "higher rate of manufacturing," which is not a common term. Asked to explain that claim, Vos provided one statistic about manufacturing gross domestic product and another about the loss of manufacturing jobs. A third statistic -- the percentage of a state’s workforce employed in manufacturing -- was cited when we asked the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO union about "rate of manufacturing." Vos also said right-to-work states have "seen much greater increases in their standard of living." Vos himself defined "standard of living" with statistics on four different topics. We’re going to set aside both in this item and focus on the very measurable claim that right-to-work states have "higher rates of income growth." Vos provided four pieces of evidence, but only two addressed growth in income. Both came from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, which advocates for right to work. A Rutgers University economics professor, in a paperwritten for the institute, said right-to-work laws "are strongly correlated with faster growth" in real personal income. The paper, however, was written in 2006 and did not provide data. The institute, using data from two federal agencies, trackedgrowth in real personal income from 1999 to 2009. It found the growth was 28.3 percent in right-to-work states and 14.7 percent in free-bargaining states. That’s a figure that supports Vos’ claim. Meanwhile, the national AFL-CIO used census data to examine median income from 2000 to 2009. Those figures show that income dropped 3 percent in right-to-work states and 5 percent in free-bargaining states. The union’s figures adjusted for inflation. That isn’t income growth, which was what Vos pointed to; but the figures do come out in right-to-work’s favor. It’s possible, of course, that changes in income may simply be correlated with a state having right-to-work status, and not caused by it. That is, there could be other factors at work. We consulted five economics professors on this point. They agreed that income growth has been higher in right-to-work states. But there was no consensus on how important right-to-work status is in causing that growth, and many minimized its role. Abdur Chowdhury, Marquette University: He said because factors such as business incentives and corporate tax rates are also involved, "it would be a stretch to say" right-to-work states had higher income growth because of right-to-work laws. With union representation less than 10 percent of private-sector employment nationally, he said, right to work "is no longer as important as it used to be." Russell Sobel, West Virginia University: He said it’s unclear how right-to-work compares to other factors in causing income growth, but the amount of income growth in right-to-work states indicates the impact of right-to-work "is fairly substantial." William Rogers, University of Missouri at St. Louis: "There has been a lot of research on this topic, and the overall conclusion is that right-to-work laws may have a small positive impact on state income." Russell Kashian, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater: Any right-to-work effect on income growth likely is diminishing, he said. Employers seeking low wages are more likely to go overseas, rather than choosing a right-to-work state over a free-bargaining state in the U.S. Richard Vedder, Ohio University: Laws and regulations relating to taxes, the environment and other areas sometimes play a bigger role than right-to-work in income growth, he said. But right-to-work is an "extremely simple and inexpensive policy change to implement." In a nutshell: None of the economists said right to work has no effect on raising income. But opinion is mixed on just how much of a factor it is. Let’s punch the clock on this one. Arguing that Wisconsin would be better off economically if it became a right-to-work state, state Rep. Robin Vos claimed that income growth has been higher in right-to-work states than in free-bargaining states. He’s correct on that statistic.

pomt-07579	Says Milwaukee County Parks director Sue Black has not received a pay raise in five years.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/28/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-milwaukee-county-parks-director-s/	Milwaukee County should be run more like a business. That’s one theme of first-time candidate Chris Abele as he seeks to replace Scott Walker as county executive in the April 5 election. On the campaign trail, Abele often says one standard, business-like approach to government calls for rewarding employees who deliver -- especially on the revenue front. When making his point, he routinely singles out the county parks director. He made the point during a March 22, 2011, appearance with challenger Jeff Stone before the Milwaukee Rotary Club. "You’ve got parks where for five years in a row earned revenue is growing and you have a parks director who earns the gold medal national award for the best managed park system but (her parks budget) gets cut and (she) doesn’t get a raise for five years." Sounds like someone got a raw deal. Let’s take a look at what Abele was discussing. We asked Abele’s campaign for his backup. Spokesman Brandon Lorenz sent us to Black, who he said told Abele about the money matter. Black didn’t return our calls, so we went to county records and other past news reports. Walker hired Black to run the county parks in 2004. Previously, she had been the director of the Wisconsin State Park System. While working for the Walker administration, Black earned a reputation as being a fierce advocate for the parks, even with a boss whose mantra was to cut back on county government. She considered running to replace Walker herself, but in January 2011 discarded the idea. In 2009, she won a national award, presented by the American Academy for Parks and Recreation and the National Recreation and Parks Association. At the time of the award, Jim Goulee, executive director of the Park People, a local parks advocacy organization, praised Black’s performance. He said Black and her staff had managed the system well in the face of "incessant budget cuts." Until recently, Black was paid $117,973 -- and it had been that way for a while. After Walker was re-elected in the spring of 2008, he rewarded several county department heads with higher pay. He accomplished that by taking the unusual step of moving up their pay grades when they were reappointed to their jobs in July 2008. County supervisors voted on the re-appointments but not the actual raises -- a matter that some complained about later on. Some examples: Airport Director Barry Bateman got an 11 percent bump, to $136,298; Department of Aging Director Stephanie Sue Stein got 4 percent, to $117,795; and corporation counsel William Domina got 8.3 percent, to $136,298. Black, too, was reappointed to her job. She got no increase. So, to this point, Abele’s point is on, well, point. Like all other county workers, Black received a 1 percent cost-of-living raise in October 2008, but beyond that her pay has remained the same. And since that was an across-the-board thing, it’s not a merit-based raise. Enter Lee Holloway, who became acting county executive in late December 2010. Holloway served about a month in the job before handing over the position to Marvin Pratt, who is in the position until the winner of the April 5 election takes over. Holloway included a $6,439 raise -- 5.5 percent -- for Black in a recommendation to the County Board’s Personnel Committee. The committee voted 6-0 to approve the report that included the raise, and it took effect Feb. 6, 2011, county records say. Black is now paid $123,931 -- well below the top pay possible for her position, $137,661. So, Black did get a raise, but very recently. Black’s unhappiness with her pay is well-known among courthouse insiders. Abele became aware of it after working with Black on several projects, including improvements to the Mitchell Park Domes and Bradford Beach, spokesman Lorenz said. Lorenz was unaware that Black had received the raise when contacted by PolitiFact the day after the forum. He also learned from PolitiFact that it had been seven years rather than five. Lorenz said someone with the campaign spoke with Black that day, and she said she had not seen the additional money. However, county records show her raise was reflected on a March 3, 2011, paycheck. At a candidate’s forum that evening, Abele mentioned Black’s raise and noted -- correctly -- that she had gone seven years without a bump. Abele revised his time span after speaking with Lorenz. But the candidate didn’t hear about the recent raise until the following morning, according to Lorenz. So let’s add this one up. Abele says Black, the award-winning director of the Milwaukee County Parks System, hasn’t received a raise in five (or seven, depending on the statement) years. That talking point came from Black herself, but very recently it became no longer operative. While Black got nothing when some other department heads received bumps in 2008, Holloway gave her a raise recently. It was handled in a low-key manner; Abele apparently wasn’t aware of it. The main thrust was good work should be rewarded, with Black -- who went seven years without a raise -- the example. He got some of the details wrong -- even after he moved to correct them. But on balance, this rates as Mostly True.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2011-03-28T09:00:00	2011-03-22	['None']
pomt-13598	"Under those eight years before (Barack) Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States" since Sept. 11, 2001.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/rudy-giuliani/aside-from-911-rudy-giuliani-wrong-about-no-terr/	Rudy Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Donald Trump’s counter-terrorism speech, appeared to forget one of the defining moments of modern U.S. history and his own political career: the Sept. 11 attacks. The former mayor of New York City during 9/11 was widely lampooned for suggesting that terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were unique to Barack Obama’s presidency. But many media reports left out the beginning of his speech, when he talked at length about 9/11. He recounted how it was the "worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812" and how Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, visited "Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help." Still, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: "By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office." Back in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, "We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush." He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, "since Sept. 11." Giuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using "abbreviated language." But even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to "radical Islamic extremism" is murkier in others. The New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of "violent jihadist attacks" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification. That’s because strict definitions like "hate crime" or "terrorist attack" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public’s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes — "questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation," said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America. That being said, let’s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role. 2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. 2002 Beltway snipers In October 2002, John Allen Muhammad and his accomplice, 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, randomly gunned down 10 people in Washington. They were arrested by police and SWAT officers on Oct. 24. The snipers’ motives were myriad. Malvo drew sketches depicting his acts as jihad and testified that Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, lectured him on the religion. He also said Muhammad wanted to start a revolution over "the continued oppression of black people." A Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of engaging in an act of terrorism, and the incident is listed as a major terrorism case on the FBI’s website. Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo is currently serving a life sentence. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself "a Muslim American, angry at Israel" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but "acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization." The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. In 2014, however, the City of Seattle included the shooting as an example of an incident that fits "into the terrorist mold" while the New America Foundation lists it as a "violent jihadist attack," because Haq claimed to be motivated by opposition to U.S. actions. 2006 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill attack In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He turned himself in following the attack and sent several letters to UNC’s student newspaper from jail declaring his intentions to exact revenge for Muslims. "I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree," he wrote in one letter. UNC students were divided over whether Taheri-azar’s actions constituted an act of terror. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating links to terrorism, the New York Times reported in 2006. Terrorist attacks that were unsuccessful or with unknown motives Two other infamous attacks don’t exactly fit Giuliani’s criteria, but are worth noting. The 2001 anthrax scare, which occurred shortly after 9/11, is the worst biological attack in U.S. history and a major terrorism case, according to the FBI. Five Americans were killed and another 17 were injured during the attacks. In 2008, the FBI was about to bring charges against Dr. Bruce Ivins, but the microbiologist committed suicide before they were filed. The 2001 shoe bomber, admitted al-Qaida member Richard Reid, attempted to light explosives on an American Airlines flight before he was subdued. In addition to these attacks, the New America Foundation has documented a handful of thwarted terrorist plots before Obama’s presidency. Our ruling Moments after mentioning 9/11, Giuliani said, "Under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States." Since then, there have been four successful plots on U.S. soil that were declared by the FBI to be terrorist attacks or whose perpetrators claimed to be motivated by ideology or anti-U.S. sentiments. Reasonable people can disagree over the definition of jihad-inspired terrorism, but Giuliani is taking things too far by omitting all of them. We rate his claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9f7f5498-8a3a-4ee1-8be2-70eb05f12c2f	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2016-08-16T17:21:50	2016-08-15	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama', 'Islam']
pomt-05014	The Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Transit Project has created 1,525 direct jobs as of June 11, 2012.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/16/trimet/has-portland-milwaukie-light-rail-project-created-/	PolitiFact Oregon takes job creation claims very seriously. It’s a popular way to justify taxpayer spending. But sometimes, the numbers just don’t add up. Case in point: A recent claim by U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., that transportation projects created more than one-third of the 2009 stimulus bill’s total jobs. We gave a nod to his methodology but found no independent evidence to back up his claim. The latest job-creation number to catch our eye? TriMet, the metro area’s transit agency, says that the $1.5 billion Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Project created 1,525 direct jobs as of June 11, 2012. That includes 659 on-site construction jobs since April 2011, and 866 professional and technical jobs since March 2009. (The numbers have been revised up for July.) We wanted to know whether those jobs would not have existed but for the light rail project -- which is how we think the average person interprets the word "created" -- and we wanted to know the duration of those jobs. We should back up for a moment and talk about why this matters. As we said, job numbers are a popular way to justify taxpayer spending. It’s easier to get behind an expensive roads project that will provide paychecks for construction workers, engineers, managers and so forth in the private sector. This is not new. Back in 1986, when the first light-rail line to Gresham was built, officials said the 15-mile line had developed some 1,200 jobs, according to a news story in The Oregonian. (This juicy nugget was pointed out by John Charles, president and CEO of the Cascade Policy Institute, a right-leaning think tank that advocates limited government and disapproves of light-rail.) Fast forward to today, where the projection for a smaller 7.3-mile line is "up to 14,500 jobs," about half of which are "direct" jobs. Economic development is obviously a big part of selling the the new light -rail line to the public. There’s a web page devoted to the subject: "The Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Transit Project is essential to the long-term economic vitality of our region, helping to connect people to their jobs and higher education. It also is providing many short-term benefits for the regional economy." Spokeswoman Mary Fetsch and Dan Blocher, TriMet’s executive director of capital projects, explained how the agency calculated the numbers. The methodology differs depending on the job. Construction jobs, for example, are tracked by name, regardless of duration. Some people may work for a year, others for two weeks, Blocher said, and the jobs figure does not differentiate. Technical and professional jobs are calculated differently. There’s no certified payroll list, as there is for construction contractors, so TriMet goes through billings by hand and counts heads. He said the agency counted workers who had worked at least 160 hours on the project -- which is equal to one month -- and came up with 866 jobs. Many of these jobs are now gone since the project has moved into the construction phase. What have we learned? The jobs created number does not differentiate between people employed for months and people employed for weeks. Certainly a job is a job, and that’s something for people who don’t have a job, but let’s be clear that these are not all long-term positions, even for a transit project that we know is temporary by nature. Nor is it clear that all jobs are jobs that didn’t exist before the light rail project. When we hear that a project created 1,525 direct jobs, we picture 1,525 new jobs that wouldn’t have existed but for the project. But that may not be the case. We don’t know how many of the contracted companies -- if any -- hired new people for new positions. TriMet doesn’t know either. We should also note that about 100 jobs are in-house, with TriMet. Is it fair, we asked, to include short-term jobs and TriMet jobs in the number of jobs created? Is it accurate to use the word "create" when maybe the better word is "sustain"? Perhaps we’re being overly picky, but we think officials should take extra care when talking about what a public project can or cannot do in terms of jobs. (Ditto for private sector companies that take public subsidies for projects.) Fetsch defended the figures: "I don’t think they’re inflated from my layperson’s perspective." She also explained that numbers are there to give people an idea of what happens when you put a shock of money into a region, like a $1.5 billion transportation project. We agree that’s a fair point to make, but it won’t affect our ruling. Finally, we reached out to Chuck Sheketoff, executive director of the Oregon Center for Public Policy, a left-leaning think tank that advocates for middle- and low-income families. To him, a public agency or private contractor can claim a job is created only when the company has hired a new person for a new position in anticipation of that work. Also, it matters whether the work is part-time, full-time, weeks-long or years-long. "Public agencies ought to be clear about creating temporary or full-time jobs. Everybody ought to," said Sheketoff. We think so, too. We’re relieved to know TriMet's numbers weren't produced from thin air, and find the statement somewhat accurate. But without knowing what the numbers mean or the definition of "created," a reader could easily think the light-rail project resulted in more than 1,500 brand-new full-time, long-term jobs when really, it’s far more accurate to say that the transit project has provided work for more than 1,500 people. We find the statement Half True, partially accurate but missing important details.	None	TriMet	None	None	None	2012-07-16T16:59:00	2012-07-02	['None']
pomt-05645	The administration has issued rules for "$1 abortions in ObamaCare" and "requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay" an abortion premium.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/21/blog-posting/does-barack-obamas-health-care-bill-include-1-abor/	Many readers have asked us to review a recent claim reverberating around the Internet that stems from an article posted on an anti-abortion website, lifenews.com. The March 12, 2012, article is titled, "Obama Admin Finalizes Rules: $1 Abortions in ObamaCare." Referring to a rule recently issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, lifenews.com published the following: "It’s official. The concern pro-life organizations had about the ObamaCare legislation funding abortions has been confirmed, as the Obama administration has issued the final rules on abortion funding governing the controversial health care law. Nestled within the ‘individual mandate’ in the Obamacare act — that portion of the Act requiring every American to purchase government-approved insurance or pay a penalty — is an ‘abortion premium mandate.’ This mandate requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion. As a result, many pro-life Americans will have to decide between a plan that violates their consciences by funding abortion, or a plan that may not meet their health needs." We’ll look at whether the Obama administration has issued rules for "$1 abortions in ObamaCare" and required "all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion." (We emailed lifenews.com but did not hear back.) As we’ve noted before, abortion has been a thorny issue in the process of drafting and enacting a health care law from the beginning. Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care reform bill set up health care "exchanges" in which private insurance companies can compete for the business of buyers who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question became: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do) when operating through the exchanges? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? The final rules from HHS don’t dramatically alter the approach taken by the law itself. For starters, when the exchanges begin operating in 2014, some states will ban all abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on that state’s exchange. Doing so is allowed by a state "opt-out" clause that was passed as part of the health care law. According to the National Right to Life Committee, 15 states have passed such laws so far, with other legislatures considering similar measures. Beyond that, every state must offer at least one plan on its exchange that doesn’t cover abortion, and that plan will include the same minimum benefit package for non-abortion services that is required of every other plan sold on the exchanges. In addition, no private insurer will be forced to cover abortion; doing so will be their choice, at least in states that choose to allow it. However, unless and until opt-out laws are passed by the other 35 states, insurers will be allowed to sell policies on the exchanges that include abortion coverage. To allow this yet still abide by the Hyde Amendment, sponsors of the bill drafted a special procedure to differentiate between dollars spent on abortion coverage and dollars spent for everything else. (Anti-abortion advocates have consistently argued that the approach doesn’t offer strong enough protections to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. More on that later.) Any insurer offering a plan on the exchange that includes abortion coverage must set up two separate accounts for dollars received and paid. One account would hold money that is used to pay for abortion services (except for abortions that are the result of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother, which may be paid for under the Hyde Amendment). The other account would hold money that is used to pay for everything else. All federal dollars, such as federal subsidies received by purchasers on the exchange whose incomes are low enough to qualify for them, would be deposited in the non-abortion account. Most of the premiums paid by the plan’s beneficiaries would also go into this account, but a fraction of individual premium payments would be sent to the abortion account, so that enough money is available to pay for claims submitted by beneficiaries for abortion services. The Obama administration has issued rules for "$1 abortions in ObamaCare" So where does that $1figure come from? HHS has determined the minimum amount that insurers offering plans that include abortion must allocate per beneficiary into this abortion account. An insurer "may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee, per month," HHS said. That’s where it comes from. But what does it mean? It means that a plan cannot contribute less than $1of premiums per month per beneficiary into the abortion fund. That’s all. It doesn’t mean that abortions will cost one dollar -- which seems an obvious interpretation of the phrase "$1 abortions in ObamaCare." Rather, it’s a way of filling the account so that there’s enough money to pay abortion providers for their services. The actual amount per enrollee per month may be a lot higher, depending on what the insurer’s actuaries determine. So the claim of "$1 abortions" is ridiculously inaccurate. What about the second claim? The law "requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion." This claim echoes many made by anti-abortion advocates since the law was first proposed. Critics argue that the health care law’s protections against taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions are inadequate. "The most objectionable aspect is that it is a smokescreen intended to conceal the new and massive federal subsidies (‘tax credits’) to health plans that cover abortion on demand -- a sharp break from decades of federal policy," said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. "Under Medicaid and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, for example, federal funds do not go to plans that cover elective abortions." But let’s parse the lifenews.com statement closely. For starters, it refers to "all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion services" -- but the issue at hand actually affects only persons who purchased insurance from the exchanges. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2018, there will be 24 million people buying insurance through the exchanges, compared to 184 million people with either employer-provided insurance or individually purchased insurance outside the exchanges. So the maximum number of people theoretically affected by this concern is 12 percent of private-insurance beneficiaries in 2018. And that number could decline substantially once you subtract residents of the 15 states (or more) that bar any abortion coverage in exchange-sold policies, and after you subtract those individuals that purchase one of the non-abortion options required to be offered by the exchanges. This group falls well short of "all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion." But even this is a side issue. We have ruled in the past that the health care law does not provide federal funding for abortion. Our conclusion was that even if you have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges -- and Americans in many states won’t have that option -- you won’t be forced to buy such coverage. Non-abortion options will always be available on the exchanges, and tax dollars sent to those plans through federal subsidies will be placed in accounts walled off from accounts used to pay for abortion services. This all means that anyone purchasing a plan with abortion coverage will be be doing so by choice and paying for it personally. On March 16, 2012, Johnson, of the National Right to Life Committee, and his colleague, senior legislative counsel Susan T. Muskett, raised an issue about the way the law is worded. They wrote that "if a health plan covers abortion, the rule forbids the plan from calling attention to that fact in any of its advertising or explanatory materials. The disclosure of abortion coverage can be provided ‘only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment.’ This provision seems designed for no other purpose than to ensure that many people who would not deliberately sign up for abortion-covering plans will do so inadvertently." The text of the law does include this line: "A qualified health plan that provides for coverage of (elective abortion) shall provide a notice to enrollees, only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment, of such coverage." This use of the word "only" does seem to raise the risk that a plan’s abortion provisions won’t be fully transparent to the buyer. But we think the law does ensure disclosure for any potential purchaser who is paying attention. HHS describes the disclosure summary in question as something akin to the nutritional labels on food -- a standardized form that will allow consumers to easily compare one plan’s features to another’s before they buy. "Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services," said HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields. Our ruling The claim that the Obama administration has issued rules for "$1 abortions in ObamaCare" is ridiculous; the administration has simply set a floor for how much money per month of the premiums paid by those who have chosen plans that include abortion must be placed in a segregated account in order to make sure that there’s enough money available to pay for abortion services incurred by people enrolled in that plan. The bigger charge -- that the Obama health care law "requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion" -- is also incorrect. The provision in question only affects people who purchase insurance plans that cover abortion and who do so on the exchanges -- a much narrower group than the claim suggests. And people who make such purchases will be paying their private dollars into abortion coverage accounts voluntarily. Despite some puzzling wording, ultimately the law allows for full disclosure of its abortion rules at the most obvious time, when someone is signing up for coverage. On balance, we rate this claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2012-03-21T18:04:25	2012-03-12	['None']

pomt-04768	Republicans included "the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/27/charlie-crist/crist-gop-platform-bans-abortion-even-cases-rape/	The Democrats have been attacking Mitt Romney and the Republicans for their opposition to abortion rights. On the eve of the Republican convention in Tampa, they got some help from Republican turned independent Charlie Crist, the former governor of Florida. Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times, and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women’s issues. "Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims," Crist wrote. Crist refers to Todd Akin, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Missouri. The GOP establishment , including Mitt Romney, called for Akin to withdraw after he said that "legitimate rape" rarely results in pregnancy. Akin apologized for his comment but refused to back out. Democrats have been tying Akin to the GOP and Romney ever since. To assess the accuracy of Crist’s statement, we asked whether Akin’s views are part of the GOP 2012 platform and whether there is such a thing as an Akin amendment in the first place. What the platform says A party’s platform document is supposed to capture the values and policies its presidential candidate will advance if she or he wins the White House. We should note that presidential candidates don’t always agree with every element of the platform, but it is a statement of the party’s overall principles. The 2012 platform remains unofficial until a formal vote by the convention delegates but the staff of the Republican National Committee sent PolitiFact the current text of the section on abortion. The key portion reads "We assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children." What these words mean is subject to interpretation, but at the very least, they call for nullifying Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion as a private decision that should be left, within limits, to the woman. We attempted to reach Crist to hear why he believes this language would ban abortion in cases of rape, but we were unsuccessful. We did speak to David O’Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. O’Steen said the platform does not prohibit abortion when rape produces a pregnancy. "It states a broad policy," O’Steen said. "It says Roe should be reversed and human life should be protected and that elected representatives should have the right to pass those protections." But O’Steen said those protections are not absolute, and Congress and individual states would have to decide what exceptions to allow. O’Steen compared those exceptions to laws regarding capital punishment. For example, homicide is a crime but killing a person in self-defense is not. "It all depends on the circumstances," O"Steen said. Similarly, Congress and states could pass laws that allow or prohibit abortion in cases of rape. O’Steen says this would hold true if Congress passed the human life amendment or other legislation that declares that legal personhood begins at the moment of conception. That legal opinion is far from universal. Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a staff attorney at the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, told Mother Jones magazine, "Anywhere they give legal rights to and define 'person' as beginning at fertilization, you have the 'personhood' effect." In the article, the personhood effect is defined as effectively banning all abortions. As for whether states would have the flexibility to set their own conditions for abortions, Suzanne Novack, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in the same magazine article, "It wouldn't go back to the states. It would be the law of the land." We should note that the current wording in the GOP platform has been in place at least since 2004. Republican candidates have run on that platform and have endorsed exceptions for abortion in cases of rape and incest. As PolitiFact has reported before, since about 2000, the human life amendments introduced in Congress have included those exceptions, too. However in 2008, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., failed in an effort to include the rape and incest exceptions in the platform itself. Also, O’Steen says while the National Right to Life Committee has endorsed Romney, the "ideal policy would have an exception to protect the health of the mother only." An "Akin" amendment? So is the personhood amendment fairly described as the Akin amendment? As far as we can tell, there is no Akin amendment. We were unable to reach Crist to ask what he meant by the term. O’Steen told us that Akin "was nowhere close to the platform committee." Romney’s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., has joined Akin on legislation to limit Medicaid funding for abortions to cases of ‘forcible rape.’ PolitiFact has found that Ryan opposes the rape exception for abortion, as does Akin. The advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America told us that "someone started to refer to the abortion language in the GOP platform as the "Akin amendment" because it did not explicitly include exceptions for rape and incest. That said, Akin didn’t play a role in drafting that language." We found an article that credits the Obama campaign for applying that label to the GOP platform position on abortion, which we believe is quite a stretch given Akin has not been involved. Our ruling Crist said the GOP platform includes "the Akin amendment ... which bans abortion, even for rape victims." The platform clearly opposes most abortions but is vague on the details. It does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims. Also, there is no official Akin amendment, and the legal implications of a human life amendment and some versions of personhood bills are debatable. However, there is no dispute that all such measures would nullify Roe v. Wade. Some leading anti-abortion groups would like to ban abortions even in cases of rape and believe personhood bills would help them do this. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-13197	A World Health Organization report shows "that more people are dying of TB."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/24/doctors-without-borders/world-tb-deaths-shoot-paper/	A reader of a recent statement from the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders might be forgiven for thinking we are losing ground in the battle against tuberculosis. "The World Health Organization’s annual look at the global state of tuberculosis this year makes for a shockingly bad report card," the statement began. It then noted "WHO’s report reveals that more people are dying of TB and more people are left undiagnosed and untreated than last year, creating a cycle of TB transmission and death." We went to the WHO tuberculosis report to see if more people are dying of TB and if so, does that amount to shockingly bad news. The answer is that while Doctors Without Borders has its numbers right, the increase is the result of better reporting, which people in public health, including Doctors Without Borders, see as a plus in the battle against any disease. The WHO tuberculosis update In 2015, WHO estimated that tuberculosis killed 1.4 million people directly and was the proximate cause of death for an additional 0.4 million people infected with HIV. Together, the death toll was 1.8 million. In 2014, WHO estimated the total number of deaths at 1.5 million, with about 1.1 million who died exclusively from tuberculosis and another 0.4 million who were HIV-positive. So that’s pretty clear. The total death toll rose by about 300,000. But as the authors of the latest report spell out, the change stems from better counting, not in the growing reach of the disease. "The TB epidemic is larger than previously estimated, reflecting new surveillance and survey data from India," the report said. Prudence Smith, a WHO spokeswoman, explained that between 2013 and 2015, India shifted from a reporting system based on paper to one that lives on the Internet. "In addition," Smith said, "the country has made case notification legally mandatory." In the world of tuberculosis, India is a huge deal. It is home to more than 25 percent of all TB cases and deaths worldwide. With better raw data in hand, the estimated death toll in India more than doubled between 2014 and 2015. While that might seem shocking, what really happened is that the earlier estimates low-balled deaths by a huge amount. So, has the situation deteriorated? Not really. There are two ways to measure progress. You can estimate deaths and from that, you can estimate the TB death rate within the population. The same WHO report said both deaths and the death rate are down dramatically since 2000. We looked at estimates from another respected source, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. In an Oct. 8, 2016, Lancet article, the institute looked at the trend between 2005 and 2015. As you can see in this chart, the University of Washington group’s estimates mirror those of the WHO. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us the numbers can seem confusing. Kates said there’s been a strong effort to amp up the accuracy of tracking TB for some time, and she doesn’t find the latest figures surprising. "Newer methods, better data, and so on yield better estimates and that sometimes makes understanding the trends and messaging about them much harder," Kates said. Doctors Without Borders spokeswoman Brienne Prusak said the latest figures paint a dire picture. Prusak noted that the report shows that TB deaths topped those by HIV/AIDS. Kates, WHO and Doctors Without Borders applaud the improved TB monitoring. They also all say that funding to combat the disease falls well short of what’s needed. The WHO said the global effort ought to be in the neighborhood of $8.3 billion. Current spending is about $2 billion shy of that. The 2015 estimate from the WHO has a special significance. It is the starting point in a 20-year plan to not just stop tuberculosis, but to end it. Our ruling The group Doctors Without Borders called the latest WHO report on TB shockingly bad and noted that more people are dying from the disease. That statement about the rise in the deaths ascribed to tuberculosis is accurate. Estimated deaths rose by about 300,000 people. But much of that increase has more to do with better reporting and more complete data than an actual increase in deaths. As the WHO report noted, experts came to believe that earlier estimates were too low. This was largely driven by the numbers out of India. Looking back 10 years, the trends in the number of deaths and the TB death rate show steady improvement. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-08111	Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/12/mark-brodeur/tourism-director-says-rhode-island-spends-just-10-/	Rhode Island hasn't always done a good job of promoting itself as a tourist destination. During the 1980s, the state created catchy ads touting Rhode Island as "the biggest little state in the Union," yet didn't invest money to run them outside the Ocean State. Other slogans such as "America's First Resort" and "Our People Make Us Great" never really caught on. (We couldn't even remember them. We had to look them up.) So it seemed plausible when Mark Brodeur, director of the state's tourism division, told The Journal that Rhode Island's current tourism budget is $720,000, which he said is less than 10 percent of the $11 million that, on average, other states spend promoting tourism. But we wanted to know whether the level is really that low, especially if you factor in Rhode Island's small size. Our first stop was a call to Brodeur's office, where we asked for the source of his numbers. He wasn't available for an immediate answer so we did some digging on our own. New Hampshire's Division of Travel & Tourism Development had no trouble coming up with numbers. Spokesman Tai Freligh e-mailed us a January 2010 report from the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group in Washington, D.C., that surveyed tourism budgets for 2008 to 2009. It reports that Rhode Island ranked 48th out of 48 states when it came to spending money on tourism promotion. (The report had no data for Massachusetts or New Jersey.) It listed the median state expenditure for state tourism offices as nearly $11.8 million, the "average" Brodeur was apparently referring to. Ten percent of $11.8 million would be $1.18 million. The $720,000 Rhode Island spends is, in fact, less than 10 percent of that (8.5 percent, in fact). So far so good. Then the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, at Brodeur's request, sent us statistics, citing U.S. Travel as the source, that seemed more complete. According to the newer figures for the now-complete 2010 fiscal year, Rhode Island again ranked dead last on the total amount spent. Second from the bottom was Connecticut, which cut its tourism spending from $5.7 million for the 2009 fiscal year to $981,538 the following year. The median amount spent by a state was $10.2 million. Even if Rhode Island was spending $1 million promoting tourism, we would still be 10 percent below the norm, according to the numbers Brodeur's office sent us. Brodeur's statement continued to ring true. However, when we adjusted the numbers to account for Rhode Island's size, it revealed a different story. But first, for the benefit of people who are savvy in math, we have to nitpick. The "average" state tourism budget numbers that we've been citing ($11.8 million in 2009 and $10.2 million in 2010) aren't really averages. They're medians -- or the amounts spent by the two states in the middle of the list, as ranked by the amount spent. (The true average in both years is actually higher -- $13.5 million in 2010, for example -- because a few states such as Hawaii and California spent a disproportionately higher amount.) So far, the distinction hasn't mattered. Whether you talk about average or median, Rhode Island's spending is 10 percent below either figure. Now let's talk about per person (also known as per capita) spending. We divided each state expenditure by the state's population, using U.S. Census Bureau estimates for July 1, 2009. Suddenly our ranking improves, but not by much. For 2010, Rhode Island was fifth from the bottom, at 68 cents per person. Only Ohio, Indiana, New York and Connecticut spent less. But the amount wasn't low enough for Brodeur's statement to be accurate. According to our calculations, based on the numbers provided by the EDC, states, on average, spent $4.69 per person promoting tourism. The median was $2.40 per person. Ten percent of the average spent would be 47 cents. Ten percent of the median spent would be 24 cents. At 68 cents, we were well above both those amounts. When Brodeur says that Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism, that's true only if you ignore each state's population. Once that is factored into the equation, no matter which "average" you look at, his statement is wrong. But in the end, Brodeur's broader point that, compared with other states, Rhode Island spends very little promoting tourism is correct, especially when you take into consideration the fact that Rhode Island's tourism office had a budget of nearly $3 million in 1994. So Brodeur gets an "I survived the Truth-O-Meter" T-shirt and a ruling of Mostly True.	None	Mark Brodeur	None	None	None	2010-12-12T00:01:00	2010-12-02	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-07930	There have been "at least four incidents where bullets from Mexico have crossed the border."	true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/28/greg-abbott/attorney-general-greg-abbott-says-bullets-have-cro/	Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, publicizing his call for Congress to investigate a shooting along the U.S.-Mexico border, said in a press release this month that his demand "comes after at least four incidents where bullets from Mexico have crossed the border, putting at risk the safety and security of Texas residents." We’ve found other claims about cross-border violence — how many people have been killed across the border and whether spillover violence is escalating, for example — to be inflated. So we looked into Abbott’s count. According to an Associated Press news article, authorities from the Hudspeth County Sheriff’s office said road workers near the border "were fired upon by an unknown gunman in Mexico" on Jan. 13. Abbott referred to the incident in his Jan. 14 press release announcing he’d sent a letter to U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, urging their committees to review the Obama administration’s "response to this incident and others like it" and "determine what the federal government can do to protect border residents." Abbott’s press release said: "Gunmen in Mexico fired across the border at U.S. road workers in rural West Texas, in what local law enforcement considers to be an attempt by drug smugglers to scare the workers away so that their smuggling operations in the U.S. could continue." Abbott’s letter offers more detail: "Six months ago, I warned President (Barack) Obama about the life-threatening danger of bullets flying across the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas. At that time, El Paso’s City Hall had just been struck by gunfire from the Mexican side of the border. In August of last year, more stray bullets from inside Mexico struck school buildings at the University of Texas at El Paso." In a June 30 letter to Obama, Abbott said "it was mere luck that the bullets struck buildings rather than bodies." He urged the president to "make border security (his) top priority." Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland provided us with the administration’s response, from Jarrod Bernstein, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. "Border security remains a top priority for this administration," Bernstein wrote Dec. 10, also pointing out that "Obama has deployed 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southwest border." We previously confirmed three of the incidents Abbott referred to while fact-checking earlier statements, including one that Abbott made in August about gunfire in Mexico that month had led El Paso authorities to close a section of U.S. 85. A building on the UTEP campus was struck by a bullet that police suspect was fired during the incident, according to an Aug. 24 El Paso Times news article. Subsequent news articles by the Times reported more than one bullet crossed the border. Earlier, bullets fired on the Mexico side of the border struck El Paso’s City Hall June 29, an incident Gov. Rick Perry referred to in July. According to the El Paso Police Department, one bullet traveled through a ninth-floor window and an interior wall before lodging in a picture frame. Stucco walls of the government building were struck by an additional six rounds, the police said. "Investigators believe that the rounds may be related to (a shooting incident) that occurred in Juarez," a police department press release said. In August, department spokesman Darrel Petry told us the bullets flew during an attack in Juarez on Mexican federal agents. In March, checking Sen. John Cornyn’s claim that spillover violence in Texas is real and escalating, we confirmed that in September 2009, the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College closed for several days after stray bullets from a shootout from the Mexican side of the border hit a car and building on campus. Strickland, who told us that Abbott wasn’t referring to a specific time period when he said at least four incidents have brought bullets across the border, pointed to news reports to confirm the recent incident in West Texas. On Jan. 14, the El Paso Times, reported that the day before, "at least one gunman fired a high-powered rifles across the border" at four road workers toiling about half a mile from the border, east of Fort Hancock. Robert Wilson, a lieutenant with the Hudspeth County Sheriff’s Office, told us authorities found eight bullets around Indian Hot Springs Road, where the men were working. The men weren’t hit, according to the news article. We rate Abbott’s statement as True.	None	Greg Abbott	None	None	None	2011-01-28T06:00:00	2011-01-14	['Mexico']

pomt-03911	Says "Did you know that the #KeystoneXL project is expected to create 20,000 American jobs, including more than 800 in Oregon?"	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/27/greg-walden/rep-greg-walden-says-keystone-xl-pipeline-would-cr/	The Keystone XL pipeline is years from operating and may, in fact, never be built. But that doesn’t mean the 1,700-mile project from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands in Alberta that would bring heavy crude to the Gulf of Mexico isn’t already pumping product, at least rhetorically. The U.S. State Department is expected to decide by the end of March whether to grant a permit that must be issued for the pipeline to be built. (The State Department is involved because the pipeline would cross an international border.) It’s a high-stakes, high volume, politically charged exercise. Environmentalists have protested -- and been arrested -- in recent days in front of the White House as part of their campaign to pressure President Barack Obama to reject the project. The other side has been just as active. That includes U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who has long supported the pipeline as a way to make the United States more energy self-sufficient and boost the economy -- even in Oregon. Here’s what he tweeted Jan. 29, 2013: "Did you know that the#KeystoneXL project is expected to create 20,000 American jobs, including more than 800 in Oregon?" That’s an attention-grabbing statement for two reasons. The first is the overall number of jobs at a time when the U.S. economy continues to struggle. The second concerns both numbers and geography. The pipeline as proposed would enter the U.S. in Montana and angle toward the Gulf on an eastward track through South Dakota and Nebraska. From there it continues to the Gulf. Even if the route changes, the pipeline will be 1,000 miles (or more) from Oregon. So it’s fair to ask, how will a state so far removed from the project claim 800 jobs? Here’s a second, more basic question: Is the 20,000 "American jobs" cited by Walden and many other supporters of the project real? Let’s take a look. Sure enough, TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline has cited the potential for 20,000 jobs. "The $7 billion oil pipeline is the largest infrastructure project on the books in the U.S. right now," the company said in a 2012 news release. "It would create 20,000 jobs: 13,000 in construction, 7,000 in manufacturing." There have been numerous analyses and copious filings by the company itself in pursuit of the permit. And yet, the conclusion that 20,000 jobs would be created is more than a bit slippery. A 2011 study by Cornell University is absolute: "The company’s claim that KXL will create 20,000 direct construction and manufacturing jobs in the U.S is not substantiated," it states. One of the more troublesome devices is this: The total is a reflection of something called "job years." Why is that important? A "job year" is a measure of one job performed for one year. That means if a single worker stays on the job for the two years the pipeline construction is expected to last, that single worker counts as two jobs. The measure might be accepted -- and used -- by economists but it’s not what the average person thinks when hearing the word "job." TransCanada says the 20,000 jobs include 13,000 direct jobs, mostly construction and 7,000 indirect jobs. If the project takes two years, it means 6,500 actual direct jobs (plus or minus), which is the number the State Department uses. Calculated that way, the actual number of people employed by the pipeline moves closer to 10,000, or some 6,500 workers in construction and 3,500 in manufacturing. Not 20,000. Here’s another important point: These construction jobs are not permanent and, for the most part, aren’t necessarily local. The positions will disappear when the pipeline is complete. The State Department estimates that only 10 to 15 percent of these jobs can be filled with workers from communities in the pipeline’s path. As for the broader (and always murky) world of indirect jobs, the study -- by Lara Skinner and Sean Sweeney at Cornell’s Global Labor Institute -- raises questions about an analysis by the Perryman Group, which was hired by TransCanada to look at economic impacts. "The Perryman study is based on expenditure and sourcing data provided by TransCanada, and none of that information has been disclosed or subject to independent review," the Cornell study says. By their calculations, Perryman uses a multiplier of 18 job-years for every $1 million spent on the project. Skinner and Sweeney write that a more acceptable multiplier is 11 job-years for every $1 million spent. "So a reasonable estimate of the total incremental U.S. jobs from KXL construction is about one-third of the figure estimated in the Perryman study and used by industry to advocate for the construction of KXL," the Cornell study concludes. Let’s move on to the second part of Walden’s claim, that the pipeline would bring "800 jobs" to Oregon. Unlike a lot of states far removed from the actual pipeline route, there is an official thread to Oregon. In a January 2012 news release promoting the pipeline’s economic value, TransCanada says this: "Construction of Keystone XL is expected to create 7000 manufacturing jobs. Key support companies include: Welspun (pipe from Arkansas), Cameron (valves from Louisiana), Siemens (pumps, motors and related control equipment manufactured in Oregon, Ohio and Indiana) and dozens of other companies manufacturing everything from nuts and bolts to complex electrical control equipment." That’s as specific as it gets, however. When asked for source material to back this claim of 800 jobs, Walden’s office referred to a Chamber of Commerce study. Sure enough, the publication says there will be 838 jobsattributable to the pipelinein Oregon by 2020. (Once again, the use of "jobs" is not what an average person expects.) Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Blair Latoff Holmes said the number was taken from a study commissioned by the pro-pipeline American Petroleum Institute, written by the Canadian Energy Research Institute and released in June 2011. All of these studies are vulnerable to criticism because the formulas are by necessity often more art than science and the methodology used is not clearly expressed. That’s why the conclusions should be consumed with caution. But tone matters too. In his statement, Walden seems absolute even while there is no clarification that the 20,000 figure refers to "job years," which is much different than the way "job" is commonly understood. Walden has a somewhat stronger case on the Oregon job claim, mostly because TransCanada mentions Oregon by name as one state that would produce equipment needed for the project. As for the number 800, however, it is at best a guess. That’s a pipeline full of uncertainty. We rate this claim Mostly False: It contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12079	"Two-thirds of the (Hurricane Sandy relief) bill had nothing to do with Sandy."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-mostly-false-claim-two-thirds-sandy-reli/	Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains and flooding have revived memories of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s nay vote on federal relief for superstorm Sandy. MSNBC host Katy Tur challenged Cruz to defend his vote then with his support for relief today. Cruz said he enthusiastically backed aid for Sandy’s victims, but the problem was the particular bill. "It became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork," Cruz said Aug. 28. "Two-thirds of the bill had nothing to do with Sandy. And what I said then and still believe now is it's not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people who are hurting, for them to pay for their own political wishlist." Did two-thirds of the Sandy money have nothing to do with that storm? No. There was some padding, but the data and the assessment of those who studied the bill say the extras amounted to far less than Cruz stated. Cruz’s office sent us its breakout of the 2013 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act to support the assertion that "nearly 70 percent" was "used for non-emergency spending." Before we dive into a couple of the big items on that list, it’s important to note that Cruz said the bulk of the money had nothing to do with Sandy. That’s considerably stronger than saying the money went for "non-emergency spending." Two big pots of money In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated portions of the Mid-Atlantic coast. Congress responded by adding nearly $10 billion to the National Flood Insurance Program. It then passed a relief bill for five times that amount. The bigger package passed without the support of Cruz and most other Republicans. Of the $50.5 billion dollars that Congress appropriated, Cruz’s office cited a Congressional Quarterly article that said $17 billion went for "immediate aid and $33.5 billion for near- and long-term assistance and mitigation." The list from Cruz highlighted $16 billion to the Housing and Urban Development Department’s Community Development Fund. (The actual figure is $15.2 billion according to a spreadsheet from the Recovery and Accountability Board, the agency created to oversee recession recovery spending.) Cruz’s office said that included "any major disaster declarations from 2011, 2012 and 2013." While that might raise concern that the money would go elsewhere, in reality, the funds largely went to the states hit by Sandy. According to HUD, $12.8 billion has been granted to New Jersey, New York and New York City. Add in other east coast states where Sandy did damage -- Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island -- and the total reaches $13 billion. So you could argue that the bucket leaked, but not nearly on the scale flagged by Cruz’s office. The other large chunk of funds was $10.9 billion for mass transit reconstruction. That money has been slow to get out the door. The Recovery Board had just $3.7 billion granted and a bit under $1 billion spent as of March 2015. But that doesn’t prove that the money had nothing to do with Sandy. The Federal Transit Administration told state officials in 2013 that "funds are for specific areas (counties) in 12 states designated as disaster areas for Hurricane Sandy." The Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, assessed the transit relief program in 2014. It said "transit projects can take years to complete. Furthermore, Federal Transit Administration plans to use nearly half of its Disaster Relief Appropriations Act appropriation for resiliency projects (or projects to protect facilities from future damage)." The GAO noted that the funding guidelines allow "transit agencies to improve facilities beyond pre-disaster conditions." This supports the criticism that the money would go beyond immediate disaster relief, but as the report noted, large-scale construction projects have long runways. Taken together, these two buckets of money account for about $24 billion of the $33 billion that was the basis for Cruz saying most of the money was unrelated to Sandy. Two people who analyze disaster relief spending said Cruz was off the mark. "Two-thirds would be a gross overestimate," said Robert Young, a Western Carolina University geologist. "There was clearly extraneous spending, but no way it was two-thirds." The advocacy group Taxpayers for Common Sense assembled a body of data on spending related to Sandy. The group’s vice president Steve Ellis said no matter how you look at the numbers, two-thirds of the funds "are definitely Sandy related." Ellis said the bigger issue wasn’t pork barrel spending, rather that the bill passed outside of the regular budget process. "It really depends on how you think about emergency," Ellis said. "Two years after Sandy only a fraction of the money had been spent. We would like to see a more deliberative approach to disaster rather than strike while the iron is hot." Our ruling Cruz said that two-thirds of Hurricane Sandy relief money had nothing to do with Sandy. The numbers don’t back that up. Cruz might have been focused on the difference between immediate emergency relief and longer term reconstruction, but his words skipped over that distinction. The data and the assessment of experts show that the bulk of the funds went to the places hit hardest by Sandy. There was a leaky bucket, but not at the level Cruz declared.

pomt-14834	Wisconsin’s 6th congressional "district has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other" in the nation.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/20/glenn-grothman/rep-glenn-grothman-says-his-district-has/	In making the transition from state lawmaker to a U.S. Congressman, Republican Glenn Grothman has learned a few things about national issues -- and his new district. As a candidate in 2014, Grothman -- like the other Republicans seeking the open seat -- opposed the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Grothman called the agency a form of "corporate welfare" and promised not to support the institution. But employers in his district told him they are heavy users of the bank, which helps companies sell their goods and services in foreign countries by providing financing for export deals. Ultimately, Grothman voted to support reauthorization of the bank -- a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter. At the time, he said he reconsidered after listening to Wisconsin employers who benefit from the bank. And Grothman told us that, since taking office, he’s learned a lot about the 6th District. With about 710,000 residents, it’s a little more than four times as large as his state Senate district. One tidbit he picked up: "This district has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other" in the nation. That claim caught our attention. Is Grothman right? Behind the numbers Before we dig into the numbers, let’s look at some of the manufacturers in his district that urged him to support the Export-Import bank. In all, Grothman said he heard from 42 businesses. Those companies include defense contractor Oshkosh Corp. and crane manufacturer Manitowoc Co. Grothman said he knew manufacturing was important to Wisconsin, but initially assumed that Congressional districts in large cities like Chicago might have a greater share of manufacturers. As backup on the claim the 6th District is among the most manufacturing-heavy in the nation, Grothman pointed us to a January 2015 report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute on the importance of manufacturing jobs. According to the report, which is build on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Wisconsin is the nation’s No. 2 state in percentage of total employment which are manufacturing jobs, behind Indiana. The report said that as of 2013, there were 458,400 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin, about 16.3 percent of the state workforce. The 6th District has about 80,000 manufacturing jobs out of a workforce of 353,700. That’s a share of 22.6 percent, putting it third, behind two districts in Indiana - one in the far northeast corner and the other in the north western portion of the state. The 6th District is No. 1 in terms of total manufacturing employment, followed by the 3rd District in Indiana which has 76,200. Four Wisconsin congressional districts (the 1st, 5th 6th, and 8th) are in the top 11 nationally, in terms of manufacturing jobs as a share of total employment. All are represented in the House by Republicans. The 1st is in the southern and eastern part of the state, represented by Paul Ryan; the 5th, represented by Jim Sensenbrenner, includes suburban counties north and west of Milwaukee; the 6th is represented by Grothman and the 8th is in northeastern Wisconsin, represented by Reid Ribble. Our rating Grothman’s introduction to Washington included some insights --and political pressure -- about his district that caused him to switch his position on the Export-Import Bank. In explaining his switch, he said the 6th District has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other other in the nation. He’s right both in terms of the percent of jobs in manufacturing (3rd) and the raw number (1st). We rate the statement True.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2015-11-20T13:23:51	2015-10-30	['None']
pomt-07066	"Rep. Jim Renacci’s plan to end Medicare also puts nursing home care for 3,000 seniors in the district in immediate jeopardy."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/28/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-rep-jim-renacci-plan-would-jeopardize-nu/	The "Path to Prosperity" budget document that Republicans in the House of Representatives adopted in April has become a path to propaganda for Democrats who are using the proposals it contains in an effort to discredit its Republican supporters. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blitzed the media June 8 with news releases that claimed particular GOP congressmen who voted for the plan would jeopardize nursing home care for senior citizens in their district. One targeted freshman Rep. Jim Renacci from Ohio’s 16th Congressional District. "Rep. Jim Renacci’s plan to end Medicare also puts nursing home care for 3,000 seniors in the district in immediate jeopardy," the news release said. It asserted the "Republican-Renacci plan" might force grandma "to move out of the nursing home because families can no longer afford her long-term care." This seemed like an odd claim to make about Renacci, an entrepreneur who built a personal fortune of more than $30 million through businesses that included a chain of nursing homes. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. A popular soundbite has been to label the GOP plan as a plan to kill Medicare. This claim, though, also ties in nursing home care funded by Medicaid. Medicaid is the nation’s largest payer for nursing home care, bankrolling 64 percent of nursing home patients and 13 percent of assisted living residents, according to the American Health Care Association, a trade group for the nursing home industry. The Republican plan would convert the federal share of Medicaid into block grants. Republicans say that would maximize states’ flexibility to focus benefits on specific needs. Presently, the only option for states to reduce costs, they say, is across-the-board cuts in reimbursements to doctors, which leads to fewer doctors willing to see Medicaid patients. The GOP budget would initially give states the same allotment for Medicaid they get today, only in block grant form. The change would start in 2013. The amount would grow each year to account for inflation and population. However, Medicaid expenditures would not grow as much as they would under current law. In support of their claim, The DCCC referred us to a series of reports produced by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which aim to break down the district-by-district impact the GOP budget would have on Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats contend the GOP proposal, with its new flexibility for the states, would mean that states no longer have to abide by current federal requirements for the money’s use, thus jeopardizing nursing home care. The Medicaid report for Renacci's district says 3,000 constituents have nursing home care paid by Medicaid, a figure it got from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal spending for Medicaid under the House GOP plan would be 35 percent lower in 2022 and 49 percent lower in 2030 than it would be if the program was left alone. Its implementation would keep federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP - the Children’s Health Insurance Program - under 6 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product, rather than having it rise to around 12 or 14 percent, as would be expected under current scenarios. This would make Medicaid funding more predictable from a federal perspective, but it would lead to greater uncertainty for states as to whether the federal contribution would be sufficient during periods of economic weakness. Federal payments for Medicaid under the proposal would also be substantially smaller than currently projected amounts, the CBO says, although states might be able to achieve greater efficiencies with the flexibility provided by the changes. Both AHCA and AARP fear that converting Medicaid to a block grant program would have negative effects on nursing home patients. An issue brief from the nursing home group says block grants "threaten care for frail seniors and the disabled." Whether nursing home care would continue to be paid for by Medicaid would be up to individual states if the program is converted to a block grant, AARP state government relations director JoAnn Lamphere said in an interview. "If you recognize that the bulk of Medicaid spending goes to nursing homes, you would have to conclude that nursing homes would be severely impacted," Lamphere said. So where does that leave the DCCC’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter? It’s impossible to precisely know how much funding would be cut for nursing home care, since each state would make that decision. But given that the CBO predicts funding levels would be 35 percent lower under this plan than under the current system by 2022 and 49 percent lower by 2030, and that 64 percent of the nation’s nursing home care is paid for by Medicaid, it’s reasonable to expect some cuts in coverage. The claim says nursing home care would be put in immediate jeopardy, but the language in the proposal delays the changeover until 2013 -- well over a year away. The DCCC refers to the GOP budget plan as "Rep. Jim Renacci’s plan to end Medicare," but Renacci had no role in drafting the plan. It was authored by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Renacci merely voted for it on the House of Representatives floor. And PolitiFact has repeatedly rated Democratic claims that the GOP plan would "end Medicare" as False, concluding the major alterations it entails don’t actually end the program. There is an element of truth to the DCCC claim, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. The DCCC packs a lot of misinformation into a single sentence. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09931	"Obama has more czars than the Romanovs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/12/john-mccain/McCain-says-Obama-has-more-czars-than-Romanovs/	How many czars does it take to run the federal government? More and more, it seems. In a Twitter message on May 30, 2009, Sen. John McCain took this poke at the Obama administration: "Obama has more czars than the Romanovs — who ruled Russia for 3 centuries. Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20." First of all, yes, John McCain — the guy criticized during the presidential campaign for being computer illiterate — is tweeting. But what about the czars? It sure seems like we keep reading about one czar after another being appointed to oversee the auto industry, the Great Lakes, and the closure of Gitmo, and we wondered: Just how many czars does the Obama administration actually have? First off, the Obama administration doesn't usually call any of these people czars. We only found two instances of President Barack Obama using the term, once in an April 15, 2009, interview with CNN En Espanol when he talked about the role of his "border czar," and once during the campaign when he promised to appoint an "autism czar" to coordinate a nationwide autism effort (he hasn't yet). And in announcing Obama's nomination of Gil Kerlikowske as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Vice President Joe Biden referred to the position as "our nation's drug czar." We're sure there are more, but the point is that, by and large, you don't often hear the administration talking about its czars. In fact, the administration has at times gone to some lengths to avoid the moniker, as was the case in this somewhat humorous (in an inside-the-Beltway sorta way) exchange between a reporter and White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on June 10, 2009: Reporter: On Ken Feinberg, I think that he's maybe the 20th czar-type position you've named. Gibbs: No, I think the title is "special master." So who exactly qualifies as a czar? As best we can tell, it's whenever someone in the media says so. You can identify a guy as "Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Co-Chair of the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology," but it's a lot easier on everyone to just say "Science Czar." And "Special Master" sounds like Richie Rich's best friend. So the title of czar is largely arbitrary media shorthand for "It's this person's job to make sure (blank) goes right." And we think everyone can agree that "Terrorism Czar" sounds way cooler than "Deputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security." Below, we have compiled a wildly unscientific list of Obama administration "czars." But we're not the first. Talking Points Memo has a slideshow of Obama's "czars." They count 23 . And ForeignPolicy.com came up with at least 18. We've got 28. Some of these "czars" are carryover positions from previous administrations. And "czars" go way back in presidential history. Roosevelt had a slew of so-called czars. But to the extent that Obama has created a number of new positions to oversee various issues and to cut through bureaucratic red tape, he seems to have a lot more czars than his predecessors. Or you could argue that the media has just seized on a new buzzword it likes. We're not going to wade into the debate about whether having more czars is a good idea, but Fox ran a story about concerns some lawmakers have with it. We're just fact-checking McCain's claim that Obama has more czars than the Romanovs. According to the World Book Encyclopedia , there were, as McCain said, 18 Romanov czars, starting with Michael Romanov in 1613 and ending with Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. As for Obama's czars, we've got 28 who have been referred to as a czar ... somewhere. Undoubtedly some will take issue with some of the "czars" on our list, but we think McCain is on solid ground. He earns a True.

pomt-11964	Bryan County, Ga., has "corrupted voter rolls."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/oct/04/public-interest-legal-foundation/anti-vote-fraud-group-levels-false-charge-corrupte/	An Indianapolis-based advocacy group issued a news release Sept. 25 with a stunning headline: "24 states show corrupted voter rolls." "Voter fraud begins with corrupted voter rolls," said J. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation. "Our nation’s voter rolls have records that cannot be distinguished between living or dead; citizen or alien; resident or relocated. We hear about possible cyber-attacks, but we aren’t doing enough to fix voter rolls that are certainly corrupt." The Public Interest Legal Foundation, which aims to keep voter rolls as up-to-date as possible, had sent letters to nearly 250 counties. Bryan County was among them. The group’s letter to county elections supervisor Cindy Reynolds said, "Based on our research, your jurisdiction is in apparent violation of Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act." It explained that the letter was the required statutory notice "prior to the commencement of any lawsuit." The county’s key problem, according to the foundation, was that it had "significantly more voters on the registration roles than it has eligible, living citizen voters." In this fact-check, we looked at whether Bryan County’s voter rolls are corrupted, as the news release charged. The short answer is that the situation in Bryan County is cleaner than the foundation would have us believe. The fact is, maintaining the voter rolls in Georgia is an ongoing process and the foundation counted names on the Bryan County list that were flagged for possible removal. The active vs. inactive voter difference Foundation spokesman Logan Churchwell told us that his group relied on the latest federal survey from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. That spreadsheet showed 20,285 active voters and 5,622 inactive ones in Bryan County on the rolls for the November 2016 election. What are inactive voters? People who haven’t voted in the past two elections, have been sent a letter to confirm their registration and haven’t responded to that letter. The foundation added the two groups and reported a total of 25,907 voters. It then compared that to the number of county residents age 18 and older. Using the latest Census figures, that was 25,643. Not all of them would necessarily be eligible to vote, but "that gives the county the maximum benefit of the doubt," Churchwell said. With 264 more names on the rolls than the total of potentially eligible voters, the foundation included Bryan County on its list of those with corrupted voter rolls. Including the inactive voters is essential to that finding. The problem evaporates based on active voters. Judged against that, there are 5,358 fewer names on the rolls than the total potentially eligible population. Churchwell defended his group’s methods, saying "all a person on the inactive list needs to do is respond and like that, they are back on the rolls." The county can’t "pretend they aren’t there," he added. Keeping the rolls current The relationship between voter rolls and residents is constantly in flux. Many people move away and some die, to give the two biggest factors. The same survey used by the foundation gives a glimpse into how election officials try to keep up. Importantly for this fact-check, it also shows what the size of the inactive list can tell us about changes in the active voter rolls. The foundation counted all inactive voters, but there’s good reason to question that. In Georgia, the state maintains the voter rolls, not the counties. Between 2014 and 2016, the state sent 4,323 letters asking people in Bryan County to confirm their voting status. In the same period, the state removed 2,579 names. Put another way, take about 60 percent of the inactive total and you get the number of names that will be dropped. Apply that to the 2,622 on the November 2016 inactive list and you’d expect that 1,542 names would drop from the rolls. That alone would put the number of voters below the number of potentially eligible voters by about 1,200. In fact, Bryan County election supervisor Reynolds said the state cut 2,934 names from the rolls as of September 2017. The state was more aggressive than it had been over the past two years. "This is a regular process by the Secretary of State provided by Georgia laws to ensure that our rolls are as accurate as possible," Reynolds said in a statement. We wondered how often the group’s assertions led to successful lawsuits. Churchwell told us that in 2015, his group targeted 141 counties. Of those, they brought legal action against eight, resulting in one settlement and two consent decrees to improve roll maintenance practices. Our ruling The Public Interest Legal Foundation said Bryan County had corrupted voter rolls because it had more voters registered than the eligible population in the county. The foundation relied on the number of voters listed as inactive to reach that conclusion. That is a worst-case approach that does not account for the reality of voter roll maintenance in Georgia. Based on all the data, there’s no evidence that the Bryan County rolls are corrupted. The group took a number that reflected an effort to keep the voter rolls current and used it to cast the county in a bad light. The foundation used data selectively and ignored ongoing efforts to clean up the voter rolls to reach an exaggerated conclusion. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03912	Comic strip says government study shows Head Start "has little or no impact on the children it’s supposed to help."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/26/mallard-fillmore/mallard-fillmore-says-government-study-shows-head-/	The self-described "right-leaning duck" who appears on funny pages nationwide provoked PolitiFact Texas readers earlier this month. Several asked us to look into the "Mallard Fillmore" comic strip’s statements about Head Start, such as this from the Feb. 9, 2013, cartoon: "A government study has found that the vaunted ‘Head Start’ program actually has little or no impact on the children it’s supposed to help." All is not lost, though: The "Fillmore Foundation" found the program makes Head Start supporters "feel really really good about themselves," joked the strip. It includes a footnote citing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; other "Mallard" Head Start comics between Feb. 6 and Feb. 13 do the same or cite the conservative Heritage Foundation’s website. The federal Head Start program was launched by Congress in the mid-1960s to help preschool-age children from low-income families. With an annual budget of $8 billion, it offers such children educational activities, medical/dental care, meals and safe playtime. Government’s six-year study King Features Syndicate spokeswoman Claudia Smith told us by email that "Mallard" cartoonist Bruce Tinsley was speaking about a new report that Health and Human Services issued on its 2002-08 study of Head Start’s effects, which Congress mandated in 1998 when it continued the program. To determine how the program affected school readiness and when or how it was most effective, the department tracked 4,667 students in 23 states whose families applied to get them into Head Start. The children, all aged 3 or 4, were randomly assigned to a Head Start program or a control group. Data were gathered on measures of cognitive and social-emotional development, health and parenting practices. An earlier, Jan. 15, 2010, report covered results from fall 2002 through the end of the students’ first-grade years. The 3-year-olds could have logged as much as two years in Head Start, the 4-year-olds only one; children not initially assigned to Head Start might have participated in other preschool programs or reapplied. At the end of preschool, the Head Start 3-year-olds showed advantages, mainly in language and literacy categories such as naming letters and oral comprehension, over non-Head Start 3-year-olds. Fewer positive outcomes were recorded for the 4-year-olds, and both age groups’ advantages had faded by the end of first grade, according to the report. Results updated in late 2012 The department’s October 2012 report, released Dec. 21, 2012, updated study results through the end of third grade. And like the first-grade results, the 2012 report said that "there were initial positive impacts from having access to Head Start, but by the end of 3rd grade there were very few impacts found. ...The few impacts that were found did not show a clear pattern of favorable or unfavorable impacts for children." We tallied the results for children assigned to Head Start as compared to the control group: The 3-year-olds, who had the chance to stay in Head Start for two years: At the end of Head Start, they had 15 positive results out of 33 categories for which data was gathered (45 percent positive). By the end of third grade, they showed two positive results and one negative result out of 48 categories (4 percent positive, 2 percent negative). There was no significant change in most categories. The 4-year-olds, who would only have been able to attend Head Start for one year: At the end of Head Start, they showed nine positive results out of 33 categories (27 percent positive). By the end of third grade, they showed three positive and four negative results out of 48 categories (6 percent positive, 8 percent negative). Most measures showed no statistically significant change. To sum that up: The Head Start age groups were doing 45 percent (the 3-year-olds) or 27 percent (the 4-year-olds) better than their peers at the end of Head Start. By the end of third grade, though, the results were only a few percentage points apart and the Head Start children had fallen behind in several categories. Among the negative results at the end of third grade, the 3-year-olds showed a drop in "school promotion" (advancing to the next grade) and the 4-year-olds showed increased "emotional symptoms" and declines in relationships with teachers and peers. Evaluating the research We checked to see if the study was considered solid and how it fit into other research on the topic. Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child interpreted the 2010 findings in an undated "brief" that said in part, "Overall, the study was sound scientifically, but there has been considerable debate over what its findings mean." The fact that Head Start advantages disappeared by the end of first grade, it said, apparently meant that "the comparison children were able to catch up to their peers in the Head Start treatment group during the first two years of school." Two experts took issue with one aspect of the study’s results: Even if children exited or entered Head Start after the study began, they were still counted as part of the group to which they were first assigned. The 2012 report said 15 percent to 20 percent of the children assigned to the Head Start group exited the program, while 14 percent to 17 percent of children who started in the control group were later admitted to Head Start. Retired early-education researcher John Love, who directed a 1995-2002 study on Early Head Start (the federal program for low-income children up to age 3), told us by email, "This isn't so much a criticism of the researchers ... but a fact that those who want to make sense of the findings should be aware of." The report included estimates that were adjusted to account for this issue, he said. According to the report, that adjustment made "no change in the statistical significance of the estimates" or "the overall patterns found in the main analysis." Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, raised the same concern. By email, he told us that in his view, it means "the results of the study are somewhat misinterpreted" and the effects of Head Start are underestimated. Did ‘Mallard’ get it right? Overall, Love said, the comic strip’s description of the study was close but oversimplified. "That is a fair summary of what they found, as far as it goes," he said, but it’s an inadequate description because there were some significant results within subgroups; for example, black 4-year-olds showed more improvement than their peers, with effects lasting until the end of third grade. Such findings, Love said, could help determine "what works for whom under what conditions." Barnett said other research has yielded varied results. "Some find that other studies are persuasive that Head Start has larger impacts, and there certainly are other studies that find these," he said. "On the other side are people who would be closer to the duck." He emailed us his review of major U.S. and other studies on early educational intervention for children in poverty that appeared in the Aug. 19, 2011, issue of the international journal Science. There, Barnett considered decades of research showing that the Head Start study and three others all showed declining benefits to children as they got older. In the Head Start study and Love’s Early Head Start study, Barnett wrote, effects "start small and disappear shortly after school entry." Two smaller and older studies showed effects that were "relatively large and long-lasting," the review said: a mid-1960s look at Perry Preschool in Michigan and a late-’70s/early ‘80s examination of a North Carolina preschool program. Barnett told us, however, that the longer-lasting benefits indicated by the older studies might reflect the fact that fewer children then had access to quality preschool or health insurance. Our ruling "Mallard Fillmore" said a government study shows Head Start "has little or no impact on the children it’s supposed to help." That could be an accurate description of the longer-term results -- relatively few positive outcomes and some negative ones -- measured at the end of first and third grades. Still, the Head Start children had significant advantages over their peers when they exited preschool and started kindergarten. We rate the duck’s proclamation as Mostly True.

pomt-06842	"The government's twice the size it was 10 years ago. It's 30 percent bigger than it was when (Barack) Obama became president."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/05/tom-coburn/sen-tom-coburn-says-government-twice-size-it-was-d/	EDITOR’S NOTE: Upon further consideration, we have changed the rating on this item from Mostly True to Half True. The new analysis is below. Our previous posting is archived here. On the July 24, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to give some perspective on the size of federal spending -- a central factor in the current debate over raising the debt ceiling. Addressing host David Gregory, Coburn said, "David, everybody's talking about the symptoms of our problem instead of the real disease. The government's twice the size it was 10 years ago. It's 30 percent bigger than it was when (Barack) Obama became president. The problem is that we're spending way too much money, and it's not hard to cut it without hurting entitlement benefits. But we don't have anybody that wants to do that without getting a tax increase." We wondered whether Coburn was right that the size of government has doubled over the past 10 years. We began by looking at the size of outlays by the federal government, even though Coburn didn’t specify which level of government he was talking about. (Coburn communications director John Hart later confirmed that he had meant to refer to just the federal government.) We also decided to use outlays as our yardstick -- rather than, say, government employees or regulatory burden, as some readers later suggested -- since Coburn went on to say, "we're spending way too much money, and it's not hard to cut it without hurting entitlement benefits." Here are annual figures from the Office of Management and Budget for total federal outlays: Fiscal year 2001: $1.86 trillion Fiscal year 2002: $2.01 trillion Fiscal year 2003: $2.16 trillion Fiscal year 2004: $2.29 trillion Fiscal year 2005: $2.47 trillion Fiscal year 2006: $2.66 trillion Fiscal year 2007: $2.73 trillion Fiscal year 2008: $2.98 trillion Fiscal year 2009: $3.52 trillion Fiscal year 2010: $3.46 trillion Fiscal year 2011 (estimate): $3.82 trillion So, doubling the 2001 outlays over 10 years would have meant a 2011 figure of $3.72 trillion. Since the actual figure is higher than that, Coburn is right that the cost of government has doubled over the past decade. In our initial analysis, we stopped there and did not adjust these figures for inflation. After readers pointed this out to us, we ran the inflation-adjustment calculations and determined that the fiscal 2011 federal outlay of $3.82 trillion was equivalent to $3 trillion in 2001 dollars. That produced an increase in federal outlays of 60 percent over 10 years. That’s still a significant increase, but short of double. We also calculated that government outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product, rose from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.3 percent in 2011 -- an increase of 39 percent, which is also not double. Despite our initial focus on non-inflation-adjusted numbers, we have since decided that our readers had a point, and that Coburn would have been better off using inflation-adjusted numbers. So we have decided to change our ruling. Meanwhile, we also looked at Coburn’s second claim, that government expenditures are 30 percent bigger than they were when Obama became president. For this one, it depends when you start the clock. We’ll start with non-inflation-adjusted numbers. If you use fiscal 2008 as the baseline -- which we confirmed with Coburn’s staff was his intention -- then the comparison is just about right. Federal outlays increased by 28 percent between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2011, which is just below the 30 percent Coburn cited. However, fiscal 2008 ran from Oct. 1, 2007, to Sept. 30, 2008, ending almost four months before Obama took office. The OMB only offers figures by fiscal year, so we can’t pinpoint a number that’s pegged precisely to when Obama took office. If instead you use as a baseline fiscal 2009 -- which started on Oct. 1, 2008 -- then federal outlays increased by about 9 percent, or well below what Coburn said. The inflation-adjusted numbers are a 22 percent increase if you start with 2008, and 3 percent if you start with 2009. Clearly, the shift of the calculation by just one year makes a big difference in the result. We also considered whether Coburn intended to blame Obama for this spending increase. This was a tough call. Re-reading his claim, we don’t feel that his use of the inauguration of a new president as the cutoff point necessarily invokes blame. The entirety of Coburn’s comment encompasses government growth over a 10-year period, most of which was clearly under a Republican president, George W. Bush, and not Obama. And the inauguration of a new president is a pretty natural dividing line for making mathematical comparisons. "No one has a more consistent record of being a nonpartisan critic of spending than Coburn," said Coburn’s communications director Hart. "He has been criticizing Republican and Democratic spending for many years." We agreed with this assessment, so we gave Coburn the benefit of the doubt on whether he intended to place the blame for government growth on Obama. And we stand by that decision. So what's the bottom line? We don’t think that Coburn was entirely wrong to use non-inflation-adjusted dollars, but it would have been better if he -- and we -- had adjusted for inflation. Doing it this way still means there was a significant increase in government over the period he studied, but not as high as he had indicated. On balance, we have decided to lower our ruling from Mostly True to Half True.	None	Tom Coburn	None	None	None	2011-08-05T15:52:21	2011-07-24	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-01726	"The leader of ISIS was imprisoned by American troops and ordered released to Iraq by Obama administration in 2009."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/06/james-woods/actor-james-woods-obama-ordered-release-islamic-st/	When James Woods isn't busy acting and doing voiceovers for video games and Family Guy episodes, he tweets from the right-end of the political spectrum. One of his latest messages revives the inaccurate claim that President Barack Obama let the head of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) slip through our fingers in 2009. ISIS, which has simplified its name to Islamic State, is the well-armed Sunni force that has claimed broad swaths of land in Iraq. Recently, it defeated seasoned, if ill-equipped, Kurdish forces in battles for two key towns. On Aug. 5, Woods, no fan of Obama, tweeted to his 145,000 followers, "The leader of ISIS was imprisoned by American troops and ordered released to Iraq by Obama administration in 2009." Woods followed that up with, "Clearly Obama did not hand select the leader of ISIS for release to the Iraqis in 2009. Obama's weak kneed foreign policy is the issue." We looked at an almost identical claim about the head of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in June. Baghdadi was held by U.S. forces at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca, but not when Woods said. According to the Defense Department, Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009. "Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as 'Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi' was held as a 'civilian internee' by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released," the Pentagon told us in a statement. "He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended 'unconditional release' of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time." In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads Islamic State was set free in 2004, long before Obama took office, and he was not recaptured. How did the 2009 version get started? In mid June, there were several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others -- that placed Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracked back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didn’t expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement. "I'm not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I'm a little surprised it was him," King said. "He was a bad dude, but he wasn't the worst of the worst." In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed. ABC News questioned King’s recollection, citing a "a U.S. official" that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009. "I could be mistaken," King told ABC News, "but I’m 99 percent. He’s a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with … His face is very familiar." King declined to comment to PunditFact. For the record, even if King's memory is better than the Defense Department's paper trail, Obama didn’t order Baghdadi released as much as enforce an agreement brokered by President George W. Bush. Before Bush left office, his administration signed a contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee. Our ruling Woods said Obama ordered the release of the leader of ISIS, now called Islamic State, in 2009. The Defense Department says the release took place in 2004 and Obama had nothing to do with it. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08710	"I asked (then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice) how many people had died and she did not know the answer to that question."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/03/barbara-boxer/sen-barbara-boxer-says-condoleezza-rice-didnt-know/	During a meeting with the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial board on Aug. 31, 2010, Sen. Barbara Boxer was asked about a controversial comment she made in 2007 to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about Rice not paying a "personal price" in the Iraq War because she did not have any immediate family members serving in the military. Rice and a number of political pundits later claimed Boxer's comment was an unfair jab because Rice didn't have children. In the editorial board meeting, Boxer, a California Democrat, sought to set the record straight about her comments, but then added a bit of revisionist history, saying she was criticizing Rice because she didn't know how many American troops had died in Iraq. In fact, Rice never said that. Let's back up to 2007. During the Jan. 11, 2007, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Boxer tried to make a point with Rice about the sacrifice families were making in the Iraq War. "The issue is, 'Who pays the price?' I'm not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old. My grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay the price, as I understand it, with immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families," Boxer said. A day later, Rice told the New York Times that she believed Boxer was implying she was less sensitive about the impact of war because Rice didn't have kids. ''I thought it was O.K. to be single. I thought it was O.K. to not have children, and I thought you could still make good decisions on behalf of the country if you were single and didn't have children.'' Fast-forward three years to the editorial board meeting and Boxer said her words were twisted. "I asked her how many people had died and she did not know the answer to that question. And since we had lost a lot of Californians, I was concerned. And I said, you and I don't have, we haven't paid a person price. I said, you and I, I said, myself, my grand kids are too young, my husband too old, and as far as I know you don't have anybody in the war. So I tried to use it to bring us together, but the right-wing press said that I questioned, that I turned on her because she wasn't married which was a little silly." So you weren't criticizing? Boxer was asked. "I was criticizing the fact that she didn't know how many people died in Iraq. Absolutely I was," Boxer said. But in a blog posting after the editorial board meeting, the Chronicle's Debra J. Saunders called Boxer out, pointing out that in the 2007 hearing, Boxer never actually asked Rice how many Americans had died in the war in Iraq. "I can see why Boxer would want to believe that she put her foot in her mouth -- and somehow it was Rice's fault, but the tale turns out to be a figment of Barbara Boxer's self-aggrandizing imagination," Saunders wrote. We reviewed the video ourselves, and Saunders is correct -- Boxer actually hadn't asked Rice any questions prior to her "personal price" comments. Nor did such a question arise at any point in the exchange between the two. In other words, Rice wasn't ignorant of the number of troop casualties; she was never asked. Indeed, it wasn't until after her "personal price" comments, when Boxer asked Rice about casualties, but it was for an estimate of future deaths from the surge in troops: Boxer: "Do you have have an estimate of the number of casualties we expect from this surge?" Rice: "No Senator, I don't think there's any way to give you such an estimate." Boxer: "Has the president, because he said, 'Expect more sacrifice.' He must know." Rice: "Senator, I don't think any of us have a number of expected casualties. I think that people understand that there is going to be violence for some time in Iraq and that there will be more casualties." And then Rice responded to Boxer's "personal price" comments. "And let me just say, I fully understand the sacrifice that the American people are making," Rice said. "And especially the sacrifice that our soldiers are making, men and women in uniform. I visit them. I know what they're going through. I talk to their families. I see it. I could never, and I can never, do anything to replace any of those lost men and women in uniform, or the diplomats…" Said Boxer: "Madam Secretary, please, I know you feel terrible about it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions, and the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we are going to pay militarily. We certainly know the numbers, billions of dollars that we can't spend here in this country. I find really appalling that not even enough time was taken to figure out what the casualties would be." "Senator, I think it would be highly unlikely for the military to tell the president we expect 'X' number of casualties because of this augmentation of the forces," Rice said. So there you have it. Boxer asked Rice for a projection on how many American troop casualties might be lost in the surge, and Rice essentially answered that that was unknowable. In the editorial board meeting, Boxer made a strong argument for her initial point that she was not criticizing Rice for being single and childless. As Boxer noted, and the record confirmed, Boxer began by noting that she, herself, did not have any immediate family serving in Iraq; and she then made the point that neither did Rice. But in defending herself on that issue, Boxer completely distorted what Rice said. She claimed Rice did not know how many American soldiers "had died" -- past tense. In fact, Rice said she could not project expected casualties from the surge. Boxer makes it sound like Rice either didn't know or didn't care about the number of soldiers who had died and that Boxer was nobly calling her out. In fact, she was asking Rice to speculate about casualties in the future. We find the senator's revisionist account to be far from the truth and disparaging of Rice. Pants on Fire!

pomt-13395	"You will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the Federal Elections" to see the financial disclosure form than by looking at tax returns.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-talks-about-his-finances-first-presid/	Pressed on his refusal to follow decades of precedent and release his tax returns, Donald Trump at the first presidential debate repeated his assertion that the 92-page financial disclosure form he filed to the Federal Election Commission provides a better picture of his finances than the tax returns would. "You will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the Federal Elections" to see the financial disclosure form than by looking at his returns, Trump said. (Trump has cited an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason he isn’t releasing the returns. Hillary Clinton has released her tax returns from 2000 to 2015.) Trump has a point that his financial disclosure form is extensive. Its 92 pages are crammed with small print detailing assets, income sources and positions held. (We were able to track his investments in the stock market, for instance.) By comparison, Mitt Romney -- the 2012 Republican nominee who was a businessman with a complex set of holdings -- filed a 47-page disclosure form, not counting amendments and updates. We have previously looked at the difference between the financial disclosure form, which is required of presidential candidates under federal law, and tax returns, which have been released since 1980 by tradition rather than legal requirement. We found little evidence to support Trump’s argument that the financial disclosure allows observers to "learn more" than they would from a tax form. "It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation," Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told us earlier this month. The two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump’s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and details about his charitable giving. Depending on what figures appear on his tax forms, Trump could face political criticism. Paying a low tax rate could be politically embarrassing. And Trump has faced questions about his past charitable giving. (For details, see the ongoing coverage by reporter David Farenthold of the Washington Post.) Tax returns also can give a clearer picture of the candidate’s liquid assets. "Trump can inflate his image of being rich on the financial disclosure forms, but you can get a better sense of how much he’s actually making from his tax returns," said former Romney aide Ryan Williams, who did not support Trump during the GOP primary and now says he’s officially undecided on the presidential race. Other nuggets can be gleaned from tax forms as well, such as what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid. "Romney’s tax return showed us a ton of valuable information about Romney, including the fact that most of his substantial income was ‘carried interest,’ " which is a type of tax-favored income available primarily to fund managers, said Allan Sloan, a business columnist for the Washington Post. Because of this, "we saw that the majority of his income was taxed at low rates." Trump wouldn’t necessarily qualify for the carried-interest tax, but as a someone in the real-estate business, he would have access to specialized tax breaks of his own, Sloan said. There is a "provision in tax law that allows people who spend at least half their working time as real-estate or development professionals to get depreciation deductions not available to other investors," he said. "That’s a huge loophole, and it’s gotten nothing like the attention that carried interest has gotten." The fact that Trump has not run for office before or served in government makes the scrutiny of his business dealings especially important for those who care about transparency. Yet the fact that he runs a privately held company makes it hard for outsiders to get a handle on his personal finances as long as no public tax filing is available, experts said. "Because Trump’s business dealings are varied and extensive, there is a lot to look at, but the quality of information is often poor, so reporters spend a lot of time looking at information insufficient to draw accurate conclusions," said Dennis Caplan, an associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. Our ruling Trump said, "You will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the Federal Elections" to see the financial disclosure form than by looking at his returns. An observer would find valuable information about Trump’s personal financial holdings from his extensive (and legally required) financial-disclosure form. However, experts consider that a red herring. Unlike all presidential nominees since 1980, Trump has not released his tax returns, which experts say would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his income-producing assets. Trump’s statement was, and is, inaccurate.

pomt-11951	"The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/06/national-rifle-association/nra-claim-obama-approved-bump-stocks/	In a rare move, the National Rifle Association issued a statement calling for regulation of the device that turned the Las Vegas shooter’s rifles more deadly, blaming Barack Obama’s administration for its approval. "Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law," the NRA wrote in a statement. "The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations." A bump or fire stock is a device that allows rifles to fire bullets as quickly as a machine gun. At least 12 of the Las Vegas shooter’s guns were outfitted with them. But did Obama approve their legality? Sort of, but approved is probably the wrong word. NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter pointed us to a June 2010 approval letter from ATF, an agency under executive purview, sent to Slide Fire, a bump stock manufacturer. Spelling out the legal definition of a firearm, ATF’s technology chief John Spencer determined it was not regulated by law. "The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed," Spencer wrote. "Accordingly, we find that the ‘bump-stock’ is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act." Bump stocks harness a weapon’s recoil to cause the user’s finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don’t alter the gun’s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful. We found a similar 2012 letter addressed to Bump Fire, a competing manufacturer. But just as these bump stocks didn’t qualify for regulation, two similar devices did. The difference? The Akins Accelerator and the Autoglove were determined in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to have mechanical parts that enhanced the trigger mechanism, making them by definition machineguns. "Electrically-driven trigger devices are considered ‘machineguns’ because they are a ‘combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,’ " ATF’s letter to AutoGlove read. Automatic weapons sales have been restricted since the 1934 National Firearms Act, and 1986 regulations made it much harder for civilians to get an automatic weapon like a machine gun. Obama administration’s role Experts in firearm policy were divided when we asked about the fairness of the NRA’s characterization. Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in guns, said it was appropriate to characterize the move as an approval of its sale under the Obama administration. "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it," Winkler said. Other legal experts stressed that it wasn’t an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn’t allow for its regulation. "The statement implies Obama or (U.S. Attorney General Eric) Holder was somehow involved, and that it was an issue that wouldn’t have been approved in any other administration, and that’s technically incorrect," said Rick Vasquez, a former Firearms Technology Branch official who first signed off on the recommendation the ATF could not regulate the Slide Fire. "We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve (the Slide Fire)," Vasquez said. Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns. "I believe (the NRA) were stating that just to point out that this wasn’t some rogue decision made during a Republican administration, which would be more friendly to gun owners, and therefore that when they re-evaluate it, they’re going to have to take a really close look at the law," said John Pierce, a lawyer and advocate for gun rights. In order to re-evaluate the bump stock, Vasquez said the ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that would allow the device to be regulated. Our ruling The NRA said, "The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions." We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.

pomt-11749	The Jerusalem Embassy Act "passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-about-history-jerusalem-embas/	President Donald Trump on Dec. 6 unveiled a new policy regarding Israel’s capital city, stating that "it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel." In his remarks, Trump said he would be designating Jerusalem as the officially recognized capital of Israel and "directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy" from its current location in Tel Aviv. In his remarks, Trump noted that the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 had "passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago." The 1995 law Trump cited mandated that the embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999. However, Palestinians also consider Jerusalem to be their capital, and the city has long been considered one of the stickiest points of contention for final-status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Most other nations that have diplomatic relations with Israel have continued to locate their embassies in Tel Aviv. For these reasons, past U.S. presidents from both parties have regularly signed waivers to suspend the move, amid fears it would destabilize peace talks. So is Trump correct in describing the legislative history of the law? We took a closer look. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec. 6, 2017. (Olivier Douliery/Abaca Press/TNS) The Jerusalem Embassy Act "passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority" For this portion of his statement, Trump is on solid ground. In the Senate, the bill passed on Oct. 24, 1995, by a 93-5 margin. Later that day, the House followed suit, passing it by a 374-37 margin. The law was "reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago." This part requires more explanation. The non-binding resolution from earlier this year involved "commemorating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem" during the Six Day War in 1967. One of its provisions specifically referenced the 1995 law. A portion of the 2017 resolution "reaffirms the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 104–45) as United States law, and calls upon the President and all United States officials to abide by its provisions." On June 5, 2017, the measure passed the Senate by a 90-0 margin. Here’s the caveat: The same resolution that passed the Senate 90-0 also included this provision: The Senate "reaffirms that it is the longstanding, bipartisan policy of the United States government that the permanent status of Jerusalem remains a matter to be decided between the parties through final status negotiations towards a two-state solution." Did Trump do or say anything contrary to that provision? There’s some disagreement on that. Trump in his remarks offered some language reaffirming the substance of this provision. Specifically, he said, "In making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear: This decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. We are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved." To Michael Koplow, policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, this "made clear that his decision doesn’t prejudice final status issues, so it seems to still be consistent with the Senate resolution." Others, however, contend that an embassy move may imperil future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over Jerusalem. "Not only is this a reasonable caveat, it is a critical one," said Samer S. Shehata, a professor and acting director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Oklahoma. "If you've been following the British, French and many of the other reactions to President Trump's move, almost all note this critical point." In their public remarks, both French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May made a point of reaffirming the need for future final-status negotiations about Jerusalem, which suggests that they are worried about the impact of Trump’s move in that context. Macron, in a phone call to Trump before the announcement, "expressed his concern with the possibility that the United States might unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as capital of the state of Israel," the French government said. "Mr. Macron reaffirmed that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved through peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, and particularly those relating to the establishment of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with Jerusalem as their capital." May said that she’s "intending to speak to President Trump about this matter. The status of Jerusalem should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Jerusalem should ultimately form a shared capital between the Israeli and Palestinian states." Our ruling Trump said that the Jerusalem Embassy Act "passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago." He’s right about both pieces of legislation and the margins by which they passed. However, it’s worth noting that the 2017 Senate resolution also reaffirmed that "the permanent status of Jerusalem remains a matter to be decided between the parties through final status negotiations towards a two-state solution" -- a position that Trump rhetorically backed in his speech, but that some believe could be endangered by his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the embassy.

pomt-11194	"Religion in America isn’t receding. It’s just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life across America every day."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/16/mike-pence/mike-pence-right-religion-gaining-new-life-us/	Speaking at a commencement ceremony at Hillsdale College in Michigan, Vice President Mike Pence told the graduates that religion in the United States is going strong. "The percentage of Americans who live out their religion on a weekly basis — praying, going to church, reading and believing in the Bible — has remained remarkably consistent over the decades, even as the population of the United States has grown by leaps and bounds," Pence said during his May 12 speech. "I mean, think about it, today, relative to the population, four times as many Americans go to church on a regular basis than at the time of our nation’s founding. Religion in America isn’t receding. It’s just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life across America every day." We wondered whether Pence is right that "religion in America isn’t receding. It’s just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life across America every day." Based on data and scholarly opinion, Pence overlooked some notable nuances in the long-running data on religion in the United States. "Since 1990, weakly religious people have increasingly chosen between a stronger religious identity or none at all," said Michael Hout, a New York University sociologist. "The middle spot of being blandly religious and occasionally attending became harder and harder to maintain." Coffee vs. espresso Religious practice on the more intense end of the spectrum has held its own in recent years, according to data. However, Pence ignored that the share of Americans without a religious affiliation has risen, and the share of Americans with lower levels of described religiousness has steadily declined. Landon Schnabel of Indiana University, who co-authored a 2017 study on religious data with Sean Bock of Harvard University, said that "Pence's statement isn't totally wrong, but it is a misinterpretation." Schnabel’s issue is that Pence focused only on one trend line, rather than the entire landscape. The metaphor Schnabel uses to describe the changing shape of religion is "espresso versus coffee. There's less of it, and it's stronger. And if some people didn't like how coffee tastes, they're really not going to like espresso." See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com What the numbers say To illustrate some of the longer-term trends, we examined data from the General Social Survey, produced by the University of Chicago. In this first chart, we see the breakdown of Americans by whether they identify as Protestant, Catholic, another religion, or no religion. The most striking increase is in those who do not have a religious affiliation. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The portion of the population without a religious affiliation has quadrupled over a 40-year span from 5 percent to more than 20 percent. Additional data illustrates another question: the strength of religious affiliation. This chart looks at that data over the period: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The percentage of respondents saying they had a "strong" religious affiliation has been more or less constant for 40 years, bouncing between 35 percent and 40 percent of the population. This slice of the data supports Pence’s view. But other portions of the data run counter to Pence’s stated trend. Notably, the segment of the population that reported either a "somewhat strong" or "not very strong" religious affiliation has declined. This group peaked at about 55 percent in the late 1970s but has since fallen to a little more than 40 percent. (This category doesn’t include those with no religious affiliation.) Finally, we looked at another measure of religious strength — the frequency of attendance at religious services. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com This data mirrors that for strength of religious affiliation. The percentage attending services between zero and two times a year has risen from 29 percent to 46 percent since the early 1970s, while the percentage attending services on a roughly weekly basis fell from 35 percent to 22 percent. Those attending more than weekly — the most intense group — has remained notably stable. What other research shows We also looked at findings from the Pew Research Center, which conducted comprehensive Religious Landscape Surveys in 2007 and 2014. Pence could find support there, too — as well as findings that undermine his position. "Among the roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults who claim a religion, there was no discernible drop in most measures of religious commitment" between 2007 and 2014, said Gregory A. Smith, Pew’s associate director for research. "Indeed, by some conventional measures, religiously affiliated Americans were, on average, even more devout than they were a few years prior." By contrast, Pew found "small but statistically significant declines in the share of Americans who say they believe in God (from 92 percent to 89 percent), in the share of Americans who say they pray every day (from 58 percent to 55 percent), in the share who say religion is very important in their lives (from 56 percent to 53 percent), and in the share who say they attend religious services at least monthly (from 54 percent to 50 percent)." One reason for the shift may be generational. "Older generations of American adults who were overwhelmingly Christian by affiliation and comparatively devout in belief and behavior are gradually passing away," according to the Pew report. That said, Pew’s data shows indications that Americans are becoming more spiritual outside of the context of organized religion. "About six in 10 adults now say they regularly feel a deep sense of ‘spiritual peace and well-being,’ up seven percentage points since 2007," the study found. How accurate was Pence? Pence’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but his office told the Washington Post Fact Checker that they had relied on the Schnabel-Bock study, as well as an article that addressed the Schnabel-Bock study in the Federalist, a conservative publication. That article, headlined, "New Harvard Research Says U.S. Christianity Is Not Shrinking, But Growing Stronger," was written by Glenn T. Stanton, the director of family formation studies at Focus on the Family. When we reached out to Stanton, he said he was unaware that Pence had picked up on his article, or that it had inspired fact-checking. Stanton acknowledged that "the mainline denominations are hemorrhaging members. This goes a long way in the fact that some forms of faith are indeed shrinking in America. Those denominations that are compromising on tradition and orthodoxy are shrinking at alarming rates. No question. As Schnabel and Bock explain, it is the very serious and rigorous portions of Christianity that are holding solid." Overall, Stanton said he felt Pence was giving a reasonable, boiled-down version of the Schnabel-Bock research. Our ruling Pence said, "Religion in America isn’t receding. It’s just the opposite. Faith is gaining new life across America every day." The data on religion in the United States has been fairly consistent over the past four decades. The share of the population that is more strongly religious is holding steady, providing Pence some support. However, the share who consider themselves only modestly religious is in a long-term decline, and the share without any religious affiliation is growing. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-14964	"We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-us-loses-90-people-day-guns/	Rallying supporters in San Antonio, Hillary Clinton said Oct. 15, 2015, that she’s running for president in part "to protect our families and communities from the plague of gun violence." Clinton, who was introduced and endorsed by Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, went on: "Look, you know, we lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns." Is that so? Earlier in the week, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state aired the same per-day count at the Democratic presidential debate hosted by CNN. On her campaign website, Clinton says she favors more pre-purchase background checks, "cracking down on illegal gun traffickers, holding dealers and manufacturers accountable when they endanger Americans, and keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and stalkers." A subsequent check of Clinton’s 90 gun deaths by FactCheck.org, based at the University of Pennsylvania, found that while Clinton’s figure held up for 2013, the last year of available data, it is worth noting that only one-third of firearm deaths consisted of homicides; most other gun deaths counted as suicides. At least once, Clinton has clarified her figure by mentioning suicides; according to an Oct. 7, 2015, post on her campaign website, she said in Muscatine, Iowa: "We lose between 88 and 92 Americans a day from gun violence — homicides, suicides and accidents — and we have to act." Let’s go to the numbers. Federal statistics According to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 33,636 U.S. firearm deaths were recorded in 2013 — or 92 a day, on average. Some 63 percent of that year’s firearm deaths, or 21,175, were suicides, with 11,208 considered homicides and the rest classified as unintentional discharges (505), legal intervention/war (467) and undetermined (281). We confirmed those figures and checked the numbers for the four previous years (2009-12), finding a five-year average of 89 firearm deaths a day. In that period, the low was 86 firearm deaths a day in 2009 while the 2012 and 2013 averages tied at 92. For each year too, suicides by firearm accounted for far more deaths than homicides by firearm. Government statistician Next, we reached out to the CDC. By email, statistician Ken Kochanek said the 2013 figures remain the latest available. To our request, Kochanek drew on the agency’s statistics to create a document showing that the rate of U.S. deaths by firearm in 2013, roughly 10.6 per 100,000 residents, exceeded the rate of 10.4 per 100,0000 residents for 1999 through 2013. The 15-year high was set in 2012 — 10.7 per 100,000 residents. The 15-year low was set in 2004 — 10.1 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents. Asked to focus on homicides by firearm, Kochanek emailed a document indicating the 2013 rate of 3.5 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents was less than the 3.9 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents over the 15-year period. Over those years, the highest rate, of 4.3 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents, was set in 2006 and the lowest rate, 3.6 homicides by firearm per 100,000 residents was set in two years, 2010 and 2011. Our ruling Clinton said: "We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns." That’s about right. But it leaves unsaid that the bulk of those deaths are suicides, not homicides. Also, in 2013, the latest year of available data, the rate of homicides by firearm was lower than the rate for 1999 through 2013. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-07427	"Foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/25/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-unionization-rates-are-high/	The stated mission of the U.S. Commerce Department is to help make American businesses more innovative at home and more competitive abroad. That mission made manufacturing and exports two of the top concerns of Sen. Sherrod Brown when his Senate Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing on the department's proposed budget for fiscal 2012. The Ohio Democrat called for a national manufacturing strategy, which is the goal of a bipartisan bill he introduced this month with Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican. But Brown also asked Commerce Secretary Gary Locke what the department is doing to attract foreign investment to the United States. Foreign companies "tend to invest in manufacturing" and to spend money on research and development, Brown said. "Foreign companies in the United States have a significantly higher unionization rate than other companies overall," he added. That caught PolitiFact Ohio by surprise. We knew that union membership has declined significantly since the 1980s, but we also knew that the United Auto Workers has struggled to organize workers at foreign-owned factories, mainly in the South. None of the factories operated by foreign automakers in the region has union workers. Brown said he understood the surprise, given our auto-centric perspective, but assured us he could back up his statement. He went a step further and provided specific numbers in a statement from his office: 12.4 percent of workers at foreign-owned U.S. subsidiaries are union employees while fewer than 7 percent of private-sector workers in the U.S. are union employees. In support, Brown's staff referred us to the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based business association representing U.S. operations of global companies. Its statistics, we confirmed, are drawn from publicly available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Their figures showed: U.S. subsidiaries of global companies employ 5.6 million Americans (including 231,600 in Ohio, the nation's seventh-highest total). Collective bargaining agreements cover 12.4 percent of those U.S. workers. The union membership rate of all U.S. workers in 2010 was 11.9 percent, down from 12.3 percent a year earlier. (In 1983, the first year for which comparable figures are available, the union membership rate was 20.1 percent.) The union membership rate for public sector workers (36.2 percent) was "substantially higher" than the rate for private sector workers, which was 6.9 percent. In sum, U.S. employees of foreign-owned companies have a higher rate of union membership than the U.S. workforce as a whole, and a much higher rate than workers in the private sector. Brown's statement rates as True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2011-04-25T06:00:00	2011-04-14	['United_States']

pomt-13097	Republican gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens "spent another $600,000 on image consultants" to rebrand his charity, The Mission Continues.	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/06/chris-koster/chris-koster-skews-meaning-image-consultants-hired/	In a recent ad, Missouri Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster criticized how Eric Greitens’ charity, The Mission Continues, has been spending money. "Eric Greitens used money from his veterans charity to pay himself over $700,000 in salary and bonuses," said the ad, as part of a broad attack on how Greitens’ nonprofit, intended to help veterans re-enter civilian life, has been run. In the ad, a voice says, "He spent another $600,000 on image consultants," while viewers see a makeup artist applying makeup to Greitens’ face. We wanted to know if this claim about The Mission Continues spending money on image consultants checked out, so we decided to look into it. The Mission Continues Greitens’ nonprofit benefits recently discharged veterans by giving them volunteer opportunities in their own communities where they can learn new skills by "improving community education resources, eliminating food deserts, mentoring at-risk youth and more." The Mission Continues has operations in over 20 states and Washington D.C. called "service platoons" that collaborate with local groups to plan service activities to benefit specific communities. The organization is a Better Business Bureau accredited 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Rebranding In 2013, the organization decided to rebrand in an attempt to expand its operations. The Mission Continues hired St. Louis-based public relations firm FleishmanHillard Inc. as an independent contractor. FleishmanHillard is one of the most respected PR firms in the country, with big-name clients like Chevrolet, EA Sports, Olay and Procter & Gamble. The Mission Continues paid FleishmanHillard $619,599 for its services in 2014 and 2015, according to public filings required by the charity. This $619,599 made up approximately 5.2 percent of the organization’s total expenses for each fiscal year. News of the rebranding effort ran as a story in PR Week, an international trade publication for the public relations field. What they paid for Greitens’ charity launched its new image to the public "at a food bank event that brought veterans together with President (Barack) Obama, as they served meals to dozens of underprivileged families," according to the PR Week article. The crown jewel of the nonprofit’s new image was a new logo. It features a shield-shaped patch with a two-sided bird: an eagle to represent patriotism, and a dove to illustrate a commitment to service, as explained by a video on the group’s website. The logo won a Silver Anvil Award of Excellence from the Public Relations Society of America, a top trade organization for the industry. The campaign also introduced a new website and introduced the branding into designs for community service projects. Clearly, FleishmanHillard’s campaign was designed to rebrand The Mission Continues as a charity, not Greitens himself. This rebranding was covered by several major news outlets, including ABCNews.com and Bloomberg News. Charities have to market themselves so the people they want to help know about their services, said Daniel Borochoff, president and founder of Charity Watch. "It’s a legitimate expense," Borochoff said. "They can’t do it in the dark." A representative from the Greitens campaign said the ad was a blatant misrepresentation of the reality of the expense. Our ruling In a TV ad, Koster said Greitens’ charity The Mission Continues spent $600,000 on image consultants. This amount was well-supported by non-profit Form 990s, which listed $619,599 in payment to PR firm FleishmanHillard. The ad was misleading, however, when it suggested that the image consultants were used to craft Greiten’s personal image, instead of The Mission Continues. Furthermore, it implied that a charity spending money on branding is wasteful. An expert who monitors charities said it was a legitimate expense.

pomt-04014	"A majority of Americans agree with" a ban on assault weapons. "And by the way, so did Ronald Reagan."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/05/barack-obama/did-reagan-support-assault-weapons-ban/	About a month after a mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., left 20 schoolchildren and six adults dead, President Barack Obama rolled out a package of gun-control proposals during a speech with Vice President Joe Biden. The package included initiatives such as an assault-weapons ban that requires congressional approval, along with 23 executive actions that the president can implement on his own. The price tag for the package is estimated at $500 million. In presenting the package, specifically the portion dealing with the assault-weapons ban, Obama made a point of conjuring past President Ronald Reagan’s stance on the same issue. "Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater," Obama said during the speech. "A majority of Americans agree with us on this. And, by the way, so did Ronald Reagan, one of the staunchest defenders of the Second Amendment, who wrote to Congress in 1994, urging them -- this is Ronald Reagan speaking -- urging them to listen to the American public and to the law-enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of military-style assault weapons." Evoking past presidents is a frequent practice by politicians. Unfortunately, sometimes the context and the content of the recollections are incorrect. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the accuracy of Obama’s statement, as well as whether most Americans support a ban on military-style assault weapons. Obama pitched his gun plan at the White House surrounded by school-age children who had written letters to the president about the Newtown school shooting. In the audience were the parents of one of the students killed at Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with a survivor of the 2007 shooting massacre at Virginia Tech that left more than 30 people dead and an additional 15 wounded. Against this emotional backdrop Obama’s plans drew immediate and intense reaction from supporting groups such as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, as well as opponents such as the National Rifle Association. Obama’s push for an assault-weapon’s ban hearkens to the original ban passed in 1994 that expired in 2004. At the time of that ban’s passage, Reagan -- who took office in 1981-- supported it. In a joint letter to The Boston Globe with Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, the former presidents wrote, "While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals." Eight years before this letter in the newspaper supporting the assault-weapons ban, Reagan, who was then president, signed into law the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which was supported by gun rights advocates. In addition to providing protections for gun owners, the act also banned ownership of any fully automatic rifles that were not already registered on the day the law was signed. These items provide a framework for Reagan’s actions around an assassination attempt on his life months after taking office in 1981. The shooting left Reagan wounded and presidential press secretary James Brady paralyzed. The shooting provided the impetus for the Brady Bill, introduced in 1987, that required background checks for gun purchasers and a waiting period before a buyer could take possession of a gun. In a 1991 New York Times op-ed titled "Why I’m For the Brady Bill," Reagan detailed his support of a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers. "Every year, an average of 9,200 Americans are murdered by handguns, according to Department of Justice statistics," Reagan said in the op-ed. "… If the passage of the Brady bill were to result in a reduction of only 10 or 15 percent of those numbers (and it could be a good deal greater), it would be well worth making it the law of the land." "Reagan supported the Brady Bill. That was after he had left office, but he did support it," said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. "His views are a little complicated because he also signed legislation easing the (1968) Gun Control Act, so you can take Reagan either way." As for the president’s assessment that "a majority of Americans agree" with the assault-weapons ban, we went to the polls for answers. A Washington Post/ABC News poll involving guns, politics and governing priorities was conducted by telephone Jan. 10-13. The poll included a random national sample of 1,001 adults, including land-line and cellphone-only respondents. The poll’s results have a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. The poll includes three pertinent questions about weapons bans: -- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on semi-automatic handguns, which automatically reload every time the trigger is pulled? Fifty-one percent of all adults said yes; 46 percent said no. Fifty percent of registered voters said yes; 47 percent said no. -- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on high-capacity ammunition clips, meaning those containing more than 10 bullets? Sixty-five percent of all adults said they supported a ban; 32 percent opposed. Those same numbers applied to registered voters. -- Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons? Fifty-eight percent of all adults supported a ban; 39 percent opposed. Fifty-nine percent of registered voters supported a ban; 38 percent opposed. So how does Obama’s statement rate? During his speech laying out a package of gun-control proposals, the president evoked Reagan’s support of an assault-weapons ban. History shows that Reagan’s track record on guns is a winding road. He was a strong gun rights supporter who signed legislation easing an earlier gun law. But he also supported legislation for background checks and a waiting period for potential gun owners. He did support an assault-weapons ban and even joined two other former presidents in a letter to a major newspaper urging congressional approval of a ban. Not only did Reagan support the ban, but so do most Americans, Obama said. Information from a Washington Post/ABC News poll supports the president’s statement. On these two issues, we gave Obama a True rating.

pomt-01797	The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit compared the health care law to buying a pepperoni and ham pizza from Domino's or Pizza Hut.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz/dnc-chair-says-fourth-circuit-court-used-pizza-ana/	What does cheap pizza have to do with health care — other than if you eat too much, you might need to see a doctor? Apparently, it’s the perfect metaphor to explain why a key provision in the Affordable Care Act is legal. That’s what we heard from Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. During a July 22 Las Vegas TV appearance, the Florida congresswoman discussed two new dueling court decisions on the health care law. She said the court that sided with President Barack Obama’s administration made a compelling, albeit cheesy, argument. "The language in the Fourth Circuit actually compared if you buy a pizza from Pizza Hut to a pizza from Dominoes," Wasserman Schultz said. "And if you ask for ham and pepperoni on your Pizza Hut pizza, but then I actually go get your pizza from Domino’s, it’s implied if I bring back a pepperoni and ham pizza, then that’s what you asked for." Hold the sauce! Is this really what the court said, or did Wasserman Schultz slice the ruling? Let’s take a look. The challenge On Tuesday, two appeals courts issued rulings on whether the federal government had the authority to provide subsidies for people who purchased coverage on the federal government’s health insurance marketplace. Why is that an issue? The government directed each state to set up a marketplace where insurance providers could sell policies to uninsured residents. But if a state decided not to take this step, the federal government said it would step in and do it for them. As it stands, only 14 states are operating their own exchanges. Many of the people purchasing coverage in these marketplaces are low-income residents who are unable to afford policies without assistance. To help pay for coverage, the federal government provides subsidies in the form of tax credits to buy insurance. But, as written, the law says that the subsidies apply to insurance bought on exchanges "established by the State." In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said that clause means people in the 36 states without state-based exchanges cannot buy discounted policies. If upheld, millions of people would have to pay more for their policies or lose their coverage. Just hours later, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued its own decision in a similar case. In a 3-0 ruling, the court said that the way the law is written is at worst ambiguous, and that the Obama administration interpreted the law in a "permissible" fashion. That means everyone who’s bought the discounted policies would still get the credits. Pizza! Pizza! In a concurring opinion, Judge Andre Davis said he supported the Fourth Circuit Court’s decision to side with the Obama administration. But he didn’t see the law as that ambiguous. Quoting from the law, Davis wrote that the Department of Health and Human Services was instructed to "establish and operate such exchange within the State and … take such actions as are necessary to implement such other requirements." Giving Health and Human services the power to operate "such" an exchange also gives them the ability to provide tax credits, Davis wrote. Davis then served up this pizza-ordering scenario, presumably experienced by every college student at one time or another: "If I ask for pizza from Pizza Hut for lunch but clarify that I would be fine with a pizza from Domino’s, and I then specify that I want ham and pepperoni on my pizza from Pizza Hut, my friend who returns from Domino’s with a ham and pepperoni pizza has still complied with a literal construction of my lunch order. That is this case: Congress specified that Exchanges should be established and run by the states, but the contingency provision permits federal officials to act in place of the state when it fails to establish an Exchange." Got it? More importantly, did Wasserman Schultz get it? Yes…ish. First, and this is critical, Wasserman Schultz implied this was the opinion for the Fourth Circuit Court. It’s not. This is a concurring opinion from one judge who agreed with the ultimate decision, but added his own twist that wasn’t endorsed by the entire panel. That’s key. The second issue is pizza semantics. Wasserman Schultz said that if you order a pizza from Pizza Hut, it doesn’t matter where it comes from, as long as you get the toppings — ham and pepperoni — on the pizza you ordered. That’s not exactly what Judge Davis said. In Davis’ scenario, the person said in advance they wanted Pizza Hut, but they would be okay with Domino’s. Without that distinction, the pizza could also come from Papa John’s. Davis did not say Papa John’s would be okay, and we also have to note that Papa John’s does not offer ham as a topping (though a spokesman said patrons could order its foreign brother, Canadian bacon). Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said the Fourth Circuit Court in its ruling wrote, "If you ask for ham and pepperoni on your Pizza Hut pizza but then I actually go get your pizza from Domino’s, it’s implied if I bring back a pepperoni and ham pizza then that’s what you asked for." This wasn’t the ruling of the entire three-member court, just one judge’s concurring opinion. And she did miss the distinction that the person ordering the pizza said in advance they wanted Pizza Hut, but would be "fine with a pizza from Domino’s." We rate the statement Mostly True.

Below the comment was a picture of Wittman petting Valerie, a service dog, at a U.S. Navy contractors’ expo held May 16-18, a few miles from Capitol Hill. Wittman noted that he had backed legislation to help reunite military dogs, when they retire, with their handlers. "Brave and independent pups like Valerie deserve the hero’s treatment," he wrote. No doubt, military dogs deserve their due. But we wondered whether Wittman gave the canines too much credit in claiming each one averages saving 150 to 200 lives during their careers. Farahn Morgan, the congressman’s press secretary, told us Wittman got the figure from the American Humane Association. She provided a news release the organization sent in June 2015. It praised Congress for passing legislation that allows the military to fly service dogs back to the U.S. after retirement to be reunited with their handlers or adopted. Transportation previously had been handled by private fundraising organizations, including the humane association. "The nation’s military working dogs, each of whom saves the lives of between 150-200 servicemen and women in the course of their career, are one step closer to being guaranteed treatment as the heroes they are," the humane association news release began. We asked the humane association for its source of the statistic. Spokesman Mark Stubis told us the association got the numbers a few years ago from "a number of organizations that were working with military dog adoptions." He referred us to several news reports that also cited statistics but offered no specific source. They included: The Wall Street Journal, Feb. 25, 2012: "It is hard to quantify how many soldiers have been saved by canine detection skills, but estimates range from 150 to 1,800 lives per dog." People, March 15, 2010: "‘If one dog finds one explosive, he’s saved at least 150 lives,’ says Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Ekali Brooks." CNN, Jan. 6, 2012: "’These dogs are more soldiers than they are equipment,’ said Debbie Kandoll, founder of Military Working Dog Adoptions. Kandoll, who helps civilians adopt military working dogs, estimates that the average war dog saves 150 soldier lives during its service.’" CNN said that, according to the Department of Defense, there are 2,700 military dogs serving worldwide. The Journal offered the same number, although no source was cited. So, Let's do some math: If 2,700 military dogs saved between 150 and 200 lives each, how many service member's lives would be saved? The answer: Between 405,000 and 540,000. That’s roughly the same or more than the number of U.S. service members who were killed during World War II - pegged at 405,399 by the U.S. government. We asked the Department of Defense if it could verify that each military dog saves between 150 and 200 lives. Spokesman Eric Pahon repudiated the claim. "The DoD has not conducted a study and we feel that the number is likely greatly inflated over what the actual numbers might be," Pahon wrote in an email. Pahon said there are about 1,740 military working dogs, not including those belonging to special forces such as Army Green Berets and Navy SEALs, or those assigned to security details such as the Pentagon police. He declined to release the total number, citing security concerns. Pahon said the average career of a military dog lasts eight to nine years. Many of them are trained as bomb sniffers. "Most of our explosive-detecting (dogs) have never found anything except explosive training aids because they have never encountered a live explosive device," he said. "Those that have found devices were actually conducting deployed operations at the time in (Afghanistan or Iraq). For those that are found, the typical device in a roadway or building would kill far fewer people than 150 people. As such, the (dog) would need to find several devices or bomb-making components to reach the 150-200 number and that would only apply to very few dogs." Pahon said that while the contributions of the bomb sniffers are not quantifiable, "they are an invaluable asset for freedom of movement of our ground patrols." He added that many of the dogs aren’t bomb sniffers but are trained to detect drugs or walk patrols. "These are critical duties that are not directly life-saving, but contribute to overall mission success and safety," Pahon wrote. Our ruling Wittman said, "On average, each U.S. military working dog saves the lives of between 150 and 200 servicemen and women over the span of his career." This is a myth that’s been spread for years, often by organizations promoting the adoption of retired military dogs. Wittman says he picked up the figure from the American Humane Association’s website. Nobody seems to know the original source of the numbers. Wittman and others who state the number unequivocally fail in their burden of proof. The Department of Defense says it never has quantified the number of lives saved by military dogs and that the 150- to 200-per-dog number "is likely greatly inflated." Think about it: If the number was correct, it would mean the dogs are saving the lives of more than 400,000 service members every eight to nine years. While recognizing military dogs for the important service they perform, we rate Wittman’s statement False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/32d1c048-0b9b-4f10-9fee-3d1fba355582	None	Rob Wittman	None	None	None	2016-06-14T11:23:14	2016-06-18	['United_States']
pomt-12726	"300,000 pounds of rat meat sold as chicken wings across America."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/06/blog-posting/rats-rumors-tons-rodent-meat-passed-chicken-wings-/	A fake news story that said some 150 tons of rat meat may be sold as chicken wings to deal with high demand during the Super Bowl is actually a trap for unwary readers. A Feb. 15, 2016, post on UrbanImageMagazine.com declared that "300,000 pounds of rat meat sold as chicken wings across America." Facebook flagged the story as potentially being made up as part of the social media company’s crackdown on fake news. Facebook said this particular post had been shared more than 178,000 times in the past year. We found other instances of the same story elsewhere, too. The fake story said the Food and Drug Administration was issuing a warning about rodents being sold as chicken wings after several shipping containers of rat meat were impounded coming into San Francisco from China. An official-sounding statement from the FDA warned that the rat meat coming into the United States was filtering into the food system to deal with a shortage of poultry leading up to the National Football League’s main event. The story warned that Americans should be vigilant about what they are eating, because it’s supposedly hard to tell the difference between rat meat and chicken wings. We’d think the substitution would be easy to spot, but apparently rat is most often caught masquerading as lamb. And while some east Asian cultures have been known to consume rat meat or pass it off as something else, we could find no reports of rodent flesh being impounded in San Francisco by the ton in 2016, 2017 or any other year. The UrbanImageMagazine.com post cited as its source a Feb. 6, 2016, story from WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake articles. The site admits as much in its disclaimer, referring to "the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content." The original story posted a day before the Super Bowl was played on Feb. 7, 2016, as a joke "warning" people of counterfeit chicken wings. We contacted UrbanImageMagazine.com to ask if they knew the story was fake, but didn’t hear back. But we smell a rat, all right, and it’s the content of this story. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-11208	"Each year ICE detains someone, it costs taxpayers over $50,000. For comparison, by the way, that's four times the amount the federal government spends on each child in our public schools."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/11/patty-murray/does-detaining-immigrant-year-cost-4-times-federal/	Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., challenged the Department of Homeland Security’s spending practices, saying the agency is "unnecessarily detaining people," such as pregnant women. Murray offered a comparison of federal dollars that go toward the detention of immigrants with money spent to educate children in public schools. "As you know, detention is really expensive," Murray said during a May 8 Senate subcommittee hearing for the department’s 2019 budget request. "Each year (U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement) detains someone, it costs taxpayers over $50,000. For comparison, by the way, that's four times the amount the federal government spends on each child in our public schools." We found that Murray’s math contains some truth, but needs clarification and additional information. Based on the current rate to house an adult detainee per day, it would cost slightly over $50,000 to keep a person detained for a year. That’s roughly four times the approximate $13,000 public schools received per student. However, a year's detention is not realistic, as most detainees are held an average of 40 days. Also, most school funding is at the state and local levels, not federal. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Immigrant detention costs Murray’s office said her $50,000 estimate was an annualized calculation of the current daily bed rate for immigrant detention, $137.19, multiplied by 365 days (a total of $50,074.35). The bed rate is the national average cost to house one adult detainee for one day. In recent years, the average bed rate has been around $130. That $50,000 is likely a conservative estimate of the detention costs. From fiscal years 2014 through 2017, ICE underestimated the actual bed rate, said an April 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, flagging "inconsistencies and errors" in ICE’s calculations for immigration detention costs. Since ICE had not received an appropriation for fiscal year 2018 during the time of GAO’s review, GAO did not assess 2018’s budget projection compared to actual costs. Still, GAO said ICE’s 2018 request included a multiplication error that resulted in ICE requesting less funds for adult beds. It would cost more than $50,000 to keep one immigrant in detention for a year based on the current bed rate. But so far in fiscal year 2018, the average length of detention has been 40.5 days, according to ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett. The average length of detention from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 was about 33 days, according to the ICE budget overview for fiscal year 2018. The average length of detention for immigrants apprehended at the southwest border was about 27.4 days in fiscal year 2017, and increased to 51.5 days for immigrants apprehended in the interior of the country, the budget overview said. It also said that "due to a revived focus on ensuring public safety by increasing interior enforcement" detention of criminal immigrants "may be significantly higher when compared to prior years." Even so, there are reports of some immigrants being in detention for several months and even years. The U.S. Supreme Court in February said that individuals in immigration detention are not entitled to periodic bond hearings, even if they have been detained for months or years. The case centered on immigrants in the United States legally whom the government seeks to deport after being convicted of crimes, asylum seekers, and immigrants seeking admission on other grounds. Public school funds Murray’s office used data from the National Center for Education Statistics for her point about the cost of public school education. The center’s website said "total expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools in the United States in 2013–14 amounted to $634 billion, or $12,509 per public school student enrolled in the fall (in constant 2015–16 dollars)." Multiplied by four, the total slightly overtakes the $50,000 estimate for detaining on immigrant for a year. However, the per-student estimate includes all levels of funding, not just federal. "The word federal was inadvertently included, and will be corrected in the committee record so there is no confusion going forward," said Murray’s spokeswoman Kerry Arndt. Officials at the National Center for Education Statistics provided us updated data for 2014-15 that showed total expenditures per-student were $13,100 (or about $2,400 more than the immigrant detention estimate when multiplied by four.) The federal government contributes billions to educating U.S. students. But the bulk of costs are picked up by state and local sources. Schools use federal funds for specific school programs and students, such as school lunches and support for children with disabilities. Public schools received $56 billion from the federal government for the 2014-15 school year, said Tom Snyder, director of annual reports and information staff at the National Center for Education Statistics. Broken down to the number of students in public schools that school year (about 50 million), schools received $1,122 per student (adjusted to 2016-17 dollars), Snyder said. Our ruling Murray said, "Each year ICE detains someone, it costs taxpayers over $50,000. For comparison, by the way, that's four times the amount the federal government spends on each child in our public schools." The current bed rate to house one adult detainee multiplied by 365 days is $50,074.35. The most recent per-student expenditure total multipled by four comes to $52,400. The numbers alone don't capture the full story. It's important to note that not all immigrants spend a year in detention. Also, schools' major sources of funding are local and state governments, not the federal government. Murray’s statement is partially accurate and needs additional information. We rate it Half True.

pomt-01419	In North Carolina, "now we're near the national average" for unemployment.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/08/thom-tillis/thom-tillis-says-north-carolina-near-national-aver/	Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, said during a recent debate that the Tar Heel State has come a long way since the onset of the great recession. "We came from far behind," Tillis said. "Fourth-highest unemployment rate when I came in, now we're near the national average." We wondered: Is North Carolina now "near the national average" for unemployment? As it turns out, things have improved in the state, but they haven’t improved as much as Tillis suggested. We looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data. We found that for the most recent available month -- August 2014 -- North Carolina had an unemployment rate of 6.8 percent. That’s much lower than it was in January 2011, when Tillis assumed the office of state House speaker -- it was 10.4 percent. That’s a decline of just over one-third its previous level. (We’re not saying he gets all the credit for that drop -- simply that it happened during his tenure.) But despite this significant improvement in the North Carolina unemployment rate, it’s an exaggeration to say North Carolina is "near the national average." North Carolina’s August rate of 6.8 percent is 0.7 percentage points higher than the nation as a whole during August, and 0.9 points higher than the nation for September. (BLS releases national numbers before state-by-state numbers.) It’s a stretch to say it’s "near" the national average. By way of comparison, it took the nation nine months this year to drop its unemployment rate by 0.7 points, and it took North Carolina 11 months to shed 0.7 points to its current level. So a difference of 0.7 percentage points is a lot of ground to make up. Looking at North Carolina’s ranking among states provides further detail, but the result is not much more favorable to the accuracy of Tillis’ claim. In the state-by-state rankings for August, North Carolina is tied with Alaska for the 38th-best unemployment rate in the nation. That means it’s in the weakest one-quarter of states, not somewhere around half. Our ruling Tillis said that in North Carolina, "now we're near the national average" for unemployment. He has a point that the state has dropped its unemployment rate significantly in the past few years, but he exaggerates about how close the state is to the national average. In reality, North Carolina’s unemployment rate ranks it in the lowest one-quarter of states. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02353	Says Ralph Hall is "the oldest member in Congress ever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/20/now-or-never-pac/ad-attacking-texas-rep-ralph-hall-age-gets-histori/	A low-profile PAC has produced an ad attacking Rep. Ralph Hall, R-Texas, a 17-term House member who is facing a tough primary runoff against former U.S. attorney John Ratcliffe. The ad’s sponsor -- the Now or Never PAC -- is going for the jugular by attacking Hall for his age. "Ralph Hall was first elected to Congress when Jimmy Carter was president," the ad says. "Now he’s 90 -- the oldest member in Congress ever. With Texas families struggling, he isn’t making a difference for us any more. Hall’s a Washington insider who’s voted for wasteful earmarks and to increase the debt ceiling. Times have changed. After 33 years, let’s bring Ralph Hall home." The ad is correct that Hall is 90 -- he turns 91 on May 3 -- but we raised our eyebrows at the claim that Hall is "the oldest member in Congress ever." It is correct to say Hall is the oldest serving House member in history. According to the U.S House of Representatives, Hall passed the previous record-holder for oldest serving member in 2012 -- Charles Manly Stedman, who died in office on Sept. 23, 1930. However, as students learn in basic civics class, "Congress" refers to the House and the Senate. And the Senate has had four members older than Hall, according to Senate historian Donald Ritchie. They are Carl Hayden, D-Ariz., who was serving at 91; Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was serving at 92; Theodore Francis Green, D-R.I., who was serving at 93; and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who was serving as a Republican at 100. Ritchie noted one difference between the House and Senate: "House members stand every two years and senators every six, so of all the 90-year-old senators, only Thurmond won re-election in his 90s," as Hall is trying to do. Still, that’s not what the ad said. Our ruling The Now or Never PAC ad said Hall is "the oldest member in Congress ever." That’s not correct -- four members of Congress, all of them senators, have served at a more advanced age than Hall. So we rate the claim False.

pomt-14717	"91% of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/dec/29/patrick-murphy/terrorist-watch-list-no-obstacle-buying-guns-rep-m/	U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy joined other Democrats in demanding the House take up a bill that would keep people on the FBI’s watch list from buying guns, saying far too many people on the list have been allowed to get firearms. Murphy tweeted a graphic on Dec. 8, 2015, claiming that "91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted." His tweet came after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns. In an unusual procedural move, Murphy and other Democrats signed a petition to bring the bill to the House floor, but it currently doesn’t have the required 218 signatures for further action. The Senate earlier in December struck down a similar bill. We were curious if Murphy -- who is also running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016 -- was right to say that 91 percent of suspected terrorists looking to buy guns were able to get one. Our research showed that is accurate by the best available estimates, but there are some caveats about the watch list we should keep in mind. Watching the watch list The FBI maintains what is informally known as the terrorist watch list through its Terrorist Screening Center, which maintains a consolidated file of "those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity." As you can imagine, some critics are uneasy about the government maintaining any sort of list designating people potential enemies of the state, but it’s generally considered a valuable tool for national security. The Democrats’ bill allows for cross-referencing the list while conducting a background check for a firearm purchase. The actual size of the list and who is on it is not public information, but we have estimates: In 2011, an FBI fact sheet said there were 420,000 people on the list. Current estimates have put the list at around 700,000. Since the database pulls information from U.S. and global agencies, only a relative handful — about 8,400 in 2011 and likely around 10,000 now — are American citizens or legal residents. Murphy’s stat comes from a March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which examined how many people applying for gun purchases were run through the FBI’s instant background checks and also were on the watch list. Between February 2004 (when the FBI started keeping tabs on people on the list trying to buy guns) and December 2014, there were 2,233 people on the list who applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed, including three applications to buy explosives. That’s a bit more than 91 percent. Experts have told PolitiFact that the GAO report is plausible, and not really that remarkable, considering how many gun purchases Americans have made in the past decade. But there are things to keep in mind. The data show how many weapons applications there were, not how many individuals, so one person could have potentially made several purchases. The report also didn’t show transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren’t conducted, so the number actually could be higher. There also have been some issues with the terror watchlist database in the past. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were "associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which has previously led to people with the same name as a person on the watch list being stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Murphy said, "91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted." His figure comes from a GAO report that showed a bit more than 91 percent of gun store weapons applications by people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list were approved. There are some caveats to the watch list, including past issues with who is included and why. The report also didn’t distinguish how many individuals are making these applications, or how many people on the watch list potentially buy firearms at gun shows. But experts have told us the report is both plausible and not altogether unsurprising, given how many guns Americans purchase. We rate Murphy’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13024	Obamacare "was invented by liberal academic theorists."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/dec/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-misleads-about-inventors-obamacare-igno/	Donald Trump’s White House win gave Florida Gov. Rick Scott a powerful ally in his fight against Obamacare. In a Nov. 30 op-ed in USA Today, the former hospital executive reiterated his 2010 campaign pledge to fight for repeal of the federal health care law. "Other than President Obama and a few stragglers, everyone now realizes that Obamacare was a terrible notion," wrote the Republican governor. "It was sold on a lie. It was invented by liberal academic theorists who have no interaction with real families and businesses and therefore it doesn’t work." Scott’s piece leaves out that the Affordable Care Act of 2010 is based on ideas from not just Democrats but also Republicans. Behind the trio of academics Scott’s spokeswoman said he was referring to three academics: MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, Harvard economist David Cutler and Ezekiel Emanuel, who is now chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. We interviewed all three about their role in the Affordable Care Act or with Obama. Gruber developed the economic model for the law, which is part of the reason he has received the most attention in the media. He was instrumental in helping Massachusetts create its law, and the federal government contracted with Gruber to provide technical assistance. The national law was patterned after the Massachusetts law, and they are similar in structure. They both require everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty; they both leave the current insurance system in place; they both expand coverage for the uninsured through subsidies or Medicaid. While media reports often refer to Gruber as the "architect" of the bill, some others who worked on the legislation rebutted that characterization. John McDonough, a Harvard health policy professor who was a senior adviser to the Senate Health and Education Committee when the law was written, previously told PolitiFact that Gruber’s involvement with his economic model was important, but he didn’t determine what policies would be in the law. As for Cutler, he appears to have had the least to do with the law. Scott’s spokeswoman pointed to an October article in Politico referring to him as a "key architect" of Obamacare. But most of the articles we read described Cutler as a health care adviser to Obama during his 2008 campaign and an advocate for the law. Cutler told PolitiFact that while he spoke with people from the Obama administration, members of Congress and interest groups, "I did not serve in the administration and never wrote a line of the ACA." Cutler also worked on health care during the Bill Clinton administration and is a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. Emanuel was a paid special adviser for health policy to the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget from 2009-11. Even though Scott called him an academic given his current posting at Penn, Emanuel wasn’t working in academia when he worked for the federal government. (His brother Rahm was President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff.) Emanuel told PolitiFact that he worked on a lot of the details of the bill including the subsidy levels. So to recap, two of the men cited by Scott played important roles in the development of the law: Gruber developed the economic model and was an adviser while the law was being written while Emanuel was also a federal government adviser and worked on details of the bill. Cutler didn’t have a direct role in writing the law although he was a health care adviser to Obama during his campaign. Experts said Scott’s statement exaggerates, omitting the role of many others in the creation of Obamacare -- including conservatives. "Scott’s comment is so sweeping that it’s hard for it to be anything other than an exaggeration," said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Bipartisan roots To understand the invention of Obamacare requires looking back at previous attempts to overhaul health care, including by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Their proposal for universal health care prompted Republicans to come up with their own alternative in 1993. While as a party Republican senators never reached consensus, Republican Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island introduced a bill with 18 Republican co-sponsors (although some later withdrew) and two Democrats as co-sponsors. Chafee’s bill had some similarities to Obamacare. It included an individual mandate, created purchasing pools, standardized benefits, and included vouchers for the poor and a ban on denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. Another key player was the conservative Heritage Foundation, which advocated for health insurance exchanges including when Massachusetts, led by a Democratic Legislature and Republican Gov. Mitt Romney, crafted its own law in 2006. Many experts we interviewed noted that Romney is not a "liberal academic theorist." The Massachusetts plan and the national law share the central idea of requiring everyone to purchase health insurance and setting up a marketplace to allow individuals to buy coverage. Jonathan Oberlander, a health care policy specialist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said that liberal academics represented a part -- but not the entirety -- of the creators of the federal law. "There were many cooks in this kitchen and these ideas were generated over a long period over time," he said. "Ideas such as the individual mandate, exchange and private insurer competition had previously been advocated by conservative health policy analysts and Republican politicians—in many respects the ACA’s design and some of its major policies embodied what used to be core tenets of GOP philosophy on health care." Our ruling Scott said Obamacare "was invented by liberal academic theorists." Scott cherry-picked three advisers supportive of the law with ties to Obama. But he exaggerates by ignoring that many people over several decades from both parties developed the ideas for what would eventually become Obamacare. Most notably, Scott omits Republican Gov. Romney, who enacted a Massachusetts plan four years before the federal law passed, and the conservative Heritage Foundation, which was a strong advocate for the health care exchanges upon which both plans were based.

A talking point blasting President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation is bouncing across Georgia’s political messaging echo chamber as the U.S. Supreme Court tackles the law. Opponents of the 2010 bill have repeatedly said the changes are too expensive and have recently highlighted a March 2012 report from the Congressional Budget Office as proof. U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Roswell joined the chorus March 14 with a news release. "The new CBO projection estimates that the law will cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years -- well above the $940 billion Democrats originally claimed," said Price, a Republican. U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican from Ranger, said something similar, as did a Texas candidate for the U.S. Senate. Fox News published a story that said the law will cost twice as much as originally estimated. Oral arguments in the Supreme Court case began Monday. It’s widely considered to be one of the most politically fraught cases in years. We sought help from our sister site PolitiFact National, which tested a statement by Ted Cruz, the Texas candidate. He tweeted: "Did you know ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected -- $1.8 TRILLION?" PolitiFact National found that Cruz’s statement was False. The CBO’s estimates have increased, but far less than Cruz, Price and others have said. The biggest problem is that their claims compare apples to oranges. The CBO’s job is to review initiatives in Congress that may have an impact on the federal budget. It did so in 2010 for Obama’s health care overhaul. That report projected that the program’s costs during a 10-year period starting in 2010 and ending in 2019 would total $938 billion. This figure is the program’s "gross" cost and does not take into account plan features that will pay for some of the changes, such as new taxes on higher-income earners and penalties for those who opt out of insurance. Costs will increase as the program phases in. Full implementation will take place in 2014. Next, we looked at the newest report. The gross cost estimate is $1.762 trillion from 2012 through 2022. We found the 2012 number is not comparable to the 2010 figure. First of all, the new report calculates costs over an 11-year span, not a decade as the 2010 report did. Furthermore, it includes costs for nine years in which the health care law would be in full effect. The 2010 report covered only six years of full implementation. A better comparison would be to look at costs for 2012 through 2019, the years covered by both reports. So that’s what PolitiFact National did. In the CBO’s first estimate, the gross figure is $931 billion. In the new estimate, the figure is $1.01 trillion. That’s an increase of less than 9 percent. This jump is far less than what Price’s numbers suggest. If the CBO’s estimate had truly changed to $1.76 trillion as his news release said, the plan’s costs would have nearly doubled. PolitiFact National also considered what the projected cost of the health care overhaul would be if it took into account aspects of the plan that would pay for some of the care. It felt this "net" cost number would be a more complete portrayal of the plan’s costs. It found that these net cost projections actually declined. The CBO’s 2010 estimate totaled $784 billion. The 2012 report revised it downward to $768 billion. Price’s claim that the health care overhaul "will cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years -- well above the $940 billion Democrats originally claimed" uses numbers that are not comparable to make an incorrect assertion. When you do the math correctly, the gross cost projection increased by less than 9 percent. The net cost estimate has actually dropped. Price’s claim is False.

pomt-07522	"We’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/07/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-interim-spending-bill-would-cut-/	With the possibility of a government shutdown looming, Republicans have been saying their temporary spending bill will cut $12 billion. The statement was made by several key GOP members, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Here's what he said in a statement touting the bill, which would extend government funding by another week while also providing funds to the Pentagon for the remainder of the year. "As I’ve said throughout this process, since the spending binge in Washington is hurting job creation in this country, we’re going to fight for the largest cuts possible – real cuts, not more smoke and mirrors," Boehner said in the April 5, 2011, statement. "We’ve made clear that Democrats’ $33 billion proposal is not enough, and much of it is based on gimmicks. To make a positive impact on our economy, the cuts need to be significant, and they need to be real. Failing to make real cuts will send a signal to job creators that Washington is still not serious about getting government spending under control. ... "We’re not going to allow the Senate and White House to force us to choose between two options that are bad for America, whether it’s a bad deal that fails to make real spending cuts, or accepting a government shutdown due to Senate inaction. We’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year. We may pass this to keep the government running if Democrats don’t listen to the American people and get serious about cutting spending." At issue is this line: "We’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week." Indeed, while the bill does include $12 billion in cuts, it also includes $7.6 billion in additional spending for the Defense Department -- a 1.5 percent increase over last year’s level. (This news release from the House Appropriations Committee breaks down the numbers in the bill.) So the net amount of cuts is $4.4 billion -- roughly one-third of the $12 billion figure Boehner cited in his statement. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending, considers the emphasis on the $12 billion figure misleading. "Saying the continuing resolution cuts $12 billion while ignoring the $7.6 billion in defense adds is like saying you met your weight loss goals if you don’t count your backside," Ellis quipped in an e-mail. We asked Boehner’s office for the speaker’s perspective, but we did not hear back. We find that Boehner, who decried budget "gimmicks" in his statement, is conveniently leaving out the spending increase and painting a misleading picture of the bill. Boehner’s statement -- "we’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year" -- is carefully worded. The bill does include $12 billion in cuts to discretionary spending, and it does fund the Defense Department, as he indicated. But we also think Boehner’s artful wording suggests a much larger cut than the bill actually delivers when the additional defense spending is included. Using the net figure for spending reductions would have been a more accurate description. On balance, we rate Boehner’s statement Half True.

pomt-03152	Chemical weapons have been used "probably 20 times" since the Persian Gulf War.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/10/ted-yoho/rep-ted-yoho-says-chemical-weapons-have-been-used-/	U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., has a question for those who support intervention in Syria’s civil war: "Why now, and why us?" President Barack Obama has urged targeted military strikes to punish Syria for alleged chemical attacks against its citizens, including deadly nerve gas on Aug. 21, 2013. The U.S. government says that attack may have killed more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children. But Yoho told Fox Business Network that chemical weapons have been used repeatedly since the 1990 Persian Gulf War without a U.S. military response. "If you go back to the Iraq war, it's been used probably 20 times since then, and I just question the motive of right now in America acting out in the lead of this. I think it's wrong for America," he said Sept. 4, 2013. Experts have previously told us that chemical attacks have been rare since World War I. We wondered — have there been 20 such attacks in the last two decades? The question is partly one of definition. The most authoritative definition — set out by the Chemical Weapons Convention, an agreement among 189 countries to eliminate chemical weapons — is also very specific. It doesn’t include, for example, improvised use of industrial chemicals, or certain gases when used by a police force instead of a military. But it’s also a question of time line, and of evidence. Yoho’s office said he meant to include attacks prior to 1990, as well as recent attacks in Syria that are yet to be confirmed by the international community. Here’s what we found. We checked with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the group headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, that oversees the international Chemical Weapons Convention, which went into force in 1997. Experts say it’s the most authoritative source on chemical weapons attacks. Other than alleged attacks in Syria, which it’s still investigating, the group officially acknowledges just a single chemical attack since 1990 — by a Japanese cult using homemade sarin gas on the Tokyo subway that killed 13 people and sickened thousands. The last use by a country, according to OPCW’S brief online history, was by Iraq in 1988 — before the Persian Gulf War. "There have been numerous other alleged uses of chemical weapons in the Middle East during this period, but none has been shown to involve standard chemical weapons," said OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan. For example, in several countries that experienced protests during the "Arab Spring" of 2010 and 2011, there were allegations involving the use of tear gas, which is allowed for use in riot control by security forces, Luhan said. Other allegations included the use of white phosphorus in Fallujah, Iraq, and the Palestinian city of Gaza. But those are also allowed by the convention "to illuminate or obscure the battlefield," he said. So if you look at the use of illegal gas by nations, there’s not even one example of a chemical attack like the one alleged in Syria since before the Persian Gulf War. (Our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker dug up just a handful of examples this century.) And Yoho made his comment in the context of the Chemical Weapons Convention. "You know, this all goes back to the CWC agreement ... that stated that any country that produces, transports, stores or sells chemical weapons or weapons of mass destruction are in violation," he said during the Fox Business interview. So when Yoho mentioned "probably 20" attacks since 1990, we concluded that he meant attacks by countries, rather than by individuals or rebels. And using those parameters, you can’t get to 20. But his office suggested he was also including Syria’s own attacks since 2012. In the interview, he mentioned "over 11" such attacks that could have triggered U.S. action. But those attacks aren’t yet well substantiated. In April, the New York Times reported Britain and France had written to the United Nations suggesting there was evidence Syria had used chemical weapons in its civil war. It was as the OPCW was investigating allegations of those attacks that the suburbs of Damascus were attacked Aug. 21. The OPCW team changed its focus to the later attack. It’s now processing evidence from its visit. The U.S. says it "assesses" that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons over the last year, but isn’t specific. The French mention a handful of April attacks. The United Kingdom counts at least 14 previous attacks. Yoho also counts non-state attacks and those with rough "improvised" chemical weapons that don’t qualify under the CWC — and some attacks by Iraq before 1990. For example, Chechnyan and Iraq insurgents have detonated chlorine tanks, said Philipp Bleek, an expert in nonproliferation at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. The Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland counts 10 attacks that involved chlorine in Chechnya and Iraq in 1999, 2007 and 2009. Meanwhile, acknowledging that Yoho’s time line was "a little askew," his deputy chief of staff, Omar Raschid, said the congressman meant to include pre-1990 attacks by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in its war with Iran and against the Kurds. Those attacks are widely held up as a notable example of government chemical weapons use since World War II. They ended in the late 1980s. And while it’s true the United States looked the other way, it later used Iraq’s chemical arsenal as part of its justification for the 2003 invasion. Yoho also cited Russian security forces’ use of a "nonlethal" narcotic gas when they stormed a Moscow theater full of hostages held by Chechnyan rebels in 2002. Dozens of more than 800 hostages ultimately died from the effects of the gas, prompting "strong public debate" about whether Russia had violated the CWC, according to a U.S. Army medical textbook. But it fell into a legal loophole under that agreement, according to a book by the late Monterey Institute expert Jonathan Tucker in his 2007 book, War of Nerves: Chemical Warfare from World War I to Al-Qaeda. So Yoho’s count — with its mix of state and non-state perpetrators and official and nonofficial chemical weapons — struck experts as odd. "Rep. Yoho is misinformed," said Matthew Meselson, a professor at Harvard University who specializes in chemical and biological defense and arms control and co-directs the Harvard Sussex Program on Chemical and Biological Weapons. The most authoritative source, he said, is the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Bleek agreed, saying that while there have been a few non-state incidents, there’s no state attack in the past 20 years that compares with the Aug. 21 attack in Syria. "The problem with it is the parallelism that it implies — that there were earlier incidents in which we should have intervened. And at that point, it falls apart," said Bleek, who until recently was a senior adviser to the Office of the Secretary of Defense on nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs. (He wasn’t speaking behalf of the Defense Department.) "You have some isolated instances, but the reality is, after World War I, there's just not a lot of state uses," Bleek added. "There just aren't a lot of countries in the world that stockpile or are suspected of having chemical weapons." Our ruling Yoho said chemical weapons have been used "probably 20 times" since the Persian Gulf War. If you count confirmed chemical weapons attacks by governments since 1990, then the answer is zero. Using looser definitions and a longer time frame gets Yoho to or beyond 20. Even if you don’t count the earlier Iraqi attacks that fell outside of Yoho’s stated time line, it’s possible to get to 20 attacks by counting the pre-Aug. 21 incidents in Syria, the use of chlorine gas by insurgents, the Tokyo subway attack and the Moscow theater rescue. Still, experts told PolitiFact that loosening the definition of what counts as an attack doesn’t make it an apples-to-apples comparison. Yoho talked about enforcement of an international agreement against chemical weapons, but he’s only correct when he uses a definition of chemical attacks that has nothing to do with that international understanding. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Ted Yoho	None	None	None	2013-09-10T10:41:50	2013-09-04	['None']
pomt-02660	"Unemployment insurance kept more than 620,000 children out of poverty in 2012."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-facebook-post-says-unemployment-benef/	In the midst of a battle over whether to extend unemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed, President Barack Obama’s Facebook page posted this: "Unemployment insurance kept more than 620,000 children out of poverty in 2012. Tell Congress to renew job seekers' economic lifeline." We wondered whether this claim, which was posted Jan. 7, 2014, was accurate. We checked with Organizing for Action, the pro-Obama group that the president has deputized to handle his personal Twitter and Facebook accounts. Organizing for Action spokeswoman Katie Hogan said the numbers were based on a report by the Joint Economic Committee, a panel in Congress that consists of both House members and Senators. While the Joint Economic Committee is bipartisan as well as bicameral, the report was written by the panel’s Democratic staff, which is overseen by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. In its summary table, the Joint Economic Committee report says that, nationally, 2,458,295 Americans were lifted out of poverty due to unemployment insurance payments, including 618,788 children. According to the table, the calculations were based on U.S. Census Bureau data. Specifically, the committee used publicly available data files that had information on 387,876 individuals, with the identifying information removed. If the difference between a person’s income and the poverty line was less than the amount of unemployment insurance they had received, they were counted as having been lifted out of poverty due to unemployment insurance. This number was used as the basis for estimating the number nationally. So, unless the Joint Economic Committee staff muffed the calculations, the Obama Facebook post was in the ballpark, though the figure was actually slightly less than 620,000, instead of "more than 620,000," as the Facebook post said. That said, it’s worth taking a closer look at the numbers -- specifically the threshold for what counted as being in poverty. The table notes that the committee used the Supplemental Poverty Measure rather than the traditional way of measuring poverty. What’s the difference? Currently, poverty is officially measured by establishing a set of income thresholds for families of different sizes and compositions, then comparing family incomes to those levels. Being in poverty means that you have an income below the threshold for your family type. But for years, scholars have debated whether there is a better way to measure poverty than the official statistic. One of the efforts to test an alternative measurement is called the Supplemental Poverty Measure. The Supplemental Poverty Measure doesn’t just consider cash earned but also in-kind transfers such as food stamps, as well as taxes paid and medical and work-related expenses, such as child care and commuting costs, wrote University of Massachusetts-Amherst economist Nancy Folbre in a New York Times blog post. It also employs a "new standard of need, linked to what low-income families actually spend," she wrote. In 2010, a federal interagency working group gave a green light to begin calculating the statistic, but only as long as the long-standing poverty calculation retained its official status. Because the two poverty rates are calculated differently, the findings about how extensive poverty is in the United States are almost guaranteed to be different, though the poverty rate may end up higher for some subgroups using the supplemental method even as it is lower for other subgroups. So how does the use of the supplemental figure shape the Joint Economic Committee’s findings? A footnote to the chart reports that while the supplemental measure found that nearly 2.5 million Americans were lifted out of poverty by unemployment benefits, the number would have been 1.7 million using the official poverty calculation. The report doesn’t say how many children would have been lifted out of poverty using the traditional poverty calculation, but since the supplemental measure has sometimes shown lower poverty rates among children, it’s certainly plausible that the number also would be smaller than 618,788. If the proportion for children was the same as it was for individuals as a whole, the number of children lifted out of poverty would be 427,914. Our ruling Obama’s Facebook post said that "unemployment insurance kept more than 620,000 children out of poverty in 2012." The number has some backing from an analysis of Census Bureau data published by the Democratic staff of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. However, this analysis used an unofficial poverty measure rather than the traditional one, and the report Obama’s team cites as support acknowledges that using the traditional poverty measure would have decreased the number of individuals lifted out of poverty by about one-third. A similar decrease among children would have meant the number of children would have been 427,914 rather than roughly 620,000. Overall, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05151	"A million people a year come into the U.S. legally. No other country even comes close to that figure."	true	/florida/statements/2012/jun/20/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-us-admits-1-million-immigrants-ye/	During a Fox News interview on June 18, 2012, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., discussed immigration and said that "a million people a year come into the U.S. legally. No other country even comes close to that figure." We’ll check these two claims in order. "A million people a year come into the U.S. legally" The numbers can get a little complicated, but all the experts we spoke to said Rubio was on solid ground. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the United States accepted 1,062,040 legal permanent residents in fiscal year 2011, a number that has been fairly steady over the past few years. Of this number, roughly 45 percent were new arrivals and about 55 percent were people already in the U.S. whose status was upgraded to "permanent." Separately, the U.S. admitted more than 4.4 million people in 2010 on a long-term temporary basis, either for employment or study. This number does not include a much larger total (roughly 42 million people) admitted for shorter stays, including visitors for pleasure or short-term business. So while one could say that 46 million people actually "come into the U.S. legally," we’ll give Rubio the benefit of the doubt that he was referring to the 1 million who were granted permanent resident status, not those admitted on a temporary basis. "No other country even comes close to that figure" We looked at immigration statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research group for advanced industrialized nations. Using 2009 statistics, the only nation that came close to the U.S. in permanent immigrant inflows was Germany. That year, the U.S. had 1,130,800 permanent immigrants, compared to 606,314 for Germany. So the U.S. had numbers about twice as big. The third-place finisher, Spain, had 469,300. So Rubio’s correct on this point, too. Some additional context Without taking away from the accuracy of Rubio’s statements, we thought it would be worthwhile adding a bit of context. There are actually many other countries that absorb immigrants at a higher rate than the U.S. does once you factor in the size of each nation’s population. Using the measurement of permanent, annual immigrant inflows per overall population, the U.S. in 2009 ranked only 11th out of a selection of 28 advanced industrialized nations, trailing such countries as Australia, Austria, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway and Ireland. And using United Nations data on the cumulative number of resident immigrants as a share of total population, the U.S. ranks only 25th in the world. Some of the nations with higher immigrant percentages are small, oil-rich Arab countries with large foreign-worker populations, but others with higher rankings include Israel, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, Spain and Sweden. On the other hand, the U.S. does diverge from most of the rest of the world on the rights granted immigrants once they are made permanent. "Where the U.S. differs from most European countries is that the immigrants we admit are generally eligible for full membership in society through naturalization, and that the immigrants' U.S.-born children are automatically citizens with full rights," said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center. "Neither of these is generally the case in Europe." Our ruling Rubio is right that "a million people a year come into the U.S. legally" and that "no other country even comes close to that figure." We rate his statement True.

pomt-01347	Says David Perdue wants to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, which would cost Georgia schools $1 billion a year and eliminate millions in student loans.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/22/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/does-david-perdue-want-eliminate-us-education-depa/	A new ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wants to paint GOP Senate hopeful David Perdue as an extremist when it comes to education. Education has already been a hot issue in the tight governor’s race. The ad, "Help," sounds the alarm for the topic in the closely watched Senate battle between Perdue and Democrat Michelle Nunn. The main claim: Perdue wants to abolish the federal Department of Education, which would jeopardize $1 billion for Georgia public schools already struggling with tight budgets. "That would devastate Georgia schools," the ad narrator says. "A billion dollars cut from K through 12. Eliminate all federal student loans." Republicans have called for eliminating the federal department since Ronald Reagan first pledged to do so in his 1980 presidential campaign. The issue has lived on in some conservative circles, even amid stiff Congressional opposition for decades. Reagan himself switched positions in 1983, after a federal report warned of a "rising tide of mediocrity" in American schools. The son of two teachers, Perdue has talked at length about the need for more local control. But does that translate into eliminating the federal department? And would the cut mean such a dramatic loss to school funding in Georgia? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. First, we looked at Perdue’s stance. When asked about Common Core in a July interview with the Marietta Daily Journal, Perdue called for the academic standards to be abandoned and "went on to say the federal Department of Education should be abolished." The July story does not include a direct quote. But a July story in the Covington News quotes Perdue as saying the department should be "defunded" and fixed. In October, the Political Insider blog referred to the MDJ story calling for the department to be abolished and quoted a campaign spokeswoman as saying Perdue’s plan called for shifting money from the federal to the local level. Perdue did not respond to repeated requests to clarify those comments. However, when asked by Channel 2 Action News to address the specific charge at a press conference at the National Federation of Independent Business on Oct. 2, he did not deny the claim. "My position all along on this has been that big government is not producing results," Perdue said. "So what I would look at doing is moving a lot of those dollars that go into the federal government back in the local school systems where the best decision can be made." States handle nearly all education policy and issues. At the federal level, the Education Department conducts research, enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and, as the ad says, handles federal financial aid in loans and grants. But as the ad suggests, there is also plenty of money at hand. The ad says eliminating the department would cut $1 billion in K-12 funding every year and eliminate student loans. That’s a slightly conservative estimate, given that Georgia will receive nearly $1.1 billion in elementary and secondary school funding for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, and another $1.1 billion for the current year, according to federal figures. There is even more money in the two federal loan programs set up by the Higher Education Act of 1965 – with Georgians receiving about $2.9 billion in federal direct student loans, records show. In addition, more than 297,000 Georgia students received federal Pell Grants in 2012-2013, totaling nearly $991million, according to federal numbers. The U.S. Education Department has administered all of those programs since 2010, when the government eliminated the Federal Family Education Loans program and began making loans directly to students and parents. That is to say, the loan programs’ operation has been shifted already. And Congress could again shift them to another agency if it voted to eliminate the federal education department. Reagan had called for such a transition years ago. Rick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, said he doesn’t believe the next Congress will have the majority votes needed to abolish the U.S. Department of Education or the funding it provides for student loans and other programs. Even with talk of abolishing the department in the past, discussions have called for those programs to move to the Department of Health and Human Services, he said. "I don’t think you could find 15 votes for doing away with the funding," Hess said. Andrew J. Coulson, director of the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, agreed that abolishing the agency is "not equivalent to ending all the programs/funding streams that currently are gathered there." Coulson said there were federal education programs before the cabinet-level education department was established under President Carter, and other agencies continue to run some programs. The Head Start pre-K program, for example, is still run by DHHS, he said. That brings us back to the ad, which claims David Perdue supports eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, a position that could cripple Georgia schools, students and loan recipients. Our research finds there is reason to believe Perdue does support abolishing the department and transferring funding to the local level. But it is alarmist to suggest the end of the department would be the end of all K-12 money.

pomt-06577	"The Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/28/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-fed-created-12-trillion-o/	U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich wants to put people back to work, but since the private sector has not had much success, he wants to prime the economic pump by spending public money on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. There’s plenty of demand out there, Kucinich told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto on Sept. 7, pointing to an American Society of Civil Engineers report identifying an immense need for infrastructure repairs and rebuilding. But where would the money come from? States and local governments don’t have those kinds of dollars, Kucinich rightly pointed out. But, the Ohio Democrat added, the federal government does. "We just found out the other day that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations," he told Cavuto. That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. After all, how can anybody simply create $1.2 trillion out of nothing? Well, it turns out Kucinich was pretty much on the money, no pun intended. Let’s take the first part of his sentence, that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing. The "Fed" in this case is the Federal Reserve, our country’s central bank. It’s the job of the Fed to use monetary policy to keep inflation in check and to stimulate the economy to create jobs. It does this by buying and selling government-backed securities that either increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation. The Federal Reserve also serves as the lender of last resort to its member banks who are having liquidity problems and can’t go to other banks for short-term loans. With that in mind, let’s go back to 2008 and 2009 when the United States banking system was on the brink of disaster. Then-President George W. Bush created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, to buy up banks’ bad investments and later to infuse the institutions with badly needed capital. In Cleveland, PNC National Bank used TARP money to buy troubled National City. TARP, however, is not what Kucinich was talking about. TARP was orchestrated by the U.S. Treasury and used money borrowed from the sale of U.S. securities such as Treasury bills. Nor was he talking about the $800 billion stimulus package of 2009, much of which was in the form of tax cuts. Kucinich was talking about $1.2 trillion that the Federal Reserve had on loan, primarily to banks, at the peak of its emergency lending during the financial crisis. The figure comes from a Bloomberg News investigative story this past summer that analyzed detailed loan information released by the Federal Reserve. Indeed, many banks did get money. Morgan Stanley at $107.3 billion received the most, followed by Citigroup at $99.5 billion and Bank of America at $91.4 billion. The loans, however, were not handed out the way your bank down the street dispenses money, explained Walker Todd, former assistant general counsel to the Federal Reserve banks in Cleveland and New York City. Regular banks are limited in how much they can loan based on their access to money, be it deposits or other forms of financing. "But the Fed, uniquely among institutions in our society, gets to create money out of thin air," Todd said. It does so by simply increasing the balance in a member bank’s account. No actual money is printed. It just shows up in the electronic ledger, new money that never existed before that’s now in circulation, boosting the aggregate money supply. Each bank, however, did have to put up assets as collateral in case the money wasn’t repaid. Some of those assets, according to Bloomberg, were junk bonds. Eventually, all the money was repaid, with interest. But according to Todd, rather than wipe the money off its books, the Federal Reserve chose to use much of it to further stimulate the economy by purchasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities on the open market. So that money remained in circulation. Finally, what about Kucinich’s claim that some of the $1.2 trillion went to foreign banks? Again, Kucinich was correct. Two of the several foreign banks getting help were Royal Bank of Scotland Plc at $84.5 billion and UBS AG of Switzerland at $77.2 billion. The Federal Reserve treats foreign banks operating in the United States the same as U.S. banks because they are all part of the same financial system. On a side note, even some companies, including General Electric, received emergency cash. So while Kucinich’s comment that "the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks and some of them foreign banks so that they could stabilize their operations" is a bit flip, maybe even pejorative, he was essentially correct in describing the unique money-creating capabilities of the Federal Reserve and how it was used. On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates True.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-09-28T06:00:00	2011-09-07	['Federal_Reserve_System']

pomt-03734	Says "A baby in Coos County is two times as likely to be born to a mother who is someone who used tobacco during her pregnancy as is the average baby born in Oregon or the U.S."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/apr/12/caddy-mckeown/are-babies-born-coos-county-twice-likely-be-born-s/	Legislation to let counties set additional taxes on tobacco squeaked through the Oregon House last week on a 31-to-29 vote. Lawmakers opposed to higher taxes said it wasn’t fair to squeeze more revenue out of cigarette addicts. Lawmakers in support said smoking is a public health hazard and that local governments should be allowed to assert local control. Freshman Rep. Caddy McKeown, D-Coos Bay, said she too struggled with aspects of House Bill 2870, but then reeled off some disturbing statistics courtesy of the Coos County public health department, including this one: "A baby in Coos County is two times as likely to be born to a mother who is someone who used tobacco during her pregnancy as is the average baby born in Oregon or the U.S.," she said. Twice as many smokers? What’s up, Coos County? Studies show that prenatal smoking puts babies at greater risk of low birth weight, respiratory illnesses and other potential health problems. State and county numbers McKeown’s office shared a 2011-12 annual report on the status of public health in Coos County. We also checked with Stephen Brown, a tobacco prevention program coordinator at Coos County. Figures from 2011 birthsshow that in Coos County, 23.4 percent of mothers used tobacco while pregnant. Statewide, the figure was 10.7 percent. That’s more than double. In real numbers, that means 135 of 577 babies born in Coos County in 2011 were born to smokers. Statewide, 4,795 of 45,136 babies born in 2011 were born to smokers. Brown says that studies show that people are less likely to smoke the higher their educational attainment. Prenatal tobacco use is greater among women who don’t finish high school than among women who graduate from college. People living in poorer households are more likely to smoke. Coos County lags the state in educational achievement and in per capita income. Certainly Coos is not the only county to post rates at least twice Oregon’s. Douglas and Josephine counties posted rates at 25 percent, and Lake County was the highest at 26.5 percent. Those are also rural counties similar to Coos in income and education demographics. Multnomah County was at 6.8 percent. National average A national average is harder to come by, mainly because not all states use the same "certificate of live birth" forms to collect prenatal information. The Annie E. Casey Foundation calculates a U.S. figure of 9 percent for births in 2010, but the number leaves out about 20 states. Oregon, which was included, was at 11 percent. Still, the average is backed up by a hefty Oregon Health Authoritydocument, which reports prenatal tobacco use across the country went from 13.6 percent in 1996 to 10.7 percent in 2005. In Oregon, the percentage of women smoking during pregnancy also dropped during that period, from 17.8 percent to 12.4 percent. The ruling: We can say with certainty that babies born in Coos County are twice as likely to have mothers who smoked during pregnancy than the average baby in Oregon. That also looks to be the case using older or incomplete national averages. We rate the statement True.

pomt-15360	Says Hillary Clinton’s top 10 donors are mainly "banks, corporations and media," while Bernie Sanders’ top 10 donors are labor unions.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/07/facebook-posts/meme-says-hillary-clintons-top-donors-are-banks-an/	As Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gains ground on Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, the two candidates’ supporters have been sparring, including over campaign donations. Recently, a reader sent us a social media meme that paints Clinton’s list of donors as dominated by corporate interests, whereas Sanders’ top 10 donors come largely from labor unions -- a dichotomy that, to Democratic primary voters, puts Sanders in a more favorable light. "Hillary: Top ten donor list. Representing banks, corporations and media," the meme reads, providing a top-10 list with dollar amounts. "Bernie: Top ten donor list. Representing people." The meme is topped by each candidate’s presidential campaign logo. (See the meme below.) We can’t tell who produced this meme, but we thought it was worth a closer look. We’ll start by noting that reasonable people can disagree about whether labor unions represent "people," as the meme says, as opposed to just unionized workers, who are a relatively small subset of the entire population. We’ll also note that while this meme may appeal to union supporters and critics of Wall Street and big corporations, it also could be used as evidence that Sanders is just as reliant on one type of donor -- labor unions -- as Clinton is on big corporations. We found that the data cited in the meme refers to cumulative donations over the course of each candidate’s political career as calculated by the Center for Responsive Politics, not just fundraising from the current presidential cycle. (Clinton and Sanders have announced their fundraising hauls for the second quarter of 2015, but have not yet released the full data that is due at the Federal Election Commission by July 15; a more complete analysis of the data will be compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics after that.) For Clinton, we found a high degree of similarity with the meme when we checked the database on July 6. Clinton’s top 10 cumulative donors between between 1999 and 2016 were, in descending order, Citigroup ($782,327), Goldman Sachs ($711,490), DLA Piper ($628,030), JPMorgan Chase ($620,919), EMILY’s List ($605,174) Morgan Stanley ($543,065), Time Warner ($411,296), Skadden Arps ($406,640), Lehman Brothers ($362,853) and Cablevision Systems ($336,288). That list is quite close to what the meme says. It includes five financial-services companies, two law firms that do a lot of corporate work, two media conglomerates and one group, EMILY’s list, that supports abortion-rights Democratic candidates. It’s worth noting that Clinton was a senator from New York, meaning that some of the donors on her list were not simply Wall Street and corporate behemoths, but also constituents, based in New York. The database results for Sanders are also quite close to what’s in the meme. The data for Sanders goes back to 1989. His top 10 are, in descending order, Machinists/Aerospace Workers union ($105,000), Teamsters union ($93,700), National Education Association ($84,350), United Auto Workers ($79,650), United Food & Commercial Workers union ($72,500), Communications Workers of America ($68,000), Laborers Union ($64,000), Carpenters & Joiners Union ($62,000), National Association of Letter Carriers ($61,000), and the American Association for Justice ($60,500). In the meme, the letter carriers’ union makes the list, but the Center for Responsive Politics has the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees cracking the top 10 instead. Either way, nine of the 10 are unions, and the tenth is the national association representing plaintiffs’ attorneys. During his career, Sanders has received strong support from progressive Democrats, so this pattern of financial backing is not surprising. So the meme is pretty accurate for both candidates. However, we see a few things worth pointing out. As we noted, this data refers to their entire political careers back to the 1990s. Once the full presidential data is released, those figures may show different patterns. "That is not made clear" in the meme, said Anthony J. Corrado, a campaign-finance expert at Colby College. "Most people would assume that this is money raised so far in the 2016 presidential campaign." Also, the "donors" listed are not the ones who gave the money, since that would be against the law. Rather, it was their PACs, employees and those employees’ families. In fact, due to how the forms are filled out, the data is less likely to capture individual donations from union members than from employers of companies. Most individual donations are listed by employer, and if, say, a union carpenter lists his affiliation as his company, the fact that he’s a union member wouldn’t be recorded. Finally, lists such as this ignore that both candidates are collecting many small donations, too. According to the Clinton campaign, she raised roughly $50 million in contributions under $200 during her '08 campaign. Data for the 2016 cycle is not available yet. All told, it’s possible to look at the top donors on the two lists and say both candidates are captive to a particular set of interest groups, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. However, he added, "labor is a Democratic constituency whose beliefs generally line up with Democratic policies, and we’re talking about a Democratic primary here. So all things being equal, Sanders’ donor list probably looks better, politically, than Clinton’s." Kondik added that, as the meme indicates, Clinton has a much larger reservoir of money than Sanders has. "The value of having a large financial advantage over your competitors in a primary setting seems to be worth occasional questions about how the financial advantage was built," he said. Our ruling Social media memes say that Clinton’s top 10 donors are mainly "banks, corporations and media," while Bernie Sanders’ top 10 donors are labor unions. This contention fits quite closely with campaign data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, it’s worth noting that this data refers to cumulative donations as far back as the 1980s, rather than just donations to their current presidential bids. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2015-07-07T10:51:33	2015-07-06	['Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-01180	Says President Barack Obama "has lost more members of the House and more members of the Senate than any president ever has lost" in modern times.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/07/matthew-dowd/has-president-obama-lost-more-democratic-seats-con/	The Democrats took their final drubbing of the 2014 midterm election Dec. 6 with the decisive defeat of Sen. Mary Landrieu in the Louisiana Senate runoff. The election of U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy means Republicans will hold 54 seats in the new Senate. Assessing the Democratic plight, one-time Republican consultant turned news analyst Matthew Dowd said President Barack Obama had overseen historic losses for his party. "President Obama has demonstrated he’s very good at winning his own elections," Dowd said on ABC’s This Week on Dec. 7, 2014. "But in modern times, he has lost more members of the House and more members of the Senate than any president ever has lost." We asked Dowd what he meant by modern times and he told PunditFact he was thinking of post-World War II. We went to the congressional records to see how this president and his party stack up compared to past administrations. We decided to look at how many seats for the own president's party, be it Democrat or Republican, shifted during each president's time in office. We ran the numbers two ways. In the first approach, we looked at the electoral impact of a president who was running on his record. This meant we ignored party shifts in the year he was first elected because at that point he had no presidential track record. This meant that for two-term presidents, we summed the changes for the first midterm, the re-election, and the second midterm. We scored single-term presidents for just one midterm. In the second approach, we allowed for a presidential coattail effect. If the president’s name was on the ballot, we counted any party shifts, including those in the year he was first elected. So for all presidents, we summed the changes from his first election to his last midterm. We treated Presidents Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford a little differently because they took office when their president died or resigned. We counted their first election, if they won, as a case of running on their record and added in any shifts in the balance of congressional party power. Here’s what we came up with. President President's party shift in Congress (Without first election) President's party shift in Congress (Including first election) Franklin Roosevelt (D) -71 seats +38 seat Harry Truman (D) -17 seats -17 seats Dwight Eisenhower (R) -83 seats -60 seats John F. Kennedy (D) -2 seats -22 seats Lyndon Johnson (D) -14 seats -14 seats Richard Nixon (R) -1 seats 11 seats Gerald Ford (R) -54 seats -54 seats Jimmy Carter (D) -16 seats -16 seats Ronald Reagan (R) -24 seats +24 seats George H.W. Bush (R) -7 seats -10 seats Bill Clinton (D) -59 seats -67 seats George W. Bush (R) -18 seats -26 seats Barack Obama (D) -85 seats -52 seats The table makes it clear that the first election makes a big difference. Without it, Dowd is correct, though just narrowly. Obama saw his party lose a total of 85 seats between the House and the Senate in the course of three elections. Interestingly, President Dwight Eisenhower runs a close second with 83 fewer Republicans. These are net numbers so ground lost in one election could be made up in the next. For Eisenhower, 1958 was the worst year. For Obama, it was 2010. However, when we include every year when the president’s name appeared on the ballot, the ranking shifts. Obama first took office in a wave election that cost Republicans quite a bit. When we run the numbers this way, President Bill Clinton comes in as first among losers, followed by Eisenhower and Ford. Obama takes fourth place. To viewers, it wasn’t clear what yardstick Dowd was using. While he noted that Obama was good at winning his own elections, he didn’t specifically set a timeframe for measuring how the balance of power in Congress has shifted over time. We think both measures are largely valid. One argument for giving more weight to the first approach is Dowd was talking about the effect that presidents have on their party. Until you win election, you aren’t president, and the gains or losses in your first election shouldn’t count. We should also highlight that no president deserves full credit or blame for party gains or losses. To say that Obama has lost members of his party in Congress is not to say that he alone made that happen. (A technical note: We used the official party counts by the House of Representatives and the Senate. They record the numbers at the start of each Congress. If members die, resign or switch parties during their term, we don’t include those changes. Also, we did not include independents or members of other parties who would then choose to caucus with one of the major parties.) Our ruling Dowd said Obama has lost more seats held by his party in the House and Senate than any modern president. By one valid measure, Dowd is correct. By another measure, Obama would rank fourth. That, however, does not make Dowd’s claim inaccurate. It just means that it needs clarification and some additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-09987	"More than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/16/barack-obama/Obama-claims-90-percent-guns-used-Mexico/	With growing violence on the U.S.-Mexico border fueled by powerful drug cartels, officials from both countries have been repeating a shocking statistic to suggest this isn't just a Mexican problem. "This war is being waged with guns purchased not here but in the United States . . . more than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States, many from gun shops that lay in our shared border," President Barack Obama said on a visit to Mexico on April 16, 2009. "So we have responsibilities as well." Obama joins many other U.S. and Mexican officials — from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. — who have cited versions of the 90 percent figure in arguing for greater U.S. intervention. For his part, Obama has pledged to commit more money and resources to stem the flow of guns south of the border. But Obama, Clinton and others have left out important qualifiers when citing the 90 percent statistic, which originates from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The agency doesn't have statistics for all weapons in Mexico, where gun sales are largely prohibited; the figure is based on only guns that the Mexican government sent to the ATF for tracing and that the ATF found were traceable. Along those lines, the number was cited correctly by William Newell, an ATF special agent who oversees the bureau's operations along border in Arizona and New Mexico, when he testified before a House subcommittee on March 24. "In fact, 90 percent of the firearms recovered in Mexico, and which are then successfully traced, were determined to have originated from various sources within the continental U.S." Gun rights groups say the number has been widely and intentionally distorted to advance a gun control agenda. And on April 2, 2009, Fox News ran a story on its Web site dismissing the statistic as a "myth." The article cites statistics from the Mexican government that suggest only about a third of the guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico are submitted to the ATF for tracing; and it notes that many guns submitted to ATF cannot be traced. Therefore, the writers conclude, only 17 percent of guns found at Mexican crime scenes have been traced to the United States. According to the article, "a large percentage of the guns recovered in Mexico do not get sent back to the U.S. for tracing, because it is obvious from their markings that they do not come from the U.S." The article goes on to say many weapons are coming from a wide variety of foreign sources including China, South Korea, Spain and Israel, as well as from the Russian mafia and other nefarious sources in Asia, South and Central America. "Reporter after politician after news anchor just disregards the truth on this," National Rifle Association spokesman Chris Cox told Fox News. "The numbers are intentionally used to weaken the Second Amendment." ATF officials challenge the suggestion that Mexico only sends them guns they suspect are from the United States. In fact, the ATF found about a quarter of the 90 percent were made in other countries and then taken illegally from the United States into Mexico. So what does that mean about the accuracy of Obama's claim? Are the guns submitted to ATF a representative sample of all guns confiscated by Mexican authorities? In an interview on CBS's Face the Nation on April 12, 2009, Arturo Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, stood behind the 90 percent figure. "Ninety percent of all weapons we are seizing in Mexico ... are coming from across the United States," Sarukhan said. "Just on the Arizona and Texas borders with Mexico alone there are approximately 7,000 (gun shops). And a lot of the weapons that are being bought by the drug syndicates, either directly or through proxy purchases are coming from those gun shops." Alberto Islas, a security consultant with Risk Evaluation in Mexico City, said the 90 percent figure is based on an incomplete sample. Mexican officials only require ATF traces of guns used in "high-impact crimes," he said. That certainly includes crimes involving violent drug cartels. That's the sample from which the ATF derives its 90 percent statistic. Driving up that percentage, Islas said, is the fact that nearly all of the handguns traced by ATF come from the United States, Islas said, while assault weapons are more of a mixed bag — some come from the United States, but others come through drug routes in Eastern Europe, Africa and elsewhere. When looking at all the weapons used in violent crimes in Mexico, Islas said the figure of 90 percent coming from the United States may be a bit on the high side, but he said the real number is certainly a lot higher than the 17 percent cited by Fox. We think the ATF number, presented in its proper context, provides legitimate and useful information to weigh when considering U.S. policy. We find the implication that the number could be as low as 17 percent is unrealistic because it assumes that every gun that has not been traced comes from somewhere other than the United States. That's faulty logic. But we think Obama also mischaracterizes the statistic some when he says 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States. Not every gun recovered in Mexico is submitted to the ATF for tracing. And so Obama and others can't know exactly what percentage come from the United States. They can only speak to the guns successfully traced by the ATF. And so we rule Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-04-16T20:26:40	2009-04-16	['United_States', 'Mexico']

pomt-08953	The lieutenant governor has the power to be an "economic ambassador" and "negotiate" on economic development	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/23/jeremy-kapstein/kapstein-says-lieutenant-governor-has-power-negoti/	Here we go again. Another election year, another debate over what the lieutenant governor's job is all about and whether it's even worth having the position at all. The characters might change, but the story stays the same. The sitting lieutenant governors try to defend their work. The challengers promise they'd do more with the office, or in the case of Cool Moose candidate Robert Healey, eliminate it altogether. Enter one of the newest candidates for the job, Red Sox senior adviser Jeremy Kapstein. When appearing on WPRO's Dan Yorke Show Tuesday, Kapstein, a Democrat, promised that, if elected, he'd be a salesman for the state, wooing developers and creating jobs in the process. But it was what he said about the lieutenant governor's responsibilities that caught our ear: "The lieutenant governor has the power to go out as an independent constitutional office and has the budget to be this economic ambassador. And then, when the deal is brought in, to actually negotiate and help the [state Economic Development Corporation] so that it is a good deal for the taxpayers of the state." That sounded like quite a lot of authority for an office that some have argued shouldn't even exist. Kapstein's claim has created a minor stir among Rhode Island politicos, so we elected to send it to the Truth-O-Meter. What we really wanted to know is whether the state Constitution gives a lieutenant governor any authority to be an "economic ambassador" who could negotiate on behalf of the EDC. Here's what we found: Apart from references to how and when the lieutenant governor is elected, there are few mentions of this job in the Constitution. Statutes within the state's General Laws note that the lieutenant governor is responsible for chairing several boards and commissions. But the Constitution does not lay out a specific set of duties that the state's number-two executive can, or must, perform. It wasn't always that way. It used to be that the lieutenant governor was authorized to take over when the governor was out of state. But that power was stripped in a 1992 constitutional amendment. Until 2003, lieutenant governors were also responsible for presiding over the state Senate. These days, however, the most significant constitutional duty assigned to the lieutenant governor is as the governor's understudy: "When the governor elect shall die, remove from the state, refuse to serve, become insane, or be otherwise incapacitated, the lieutenant governor elect shall be qualified as governor at the beginning of the term for which the governor was elected." We admit, we were intrigued by the question of who would determine that a governor had gone insane. But we digress. Kapstein campaign manager Joe Rodgers said the candidate acknowledges the ambassador and negotiator roles are not specifically defined in the state Constitution, but Rodgers said Kapstein believes an effective lieutenant governor would take on those types of duties. All this raises some interesting questions about Kapstein's claim. On the one hand, because the Constitution gives the lieutenant governor no specific powers, he's wrong to suggest that it does. But on the other hand, does the lack of specifics mean a lieutenant governor could do whatever he or she wants? His Democratic primary opponent, incumbent Elizabeth Roberts, branded herself during her first term as a champion of health care and traveled across the state to encourage Rhode Islanders to "Buy Local." No one questioned her authority to do so. The same goes for Kapstein's ability to negotiate on behalf of the Economic Development Corporation. There's nothing in the Constitution to say he can't do so, assuming the agency wants his help. The EDC board is chaired by the governor, which means Kapstein would need the governor's approval to take on any of this responsibility. Roger Williams Law School Prof. Jared Goldstein said the absence of a defined job description makes it hard to determine what's appropriate. "The question is whether the lieutenant governor on his or her own volition can just decide to take on various activities that are neither authorized by statute or by the Constitution," he said. "Yet there's simply nothing in the Constitution or in statutes or in case law that speaks to that." So there we are, a little stuck. Kapstein's not completely right. But he's not really wrong either. As much as we hate to do it, we'll split the difference and call it Half True.	None	Jeremy Kapstein	None	None	None	2010-07-23T00:01:00	2010-07-20	['None']

pomt-01632	"I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon … Most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/26/don-lemon/cnns-lemon-says-automatic-weapons-are-easy-get/	Fans of the Second Amendment have been chiding CNN’s Don Lemon for his comments about the sorts of guns you can legally buy in this country. They’ve said Lemon was confused, and his exchange with conservative radio host Ben Ferguson on Aug. 20, 2014, was embarrassing. It began when Lemon, broadcasting live from Ferguson, Mo., said he supported the Second Amendment but that he doubted the Founding Fathers were thinking about automatic weapons when they wrote it. Ferguson shot back. "Let’s deal with the facts here," Ferguson said. "A semi-automatic weapon is a gun that you or I is allowed to own and in different places they have different rules. But to imply that anyone can just go out and buy an automatic weapon is just not true, Don." "What do you mean?" Lemon said. "During the theater shooting in Colorado, I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon, and I maybe have shot a gun three, four times in my life. I don’t live in Colorado. I think most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon." This fact-check zeros in on Lemon’s claim that "most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon." The gun Lemon bought in Colorado was an AR-15. The version sold by the Bushmaster company is described as a semi-automatic. When Ferguson pointed out the difference between a fully automatic and an semi-automatic weapon, Lemon dismissed the distinction as a matter of semantics. "An automatic weapon is something that you can shoot off a number of rounds very quickly," Lemon said. That is not the legal definition of an automatic weapon, but this debate pulls back the curtain on a couple of wrinkles in what federal law says and does not say. For starters, the law fails to define the term "automatic." Semi vs. fully automatic The 1968 Gun Control Act defines a semi-automatic as "any repeating rifle which utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round, and which requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge." The key part there is the "separate pull of the trigger." One pull = one shot. The law speaks clearly about what it means by the term semi-automatic. When it comes to the term "automatic," a little inference is required. The 1934 National Firearms Act defines a machine gun as "any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger." Note that part about more than one shot by "a single function of the trigger." One pull = many shots. That’s the legal difference between a semi-automatic and a fully automatic weapon. The AR-15 that Lemon bought was a semi-automatic. People can go out and buy such guns at many stores across the country. Buying a fully automatic gun is a very different and more restricted process, which we’ll get into in just a bit. But it’s interesting that while the legal definition of a machine gun talks about firing automatically, there is no definition of an automatic weapon as such. We asked the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and a couple of top legal experts on federal gun laws. No one could point to legal language, court ruling or federal rule that make a machine gun interchangeable with an automatic, even though in a practical sense, they are. Yes, you can buy a machine gun During the exchange between Lemon and Ferguson, Ferguson said "the majority of private citizens are not allowed to own full automatic weapons." Steven Howard is a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mich. Howard said the ban on machine guns is not quite as complete as Ferguson’s words might sound. "Most people can buy machine guns in lots of states," Howard said. "But, and this is one of those classic big ‘buts,’ they have to get through a background check by FBI that is as thorough as if you are getting clearance to become a federal agent." Howard said those checks can take up to six months. States such as California, Iowa and Kansas, ban private ownership under any circumstances. But in about half the country, including Florida and Texas, if you pay the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms $200 and have a clean record free of any history of domestic violence or a felony conviction, you can get yourself a machine gun legally. However, Joseph Olson, recently retired as professor of law at Hamline University, and a former board member of the National Rifle Association, said it won’t be a new one. "There was a freeze put on them in 1986," Olson said. "New Jersey representative (William) Hughes had an amendment that limited them to the ones that were registered at that time. There are a bit under 300,000 in circulation." New devices blur the lines Since the key legal difference between a semi-automatic and a machine gun is whether pulling the trigger releases one bullet or many, it is worth noting that government regulators have approved devices that, when added to a rifle, allow a gun like an AR-15 to fire many rounds at great speed. They are called bump stocks, or trigger activators. The hunting supplier Cabela’s offers one called the Slide Fire. "Maximize your fun with this safe and innovative AR-15 stock, which uses bump-fire technology to shoot as quickly as desired," the retailer says on its website. Videos show shooters going through clip after clip of ammunition. Howard said that while the rate of fire mimics a machine gun, the mechanism is different. "If you very slowly pull the trigger, the recoil causes the gun to jump back and forth," Howard said. "And that causes the trigger to be pulled." By government standards, this retains the role of human intervention for each shot fired. Howard said the impact of trigger activators is less than meets the eye. He said they easily fail and make a gun difficult to aim. "People don’t use them in crimes because you have to use them so carefully," Howard said. Still, there are enthusiastic reviews on the Cabela's website. A buyer who calls himself "Freddie Joe" wrote, "This is an extremely fun addition to your A/R. The only problem will be the amount of shells you will go through. I went through 300 in a couple of days ... When you get really good at using this product, you can empty a 30-round clip in a matter of seconds. Cool!" Our ruling CNN’s Lemon said that many people can go out and buy an automatic weapon. Lemon spoke as though the gun he had purchased was an automatic. It was not. It was a semi-automatic, meaning each shot requires a separate pull of the trigger. The ease of purchase that Lemon described applies to semi-automatic guns. The legal status and availability of semi-automatic and fully automatic guns are quite different. Lemon was further incorrect when he didn’t revise his language and insisted that the distinction was just a matter of semantics. Acquiring a machine gun is prohibited in some states, while much more heavily regulated in others. We rate Lemon’s claim False.	None	Don Lemon	None	None	None	2014-08-26T16:22:21	2014-08-20	['None']

pomt-11727	"The candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.’ "	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2017/dec/14/bruce-rauner/rauner-distorts-dems-message-illinois-income-tax/	Speaking to reporters after a speech in Chicago on Dec. 4, Gov. Bruce Rauner predicted a re-election victory in next year’s gubernatorial race and warned of dire tax consequences if any of the three main Democratic candidates for the post win. "You know what will happen? We will get a massive income tax hike. The candidates controlled by (House Speaker Michael) Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike,’ " Rauner said, referring to Democratic candidates Daniel Biss, Chris Kennedy and JB Pritzker. All three have stated they support replacing Illinois’ flat-rate income tax with a system in which those with higher incomes pay higher rates. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rauner went on to list examples of other states — New Jersey, New York, Minnesota and California — where people earning $40,000 a year pay more in state income tax than the 4.95 percent rate now applied to all Illinois taxpayers. "They will sock the middle class with a tax hike that Madigan and his puppets want and it will destroy Illinois," Rauner said, noting that the progressive tax movement would be deceptively labeled as a "tax the rich" effort. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Rauner’s statement contained a generous dollop of campaign vitriol — the Madigan-as-puppet-master theme is a running theme for Rauner — but it also brings up what is sure to be another key issue in the governor’s race. Would a Democratic victory for governor next year bring about a graduated-rate income tax for Illinois? And would that be tantamount to a "massive income tax hike?" Long road ahead Rauner’s statement implies a Democratic governor could muscle through a change that would replace Illinois’ current flat-rate income tax system with a multi-rate system. That overlooks the fact that the single-rate income tax is enshrined in the Illinois Constitution of 1970, establishing a high hurdle for enacting any change. "A tax on or measured by income shall be at a non-graduated rate," begins Article IX, Section 3 of the constitution. To impose a progressive tax system lawmakers would have to amend the constitution. That requires approval of three-fifths majorities in both the Illinois House and Senate to put the issue on a general election ballot. Then voters must approve the amendment by "either three-fifths of those voting on the question or a majority of those voting in the election," according to Article XIV, Section 2 of the constitution. From 2013 to 2017, Democrats held three-fifths majorities in both the House and Senate yet still could not muster votes to back ballot referendums on a limited graduated income tax plan to impose higher rates on the very rich. Since then, Democrats have lost their three-fifths margin in the House, though they control the chamber. In theory that could change in the next election, but to push through a tax referendum in the House before then would require a handful of Republican votes. And that’s not likely to happen. The governor, incidentally, is irrelevant in this process. There is no veto power over constitutional amendments. If approved by voters, they become law. Under the constitution, the only path to get a tax referendum before voters is through the Legislature. Citizen-led petition drives for such a purpose are not allowed. Bracketology Rauner also equates a graduated tax system to a "massive tax increase" on the middle class. But he tries to make the point with cherry-picked examples. A single filer earning $40,000 annually in California pays 6 percent. It’s 5.525 percent in New Jersey, 6.45 percent in New York and 7.05 percent in Minnesota, according to 2017 tax data compiled by The Tax Foundation. Those tax rates are all higher than the 4.95 percent now imposed on Illinois taxpayers. But there are other graduated income tax states Rauner failed to cite where the numbers would undermine his premise. Individuals earning $40,000 a year pay 3.36 percent under Arizona’s graduated-rate system. In Maryland, those who earn between $3,000 and $100,000 pay 4.75 percent. North Dakota taxes $40,000 at 2.04 percent, and its highest bracket imposes only a 2.9 percent rates on incomes over $416,700. Ohio’s top rate, 4.997 percent, applies to income of more than $210,600. Those in Ohio earning $40,000 pay 2.969 percent. Even Connecticut’s 5-percent tax on $40,000 is very close to Illinois’ 4.95 percent. (Connecticut’s top bracket, 6.99 percent, kicks in at $500,000 for individual filers.) While Democratic candidates say they support a graduated-rate system, they have been talking in the abstract and none have proposed specific rates. Given the difficulty of amending the constitution, lawmakers would be loath to enshrine tax and income brackets into it, and any rate-setting would fall to the legislature after a constitutional change. The realpolitik of that hasn’t stopped Rauner from predicting how it would all play out. "They say, ‘Let’s tax the rich,’" Rauner said in the same Dec. 4 press conference. "Well, first of all, you watch business owners flood out of this state when that happens and our unemployment rate is going to go through the roof." Immobile movement The last big push for a comprehensive progressive tax amendment came during the 2013-14 legislative session and it died without receiving a vote in either the House or Senate. The proposal contained no income or tax bracket figures. In 2012, the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning fiscal watchdog, created a progressive tax model in which taxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000 — 94 percent of those in Illinois — would pay the same or less than the 5 percent tax rate in effect at that time. The model nonetheless projected a 5.8 percent increase in revenue from the income tax because of higher rates on the wealthiest Illinoisans. CTBA Budget Director Bobby Otter said that model would likely hold up today because the current Illinois tax rate, 4.95 percent, is close to that used to make the projection. The easy way Raising taxes is never easy, but procedurally it is easier to change rates than change the constitution. Indeed, the Illinois tax rate has bounced around in recent years, from 5 percent in 2010 to 3.75 percent in 2015 to 4.95 percent starting last summer. When we contacted Rauner’s campaign to ask whether the Republican believed a Democratic successor would try to raise the latest rate, spokesman Justin Giorgio referred us to a recent column in The News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana. That column focused on reporting by Crain’s Chicago business about a Nov. 20 visit by Pritzker to its editorial board. During that visit, the Democrat mentioned a progressive income tax and potentially new tax revenue for the state if it legalized marijuana. Pritzker was not quoted as directly calling for a tax hike: Some will come from amending the Illinois Constitution to allow a progressive income tax, something that would require a referendum vote, likely in 2020. Pritzker said he could not estimate how much that would pull in, but he projected the state would net another $300 million to $700 million by legalizing and taxing marijuana. Would that be enough to meet all the needs while (economic) growth accelerates? "No. But it depends on how you prioritize," Pritzker replied. After the meeting, a Pritzker campaign spokeswoman issued a statement to clarify that "J.B. does not believe we should raise taxes on middle-class families, period." In sum, Pritzker backs a graduated tax amendment, thinks it will reap more revenue for the state and acknowledges that still may not be sufficient to meet needs. But his spokeswoman suggests only the wealthy should be asked to pay more. (The article cited by the Rauner campaign discussed only Pritzker, though Biss and Kennedy have endorsed the progressive tax concept.) Our ruling Rauner said Democratic gubernatorial "candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.'" Rauner’s "controlled by Madigan" tag is aimed at the three highest-profile candidates, Pritzker, Kennedy and Biss, and suggests without proof they are all acting at the behest of the powerful House Speaker. All three have advocated for a change from a flat income tax rate to a graduated-rate system in which tax rates are higher for those with higher incomes. Despite Rauner’s examples, a progressive income tax system does not necessarily mean a tax increase for the middle class. And there is no evidence that anyone in Illinois politics has a blueprint for income and tax brackets under a potential Illinois system. The closest such blueprint, from 2012, had the vast majority of voters paying the same or lower taxes. Nor is that decision up to the governor. It would take three-fifths of the General Assembly and a majority of voters to bring a progressive tax to reality. Recent history does not point favorably to this happening without significant Democratic gains in the Legislature. Pritzker was squishy when discussing immediate revenue needs with Crain’s, but Rauner cites the Crain’s article as Pritzker’s solid endorsement of a "massive tax increase."

The image in question is part of a British contemporary artist’s portfolio of placing celebrities and prominent figures in compromising situations. We've included it below, but be warned, it's a bit jarring. "The Clintons are Finished Forever After Dirty Picture LEAKS! (NSFW)," the website wrote Nov. 15, 2016. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The post says the images are not confirmed, but then goes on to speculate who the woman is and surmises that both the person in the image and Clinton are left-handed: "If that’s not Bill Clinton, it sure looks like him." The post tracks back to the Twitter account of a user named 0Hour. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In reality, the image was cropped and lifted off the website of contemporary artist Alison Jackson. Here is a screengrab of the full image from her website: And here is how Jackson describes her work. "Alison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is ‘real’. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson’s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of ‘truth’." Jackson also has portrayed President-Elect Donald Trump as part of work for Vanity Fair. She has a new book with her images, entitled Private 2016, available on Amazon. Through a spokeswoman, Jackson told us that she is "delighted one of my works is part of the ‘fake news’ movement. ... My work is about celebrities and public figures in private, things we have all imagined but never seen before. We think we know them intimately but we only know them through the media imagery -- very few of us have met them for real. Celebrities and public figures are created by the media industries."

pomt-10966	Says John Brennan "was a member of the Communist Party during the Cold War."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/jul/19/ron-desantis/was-john-brennan-once-member-communist-party/	Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis cast doubt on the credibility of John Brennan over the former former CIA director’s furious reaction to President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Brennan called Trump’s meeting with Putin "nothing short of treasonous" on Twitter. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com DeSantis, who is vying for Florida governor, appeared on Fox News hours later to respond. "John Brennan was a disaster as CIA director," DeSantis said on Fox News on July 16. "He was a disaster as the counterterrorism official. He was a member of the Communist Party during the Cold War." DeSantis added: "So this is not exactly the guy I would listen to about Russia." We wanted to look into his statement that Brennan was a member of the Communist Party during the Cold War. We found Brennan has acknowledged voting for a communist presidential candidate in 1976. That does not mean he was a member of the Communist Party. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and pundit Sebastian Gorka are examples of Republicans who framed similar criticism of Brennan more accurately, singling out the vote but not going as far as saying he belonged to the party itself. Where is this coming from? Long before his appointment as CIA director in 2013, Brennan took a required polygraph test before entering the agency. Brennan discussed the test at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual conference in September 2016, CNN reported. He was a panelist in a discussion about diversity in the intelligence community. Brennan was asked about whether past activism would create a barrier for diverse candidates seeking to enter the intelligence community later in life. According to Brennan, the polygrapher asked him, "Have you ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the U.S.?" Brennan said he was apprehensive — he had voted for Gus Hall for president in 1976, which was while the Cold War was underway. (The Cold War is generally defined as running from 1947 to 1991.) The New York Times reported Hall earned more support from American voters in his 1976 presidential campaign than in his other three. He won 58,992 votes, putting him in eighth place, behind candidates from the Democratic, Republican, Independent, Libertarian, American Independent, American and Socialist Workers parties. "I froze, because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said, 'OK, here's the choice, John. You can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or I can acknowledge it and see what happens,'" CNN has quoted Brennan as saying. (We searched for video but did not find it.) Brennan told the polygraph operator that he had voted for Hall, but added that he was never a member of the Communist Party. Speaking at the conference, Brennan said he was relieved to have been accepted into the CIA, because he worried about having compromised his chances by being forthcoming. "I said I was neither Democratic or Republican, but it was my way, as I was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change. I said I'm not a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, 'OK,' and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said, 'Well, I'm screwed.'" Brennan used the anecdote to make a point about room for diversity in the CIA ranks. "So if back in 1980, John Brennan was allowed to say, 'I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall' ... and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that's not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government," CNN reported him as saying. Does any of this make Brennan a member of the Communist Party at the time? No. In 1976, Brennan was studying political science at Fordham University. This was the first election after the Watergate scandal, which left many Americans disillusioned with American politics. He could have voted for the Republican candidate Gerald Ford, who had controversially pardoned Richard Nixon, or he could have cast his ballot for Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter. Stephen Craig, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said, "Carter (was) a southerner who was not trusted given the legacy of the Jim Crow South by many Democrats and other left-leaning voters." "Carter was an outsider who promised ethical governance but still represented mainstream politics," added Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. Importantly, experts agree that voting for a particular candidate in a party does not make the voter a member of that party. Becoming a member of a party is a much more specific and intensive commitment than simply pulling a lever in the ballot booth. "Brennan was … a young idealistic student pursuing studies in politics who shared the concerns of many about the health of the U.S. political system during this time period," said Thomas Sutton, a political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University. Brennan’s former CIA deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro told PolitiFact Florida that it wouldn’t make sense for someone who was a secret communist to out themselves repeatedly. Our ruling DeSantis said Brennan "was a member of the Communist Party during the Cold War." Brennan has openly confirmed voting for a Communist Party candidate for president in 1976. But the DeSantis campaign did not provide evidence that he was a card-carrying party member, and we did not find any. Voting for a particular candidate in a party does not make the voter a member of that party. Because it contains an element of truth but twists facts to give a different impression, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10967	"Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over $3M in federal disaster relief"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/19/blog-posting/misleading-article-implies-puerto-rico-hurricane-a/	A headline on an online story says, "Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over $3M in federal disaster relief." The article includes a photo of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, wearing a shirt with "NASTY" printed in large block letters. This photo is taken from a television appearance following Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico in September 2017. Cruz was a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, accusing him of providing insufficient aid to the island. On Facebook, the story's link preview shows Cruz’s face above the headline. But she has not been accused of fraud related to hurricane relief. The article, published July 15 on Your News Wire, reveals that Cruz isn’t facing charges at all. A different Puerto Rican mayor was accused. (Fact-checkers at The Weekly Standard caught that the initial version of the story said that Cruz and her party faced charges, but the language had been changed by the time we looked at it. Some versions of the story copied elsewhere had not made the change.) We decided to dig a little deeper and see what else might be misleading about this story. Wrong mayor The mayor facing fraud charges is Miguel Ortiz-Vélez of Sabana Grande. Federal authorities have accused him of running a three-year scheme, beginning in 2013 and ending in 2016, to defraud the government of $3 million. Ortiz-Vélez proposed projects to the Puerto Rico Department of Education, but intentionally overestimated their cost. He gave the extra money to the companies he contracted out for the work, as well as to the city. The owner of one of the companies reimbursed Ortiz-Vélez nearly $23,000 in cash. Ortiz-Vélez was indicted on July 2 for theft of government money, mail fraud, and money laundering. If he is found guilty, he could face up to 30 years in prison. Close, but no cigar The article on Your News Wire mixes the alleged Ortiz-Vélez scheme with another case of fraud in Puerto Rico. Two finance directors in Tao Baja were accused of misusing federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Your News Wire story implies that this money was meant as hurricane relief funds, calling it "assistance funds" that were given "during the same general time frame as the disaster." This scheme took place from 2014 until early 2016, long before Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The money was meant to be used for promoting economic development and building new public facilities. Instead, the finance directors put the funds toward paying municipal employees and contractors. This investigation is ongoing, and, again, separate from the investigation into Ortiz-Vélez. A lawsuit There have been allegations against Cruz as well, which some outlets have connected to misuse of federal disaster relief funds. In February 2018, a former government worker sued the municipality of San Juan. She claims that the city was committing fraud by paying some contractors far more than others. She also claims she was demoted for speaking out against the corruption. A local San Juan paper reported that, according to two unnamed sources, the FBI has opened an investigation into the alleged fraud. However, the plaintiff of the suit resigned in June 2017, before Hurricane Maria. The suit does not include any mention of federal disaster aid. Our ruling The article said, "Puerto Rico Mayor Facing Fraud Charges Over $3M In Federal Disaster Relief." The article was styled to make it seem that Cruz, the vocal San Juan mayor, was responsible for the fraud. The entire first half of the article focuses on her liberal politics and her objections to Trump, rather than any specific crimes. All of this is severely misleading. The reporting on the underlying fraud itself is bungled. It has nothing to do with "federal disaster relief." The story mixes up two unrelated cases of fraud stemming from Puerto Rico that took place over a year before Maria struck. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00740	In recent polling in battleground states, a "majority of the people" said Hillary Clinton "is untrustworthy."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/21/reince-priebus/polls-show-majority-swing-states-see-hillary-clint/	On the day Hillary Clinton announced her run for president, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus tried to hang an "untrustworthy" label on her. Priebus, the former Wisconsin GOP chairman, made his charges April 12, 2015, on CBS' "Face the Nation." After host Bob Schieffer noted that a national GOP web ad had attacked Clinton two days earlier, there was this exchange with Priebus: Schieffer: Is there a concern that you might, you know, that it might backfire here and make her, you know, people sympathetic to her with all of this starting so soon? Priebus: I don't think so. I mean, she has kind of portrayed this air of inevitability. I think if you look at the facts of the case -- which is where I really would like to stay as chairman of the party -- you know, if you look at the facts of the scandal that surrounds her, you look at the facts of the recent polling -- where a majority of people in battleground states say that she is untrustworthy -- when you look at the fact she has 100 percent name recognition -- Schieffer: A majority -- Priebus: -- majority of the people polled in Colorado, Virginia, Iowa, Florida, said she is untrustworthy. So, Priebus claims that in recent polling a majority of people in battleground states said Clinton is untrustworthy.​ After Schieffer interjected, Priebus singled out Colorado, Virginia, Iowa, Florida. However, as we’ll see, the polling he relies on also surveys two other battleground states. And there is an issue with what pollsters refer to as a plurality, which is not the same as a majority. Poll results breakdown Before jumping into the polling results, we'll note that we rated another Priebus claim about Clinton on the same program as Half True. Priebus said Clinton took "money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen." The monarchies in the first three countries did give money to the Clinton Foundation, but not to her personally. Yemen, which does not have a king, did not. To back Priebus’ polling claim, his office pointed us to the latest swing state surveys from Quinnipiac University Poll. The Hamden, Conn., college regularly polls nationally as well as in what it describes as swing states for the 2016 presidential election. They are the four states Priebus cited, plus Ohio and Pennsylvania. The latest results from Quinnipiac in Colorado, Iowa and Virginia were released April 9, 2015; and the latest results for Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania were released March 31, 2015. All of the people surveyed were self-identified registered voters and the margin of error in each survey is about 3 points. One question was: "Would you say that Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy or not?" Here are the results: State Yes -- Clinton is honest and trustworthy No -- Clinton is not honest and trustworthy Don’t Know or No Answer Colorado 38% 56% 6% Virginia 40% 52% 7% Iowa 43% 49% 8% Florida 41% 50% 9% Pennsylvania 44% 49% 7% Ohio 47% 46% 7% At first glance, it might seem Priebus' claim is largely correct. In five of the six states, more people say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy than say she is. But a closer look shows that in three of the five states that didn't break in Clinton's favor, neither the yes nor the no answer got more than 50 percent. In other words, there was not a majority opinion. And in Ohio, the plurality opinion was, by one point, in Clinton's favor. Before we close we'll note some national polls, done in March or April 2015, that asked the same question or a similar one. In a CNN/Opinion Research Center poll of adults, 50 percent said Clinton is honest and trustworthy and 49 percent said she isn't. In a ABC News/Washington Post poll of adults, 46 percent said she is honest and trustworthy and the same percentage said she isn't. In a CBS News poll of adults, 42 percent said Clinton is honest and trustworthy and 47 percent said she isn’t. A Fox News poll of registered voters asked if "honest" describes Clinton -- 44 percent said yes and 52 percent said no. Our rating Priebus said that in recent polling in battleground states, a "majority of the people" said Hillary Clinton "is untrustworthy," and he went on to cite Colorado, Virginia, Iowa and Florida. But there are two other states -- Ohio and Pennsylvania-- included in the six swing states that are surveyed by Quinnipiac University Poll, which is what Priebus cites to back his claim. In five of the states -- Colorado, Virginia, Iowa and Florida and Pennsylvania -- more people said Clinton is not honest and trustworthy than said she is. However, the percentage reached a majority -- over 50 percent -- in only Colorado and Virginia. Meanwhile, by 47 percent to 46 percent, people polled in Ohio said Clinton is honest and trustworthy. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-07100	On subsidies for ethanol production.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/22/george-allen/george-allen-changes-stance-again-ethanol/	Republican George Allen made headlines in 2005 when he voted for a bill in the U.S. Senate that helped the ethanol industry by mandating greater use of the biofuel in the production of gas. The story was first reported in the Des Moines Register, which noted that Allen "used to be a reliable vote against expanding the ethanol industry." There were two reasons why Iowa’s largest newspaper was interested in the changed position of the Virginia senator. The first concerned the nature of ethanol, a type of alcohol that can be combined with gasoline and burned in engines. Demand for ethanol drives up demand for corn, which is used to produce the alcohol. And no state produces more corn than Iowa. The second reason had to do with politics. Iowa is home to caucuses that make it the first state to weigh in on whom the Democrats and Republicans should nominate for president. And back then, Allen, was giving plenty of thought to a White House bid. The Register wondered whether Allen’s change on ethanol might "have anything to do with the possibility that he may enter the Iowa caucuses and run for president in 2008?" At the time, an Allen spokesman told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the senator’s position had "evolved with technology" which had "made it more practical, more efficient and more affordable to produce biofuels." Some were skeptical of Allen’s conversion. "If you think presidential ambition has nothing to do with it, I’ve got some nice beachfront property in Des Moines to sell you," quipped Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University. Allen made several trips to Iowa in 2006 -- as well as to other key presidential primary states, including New Hampshire. But his national ambitions tumbled later that year when Allen was upset in his reelection bid for the Senate by Democrat Jim Webb. Now, let’s fast forward to 2011. Allen is campaigning hard to regain his old Senate seat next year and seeking to establish his credentials as a fiscal conservative. Although Allen is the favorite to win the GOP nomination, there’s a feisty group of other Republican candidates nipping at his heels. With the United States having maxed out its $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, Congress faces an Aug. 2 deadline to reach a deal that cuts spending and raises the borrowing limit on Uncle Sam’s credit card. And ethanol is a small part of that debate. The Senate this month passed a measure that would end a 45-cent per gallon tax credit to U.S. ethanol refiners and a 54-cent per gallon tariff on imported ethanol. The measure -- pushed by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.-- would save the U.S. about $6 billion a year. Allen applauded the legislation, which still faces a difficult route through Congress. "I have long maintained our biofuel mandates have become unrealistic and drive up the cost of our food and feed," Allen wrote in a June 14 campaign blog. "I commend Senator Coburn’s amendment to end the tax breaks and subsidies for ethanol." Bill Riggs, Allen’s campaign press secretary, said the candidate stopped supporting ethanol subsidies when Congress passed a 2007 mandate for another dramatic increase in production of the biofuel -- from a future goal 8 billion gallons a year to a new objective of 36 billion gallons annually. At that level, Riggs said, ethanol could consume about one-third of the U.S. corn crop. Riggs said Allen’s view in 2005 was that supporting emerging ethanol technology would be a relatively small mandate. But the 2007 bill pushed food and feed prices higher, he said, and was inconsistent with the legislation Allen had supported two years earlier. Allen’s new position caught the attention of one of his opponents for the GOP nomination, Tea Party activist Jamie Radtke. She issued a news release headlined, "George Allen Flip-Flops on Ethanol." The candidate has his reasons for changing his position, but everyone agrees a change occurred. Full Flop!	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2011-06-22T12:23:35	2011-06-14	['None']

pomt-09090	The Tampa Bay Rays' "prices have been judged the most affordable in all of professional sports."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/24/stuart-sternberg/tampa-bay-rays-owner-says-team-most-affordable-spo/	When Stuart Sternberg took control of the Tampa Bay Rays, people told him that in order to improve dismal attendance at the team's games he needed to first build a winner on the field. "People said if you win, they will come,'' Sternberg said. 2008 -- 97 wins and a trip to the World Series. 2009 -- A second consecutive winnning season (just the second in franchise history). 2010 -- The second-best record in baseball through June 22nd's games. Yet attendance is still, well, dismal. The Rays are averaging a little over 22,000 people a night at Tropicana Field in 2010, which places them 10th in the 14-team American League and 23rd out of 30 in Major League Baseball. Despite a winning team. Despite a popular Saturday night concert series. And despite a cheap ticket, the Rays say. The disappointing turnstile receipts played prominently into Sternberg's announcement June 21, 2010, that the team wants to explore options for a new stadium outside St. Petersburg, specifically in Tampa and Hillsborough County. Rays officials are convinced that a new, modern ballpark constructed closer to the region's geographic center could boost attendance by 7,000 to 8,000 fans a game. "We have learned that it's not just about winning," Sternberg said. "It's not about ticket prices. And it certainly isn't about a lack of interest in this team. "Our prices have been judged the most affordable in all of professional sports. Our television ratings have grown dramatically. And our standing in the community has never been higher. Our customers are our fans. We need to be in a location that is convenient for our fans to reach. And we need to be in a place that makes us attractive to the region's businesses and community." Sternberg claims the Rays have done everything to make baseball work in downtown St. Petersburg, including cutting prices to the bottom in all of professional sports. PolitiFact Florida got a call from the bullpen to check it out. The Rays directed us to a 2009 fan survey from ESPN Magazine called the Ultimate Standings. The survey ranks teams in each professional sport (baseball, football, hockey and basketball) in eight different categories. Scores in seven of the eight categories came from 50,000 responses to ESPN.com. An eighth category -- which tried to measure wins versus revenues -- was computed by researchers at the University of Oregon. The results were then weighted to create an overall score. The Rays ranked 16th overall out of 122 professional sports teams. But that's not what we're checking. One of the individual categories was Affordability, and specifically asked fans to rate teams in terms of ticket prices, parking prices and concessions prices. According to ESPN, the Rays ranked No. 2 overall in ticket prices, No. 1 in parking prices and No. 5 in concession prices. That made the Rays the most affordable franchise in all of professional sports, according to the ESPN survey, just like Sternberg said. But we're not sure how much weight the ranking actually should hold. Take parking, where the Rays ranked first. Depending on the game, it costs anywhere from $10 to $25 to park at Tropicana Field. The New York Mets -- who ranked 111th in parking prices in the survey --charge $19 for all games. The San Diego Padres -- who ranked 108th in parking -- charge less than the Rays, between $8 and $15. The NFL's Denver Broncos charge between $20 and $30 to park and rank 68th. Parking is $18 a game for the NBA's Golden State Warriors, which somehow ranks 106th. Now, the Rays point out that if you have four people in your car you can park for free. And we'll point out that if you live in New York, Philadelphia, Boston or Washington, you'll most likely take public transportation meaning you won't have to pay for parking either. We also feel obligated to note that the four people free parking rule only applies to Sunday games and a select other few home dates. The rest of the time, the first 100 cars with four or more will park for free up to an hour before game time. Trying to consider the relative cost of tickets is even more challenging. The Rays charge a different price for the same seat depending on who they are playing and what night of the week the game is on. Baseball, of course, also has a built in advantage because teams play 81 home games a year compared to half that for hockey and basketball and just eight regular-season home games for football (Fewer games means a smaller supply of seats, which translates into higher prices). Still, for the sake of argument, let's see how much it cost to buy an outfield seat at a handful of Thursday's baseball games -- not counting those Ticketmaster fees. Rays vs. San Diego Padres -- $17 Atlanta at Chicago White Sox -- $17 Chicago Cubs at Seattle -- $32 Pittsburgh at Texas -- $30 Florida at Baltimore -- $15 Minnesota at Milwaukee -- $30 San Francisco at Houston -- $18 Of the seven games we looked at, the Rays have the second-cheapest outfield seat available. The team that has the cheapest option, the Baltimore Orioles, ranks 61st in terms of ticket pricing, according to ESPN. And the Brewers, who rank fourth in ticket pricing, have the second-most expensive ticket. Any of that make sense? Doesn't to us either. And here's the point. Sternberg accurately cites an ESPN study in saying that the Rays have been "judged the most affordable (team) in all of professional sports." But we're not sure an ESPN survey of 50,000 fans represents a true picture of the affordability of the Rays, or any of the other 121 professional sports franchises. There are so many variables when it comes to ticket pricing -- be it the opponent or the day of the week -- or parking, or concession prices that it's just hard to make a fair judgment. Because the survey is suspect, we rate Sternberg's statement Mostly True.	None	Stuart Sternberg	None	None	None	2010-06-24T14:16:56	2010-06-21	['None']

pomt-00204	"Leah Vukmir OPPOSES Buy American legislation."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/17/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-delivers-trade-dig-against-vukmir/	International trade has been at the forefront of American political discussion, from billions in tariffs levied in trade disputes to President Donald Trump announcing a replacement for NAFTA, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. In Wisconsin, it has created some strange connections. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat running for re-election, is touting her ‘Buy American’ legislation focused on infrastructure projects. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has backed Baldwin’s efforts. Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir -- Baldwin’s opponent -- has positioned herself as a stalwart Trump supporter, and has Trump’s endorsement. Yet in the midst of this comes a mailer from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin that states: "Leah Vukmir OPPOSES Buy American." What gives? The evidence The Democratic Party mailer features a photo of Baldwin wearing a hardhat while talking to a factory worker, and includes this quote: "My Buy American legislation requires government infrastructure projects to use 100% American iron and steel. Because it’s time America buys what Wisconsin makes." When asked to provide backup for the attack on Vukmir, a spokesman for the state party referred us to Baldwin campaign spokesman Bill Niedhardt. He, in turn, offered this critique: "While Senator Baldwin and President Trump are both backing Buy American bills that support Wisconsin workers and businesses, Leah Vukmir is again siding instead with powerful special interests and the multinational corporations who are blocking these bills." But Niedhardt did not offer any examples of specific votes or statements from Vukmir. That sent us back to the mailer, which included a footnote that pointed to a July 5, 2018, article in the Fond du Lac Reporter. The article was about a visit to the area by Baldwin to tout her "Buy American" measure. From the article: State Sen. Leah Vukmir, a Republican hoping to unseat the former congresswoman, said Baldwin’s proposed policy is not sustainable. "She backs big-labor mandates and giveaways that drive up infrastructure costs for Wisconsin taxpayers," Vukmir said in a statement. "We can’t build roads, no matter where the materials are from, if we can’t afford them in the first place." When we asked Vukmir’s team for more information on her position,a spokesman simply referred us back to the statement quoted in the Fond du Lac Reporter article. So, we looked for additional evidence. Earlier in the campaign, Vukmir said Baldwin "claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words." That framework would suggest Vukmir is pro-Buy American. But really, it focuses on Baldwin (Incidentally, we rated that claim False.) At an Oct. 8, 2018 debate at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the subject of Buy American legislation was raised during a discussion on trade and tariffs. Baldwin touted her Buy American legislation, saying its passage would be "a step in the right direction." Vukmir was not asked about the measure, and didn’t comment on it. She did say Trump "believes in fair trade as do I." But that is off point as well. Meanwhile, we found that a "Made in America" bill was introduced by state Sen. Dave Hansen, D-Green Bay, in 2013 as SB 88, in 2015 as SB 176 SB and in 2017 as SB 240. From the bill description: Under this bill, with limited exceptions, the state must purchase materials that are manufactured to the greatest extent in the United States, regardless of whether all other factors are substantially equal. The bill also requires, with limited exceptions, that a contract for a public works or public improvement project must contain a provision requiring the contractor to use materials that are manufactured in the United States. The bill also creates a similar provision for local governments. Tony Palese, a spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse noted Senate Democrats tried in 2015 to include the bill as an amendment to the state budget. The amendment was defeated 19-14, with the vote tally showing Vukmir voted to table the proposal. That is, to block it from being added to the budget. While Vukmir has not articulated her opposition, some clues can be found in the debate over Baldwin’s bill. An April 21, 2017 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted "Buy America" provisions have historically drawn support from both parties. The article went on to note: "But in Congress, Democrats are generally united in support of them. The other two lead sponsors of Baldwin’s bill are Democrats Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, are more divided. Some conservatives view them as too costly and as distortions of the free market." Our rating A Democratic Party mailer supporting Baldwin and her Buy American proposal said "Leah Vukmir OPPOSES Buy American legislation." Vukmir has been clear in her opposition to Baldwin’s legislation, but the claim is even broader -- that she opposes Buy American legislation in general. We did not find a statement from Vukmir that directly backs that up, but her opposition to "big-labor mandates and giveaways that drive up infrastructure costs" comes close. And at the state level, Vukmir helped vote down a move that would have included "Made in America" provisions in the state budget. We rate the claim True.

pomt-03464	"The Government Accountability Office estimated (Obamacare) will add to the long-term deficit by $6.2 trillion."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/17/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-gao-estimates-obamacare-will-/	U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith says Obamacare will be a drag on the nation’s budget for decades to come. "The Government Accountability Office estimated that it will add to the long-term deficit by $6.2 trillion," Griffith, R-9th, said in a May 16 news release. That eye-popping number, which has been repeated by other Republicans and conservative organizations critical of the health care law, caught our attention. So we checked whether the GAO report really did say the law would put the U.S. another $6.2 trillion into the red. Griffith spokesman Andrea Pivarunas pointed us to a GAO report released in January. The study, requested by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., examined Obamacare’s potential effect on the country’s "primary deficit" -- the gap between spending and revenues that leaves out interest payments on the national debt. The GAO analyzed two vastly different scenarios on Obamacare’s budgetary impact over the next 75 years. One scenario assumed the law would remain intact and that all of its provisions to slow the growth of federal healthcare spending work as intended. In this rosy case, the GAO found that the nation’s deficit, when compared to its Gross Domestic Product, would decrease by 1.5 percent over 75 years. There are good reasons to question whether things will pan out that way. Medicare’s trustees, the CBO and the Office of the Chief Actuary have questioned whether Obamacare’s costs containment measures for healthcare can be sustained over the long term. The law is based on assumptions that mandated productivity gains in health care will spur providers to cut costs. But what happens if the productivity goals are not attainable? To answer that question, the GAO considered a second scenario in which Obamacare’s mandates for expanding health care coverage remained intact, but all of its cost containment measures are phased out starting in 2019. Under that gloomy setting, the report said the nation’s deficit, when compared to GDP, would increase by 0.7 percent over 75 years. We couldn’t find the $6.2 trillion figure Griffith cited anywhere in the report. There was a good reason why. "We did not make such an estimate," emailed Susan Irving, a GAO analyst who co-authored report. The deficit number was computed by Republican staff members on the Senate Budget Committee, where Sessions is the ranking member. The aides compiled the total value country’s GDP over 75 years using data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Those figures show GDP is expected to total $883 trillion between 2011 and 2085. Running that number through the GAO report, 1.5 percent of GDP over 75 years would come to $13.25 trillion. That would be the savings under the rosy scenario. On the other hand, 0.7 percent of GDP over 75 years would total $6.2 trillion. That would be the increased debt under the gloomy scenario. Griffith, in his statement, only mentions the bad scenario. But Irving, the GAO analyst, told us the report does not say whether one outcome or the other is more likely. The study, in fact, states that Obamacare’s long-range impact on the budget "depends" on whether the cost containment measures work, which is unknown. Christopher Conover, an adjunct scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a recent web post that the gloomy scenario is a more realistic for two reasons:1) the cost containment measures may not work and, if they do; 2) Congress will not have not have the political will to continue reforms that become unpopular. Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition, said it’s a "meaningless critique" to judge the health care reform law by that $6.2 trillion figure. "It’s always good to know the worst case scenario, but it doesn’t make sense to criticize a piece of legislation for the worst case scenario," said Gordon, whose group advocates deficit reduction. "The worst case scenario is not what’s enacted." Gordon said although there are concerns that some of the containment measures may not work, "that’s very different than saying all of them at once will not work and thus the deficit will increase by ‘X’ amount." Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who supports Obamacare, was perplexed by Griffith’s statement. "Why one would say that the (health care reform law) is unbalanced because one runs estimates of a program that differs from the (health care reform law) escapes me entirely," he said. Our ruling Griffith said the GAO estimated Obamacare will add $6.2 trillion to deficits over the next 75 years. That figure isn’t in the GAO report that Griffith’s office cited. Republicans came up with the number by adding reasonable computations to a worst-case scenario laid out by the GAO early this year. Griffith failed to mention that the report also contained a rosy scenario showing Obamacare could substantially reduce long-term deficits.

pomt-14744	Regarding the USA Freedom Act, "There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/16/marco-rubio/rubio-and-cruz-spar-over-domestic-surveillance-pro/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz went head to head over the government’s bulk phone data collection program at the Dec. 15 Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas. The domestic surveillance program allowed the National Security Agency to secretly access the metadata of millions of phone calls; it was made public by government contractor Edward Snowden. Congress curtailed the program and it officially shut down just days before the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Ruibo says it has limited the government’s ability to fight terrorism. On the debate stage, Cruz defended his position. He said the replacement law, the USA Freedom Act, not only respects civil liberties by stopping the government from automatically collecting bulk data, but it also expands the government’s ability to gather terrorists’ phone records. "The old program covered 20 to 30 percent of phone numbers to search for terrorists," Cruz said. "The new program covers nearly 100 percent. That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism, and he knows that’s the case." Rubio responded, "Let me be very careful when answering this, because I don’t think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information, so let me just be very clear: There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before." That’s a pretty stark difference --- Cruz says we’ll have access to many more phone numbers, and Rubio says this bill doesn’t do anything new. We decided to focus on Rubio’s statement. Bigger pool, fewer fish Prior to the USA Freedom Act, major phone companies like Verizon and AT&T would steadily hand over all of their phone records to the NSA, which maintained a massive database. The records include information like the location of a call, phone numbers involved and the length of the call, but not the content or audio. Intelligence workers could then run a phone number with terrorist ties through the database to find out who they called and when. The USA Freedom Act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies. If the government wants to look at a suspected terrorist’s call data, they must first get a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which operates in secret. Interestingly, the old program wasn’t as sweeping as you might have thought. It turns out the NSA only collected about 20 percent of all call data, missing the vast majority of cell phone records, according to intelligence officials and first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. The NSA faced technical challenges in collecting cell phone and Internet phone data, in part due to the major shift away from landlines. To remedy this, the new law is "technology neutral," said Jeffrey Vagle, executive director of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Under the law, the NSA can compel any phone company to provide records in whatever format the government desires, per the warrant. Before, there were some limits on how responsive phone companies had to be. The law also allows for a much wider breadth of information that the NSA can request; it just can’t collect this data in bulk. To steal an analogy from policy managers at Access Now, a technology advocacy group, "Basically, there is a bigger ocean they can fish in, but they collect far fewer fish." So if we are directly comparing the old bulk data collection program to the new program established by the Freedom Act, the government has more tools to access a larger array of records -- cutting against Rubio’s point that "there is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before." However, there is a grain of truth to what Rubio is saying: The government always had some ability to obtain cell phone records to a certain extent, just not through the old bulk data collection program, said Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. The main difference now is that the government is working with the carriers to obtain those records more efficiently. "If you're just narrowly comparing the bulk program with its direct replacement, it’s true it will cover more types of records," Sanchez said. "But it's also true that there's no new legal authority to get records that were previously unavailable to the government." Vagle said it’s possible that the government could have collected cell phone records through existing avenues, such as emergency request approval by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the 1981 Executive Order 12333, which expanded intelligence-gathering abilities. He added that many tech and security experts think the idea that the government only collected 20 percent of phone records is likely an underestimate. "Cruz was correct in comparing the USA Freedom Act to the unmodified Patriot Act (the old bulk collection program)," Vagle said. "But if you look at the entire set of tools available to the intelligence community, Rubio was probably correct." Speaking of Cruz and Rubio together, Sanchez said, "they’re both sort of right and both sort of wrong." Our ruling Rubio said, regarding the USA Freedom Act, "There is nothing we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before." Rubio was responding to a point by Cruz that the Freedom Act makes it possible for the government to access a much bigger pool of phone records. Whereas the old bulk phone data collection program wasn’t very good at collecting cell phone and Internet phone records, the Freedom Act establishes parameters that make this more feasible. However, it’s not like the government couldn’t access these records at all before, they just couldn’t do it through the bulk collection program. The law did not give the government a brand-new legal authority, it just helps to streamline the record collection process. We rate Rubio’s claim Half True.

pomt-09564	“Under (Rick Perry’s) watch as governor, over six million Texans have no health care coverage, including one million children, homeowners suffer from the highest insurance rates in the country, and college tuition has skyrocketed 136 percent.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/29/democratic-national-committee/national-democrats-say-gov-perry-has-watched-over-/	It’s no surprise when Democrats criticize the Republican governor of Texas. For instance, Democratic National Committee spokesman Ricardo Ramirez reacted to Gov. Rick Perry’s recent criticism of President Obama by saying Perry had himself to blame for problems in Texas. Ramirez elaborated in a Jan. 20 press release: “Under (Perry’s) watch as governor, over 6 million Texans have no health care coverage, including 1 million children, homeowners suffer from the highest insurance rates in the country and college tuition has skyrocketed 136 percent from 2003 to 2008.” Did Ramirez's punches hit home? We revisited his left-right, left-right combination. Ramirez and Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, each pointed us to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of U.S. Census data suggesting that in 2008, 6,023,000 Texans lacked health insurance—placing the state second only to California, which had more than 6.7 million residents lacking coverage. More than 1.4 million Texas children were uninsured in 2008, the foundation estimates. The state had the most uninsured children in the nation that year; California ran second with more than 1.1 million uninsured children. The Democratic spokesman didn’t forward evidence for his next jab, that Texans pay the nation’s highest home insurance rates. Jerry Hagins, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, said homeowners' insurance costs more in Texas because the state is exposed to severe weather in the form of hurricanes and tornadoes and hail. “Texas is high (in its rates) and will always be high,” Hagins said. “We don’t want to sugar-coat that.” Indeed, the state's rates often top those of other states, as compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In its latest report, based on 2007 data, the rates for Texas were second only to those in Florida. In general, home insurance rates historically run highest in Texas, Florida and Louisiana because they’re big states with vast coastal exposures, said Michael Barry, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, a New York group funded by the insurance industry. “Homeowner insurance prices in these states reflect the risks of losses there,” Barry said. Barry suggested Texas may rise to No. 1 in the next annual compilation of rates when the data from 2008 -- the year Hurricane Ike slammed Texas -- is absorbed. One wrinkle: The NAIC and Texas insurance department caution against comparing the Texas statistics to those from other states--partly because fewer Texas homeowners carry the comprehensive coverage highlighted in the compilation and partly because calculations for some states, such as Florida and Louisiana, don't take into account the rates paid on policies from state-guided providers of last resort. Those providers offer insurance coverage when it's not available from private insurers. By its own calculations — which differ from the national report — the Texas department found that homeowners here don't necessarily fare worse than residents of some other states. The average annual Texas premium in 2007 was $1,251--less than the $1,401 average premium in Louisiana and $1,560 in Florida (though the Florida average excludes policies written by the state's insurer of last resort). What about Ramirez’s last punch, on college tuition? Ramirez cited a state overview stating that tuition set by public college and university boards increased 136 percent on average from fall 2003 to fall 2008. But the same analysis states that total tuition, meaning board-set tuition levels added to baseline amounts set by lawmakers, increased 69 percent on average. Separately, the Austin American-Statesman’s Ralph K.M. Haurwitz, who covers higher education, has tapped state figures to conclude that average tuition and mandatory fees — every student faces such fees — at the state’s public universities climbed 86 percent, to $6,300 a year, by fall 2008. All in all, the Democratic spokesman landed his health-insurance blows. But he slipped when he claimed Texas currently has the nation's highest home insurance rates and overshot on changes in tuition. We rate Ramirez’s statement Half True.

pomt-12680	Says "the New York Times wrote about" Barack Obama wiretapping Donald Trump during the election.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-learned-obama-tapped-his-phon/	When President Donald Trump tweeted on March 4 that former President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap on his phones during the election, he didn’t turn to the federal intelligence agencies for proof. Instead, he says he got it straight from the "failing" New York Times. In a March 15 interview, Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked Trump why he didn’t ask the agencies about any possible surveillance on him or his campaign before tweeting about it, given that the White House appears to have no evidence to backup his claims. "Well, because the New York Times wrote about it," Trump replied. "Not that I respect the New York Times. I call it the ‘failing’ New York Times. But they did write on Jan. 20, using the word ‘wiretap.’ " The New York Times report does use the word "wiretap;" the print headline was "Wiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides." It doesn’t appear that Trump read the article closely, however, because it does not say Obama personally ordered a tap on his phones during the election, as Trump claimed in his tweet. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The New York Times article is about intercepted communications used by the FBI amid its investigation into some of Trump’s current and former aides — including Roger Stone, Carter Page and Paul Manafort — and their ties to Russia. It does not say whether the surveillance targeted Russians or Americans. Nor does it say Trump and his campaign were under investigation or surveillance. In fact, the author stipulates: "It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself." The difference between the substance of the New York Times article and what Trump claimed in his tweet is significant, because Trump’s tweet alleges Obama possibly acted outside the law to harm a political opponent, whereas the New York Times described aspects of an FBI investigation. A president cannot unilaterally order surveillance on an American citizen. The FBI would have to obtain a warrant from a judge first, and to do that, investigators would need to have a suspicion based in evidence that Trump might have committed a crime. As president, Trump could find out whether a court ever issued such a warrant. Congress has asked FBI Director James Comey for any evidence that a warrant was requested, issued or denied. In his interview with Carlson, Trump also mentioned a Fox News segment with host Bret Baier as a source. However, that segment — and a few more news articles the White House has provided as evidence — discusses unproven allegations that the FBI requested warrants to surveil Trump associates. It does not back up Trump’s accusation that Obama personally ordered a wiretap on Trump for political sabotage. Our ruling Trump said "the New York Times wrote about" Obama wiretapping him during the election. The New York Times article Trump references says the FBI has used intercepted communications in its investigation of several Trump associates and their ties to Russia. It does not say Obama ordered this surveillance, nor does it say Trump’s own phones were tapped or that he was under surveillance in any way.

pomt-00118	"Under Scott Walker, the Department of Corrections has only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders" and "there are nearly 3,000 sex offenders that are unaccounted for."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/29/tony-evers/ad-challenger-tony-evers-slams-gov-scott-walker-se/	The topic of sex offenders is a hot button issue in any year. In an election year? Crank the rhetoric up to 11. In Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has used several ads to hammer Democratic challenger Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent, about a case involving a Madison-area middle school teacher viewing pornography at school. In return, the Evers campaign released an ad slamming the state Department of Corrections under Walker. The ad stars former Corrections Secretary Ed Wall, who was appointed to the post by Walker. "Under Scott Walker, the Department of Corrections has only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders" and "there are nearly 3,000 sex offenders that are unaccounted for," Wall says in the ad for Evers. Wall is one of four former officials in Walker’s administration who have publicly denounced the governor as he seeks a third term. Is he right? In the ad, as Wall speaks, his words are echoed by snippets from a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article that appear on the screen. The footnote says the story ran Sept. 18, 2017, but there is no such story on that date. Instead, Evers campaign deputy communications director Britt Cudaback pointed to an Aug. 27, 2018, Journal Sentinel article and the Aug. 21, 2018, Legislative Reference Bureau report cited in the article. The article does note there are more than 25,000 sex offenders on the registry, but the characterization of 3,000 as "unaccounted for" comes from a Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Sondy Pope, not the report itself. And that number has problems. So does the notion there are only 18 people tracking all 25,000 offenders. Let’s dig in. How many offenders? In response to a request from Pope, D-Cross Plains, the Legislative Reference Bureau released its Aug. 21, 2018, report, titled "Sex Offender Registrants, August 2018." According to the report: As of Aug. 20, 2018, of the 25,159 offenders on the state's sex offender registry, 16,219 were considered "compliant" and 2,735 were considered non-compliant. That’s where the "nearly 3,000 unaccounted for" phrase comes from. According to Department of Corrections regulations, an offender is classified non-compliant if he or she, for instance, has reported an incorrect address to the department or they haven't updated their place of employment with the state. Among those who were non-compliant, the report found a much smaller number, 308, had absconded. That is, according to the reference bureau analysis, they were refusing to keep in touch with DOC agents. That’s a vital distinction. It’s that smaller group that could more correctly be described as "unaccounted for." Corrections department spokesman Tristan Cook said "generally, even if a sex offender is not compliant, we know exactly where they are living and working and are waiting for them to provide updated or missing information required by state statute." Many, he said, will quickly respond once they are told the information is out of date or missing. Cook cited a more recent count, as of Oct. 22, 2018, that showed 25,205 registered sex offenders. Of those: -- 6,205 (approximately 25 percent) are incarcerated, generally in an adult prison. -- 5,856 (approximately 23 percent) are supervised by a probation or parole agent. -- 13,144 (approximately 52 percent) who have completed supervision requirements. Cook said that in 2017 the department referred 709 cases of non-compliance to local district attorneys for possible prosecution. Those cases, he said, represent those who knowingly or intentionally refused to provide required information. So far in 2018, the department has referred 510 such cases. Who is tracking the offenders? Perhaps the more important number in the claim is the idea that there are only 18 people tracking all 25,000 sex offenders. The first thing to note is that roughly half of that number are either in prison or on probation. So, clearly there are more than 18 people involved in tracking them. According to Cook, there are more than 4,000 members of the security staff in the prisons and more than 1,100 probation and parole agents. Another 500 Department of Health Services employees work at the Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center, which houses the program for sexually violent offenders. Additionally, there are 90 corrections employees who staff an around-the-clock electronic monitoring center. Where does the 18 figure come from? There are 18 "sex offender registration specialists," whose job it is to work to keep sex offenders in compliance. So, the 18 is a real number -- but the ad claims those 18 are the only ones responsible for monitoring all 25,000 sex offenders. That’s way off base. Our rating The Evers ad claims that "under Scott Walker, the Department of Corrections has only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders" and "there are nearly 3,000 sex offenders that are unaccounted for." But the ad uses real numbers to create distortions. There are 18 sex offender registration specialists, but thousands more are involved in keeping tabs on the 25,000 offenders -- many of whom are still behind bars. There are nearly 3,000 offenders deemed "non-compliant," but that is different than "unaccounted for." A report offered a much smaller figure for those who had absconded -- that is, were refusing to keep in touch with DOC agents. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-04535	"Bob Menendez actually voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times!"	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/30/joseph-kyrillos/joe-kyrillos-campaign-claims-bob-menendez-voted-fa/	When is a vote not a vote? It depends on who’s doing the counting, apparently. And with about five weeks to Election Day on Nov. 6, the issue of tax hikes is one of the latest volleys in the heated Bob Menendez-Joe Kyrillos campaign for U.S. Senate. The Kyrillos campaign, for example, claims Menendez, a Democrat, has never met a tax increase he didn’t like – and support. "Bob Menendez actually voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times!" states an Aug. 29 news release posted on a campaign website for Kyrillos, a Republican from Monmouth County. "These are direct votes against tax cuts as well as votes to raise taxes, votes in favor of reducing proposed tax cuts, votes for non-binding resolutions supporting taxes, among others," Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin said in an e-mail that included a list of 72 Menendez votes. The Kyrillos campaign’s claim has a degree of accuracy, but there’s some important context missing. Our analysis of the 72 shows that in many cases, Menendez’s votes support or give tax breaks to the middle class by reducing or eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy and big business. Many of Menendez’s votes were for education, needy children, agriculture, the environment and the disabled. Still others were for national security and safety. But there are some issues with those votes. More than half of the 72 do not actually change tax policy or law. Others have to do with procedural rules for voting, which also cannot change law. Let’s look at two examples. Menendez in 2006 voted to increase a congressional spending limit by $965 million to put more money toward port security. That money would be offset by ending certain corporate tax breaks. In 2011, Menendez voted to end debate on a bill asking those earning $1 million or more to make "meaningful contributions" to help reduce the deficit. That procedure then allows an immediate vote. For some, the senator’s intent is key. "This is not to take a partisan side either way but I would think most people reading about a record like this would ask the simple question, what the intent of the person was casting the vote, besides what the actual outcome was," said Pete Sepp, a spokesman with the National Taxpayers Union in Alexandria, Va. The NTU advocates for lower taxes and smaller government. Seth Hanlon, director of fiscal reform for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund, had context concerns. "This controversy that they’re having here is, if you get past the semantics, it’s basically about whose tax cuts we’re talking about: Tax cuts for the middle class he supports very consistently or supporting tax breaks for very wealthy people, millionaires, oil companies, corporate tax breaks," Hanlon said. "We need to look through the semantics and look at the record on middle class tax cuts." Paul Brubaker, Menendez’s communications director, said the vote list shows Menendez’s support for siding with the middle class over millionaires and corporate special interests. And there’s another issue to consider: is voting against a tax benefit for one group in order to fund a tax break for another group the same as a tax increase? That’s the case for many of the resolutions that can’t change tax law. PolitiFact National addressed that question in an August fact-check about a U.S. Senate race in Florida in which the Republican incumbent accused his Democratic challenger of voting 150 times to raise taxes. Our colleagues spoke with a few federal budget experts who generally agreed that a vote against a tax cut doesn’t equal a tax increase. Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, disagreed. "All of the votes we cite are votes in favor of higher taxes," he said in an e-mail. Our ruling The Kyrillos campaign claims in a news release that "Bob Menendez actually voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times!" More than half of the votes cited by the Kyrillos campaign have no effect on tax law or are procedural matters. There also are Menendez votes that give or extend tax breaks to the middle class at the expense of the wealthy and corporations – but federal budget experts have said that a tax break for one group isn’t the same as a tax increase for another. Menendez did vote in favor of bills that would mean higher taxes, so there’s an element of truth to the claim. But since so many of the bills would have no effect on tax law or policy, that’s a critical fact that would give a different impression – and that meets the definition for Mostly False.

pomt-13364	"If you look at any real analysis," the Trans-Pacific Partnership is "going to generate better-paying jobs that are more stable."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2016/sep/30/kasim-reed/atlanta-mayor-cherry-picks-numbers-make-point-trad/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been tapped by President Barack Obama to help sell the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The partnership, or TPP as it is commonly called, is a complex — and controversial — trade agreement that is meant to reduce barriers to trade in Pacific Rim countries while curbing China’s influence in the area. Supporters say it would boost the U.S. economy. Critics counter that it would lower wages, cost jobs and hurt American workers. In a joint press conference held Sept. 16 with Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the White House, Reed said: "The bottom line is, if you look at any real analysis, this bill is going to generate better-paying jobs that are more stable." We can’t check whether the trade deal will create jobs and economic stability, but we can check whether Reed is accurate when he states that "any real analysis" projects that specific outcome. PolitiFact decided to take a look and found that some studies back up the mayor’s assertion, while others paint a different picture. The TPP, which still needs to be passed by Congress, would lower tariffs and reduce regulations between 12 countries — the United States, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Reed’s role in advocating for the TPP puts him in a delicate political position. He is a major supporter and surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who now opposes the agreement. PolitiFact rated her position on the issue a Flip Flop. "I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership," Clinton said at a recent Ohio campaign stop, according to the Los Angeles Times. PolitiFact Georgia reached out to Reed to find out how he came to his conclusion. Reed’s director of communications, Anne Torres, said the mayor was alluding to a Commerce Department blog post on the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement around 2014: "At the same time that we were experiencing the longest streak of job growth, we also experienced a record year when it came to export-supported jobs: more than 11.7 million. This number includes the 2.8 million jobs supported by the exports to our North American Free Trade Agreement partners Canada and Mexico. And we know those export supported jobs pay 13 to 18% higher wages than non-export supported jobs." The blog post says similar, positive effects could be felt by TPP countries by 2030. PolitiFact looked at six studies on the impact the agreement could have on jobs. Like politicians, research institutions are divided on the issue. Clinton said she changed her stance on the issue because the current agreement wasn’t the original version she supported as secretary of state. The 800-page report by the U.S. International Trade Commission estimates an increase in wages and 128,000 new jobs. The Brookings Institution, which has argued in favor of the TPP, says the agreement will increase service-sector jobs. Much of the pushback, including from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, centers on the loss of manufacturing jobs to other countries through free trade. U.S. manufacturing accounts for about 9 percent of jobs in America. Since Obama took office, there’s been a net loss of about 95,000 manufacturing jobs. The conservative group Americans for Tax Reform’s analysis found "more than 1 in 5 American jobs are tied to trade, and these workers earn 16 percent more than jobs in industries not tied to trade." The group has said the TPP is a step in the right direction but needs work. To further address the "better paying" part of Reed’s quote, a study by Johns Hopkins University and the East-West Center estimated the agreement would raise U.S. real incomes by 0.5 percent by 2030. Median household income grew 5.2 percent in 2015 in the U.S., an upward swing that hadn’t been seen in years. Finally, the labor-supporting Economic Policy Institute says, "this deal will lead to more job loss and downward pressures on the wages of most working Americans." This analysis is neither stable nor high-paying. Measuring stability The stability of jobs that could be created by the TPP is another issue. Some studies, including one cited by Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, predict a loss of jobs. This loss of half a million jobs is a notable number cited in the TPP debate. A study by Tufts University found 448,000 jobs could be lost under the agreement, though this is the largest number of job losses reported. PolitiFact rated this half-a-million job loss Half True when it was cited by Sanders. Dean Baker, co-director at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the near-half-a-million figure "wouldn’t be my best guess, but it’s not an obviously ridiculous number." But Baker notes the gains and losses go both ways. While trade deals open markets, the U.S. imports more than it exports. Our ruling Reed said, "If you look at any real analysis," the Trans-Pacific Partnership is "going to generate better-paying jobs that are more stable."

pomt-00290	"As hundreds of North Carolinians face long lines at DMV offices around the state, Governor Cooper created a secret DMV office just for his friends."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/27/north-carolina-republican-party/nc-gop-mostly-wrong-about-secret-dmv-created-coope/	The North Carolina Republican Party blasted Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper last month over reports that the state Division of Motor Vehicles opened a special-access driver’s license office exclusively for state employees. "As hundreds of North Carolinians face long lines at DMV offices around the state, Governor Cooper created a secret DMV office just for his friends," the NCGOP said in an Aug. 28 Facebook post, which linked to an original report from WBTV in Charlotte. We were intrigued by the statement, which received more than 275 shares on Facebook, so we decided to take a look for ourselves. According to the WBTV report, the DMV had been running a driver’s license office from its Raleigh headquarters building since January. The office was not open to the public, and a sign outside said, "No driver license or ID issued at this location." The so-called "model office" was located in a training room where staffers test new equipment. It opened for a few days each month between January and August, but access to it was limited to state employees who received a sign-up invitation by email, as well as their family and friends, the WBTV report said. Several "senior employees" from Cooper’s office were among those who had scheduled 20-minute appointments, according to the WBTV report. These quick appointments would have been desirable to the public, because there have been significant lines at DMV offices across the state. On Aug. 8, DMV Commissioner Torre Jessup told The News & Observer the long wait times were due to residents seeking Real IDs before October 2022, when the federal government is set to begin requiring stricter identification to board commercial flights. WBTV reported that DMV spokesman John Brockwell originally denied that the special-access office existed, and a security guard told a WBTV reporter wearing a hidden camera that the office was reserved for state employees. WRAL News later reported that Jessup said it was not a secret or "something we are hiding." In another video from CBS17, Jessup told reporter Michael Hyland there was "nothing secret about it," and that the office was not open to the public because it was "behind secure doors." A DMV statement explaining the office likened it to temporary "mobile units" the DMV set up for large employers across the state. The statement said both practices represented "targeted outreach as part of an effort to get REAL IDs to North Carolinians who need them ahead of the federal deadline." Defining 'secret' The statement also said the office had closed. But Jeff Hauser, communications director for the state GOP, pointed out in an email interview that it "had been used for months and seemingly had no intention of being shut down until the story broke." Hauser said the "description (secret) comes from the multiple news stories about the office itself as well as the Merriam-Webster definition." He noted that the dictionary defines as secret anything "kept from knowledge or view," "marked by the habit of discretion," "revealed only to the initiated" or "not acknowledged." The office was not advertised or accessible to the public. It opened for a few days each month to state employees who received an email invitation and their family and friends, and Brockwell, the DMV spokesman, did not originally acknowledge it, according to the WBTV report. So at least on the surface, the office does seem to satisfy multiple definitions of the word secret. But Ford Porter, press secretary for the governor’s office, said the evidence suggests otherwise. "It isn’t a secret if you’re mass emailing and calling all state government," he said. "That suggests to me that it was a little bit more open than not." Intended use Nicole Meister, director of communications for the state Department of Transportation, explained that the office was not suitable for public use. "It’s by no means an actual office," she said, adding that it was several floors upstairs and in a training room filled with testing equipment. "We did not put out a press release opening it up to the general public because it’s not a setup that can accommodate the general public," she said. "Not only is there security that you have to go through, but you have to line through hallways to go up to a fifth floor and it’s a small kind of two offices that are one." After communicating with all state agencies to as part of its Real ID outreach, the DMV extended model-office invitations first to its own staff and DOT employees, Meinster said. But then multiple state agencies asked for mobile units like the ones sent to major corporations, so the DMV decided to extend the invitation to employees at some of those agencies, as well. "The vast majority of those to get their Real ID at the training office were rank and file state employees," Meister said. The state agencies that received invitations to the model office included the departments of public safety, agriculture, cultural resources, military and veteran affairs and revenue, as well as the Office of State Human Resources, Meister said. Meister and Porter said the Office of State Human Resources shared information about the model office with the governor’s office. Reducing wait times This was all meant to speed up the dissemination of Real IDs. "It was open to any state employee, but those are also people that you’re keeping out of DMV lines at other offices," Meister said. "That was the thought process behind it." And who was behind that thought process? Meister said the idea for the model office came from a DMV committee’s brainstorming session about ways to accommodate more people who wanted Real IDs. "This had nothing to do with the governor’s office," she said, adding that the training room itself has been around since 1996. "This was DMV employees just talking about how can we get people signed up to get their Real IDs," she said. We found no other evidence to suggest Cooper was directly behind the office’s creation, even though some workers from his office took advantage of the setup. At the same time, however, Jessup and the DMV are overseen by Transportation Secretary Jim Trogdon, who is a member of Cooper’s cabinet. "Cooper is responsible for his employees’ actions," said Hauser. Still, the office was not reserved "just for (Cooper’s) friends." The DMV sent invitations to state employees of various state agencies in the same way that it provided employees of private companies special access to temporary mobile units, according to the DMV statement. "They reached out to every agency, not just the ones that the Cooper administration oversees," Porter said. "The governor didn’t create it, and it wasn’t exclusive to the office (of the governor) or any of his friends." Meister also said both Cooper and his wife obtained Real IDs at regular DMV license offices. Our ruling The NCGOP Facebook account said, "As hundreds of North Carolinians face long lines at DMV offices around the state, Governor Cooper created a secret DMV office just for his friends." The statement referred to an office first reported by WBTV that offered quick appointments for state employees and their associates. The office was not acknowledged, open or advertised to the public, but Meister said that was because it could not accommodate the general public. The DMV commissioner falls under the leadership of the Cooper administration, but Porter said Cooper did not play any direct role in the office’s creation, and we found no evidence to suggest otherwise. Plus, the DMV granted access to the office to state employees from several different agencies, not just Cooper’s friends. The state GOP’s claim makes it sound like Cooper opened a special office just for his closest buddies so they could avoid long lines. But the model office’s creation was not that nefarious, even if it was kept secret. Overall, the state GOP’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13989	Says it's not true that Florida black bears are an "apex predator."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/08/stacy-white/florida-black-bears-arent-apex-predators-hillsboro/	A Hillsborough County commissioner who opposes declaring open season on Florida black bears said the animals aren’t the threat hunting advocates make them out to be. Stacy White, a self-proclaimed "avid outdoorsman" who hunts, backed a resolution to symbolically oppose a state-sanctioned bear hunt in Florida this year. The commission approved the resolution 6-0 at its June 2 meeting. The state will decide June 22 whether to allow another hunt. Some opponents of the measure had spoken in favor of a bear hunt. Phil Walters of GatorGuides.com said Hillsborough County didn’t need to pass the resolution, because the county didn’t even have a black bear population. But commissioners ran that risk if there was no bear hunt. "Do you really want bears being brought into this county?" Walters asked. "If you think you’ve got problems with wildlife now, wait until you have a top apex predator in close proximity to people." White later responded by saying Walters had mischaracterized bears as apex predators — meaning they are at the very top of the food chain. "One of the folks that spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting called the Florida black bear a top apex predator. That is absolutely, unequivocally false," White said. He followed up with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (or FWC) statistics that said a black bear’s diet "usually consists of 80 percent plants, 15 percent insects and 5 percent animal matter." White told PolitiFact Florida he meant apex predator in the figurative sense, to refute what he saw as Walters’ implication that bears may hunt down humans. Bears "certainly don’t actively hunt animal prey," White told us. He has a point there, bear experts said, but using the term "apex predator" largely depends on how it’s being applied. Bear complexities Florida’s black bear population had dwindled to 300 some four decades ago before the species was protected and hunting was outlawed. In 2012, the FWC removed bears from the "threatened" list as their numbers rebounded. Recent estimates say there are about 4,350 bears statewide today. As more people moved into bear habitat, the state fielded thousands of complaints about them hanging out in hot tubs, swinging in hammocks and raiding garbage bins. Then, beginning in 2013, bears attacked and mauled four women. That led to a decision in 2015 to schedule the first hunt in 21 years as a way to control the population. A 320-bear limit was set for the weeklong hunt, but the state shut it down after just two days when permitted hunters had killed 304 bears. Among the reasons bears venture into populated areas (beyond loss of habitat and increased numbers) is that bears are omnivores, and will eat just about anything they can find — including what’s in humans’ garbage cans, barbecue grills and pet-food dishes. Their diet mostly includes berries, acorns, grasses, seeds, plant shoots, and even moss and ferns. If they do eat other animals, many times they are of the six-legged variety, such as ants, wasps and beetles. If a bear digs into a beehive, chances are they want the bees and not their honey. Bears also will eat the odd armadillo or possum, but often those are scavenged from already dead carcasses. Playing dead is not a safe way to avoid being eaten by a bear. "Bears definitely are carnivores and predators. Whether they are a ‘top predator’ is open to one’s perspective," said Thomas Eason, the FWC’s director of wildlife and habitat conservation. "That connotation is not commonly used in the scientific arena for black bears." That leads to an interesting juxtaposition: Bears are, by the standard definition, apex predators. They’re at the top of the food chain, and practically nothing can or would even try to kill an adult bear for food. But how you use the term apex predator matters, too. "If you are thinking about apex predators being a danger to people that they might see as food, as a polar bear might, then black bears are not a big issue," University of Florida wildlife biologist Bill Giuliano said. "However, their omnivorous tendencies and ability to live in close proximity to people is a concern." Bears don’t look to hunt people down, as the term apex predator may evoke, but events can potentially turn sour quickly if they are around people. If bears, especially a sow with cubs, get startled or cornered (perhaps by a dog you’ve let out of the house), they will try to escape. That escape route may be through you. In that case, we asked, what could kill a 300-pound adult black bear, short of hitting it with a car? "Nothing besides a bullet," Giuliano said. Our ruling White said it's not true that Florida black bears are an "apex predator." That’s overstating the case a little bit. Experts said bears are apex predators in the sense that nothing in their ecosystem naturally hunts them for food. Bears are definitely capable of injuring or even killing someone, but they don’t normally seek out humans. Bears are omnivorous, and any interaction between hungry bears and people most often involves the bear getting caught rooting in the trash.

pomt-04739	Says President Barack Obama broke his promise to keep a Wisconsin GM plant from closing.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/29/paul-ryan/did-barack-obama-break-promise-keep-gm-plant-open/	If the hometown of Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has had an icon during his lifetime, it was a sprawling General Motors auto assembly plant. For decades, the Janesville, Wis., plant gave thousands of people a comfortable living. In 1970, the year Ryan was born, it employed 7,000. Ryan stirred memories of the factory on Aug. 16, 2012, attacking President Barack Obama during a campaign speech in Ohio. "I remember President Obama visiting it when he was first running, saying he'll keep that plant open. One more broken promise," Ryan said. He made the same point Aug. 29 during his speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa: "My home state voted for President Obama," he said. "When he talked about change, many people liked the sound of it, especially in Janesville, where we were about to lose a major factory. "A lot of guys I went to high school with worked at that GM plant. Right there at that plant, candidate Obama said: 'I believe that if our government is there to support you … this plant will be here for another hundred years.' That’s what he said in 2008. Well, as it turned out, that plant didn’t last another year. It is locked up and empty to this day. And that’s how it is in so many towns today, where the recovery that was promised is nowhere in sight." Did Obama make such a promise as a candidate and break it after becoming president? Actually, the plant closed before he even took office. The plant In 1918, General Motors bought a farm implement manufacturing plant in Janesville, a city of 60,000 near the Illinois border. Production of Chevrolets began there in 1923. Employment peaked at 7,100 in 1978, but a series of five layoffs occurred over the next 30 years. By December 2008, when President George W. Bush authorized nearly $14 billion in loans to General Motors and Chrysler, both of which were near financial collapse, GM had already warned it might close the Janesville plant because of sagging sport-utility vehicle sales. The plant was effectively shut down on Dec. 23, 2008, when GM ceased production of SUVs there and laid off 1,200 workers. (Several dozen workers stayed on another four months to finish an order of small- to medium-duty trucks for Isuzu Motors.) So, the plant closed while Bush was still in office, about a month before Obama was inaugurated. Ryan's evidence We asked Kevin Seifert, spokesman for Ryan's U.S. House campaign, for evidence that Obama promised to keep the Janesville plant open and failed. (Ryan will be on the November 2012 ballot both for his House seat and as Mitt Romney's running mate.) Seifert cited this portion of a February 2008 campaign speech then-Sen. Obama gave at the Janesville plant: "And I believe that if our government is there to support you, and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition, that this plant will be here for another hundred years. The question is not whether a clean energy economy is in our future, it’s where it will thrive. I want it to thrive right here in the United States of America; right here in Wisconsin; and that’s the future I’ll fight for as your president." That's a statement of belief that, with government help, the Janesville plant could remain open -- but not a promise to keep it open. Seifert also referred us to Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the Romney-Ryan campaign. Buck cited a Detroit News article on the same speech, saying the article made clear that "it was the takeaway from the event that (Obama) was pledging to keep the plant open if he got his bailout." That might have been Buck's interpretation. But the article reported that Obama, who later provided an $80 billion auto bailout, had pledged to help keep the Janesville plant and others like it "viable." That's not quite the same thing as pledging keep the Janesville plant open. We find nothing in the article that he explicitly promised to keep it open. Our rating Ryan said Obama broke his promise to keep a Wisconsin GM plant from closing. But we don't see evidence he explicitly made such a promise -- and more importantly, the Janesville plant shut down before he took office. We rate Ryan's statement False.

pomt-06064	Says that after she declared her candidacy for Congress, "the redistricting process was manipulated to allow incumbent politicians to guarantee their re-election."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/10/nina-turner/nina-turner-says-redistricting-process-was-manipul/	Oh, what might have been. In November, State Sen. Nina Turner filed signatures to challenge U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge in this year’s Democratic primary. Within days, Fudge responded with her own declaration -- and she was joined by a posse of heavyweight Democrats to underscore her incumbent strength. Turner vowed to soldier on against what she called "The Club." But things changed. Specifically, the primary -- penciled in for June because of a dispute over new congressional boundaries -- was moved to March 6 after state lawmakers reached a deal. For the underdog Turner, that meant two fewer months to engineer an upset. So on Dec. 30, the deadline to file for the earlier primary, Turner announced she was abandoning her bid against Fudge. And in her words, a quicker campaign was only half the problem. "Last month, I filed to run for Congress with the intention to take on the status quo and give voters an opportunity for change. Since then, two things have happened," Turner said in an emailed statement. "First, the redistricting process was manipulated to allow incumbent politicians to guarantee their re-election. And, the primary election was set for March 6, 2011, a date which gives challengers little time to wage competitive campaigns." After reading Turner’s suggestion that Fudge had somehow been handed a last-minute advantage, we at PolitiFact Ohio wondered if we had missed something. From the start the 11th Congressional District was reconfigured to preserve its status as one where a majority of voters are minorities. To accomplish that, Republicans drew a district that fused Fudge’s East Side base with a portion of Akron. So pleased was Fudge when the first map was released in September that she was a rare Democrat to openly embrace the new lines. Others complained that, in a state more-evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, the GOP gave itself insurmountable advantages in 12 of the 16 new districts. After months of stalemate and threats to place the map before voters, lawmakers approved a revised, referendum-proof map in December. In a telephone interview, Turner said she intended the first half of her withdrawal announcement as a "broad statement" about the redistricting process, "not just the 11th Congressional District." Fair enough. The new map united several urban areas across the state and added more of Toledo Rep. Marcy Kaptur’s base to a district in which she will compete against fellow Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland. In that regard, the incumbent Kaptur’s turf was fortified -- at incumbent Kucinich’s expense. Likewise, changes to the new 10th District likely helped GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Dayton at the expense of fellow Republican Rep. Steve Austria. Austria subsequently decided not to seek re-election. But when PolitiFact Ohio looked closely at the 11th District, Version 2.0, it looked an awfully lot like Version 1.0. Because it is. State legislators made no changes there. The separate House bills that created the first map and its replacement confirm that the 11th District lines in place the day that Turner declared her candidacy were the same lines in place the day she withdrew. "The 11th Congressional District was completely unchanged," Mike Dittoe, spokesman for Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder of Medina, told PolitiFact Ohio via email. So citing an overall disdain for the gerrymandering process seems like a convenient excuse for departing a primary that was sure to be hotly contested. Particularly since there was no change to the 11th District. Turner is correct in noting the earlier primary -- a development that was always possible but by no means likely at the time she entered the race. And she acknowledged that the other half of her statement could be misinterpreted, though she said that was unintentional. There is an element of truth in her statement. The new congressional districts were drawn to lean solidly toward one party or the other. All but one has at least one incumbent running for election. But that was true with the September map, as well. And some incumbents were aided by changes in the map. But it’s also true that those changes may have heightened the challenge for others. Those are critical facts that could give the listener a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Turner’s statement Mostly False.

Scott Walker made a claim about tax cuts since he took office in 2011. He said the cuts that had been approved, and those that were proposed in his 2017-’19 state budget, would "exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done." We rated the statement True. Now the budget is done and Walker is making the claim without qualifications. For example, he declared on May 31, 2018, on Twitter: "Since taking office, we have enacted more than $8 billion in cumulative tax relief." Campaigning for a third term in the November 2018 election, it’s a statement Walker will repeat. Let’s see if it’s right. More governor’s race fact checks: How Walker and the Democratic candidates for governor stack up on the Truth-O-Meter. The numbers The governor’s office provided us tallies from the State Budget Office. They show that through June 2019, when the current 2017-’19 state budget ends, the tax cuts will exceed $8.85 billion. We also went to a nonpartisan source, the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which did calculations in May 2018 and arrived at a slightly lower figure. The fiscal bureau told us it estimated the reduction in general fund tax revenues and property tax revenues, as a result of tax law changes enacted since 2011, at $8.47 billion: Income and franchise tax reductions $4.82 billion Property tax reductions $3.56 billion Other tax cuts $90 million Total tax reductions 2011 through mid-2019 $8.47 billion Democrats' reaction We asked the state Democratic Party about Walker’s claim. The party did not challenge the $8 billion tally, but criticized a number of Walker’s policies. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Among them: State tax cuts adopted since 2011 have disproportionately gone to Wisconsin residents with the highest incomes, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project.

pomt-12292	Says the CBO said "it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan; it's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/28/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrong-most-22-million-uninsured-would-be/	One of the strongest complaints about the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, is it requires everyone to have insurance. To one degree or another, both the Senate and House bills do away with that requirement. When asked about the estimated 22 million people who would become uninsured under the Senate bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., emphasized the upside of giving people the freedom to choose. Ryan offered this take on the report on the Senate bill from the Congressional Budget Office report on Fox News on June 27: "What they're basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office is, if you're not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won't buy it. So it's not that people are getting pushed off a plan. It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want." Ryan added that ending the expansion of Medicaid also played a role in the relative drop in the insured. We went back to the CBO report to see if in fact, it "basically" said that people will choose not to buy insurance. In terms of 22 million fewer insured, the CBO did not. Ryan’s press office said he was talking about the first year after the bill would take effect, and it that respect, he has a point. The CBO said it and the Joint Committee on Taxation "estimate that, in 2018, 15 million more people would be uninsured under this legislation than under current law — primarily because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated." But Ryan was asked about the 22 million figure, which is the estimate for 2026. That estimate was the sum of two groups — a Medicaid group totalling 15 million people, and the non-group insurance market amounting to 7 million people. Medicaid is a free or low-cost government health insurance plan for the poor. The biggest single chunk of savings under the Senate bill comes out of Medicaid. The CBO said that compared with the laws in place today, 15 million fewer people who need insurance would be able to get it through Medicaid or anywhere else. Ryan’s answer flipped the CBO presentation. According to the CBO, the Senate bill’s impact on people who would get coverage through Medicaid is double that of people who buy on the insurance market. That’s where people make the kind of choices Ryan was talking about. On top of that, this CBO chart shows that people currently eligible for Medicaid represent about two-thirds of the drop in Medicaid enrollment. These are people who otherwise would have had a plan — Medicaid — but wouldn’t under the Senate bill. But even for the smaller group of 7 million people in the nongroup insurance market, Ryan’s answer oversimplifies the CBO message. The reports says, "Fewer people would enroll in the nongroup market mainly because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated and, starting in 2020, because the average subsidy for coverage in that market would be substantially lower for most people currently eligible for subsidies — and for some people that subsidy would be eliminated." So the CBO number includes people who want insurance but are priced out of the market when coverage subsidies fall or disappear. "People are going to become uninsured because they can't afford insurance any more, just like they couldn’t before the Affordable Care Act," said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care data. As this CBO chart shows, the loss of insurance would be heavily concentrated among people making less than 200 percent of federal poverty. That is consistent with the idea that unaffordability, not choice, is the driving force. Our ruling Ryan paraphrased the CBO as saying that millions more would not be insured basically because they would be free not to buy a policy they didn’t want. Some people won’t buy policies due to simple choice, but many others will become uninsured because they’re no longer eligible for Medicaid. The CBO said two-thirds of the 22 million without insurance would lose out through cuts in the Medicaid program. For the remaining 7 million, some portion of those would have chosen not to buy coverage, but some portion would want to buy but find insurance unaffordable. Ryan’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores a lot of what the CBO said. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05444	Says legislative cuts mean Texas is "spending on average $500 less per student."	true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/26/donna-howard/state-rep-donna-howard-says-texas-spending-about-5/	At a Texas Capitol rally, state Rep. Donna Howard, an Austin Democrat, said a dire consequence of the 2011 Legislature’s budget-writing was a drop in per-student spending. Speaking to the crowd gathered to advocate for more public school support, Howard, without naming names, called out those officials who have said the state has increased its aid to school districts. "But the Legislative Budget Board, the nonpartisan budget board of the Capitol, will tell you we are spending on average $500 less per student, so the fact that we are appropriating more, the truth is we are spending $500 less per student," Howard said. Is that so? In a recent fact-check, we gave state Comptroller Susan Combs a Pants on Fire rating for her claim that state lawmakers in 2011 did not cut public school funding when they wrote the two-year 2012-13 budget. The upshot: Although lawmakers increased state spending on education, the state’s "general revenue" increase pales in comparison to reductions in other funds appropriated for public education. Specifically, legislators, faced with a shortfall in projected state income, changed the formulas that govern how much aid flows to districts so districts would get $2 billion less a year through the 2012-13 budget period than they would have gotten if the longstanding formulas had gone unchanged. Members also reduced by $1.3 billion the two-year appropriation of state funding for grants that finance targeted programs such as teacher incentive pay and dropout prevention. Howard told us that the figure she aired at the rally was based on information she received from the staff of the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters, about the impact of those two cuts. Her figure turned out to be less than what the board staff estimates. Staff spokesman John Barton told us that per-student reductions from the two cuts shook out to $569 a year on average, some $428 of that attributable to the drop in formula-driven aid and $141 tracing to the grant reductions. From email exchanges with Barton, checks with nongovernmental experts and a report from a national teachers group, we identified a few ins, outs and curlicues built into these figures — as well as alternative ways to determine per-student cuts. It’s fair to say this topic can be as complicated as any analysis involving the complex Texas method of funding public schools. Let’s tick through those curlicues. For starters, the board reached its per-student reduction averages for the grant reductions and changes in formula funding in different ways. The $428-per-student reduction calculation is based on comparing money that districts are going to field for operations via the state’s main school funding mechanisms in the 2012-13 biennium with what they would have gotten had lawmakers not changed the formulas. If lawmakers had hewed to previously existing formulas, Barton told us, districts would have been entitled to roughly $7,662 per student in operations aid for each year of the 2012-13 biennium. With the formula changes, the per-student estimate became approximately $7,234. The difference: $428. The rest of the board staff’s per-student reduction calculation is based on comparing state funding that lawmakers appropriated for the targeted grant programs in the 2012-13 budget with the funding during the 2010-11 budget cycle. Curlicue No. 2 is a caution on this portion of the analysis: Calculating how much grant funding is available for each student in Texas public schools does not reflect how the funds are actually allocated. That’s because the grant money is not evenly distributed among schools districts, "so the degree to which that portion of the funding reduction affects a given district will vary widely," Barton said. Next, some twists behind the board staff’s analysis of the legislated reduction in formula funding. The analysis doesn’t consider money flowing to school districts from the state to help pay off debt, most commonly bonds sold to pay for facility construction. Then again, the operations revenue is by far the largest chunk of state-guided education aid. Second, the operations revenue figures in the staff’s analysis fold in state and local revenue. That’s because the overall funding system counts on districts to contribute toward their total funding by tapping local property tax revenue. State aid fills in. Given the interconnected school funding system, Barton advised, any analysis of state funding alone "would present a grossly incomplete picture" of the amount of revenue available to school districts. "The entire system is a model of shared local and state revenue," he said. Overall, Barton said the board’s analysis of formula-driven aid — comparing what districts were owed for 2012-13 before the cuts with what they would actually receive — is the best way to assess the Legislature’s changes. His explanation: It isolates the impact on state revenue because all the other factors that go into determining the amount of funding for districts are the same. Still, we wondered whether it’s reasonable for anyone to say per-student funding is down an average of $500, as Howard did, when the board staff’s comparison largely looked at what districts would have had versus what they are now expected to field. One could read Howard’s charge as indicating that districts are getting $500 less per student than they got in the two school years during the state’s previous budget period, 2010-11. Apples to apples? Per the formula funding, Barton said, the average per-student amount going to districts for each year of the previous budget period was "roughly" equivalent to the $7,662 estimate for 2012-13 before the formula changes. That brings us back to that $428 reduction figure, which is less than $500, but also does not roll in the impact of the grant cuts. We decided to do an analysis of our own, using both the operations revenue and the grant funding. First, we combined those two funding sources for each biennium. Next, we split that total in half, to get a total funding figure for one fiscal year, which basically mirrors a school year. Finally, we divided that figure by the average annual number of students in the public school system for the corresponding biennium. And? For 2010-11, we found a per-student average spending total of $7,988 per year. For 2012-13, our calculations yielded an annual per-student average of $7,393. The drop? $595 — greater than the $500 figure that Howard aired. For wider perspective, we asked nongovernment sources to guide us to their estimates of the legislated per-student reductions. Several folks — including Lynn Moak, a lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, and Ray Freeman, deputy executive director of the Equity Center, an Austin group that advocates for school funding equity — suggested a simple way of measuring that: Divide the annual amount of the funding cuts by the number of students in the system. We did that, starting our calculations from a combined reduction total for the biennium of $5.3 billion. Next we split that in half to get a per-year cut figure of $2.65 billion. Finally, we divided by the number of students. That method yields different results depending on what measure of student enrollment is used, but all our calculations generated figures greater than $500. We found a distinct look at how per-student spending is changing in a December 2011 report from the National Education Association that presents education statistics for each state, including information provided by the state education agency in Texas. Although this fact-check has focused on the flow of money to school districts, the NEA report provides estimates of spending by districts on a per-student basis. According to the report, Texas districts were projected to spend $486 or $538 less per student in the 2011-12 school year — about the first year of the 2012-13 biennium — than in the previous one, depending on what enrollment measure is used. Notably, the report folds in spending by districts from all sources, including federal money, so the shown changes can’t be entirely attributed to decisions by state legislators. Our ruling Howard’s statement is about the effect of two major legislative actions on public school funding. By every measure we found and one that we ginned up, those actions resulted in a per-student funding reduction of at least $500. We think it’s significant that those figures represent averages — a fact that Howard noted in her rally remarks. That means some districts were likely to be hit harder, others less hard, especially by the legislated cuts to grants, which are not distributed uniformly to districts. We rate Howard’s claim True.

pomt-00164	"Black lung cases are at a 25-year high."	true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/23/joe-manchin/are-black-lung-cases-25-year-high/	Are cases of black lung disease, a scourge of the coal-mining industry, more numerous today than in recent memory? That’s the message of a joint press release by U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. Black lung disease, also called coal workers' pneumoconiosis, is caused by dusts that are inhaled and deposited in the lungs, which can create scar tissue that makes it more difficult to breathe. The condition can be prevented with appropriate respiratory protection, but once it develops, there is no cure, according to the American Lung Association. The senators’ statement touted legislation to help with the early detection of black lung disease. The legislation requires the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to submit a report to Congress on ways to boost outreach efforts to increase participation in the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. (We’re checking Manchin rather than Capito because he was the one quoted citing this particular statistic in the news release.) The press release, posted on Manchin’s website on Aug. 23, 2018, said, "Black lung cases are at a 25-year high, and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable." Is this correct? We took a closer look. The black lung study The news release from Manchin and Capito cites a study published by the American Journal of Public Health. The study was produced by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Morgantown, W.Va. Researchers used radiographs collected from 1970 to 2017 to determine the ebb and flow of the disease. The study found that not only have black lung cases increased but also that their prevalence will likely be reflected in future trends of such conditions as progressive massive fibrosis, which refers to masses in the upper pulmonary lobes of the lungs. Here are three charts from the study showing, from left to right, the prevalence of black lung in the United States as a whole; the prevalence in central Appalachia, defined as Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia; and the prevalence in the United States outside of central Appalachia. These charts show that around 1970, the prevalence of black lung was far higher than it is today — about 30 percent of miners with the longest tenures. That rate fell steadily, and by the late 1990s it had declined to the single digits. But that decline has since reversed. Now, the national prevalence in miners with 25 years or more of tenure exceeds 10 percent, and in central Appalachia, 20.6 percent of long-tenured miners have the disease. Manchin’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Manchin said that "black lung cases are at a 25-year high." A scientific study found that the prevalence of black lung disease plummeted between 1970 and the late 1990s, but that the rate has risen since then, although nowhere near its all-time high. That’s consistent with Manchin’s description. We rate the statement True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joe Manchin	None	None	None	2018-10-23T13:08:28	2018-08-23	['None']

pomt-00248	California’s rent control measure Proposition 10 would have "No effect on homeowners"	half-true	/california/statements/2018/oct/05/yes-10-campaign/will-californias-rent-control-measure-prop-10-real/	Much of the debate over California’s rent control measure, Proposition 10, has centered on how it will affect apartment dwellers and landlords. But a claim by the Yes on 10 campaign in a recent TV ad has fueled questions over how homeowners will fare should the measure pass in November. Here’s what the ad says: "Independent voices urge Yes on Prop 10. League of Women Voters, Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee all say Prop 10 will empower your local community to limit rent increases. No effect on homeowners. Help for struggling renters. Vote yes on 10." The measure’s opponents seized on the claim that Prop 10 would have "no effect on homeowners." They argue that statement is false and "recklessly disregards the truth." They’ve asked media outlets to pull the ad. Given the disagreement over the claim and significance of the ballot measure, we decided to check the facts. This, however, is not the only claim that’s in dispute. There’s also disagreement over whether rent control really helps "struggling renters," as the ad states. Economists argue it helps the select few who have their rents capped, but has the unintended consequence of making rental housing scarcer and increasing the average rent citywide, a topic Capital Public Radio explored earlier this year. Background on Prop 10 Prop 10 would repeal the state's Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which blocks rent control on units built after February 1995. The law also prevents cities from imposing rent caps on condominiums and single-family homes. Repealing the law would allow cities to craft their own, potentially stronger, rent control rules, including on condos and single-family homes. A report released this month by UC Berkeley’s Fisher Center for Real Estate & Urban Economics found the measure would negatively affect owners who rent out single-family homes. Rent control on single-family homes "would decrease property values for homeowners by 10 percent to 15 percent over time," for the more than 2 million California owners who rent out single-family homes, according to the study. A spokesman for the No on 10 campaign added that, based on the campaign’s interpretation of existing laws, rent control would automatically be imposed on single-family home rentals in several cities should Prop 10 pass. Supporters of the measure rejected that interpretation. Response from Yes on 10 Asked about the claim in the ad, the Yes on 10 campaign emphasized that the initiative doesn’t force cities to impose any rent control rules. It simply gives them that option. "The measure itself does not make any changes to local rent control laws," wrote Beverly Grossman Palmer, an attorney for the Yes on 10 campaign, in a letter to broadcasters. "This is a campaign, not a legal brief. The California voters who view this ad understand the message: People who own their own homes are not going to be affected by rent control measures." Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental College who has testified to lawmakers in favor of Prop 10, said there’s another reason to believe the measure won’t affect homeowners: It "would be politically stupid" for cities to impose rent control on single family homes. "There’s never been a rent control law in the country to that effect," he said. "That’s not going to happen." Apartment associations and real estate groups have contributed more than $30 million to defeat Prop 10. Supporters, meanwhile, have raised more than $12 million dollars for it, primarily from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The foundation is a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles, and is active in supporting political campaigns. Our ruling In a recent TV ad, the Yes on 10 campaign claimed California’s rent control measure would have "no effect on homeowners." Prop 10 would not force cities to impose rent control, but it would give them that option -- including on single family home rentals. Prop 10 supporters say it would be a politically poor decision for cities to do that. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. The TV ad is partially accurate. But it leaves out the key information that single-family homes are currently exempt from rent control in the state, and that Prop 10 would at least give cities the option to impose rent regulations on them. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-13768	Says Hillary Clinton "has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian ... refugees . . . despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-again-fails-screen-out-falsehood-oft-/	Immigration has been the cornerstone of Donald Trump's campaign, so it was not surprising he raised the issue again in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination. He attacked Hillary Clinton’s plans to accept refugees and promised to choke off all immigration from countries who might be sending terrorists to the United States. "We must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place," he told the crowd in Cleveland on July 21. "My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian, think of this, think of this. ... A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama," he said. "She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people." We've addressed these issues in several other fact-checks. The bottom line: Trump is wrong to suggest that screening isn't done and correct when he says Clinton has recommended a 550 percent increase. Let's go through the relevant points. The migration of thousands of Syrians fleeing a war that has killed more than 200,000 has been called the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II. The fear — here and in some of the countries that have accepted them – is that some of those people might be terrorists posing as refugees. Compared to other countries, the United States has accepted very few – about 2,000 last year, for example. Half are children. Only about 2 percent are single men of combat age, the mostly likely demographic for a would-be terrorist. President Barack Obama said in 2015 that he would increase the number to 10,000. Then, during a Sept. 20, 2015, appearance on CBS' Face the Nation, Clinton said that, given the scope of the problem, "I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000, and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in." That's the 550 percent increase Trump and the Republicans have been talking about. That part of Trump's statement is accurate. But contrary to Trump's claim that "there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from," the refugees are already screened, although like any security program, there are no guarantees. Said Raj Shah, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, "The head of the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center in the Obama Administration have all testified that because of the lack of databases in Syria, existing procedures cannot effectively ensure that ISIS-linked terrorists are not posing as refugees and coming into the United States." According to the U.S. refugees admissions program, created in 1980 and retooled after 9/11, a would-be refugee must first get a referral from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a U.S. embassy or a recognized non-government organization. The U.N. process takes four to 10 months, and only about 1 percent are recommended for resettlement. And that's before the United States begins its probe, where the names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through federal terrorism and criminal databases. In addition, the refugees are interviewed by Department of Homeland Security officials. If they pass those hurdles, they also have to pass medical screening, have a sponsor agency, pass "cultural orientation" classes and be examined for another security clearance. As we reported in November, Syrian refugees are singled out for an additional level of scrutiny, with their documents cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. Only then, after a process that takes one to two years, or longer, can they come to the United States. There could be gaps in some of the information because they are fleeing war, but if ISIS or another terrorist group wanted to get someone in the United States, experts told us, it would be faster and easier to arrange to fly them in as a tourist. Our ruling Trump said Hillary Clinton "has called for a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian ... refugees ... despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from." The 550 percent figure is correct. To say that there's no way to screen them to find out who they are or where they come from ignores the extensive screening they undergo.

pomt-00825	Say Michelle Obama "mandates" weighing children in day care.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/26/blog-posting/social-media-posts-say-michelle-obama-mandating-al/	First Lady Michelle Obama’s initiative on healthy eating and physical activity may have been intended to be noncontroversial, but it hasn’t turned out that way. She has faced pushback from critics who assail her call for healthier school lunches as forcing kids to eat unappetizing meals and who say she’s second-guessing parents who know what’s best for their kids better than the government does. Now, a new front against her has opened in the conservative blogosphere: Michelle Obama, critics say, is requiring day care centers to track their children’s weight. A reader tipped us off to this social media phenomenon, which has been driven by such headlines as "Michelle Obama Sending Government Monitors To Weigh Children In Daycare" (downtrend.com), "Government plans to weigh and measure your child in daycare," (American Thinker), "Michelle O Mandates Weighing Children in Daycare," (InfoWars), and "Michelle Obama Now Mandating Daycare Centers Weigh Kids" (Western Journalism Center). So is Michelle Obama really mandating the weighing of children in day care? No, this rumor is wildly overblown. Here’s how it came about. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Michelle Obama was a high-profile supporter of the measure -- she joined her husband in speaking at the bill-signing ceremony -- after it passed the Senate by unanimous consent and the House by a fairly (but not perfectly) party-line vote. The law included a provision (section 223) for a Study on Nutrition and Wellness Quality in Childcare Settings, or SNAQCS. The study was designed to look at four topics: the nutritional quality of foods offered, the amount of physical activity, the amount of sedentary activity and the ways that child care centers and family day care homes can improve their performance on these metrics. On March 23, 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released details on the proposed study, along with a request for public comments. "Good nutrition is a key to proper childhood development, but not enough is known about the food children are eating in child care and related programs," the document reads. Among other things, the study would involve a child food diary to be completed by parents, a standing height and weight form to be collected by study staff, an infant food intake form and a parent interview. If this were a mandatory requirement for all day care centers -- as the blogosphere trumpeted -- that would be pretty intrusive. But it’s not -- it’s a study of a limited number of day care centers and students. The USDA document says it will involve an estimated 3,000 children, 3,753 staff members at child care centers, family day care homes and after-school childcare providers, and 4,175 parents. That’s a tiny fraction of the more than 30 million children in some form of day care -- about one ten-thousandth, to be exact. The Agriculture Department told PolitiFact that the only mandatory aspect of the program is that all facilities receiving federal funding from the Child and Adult Care Food Program will have to fill out a form. Day care centers that don’t participate in that program may be asked on a voluntary basis if they would like to take part as a control group. Moreover, only a small sampling of children at the federally supported centers would ever be weighed, and parents would be allowed to opt their children out of the weighing part if they wish. The headline of the article that sparked the flurry of social media commentary -- published by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website -- was more measured than the later iterations. The Free Beacon piece was titled, "Feds to Weigh Children in Daycare: USDA collecting data for study mandated by Michelle Obama’s healthy eating law." The Free Beacon mentioned the fact that the study was limited to 3,000 children high up in the story and quotes at length from the USDA’s explanation of the purpose of the study. Some of the subsequent articles that appeared on the Internet also mentioned the size of the study and the department’s justification for undertaking it, but the headlines glossed over these nuances. (Email inquiries to several of the publications in question were not returned.) "I'm not responsible for how the blogosphere picks up my stories," Elizabeth Harrington, the Beacon reporter who wrote the story, told PolitiFact. "Though other sites may have gone farther, the mandate in the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which the First Lady was largely responsible for, is still clear. And that's what I reported on." Our ruling Bloggers say Michelle Obama "mandates" weighing children in day care. A law she supported -- that was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate -- has set in motion a proposed study of how children in day care are eating, and part of the monitoring would include periodically weighing the participating students. However, the headlines of most of the posts on social media painted this as a sweeping, new requirement for all children in day care. That’s not true -- the study aims to track 3,000 children, or about one ten-thousandth of all children in day care. We rate the claim False. CORRECTION, Mar. 27, 2015: This version corrects a mathematical error in the initial posting of this story. Three thousand children is one ten-thousandth of the 30 million children in day care nationally, not one ten-thousandth of 1 percent.

pomt-11380	A bill in Congress "will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns."	pants on fire!	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/29/tom-king/gun-owners-would-not-have-give-their-guns-under-as/	The president of the state group affiliated with the National Rifle Association says a bill in Congress would ban all semi-automatic firearms and lead to the government seizing guns from gun owners. Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, appeared on The Capitol Pressroom to voice his group’s opposition to stronger gun control laws. "The title of the bill is ‘something assault weapons ban,’ " King said in the interview. "And, when you read into it, the legislation will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns." The group also wants to repeal the 2013 New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, the state’s gun law passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Democrats have proposed some parts of the SAFE Act for the congressional bill, like universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on certain accessories. But is King right that the bill would ban semi-automatic weapons altogether and lead to gun seizures? The bill Opponents of gun control have long chafed at the term "assault weapon" because it does not have a universal definition. The SAFE Act, for example, defines an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons in 1994. The federal ban expired in 2004, and many Democrats have tried to revive it ever since. King did not respond to our inquiry about his claim. In the Capitol Pressroom interview, he mentioned House Resolution 5057 as the bill he was referring to. But that bill has nothing to do with guns. It seems he mixed up his bill numbers. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, leads the latest gun-control effort as sponsor of House Resolution 5087, titled the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. A Cicilline spokesperson said his office is not aware of any other current bills relating to an assault weapons ban. PolitiFact New York could not find any others in our search of House and Senate websites. Cicilline's bill would ban the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with certain military-style features: • Rifles that can accept a detachable magazine would be banned from having a pistol grip, a forward grip, a threaded barrel, a barrel shroud, a grenade or rocket launcher, or a folding, telescoping, or detachable stock. • Pistols would not be allowed to have a fixed magazine with more than 10 rounds. They would also be banned from having a threaded barrel, a second pistol grip, a barrel shroud, and the ability to load a magazine at some location other than the grip. • Shotguns would be banned from having a detachable magazine and a fixed magazine would not be allowed to have more than five rounds. The same features banned for pistols and rifles would also be banned on shotguns. Semi-automatic weapons sold without any of those features would still be legal to own and sell. The gun would become illegal if the owner decided to add any of those features. Those who legally bought a gun with those features before the ban would not have to give them up. Those weapons would be grandfathered in, but a background check would be required if the owner sells it to someone else. They would also have to be locked up when not being used. The bill would also ban any magazine with more than 10 rounds. Six states already have a similar ban. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, introduced an almost identical bill in 2017. Neither has support from Republicans, who hold the majority in both chambers of Congress. Our ruling King said a bill in Congress "will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns." That’s not true. The latest bill to ban "assault weapons" would block the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with one or more military-style features. Guns that already have those features would be grandfathered in. Gun owners would not be required to give up any of their guns as long as they were legally purchased before the ban. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-11829	"In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns. They [The Obama administration] prosecuted only 44 of them."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/nov/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-obama-administration-prosecuted-few-/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that Barack Obama’s administration bears some responsibility for the mass shooter in a Texas town acquiring guns. In a late-night Nov. 6, 2017, interview with Shannon Bream of Fox News, the Republican senator said that he’d spent the day comforting residents of Sutherland Springs, where the shooter killed 26 people in a church. Cruz said he felt his anger rising on his return flight to Washington "because," Cruz told Bream, "this should have been stopped beforehand. Under federal law, it was illegal for this individual to purchase a firearm. He had a conviction for a crime that’s punishable by more than a year in prison and he had a conviction for multiple domestic violence crimes. Both of those, it’s already ineligible. "But several things happened," Cruz said. "Number one, the Air Force, the Obama administration, didn’t report those convictions to the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) database. That’s an endemic problem; it’s a problem with the federal government, it’s a problem with the states. "And so, when he went in to buy the guns, they ran the background check and they didn’t find it because it wasn’t in the database. But I’ll tell you we could have prevented this. In 2013, in the wake of Sandy Hook, I joined with Chuck Grassley, we introduced legislation, it was called the Grassley-Cruz legislation, and it was aggressive legislation targeting felons and violent criminals to stop them from getting guns." Cruz went on: "There were a couple elements of that legislation that were critical. One, it mandated that federal agencies including the Air Force report to the NICS because that was a problem back then. But two, and this is an even more critical piece, if it had been reported to the background database, when he went into Academy to buy this, these weapons, he lied on the forms. That is a felony to lie on those forms. The Obama administration didn’t prosecute those cases. In 2010," Cruz said, "48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns. They prosecuted only 44 of them." Readers request fact-check We’re not checking all of what Cruz said though PolitiFact in Washington found Mostly False Cruz claim’s in the interview that Democrats filibustered legislation that would’ve resulted in the Texas church shooter being in prison rather than wreaking havoc. Readers asked us if Cruz was correct about the very few prosecutions of individuals for lying while buying a gun from a licensed dealer. Previous fact-checks A 1993 law requires a criminal history background check by the FBI or a state agency. If a potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the lead investigative agency in gun enforcement. The automated national instant background check system began operating in 1998. Some perspective: In 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia reviewed federal reports before concluding that the Justice Department hadn’t been prioritizing perjury charges in connection with background checks for at least two administrations. During George W. Bush’s presidency, there had been 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year and some 15/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted. In the first two years of Obama’s presidency, 8/100th of 1 percent of such cases were prosecuted. By email, a Cruz spokesman, Phil Novack, told us Cruz drew on a 2012 federal report to reach his 2010 figures. Novack noted too that when Cruz made a similar claim in 2013, the Fact Checker at The Washington Post confirmed the declared 44 prosecutions based on information in the report. 2010 statistics In 2010, the report says, FBI background checks led to initial denials of 72,659 applications to purchase a gun--with 34,451 denials attributed to a person’s felony indictment or conviction and 13,862 due to the person being a fugitive from justice--48,313 combined. But most of those denials never made it to prosecutorial consideration. The report says the ATF overturned, canceled or chose not to refer for further investigation 71,410 denial cases sent its way by the FBI; some 4,732 cases were then referred to field offices for further review. Ultimately, the report says, 62 cases were referred for federal prosecution with 18 of those not taken up by a prosecutor--which leaves 44. Then again, that doesn’t mean 44 prosecutions proceeded. That’s because a dozen referrals were still pending action by a prosecutor as of Dec. 13, 2011, the report says. Otherwise, an accompanying chart shows that the 44 possible prosecutions would have been down from 77 prosecutions the year before and 105 in 2008--and prosecutorial referrals also had declined through those years. By phone, we asked the report’s author, Ron Frandsen, about the availability of more recent data. Frandsen, who works for the Missouri-based Regional Justice Information Service, said that to his knowledge, no analyses of post-2010 data have been funded. By email, Frandsen said that most likely, the 48,321 denied applications tallied for felony or fugitive reasons were found in FBI background checks after applicants failed to disclose such information on a form. "FBI denials are referred to ATF, which investigates the cases deemed most worthy of possible prosecution. From the 2010 FBI denials, ATF referred 62 charges (against 33 people) to U.S. or state attorneys for possible prosecution," Frandsen said, involving nine different federal offenses and two to seven state offenses. Frandsen said Cruz was accurate in his reference to 48,000 denials. He said the reference to 44 prosecutions wasn’t accurate because the "44" from the service’s report refers to charges, not individual people, and those charges involved "more than just felons and fugitives, and," Frandsen wrote, "because some of the prosecutorial decisions were made by state attorneys." There’s more data available, PolitiFact reporters have noted, in a 2013 analysis of federal weapons cases by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, based at Syracuse University. The analysis doesn’t mention background checks directly. But a chart lists 123 prosecutions in 2010 in which the lead charge was making false/fictitious statements in order to acquire a firearm or ammunition. The comparable count was 143 in 2011 and 170 in 2012, the chart states. The relevant law says it’s unlawful for anyone acquiring a firearm from a licensed dealer to knowingly make false or fictitious oral or written statements intended to deceive the seller about the sale’s legality. Explaining the few prosecutions Why has Uncle Sam seemingly been reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 report from the Justice Department’s inspector general provided several answers. It said ATF agents viewed the violations "as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives" and "saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm." The report also said that the cases lack "jury appeal" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation "juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle." Frandsen told us he hasn’t researched in depth why few violations get prosecuted. But, he said, such cases are hard to prosecute "because the government must prove that the denied person intentionally failed to disclose a prohibition on the federal form (as opposed to just being unaware of what was on their record)." Also, he said, there’s a belief that the main purpose of the background check requirement is to prevent a firearm transfer to a prohibited person--and the additional step of prosecution "should be reserved for the most dangerous people, especially those with an extensive criminal history." Our ruling Cruz said: "In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns" and the Obama administration "prosecuted only 44 of them." There may have been even fewer federal prosecutions of such felons and fugitives, figures indicate, though Cruz failed to note that this paucity wasn’t unique to one administration. It’s also worth clarifying that we don’t know if all 48,000 individuals knowingly misled the government. Few of the tallied background checks resulted in further investigation.

pomt-05116	"The state's unemployment rate is fifth-highest in the country, a full point above the nationwide rate and higher than all of our...neighboring states."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/27/paul-sarlo/new-jerseys-unemployment-rate-5th-highest-nation-s/	As Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic legislators battle over cutting taxes for the fiscal year beginning Sunday, both sides have been turning to federal labor statistics to make their case. Claiming that the "Jersey Comeback" has begun, the Republican governor recently called for an income tax cut by pointing out how the state gained 17,600 nonfarm jobs in May. Christie received a False on the Truth-O-Meter for claiming that job growth represented 25 percent of the net new jobs created nationwide that month. The Democrat-controlled Legislature on Monday approved a fiscal year 2013 budget that sets aside $183 million for a tax cut, but said taxes only would be reduced if Christie's revenue projections are met between now and December. While discussing how the projections appear to be "overly optimistic," state Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) cited New Jersey’s unemployment rate. "The state's unemployment rate is fifth-highest in the country, a full point above the nationwide rate and higher than all of our...neighboring states," Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, said during a speech on the State Senate floor. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Sarlo’s statistic is accurate. With an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent in May, New Jersey had the fifth-highest rate among the 50 states, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey’s unemployment rate also was one percentage point higher than the national unemployment rate of 8.2 percent in May, according to the bureau. The only states with higher unemployment rates were Nevada (11.6 percent); Rhode Island (11 percent); California (10.8 percent); and North Carolina (9.4 percent), the bureau said. Just as Sarlo said, New Jersey’s unemployment rate was greater than in its neighboring states, according to the bureau. New York had an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent, followed by 7.4 percent in Pennsylvania and 6.8 percent in Delaware, the bureau said. Here are the top 10 highest unemployment rates in May among the states: State Unemployment Rate Nevada 11.6% Rhode Island 11% California 10.8% North Carolina 9.4% New Jersey 9.2% South Carolina 9.1% Georgia 8.9% Mississippi 8.7% Florida 8.6% New York 8.6% Illinois 8.6% Michigan 8.5% Now, here are the states with the top 10 lowest unemployment rates in May: State Unemployment Rate North Dakota 3% Nebraska 3.9% South Dakota 4.3% Vermont 4.6% Oklahoma 4.8% New Hampshire 5% Iowa 5.1% Wyoming 5.2% Minnesota 5.6% Virginia 5.6% Massachusetts 6% Utah 6% For the individual states, the unemployment rates for May are preliminary. It’s worth noting that New Jersey’s unemployment rate has dropped slightly in recent years. In February 2010 -- Christie’s first full month as governor -- the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent, according to the latest figures from the bureau. Our ruling In a speech on the State Senate floor, Sarlo claimed: "The state's unemployment rate is fifth-highest in the country, a full point above the nationwide rate and higher than all of our...neighboring states." According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the senator’s claim is on target. In May, the Garden State had an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent, marking the fifth-highest amount among the 50 states. New Jersey’s unemployment rate also was higher than the national employment rate by one percentage point and greater than the rates in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04865	Says Mitt Romney "paid only 14 percent in taxes — probably less than you."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/09/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-most-americans-pay-higher-tax-ra/	A new ad from President Barack Obama’s campaign continues the drumbeat that Mitt Romney is a privileged rich guy who isn't paying his fair share of taxes. "You work hard, stretch every penny," a narrator says. "But chances are, you pay a higher tax rate than him: Mitt Romney made $20 million in 2010, but paid only 14 percent in taxes — probably less than you." We wondered whether it’s accurate to say that Romney "paid only 14 percent in taxes — probably less than you." The 14 percent figure checks out. The 2010 tax return released by Romney and his wife, Ann, showed $3,009,766 in federal income tax paid on $21,661,344 in adjusted gross income -- an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent. But what do ordinary Americans pay? If you just look at income taxes, Obama is incorrect. Here are the average effective tax rates for Americans in different slices of the income spectrum, according to a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. These figures show that many people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, actually have negative rates because they get back more from the government than they paid in taxes. Bottom fifth of earners: -12.3 percent Second-to-bottom fifth: -4.2 percent Middle fifth: 4.1 percent Second-highest fifth: 8.2 percent Highest fifth: 17.3 percent Because these percentages are average tax rates for broad income brackets, we don't know precisely how many Americans paid more than Romney’s 14 percent effective tax rate. Still, we can make an educated guess that perhaps 20 percent to 30 percent of taxpayers exceeded Romney’s tax rate for income taxes alone. That’s far from most, making the ad’s claim incorrect. However, there’s another way to calculate it: Adding in payroll taxes. Payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare, with half paid by the employee and half by the employer. Social Security taxes are 6.2 percent of an employee’s first $110,100 of salary, while Medicare taxes are 1.45 percent of their entire salary. Because self-employed people pay the employer’s half too, and because employees of a company are assumed to be paying the employer’s share indirectly through lower wages, tax analysts typically include both halves when calculating the employee’s tax burden. Counting only income taxes, as we did above, ignores a large chunk of what most people pay in federal taxes. In fact, for all but the top one-fifth of earners, the combination of employee and employer payroll taxes actually exceeds income tax payments, according to the same Tax Policy Center study. We should note one obstacle: We don’t know exactly how much Romney paid in payroll taxes. However, based on the amount and types of income listed on his tax return, even a generous estimate wouldn’t budge his overall tax rate much above 14 percent, so we think it's reasonable to make this kind of calculation. So what happens when you add payroll taxes to income taxes? Obama's ad is accurate. Here's the breakdown when you include income taxes and both sides of the payroll tax (the parts paid for by employee and employer): Bottom fifth of earners: 1 percent Second-to-bottom fifth: 7.8 percent Middle fifth: 15.5 percent Second-highest fifth: 18.7 percent Highest fifth: 24.3 percent Once again, we can’t know exactly what percentage of Americans paid a higher effective tax rate than Romney's 14 percent, but the top two ranges, plus a significant share of the middle group, most likely did. So probably more than half exceeded Romney’s rate, making the Obama ad accurate. Even though this method validates the Obama ad, it’s worth noting that -- contrary to the ad’s invocation of Americans who "stretch every penny" -- it’s actually the wealthiest half of Americans, not those with low or middle incomes, whose tax rates end up exceeding Romney’s. At the same time, we should also note that Romney’s 14 percent tax rate is quite a bit lower than the average tax rate for those in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers -- those who earn roughly $2.2 million in cash income and up. Their average tax rate for income taxes alone was 23.6 percent. For income tax plus payroll tax, it was 24.7 percent. Our ruling There are two main ways to make this calculation, and they lead to opposite conclusions. While we believe that including payroll taxes in the calculation offers a more accurate picture of what the American public pays the IRS, it's also true that the Obama ad didn't specify which measurement it was using, and in fact used a figure for Romney -- 14 percent -- that was based on income taxes alone. On balance, then, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-08-09T17:48:33	2012-08-02	['None']
pomt-06930	Virginia state employees "pay nothing" toward their pensions.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/21/bob-mcdonnell/gov-mcdonnell-says-virginia-state-employees-pay-no/	Gov. Bob McDonnell recently proclaimed Virginia’s retirement system needs change. "We’re one of only four states in the country that the state employees pay nothing (toward their pension)," McDonnell said in a July 13 interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box. "We pay the employee and employer share." So state employees don’t contribute a dime to their own retirement? A couple of our readers who saw the TV interview told us McDonnell’s is wrong. So we decided to look into the governor’s statement. The CNBC interview began with McDonnell -- widely mentioned as vice-presidential prospect for next year's Republication national ticket -- accepting praise for Virginia's sound financial condition. When asked about the state's pension, McDonnell acknowledged it has $18 billion in unfunded liabilities and blamed part of the problem on the General Assembly's reluctance to ask state employees to kick in money. Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said McDonnell’s claim was based on an October 14, 2008, report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission that said Virginia was among five states that did not require its employees to make pension contributions. Caldwell said the other four were Tennessee, Florida, Utah and Missouri. But he said Virginia is now one of four states without employee contributions because Missouri, as of January 1, 2011, began requiring new hires to contribute 4 percent to their plans. There are major problems with the governor’s claim, however. State employees hired before July 1, 2010, recently began contributing 5 percent of their salary to their pension plans under a change that went into effect June 25, 2011 -- 18 days before McDonnell’s interview on CNBC. The new policy is contained in a well-publicized budget provision approved by the General Assembly earlier this year that gave state employees a 5 percent raise and simultaneously required them to contribute 5 percent of their salary to their pensions. The governor was hardly a stranger to this development. He urged legislators to require state employees to pay into the pension fund during his State of the Commonwealth Address on Jan. 12. McDonnell signed a budget containing such a provision -- although more lenient than what he wanted -- on May 2. The change reversed a deal made in 1983 when Virginia agreed to pay for its employees’ pension contributions instead of giving them a raise that year. This year’s pension contribution deal only affected longer-serving workers. Newer workers, hired on or after July 1, 2010, had already been required to contribute 5 percent toward their pensions from the day they began work. That provision is part of a bill McDonnell signed on April 13, 2010. McDonnell made his statement on CNBC four days after the pay period ended in which longer-serving state workers made their first contributions to pensions. New state employees had contributed for as long as a year, depending on their start dates. Caldwell said Virginia is still paying the pension contribution for longer-serving workers, because the state gave employees the 5 percent raise in return for a 5 percent pension contribution. "There was a requirement to pay in, but then the state paid employees to offset that," he said. Caldwell offered no explanation how the governor’s statement could be true in light of the fact that newer employees have been paying into the system for as long as a year. Those newer employees are not eligible for the 5 percent pay hike provided to longer-serving workers, according to the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management’s website. The newer employees received no salary boost to offset their pension contribution. About 6,000 new state employees have been hired and started paying into their pensions during the past year, said Jeanne Chenault, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Retirement System. Another 84,000 veteran workers were affected by the 5 percent raise/pension contribution. Ron Jordan, executive director of the Virginia Government Employees Association, said even with the raise, a burden for paying pension contributions has been placed on the backs of veteran workers. Next time there’s a raise, workers will pay the 5 percent contribution on a higher salary, Jordan said, meaning they will ultimately pay more towards their pension than what’s covered by the 5 percent raise given to them this year. Jordan also took issue with the contention that veteran state workers’ immediate loss from the pension contribution was entirely covered by the 5 percent raise. He pointed to a document on the Department of Human Resource Management website saying some employees could see a drop in their take home pay after the pension contribution and raise go into effect. Let’s review. McDonnell, in a CNBC interview, said state workers pay nothing toward their pension and that Virginia makes the contribution for them. That was the case for several decades, but it is no longer true. For more than a year, new state employees -- those hired on or after July 1, 2010 -- have been required to make pension contributions from the day they reported to work. About 6,000 new state workers now fall under the legislation. Longer-serving bureaucrats also are being required to ante up. McDonnell’s interview on CNBC came 18 days after after well-publicized provisions went into effect requiring longer-serving state employees to contribute 5 percent of their pay to Virginia’s pension. The governor’s spokesman correctly points out that longer-serving employees were given a 5 percent raise to offset their pension contribution. Nonetheless, veteran state employees are now chipping in for their pensions and any future raises they receive will also increase their payments into the retirement fund. The governor, in his interview, said Virginia is one of four states that foot the entire bill for pension contributions.

pomt-12939	Say first grandma Marian Robinson will get a $160,000 annual pension for life when President Barack Obama leaves office.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/10/blog-posting/fake-news-first-grandma-marian-robinson-not-gettin/	With President Barack Obama and his family soon vacating the White House, several websites continue to spread a fake news story that says "first grandma" Marian Robinson will be getting a $160,000 annual pension after they move out. Bloggers on the websites USPostman.com and ENHLive.com both posted undated articles that said Robinson will get paid the money for "services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver," meaning she watched granddaughters Sasha and Malia Obama. Facebook flagged the stories as part of its efforts to combat fake news. These stories lambast the Obamas for allegedly abusing their power and wasting taxpayer money by taking advantage of the pension. But there is no pension for the first grandma — the story is fake, and originated on a website known for trafficking in fabricated news. Robinson, a former bank secretary and stay-at-home mother to First Lady Michelle Obama and her brother Craig, doesn’t qualify for any kind of pension, because she’s never been a federal employee. She did move into the White House in 2009, and has helped raise her granddaughters. But she didn’t draw a salary and wasn’t on any kind of government payroll for doing that. There was no contact information for USPostman.com, and we received no response from ENHLive when we attempted to contact that site. But both articles mention elements found in an Oct. 17, 2016, article posted on the faux news site BostonTribune.com. That fake story said that an unspecified Freedom of Information Act request provided documentation that Robinson would be getting the lifetime payment. There’s no indication of what the request showed, or how they arrived at the $160,000 figure. The story also said she likely qualified under the Civil Service Retirement Act. That is a benefits program for federal employees that our colleagues at FactCheck.org note is only for workers who started service before 1987. It has since been replaced by the Federal Employees Retirement System. The false article makes oblique reference to the Former Presidents Act, which provides an annual pension for chief executives (plus Secret Service protection and some travel and transition expenses) after they leave office. For 2016 the pay level was $205,700, unless the former president holds an appointed or elected office in the federal government. And while presidential widows can qualify for $20,000 annual payments should their husbands die, there are no provisions to pay pensions to any other member of a former president’s family. The BostonTribune.com website doesn’t appear to be working as of this writing. It was run by Associated Media Coverage, another website that also ran fake news, including one about several states enacting a two-pet limit that we rated Pants On Fire! in the past. There’s no indication that the story is true, but other websites continue to cite it as fact in various vitriolic posts.

pomt-06272	An independent payment advisory board created by in the health care reform law is "like a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare in order to pay for new government programs."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/25/60-plus-association/60-plus-association-spokesman-pat-boone-says-ipab/	Clean-cut 1950s songster Pat Boone, who grew famous by recording cover versions of tunes like ""Tutti Frutti," "Long Tall Sally," and "Ain’t That a Shame," has been recycling old material again on television in Ohio. On Nov. 9, the conservative senior citizens’ group 60 Plus announced it was launching a $750,000 television ad campaign featuring Boone to target Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. The ad, broadcast statewide, made a series of claims about last year’s health care law, including one that takes aim at the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which the law created to suggest ways to limit Medicare’s spending growth. The IPAB, it says, is "a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare to pay for new government programs." The group behind the ad is so taken with the Medicare-IRS analogy that it has established a website devoted to that theme which claims IPAB is "in effect, a kind of Medicare IRS that will cut payment rates to doctors and nursing homes." PolitiFact has already ruled on some other claims in the ad. We thought this one was worth a look, too. For starters, it’s useful to touch on some of those earlier claims. PolitiFact has repeatedly examined the claim that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will cut $500 billion from Medicare and rated it Mostly False. A review of the claim from an earlier 60 Plus ad noted, "the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it attempts to slow the program’s future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase - the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009." PolitiFact has repeatedly rated past claims that IPAB has the power to ration care or deny specific treatments to patients False. A PolitiFact examination of a claim by presidential candidate Michele Bachmann noted IPAB is forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," as Section 3403 of the health care law states. That’s significant given the claim in the new 60 Plus ad that the IPAD has "the power to cut Medicare." If growth in Medicare spending is projected to exceed certain targets, IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase, but it can only suggest changes to Medicare. If Congress does not act on its recommendations within a set time frame, those recommendations are automatically implemented. But the decision is in the hands of Congress. The law permits Congress to come up with equal cost reductions of its own, or vote to disregard the recommendations outright by a three-fifths majority. "The IPAB is specifically forbidden from making any recommendations that would ration care, reduce benefits, raise premiums or cost-sharing or alter eligibility for Medicare," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Energy and Commerce Committee this July. "And all final decisions remain in the hands of Congress. If Medicare costs are rising at an unsustainable rate, it’s Congress’s choice whether to accept those recommendations or come up with recommendations of its own to put Medicare spending on a stable, sustainable path." PolitFact Ohio was puzzled by the ad’s comparison of IPAB to the Internal Revenue Service. IPAB is a 15-member board that’s supposed to suggest ways to reduce growth in Medicare spending. IRS is a mammoth government agency that collects taxes, enforces the tax laws set by Congress, and helps taxpayers understand and comply with those laws. So we asked 60 Plus spokesman Gerry Scimeca to explain the similarities. Scimeca said that both groups are intimidating bureaucracies that operate in secret and make decisions that dramatically affect the lives of average Americans. "IPAB will unilaterally render a sentence affecting all seniors on Medicare, impacting what remedies are available to seniors in need of health care, and giving bureaucrats immense power over available remedies and their costs," Scimeca said in an email. "Like the IRS, IPAB will operate in secret, will have vast powers to reach into our lives, and will have the final, irrefutable say on Medicare policy." But that description simply is not accurate. The IPAB appointments will be done in public. Members will be chosen by the president, with confirmation from the Senate. It would not have the power to issue edicts. Rather, it can only make recommendations. That those findings can be overruled by Congress hardly makes its rulings "unilateral" or "final," as Scimeca says. The functions of IRS and IPAB are entirely unrelated. Some taxpayers may consider the IRS to be scary and 60 Plus may be scared by IPAB. But that does not make IPAB board a "Medicare IRS." In the late 1950s, Elvis Presley, whose repertoire included the hit "Burning Love," eclipsed Boone in popularity. Boone’s website proudly notes that Presley once opened at one of Boone’s concerts. "Thank God I had a couple of hit records then and I was the star that night. I never followed Elvis again!" Boone says on the website. If he were the speaker here, rather than just the spokesman, he’d be following Elvis’ "Burning Love" with his own fiery song, "Burning Pants." The claim by 60 Plus Association is not only inaccurate, it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	60 Plus Association	None	None	None	2011-11-25T06:00:00	2011-11-07	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-10547	"I have 35 years' experience making change."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/19/hillary-clinton/many-years-of-politics-and-advocacy/	Sen. Hillary Clinton often boasts that she has a long resume — 35 years long, to be precise. "I have 35 years' experience making change," she said in a TV ad in December 2007, and has repeated the phrase, or variations of it, many times since. Several PolitiFact readers asked us to explore the 35-year claim, which Clinton uses to distinguish herself from Barack Obama, her younger (and less experienced) rival. To examine the claim, we interviewed two authors of Clinton books, Sally Bedell Smith and Suzanne Goldenberg, and we examined bios from Clinton's campaign Web site, her Senate office, the White House and the Encyclopedia of Arkansas. In simple terms, any experience counts as experience, but it's clear from the context of Clinton's remarks that she's speaking about public policy experience, so that's how we have focused our examination. We'll start with the math. Clinton is 60, so if we assume that her 35 years were consecutive, they would have begun in 1973 when she graduated from Yale Law School at age 25. That year she joined the Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group for children. But her math was way off when she claimed the difference between her and Obama is "35 years of experience," which we addressed with this item. Her career can be divided into four parts: her first years after law school, her work at the Rose Law Firm and as first lady of Arkansas, her time as first lady in the White House and her seven years in the U.S. Senate. There's little question that her time in the Senate can be considered political experience, so we'll focus on the other three. After law school, Clinton worked briefly for the Children's Defense Fund and then joined the House Judiciary Committee to work on the impeachment of President Nixon. She then taught law in Arkansas for three years (while running a legal aid clinic) before she joined the Rose Law Firm, a prominent corporate firm in Little Rock. Although she has not always drawn a paycheck for her political work, it's clear from her resume that public service, particularly involving the welfare of children, has been a major focus for her career and outside activities. As first lady of Arkansas, she was active in several groups involving education, child welfare and poverty. In 1977, President Carter appointed her to the board of directors for the Legal Services Corporation, a federal agency that provided legal aid to the poor. She was co-founder of Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and she served as president and a member of the group's board of directors until 1984. She also chaired an advisory committee on rural health, served on a task force on infant mortality and chaired an Arkansas education task force. She chaired the Children's Defense Fund board from 1986 through 1992. This work occurred while she was practicing corporate law at the Rose Law Firm. Goldenberg, author of Madam President: Is America Ready to Send Hillary Clinton to the White House? , said Clinton couldn't work full-time in politics or on children's issues because she needed a well-paying job to compensate for her husband's modest salary as governor. (Arkansas ranks near the bottom of the states for gubernatorial pay.) "Hillary Clinton was the breadwinner — and that was an important role," said Goldenberg. Sally Bedell Smith, author of For Love of Politics: Bill and Hillary Clinton: The White House Years , said Clinton has sometimes exaggerated her involvement with political causes, especially for her Arkansas years. "I think she certainly has, over time, been involved in children's issues at various intervals. But the fact is she was not employed in the nonprofit sector. She was a corporate lawyer." Clinton also had parental responsibilities. Her daughter Chelsea was born in 1980, after Clinton had been at the law firm for four years. "Like many women, her life was a juggling act," Goldenberg said. "She had her family, her full-time job and she had these other activities that really were on the side." Her legal work gave her entree into the corporate world: She served on the boards of Wal-Mart, the yogurt chain TCBY and the French building materials company Lafarge. After her husband was elected president in 1992, Clinton left the Rose Law Firm and became first lady. By most accounts, she was one of the more active first ladies in U.S. history. In contrast to some predecessors (Mamie Eisenhower once described her duties as "Ike runs the country. I turn the pork chops"), Clinton became especially involved in public policy. She chaired the White House task force that made an unsuccessful proposal to provide universal health care and she played a key role in creating a children's health care program. Soon after the legislation passed, the New York Times reported, "Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support." As first lady, she advised her husband on Cabinet appointments and senior White House staff positions, Smith said. Clinton also was active on welfare reform and foreign policy issues. "Her activism was quite unprecedented," said Smith. Smith said if she'd been given a title that matched her role, it would have been special counsel to the president. And so we find Clinton's resume and accomplishments generally support her claims of 35 years of political experience. There are a few periods during her Arkansas years when she had less time for public service because she was busy with corporate law and her duties as a new mother. But an examination of her resume and interviews with her biographers show she had a wide range of political and public service roles over those 35 years. Her claim to be "an agent of change" for that time is a flourish of campaign rhetoric (she was trying to match Obama's claim to the word change), but we find it's reasonable because, to be an advocate for any group or cause often means to seek change. We find her claim to be Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-19T00:00:00	2007-12-20	['None']

pomt-04386	Laurie Monnes Anderson "voted to let violent criminals out of jail early."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/19/oregon-senate-republicans/did-laurie-monnes-anderson-vote-let-violent-crimin/	Some legislative bills are so controversial that two, three years later they still serve as meaty fodder for political campaigns. House Bill 3508 from 2009 is just that bill and it’s playing a role in the race between state Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson, D-Gresham, and her Republican opponent, Gresham dentist Scott Hansen. The Leadership Fund, known as Senate Republicans, recently sent a mailer to voters in east Multnomah County, describing Monnes Anderson as friendly to violent criminals. "Would you have voted to let violent criminals out of jail early? Senator Laurie Monnes Anderson did …" reads one side of the mailer, which features corrections bars. The flip side explains in some detail how she voted to give "criminals, some of them violent, a chance to get out of jail before they served their full sentences." Did Monnes Anderson -- and other Democrats -- vote for legislation that let "violent criminals" out of prison early? Before they finished their prison time? And is giving "violent criminals" a chance to get out of prison earlier the same as voting to let them out earlier? PolitiFact Oregon set off sleuthing. To do that, we need to explain House Bill 3508. The legislation temporarily suspended most provisions of Measure 57, a drug and property offense sentencing measure approved by voters in 2008. The bill was expected to save the state $50 million over the two-year budget period at a time when lawmakers were trying to save the public safety budget from more reductions. We should note that House Bill 3508 cleared the Legislature with a few Republican votes -- but most Republicans strenuously opposed it, along with district attorneys and other victims’ advocates. Democrats and their allies, on the other side, called the changes a smarter, more efficient way to address crime. The part that matters for this fact check is that the legislation "also increased earned, good-time credit for some nonviolent offenders, saving about $6.5 million," according to a news report from The Oregonian at the time. In other words, inmates eligible for a 20 percent reduction in prison time could be eligible for a 30 percent reduction should a judge agree, saving bed space and incarceration costs. We reported that only nonviolent offenders would be eligible because that’s how it was billed. (See press statement from Rep. Chip Shields, D-Portland.) But a few months later, The Oregonian published another news report showing that criminals with violent backgrounds had been granted early releaseas allowed by the law. From the news report: "They include Troy Lee Hischar, who fired a bullet so close to his ex-girlfriend's skull that it clipped off a tuft of hair; Raul Peña-Jimenez, who gave a 16-year-old girl drugs and alcohol before sexually assaulting her; and Joseph Duane Betts, a convicted child molester who exposed himself to two boys." Awful, right? But here’s something worth emphasizing: House Bill 3508 didn’t create a new category of inmates eligible to get "out of jail early." These inmates were eligible for a 20 percent reduction on some aspect of their sentence anyway, regardless of the violent or abusive nature of the crimes on their record. Peña-Jimenez, for example, "plied a 16-year-old Aloha girl with alcohol and marijuana and sexually assaulted her several times, court records show. He later pleaded guilty to giving drugs to a minor and second-degree sex abuse in exchange for a 2-year, 7-month prison term." Despite objections by prosecutors, according to The Oregonian, Peña-Jimenez, who was already approved for early release, was approved for extra time off -- 18 days -- under the new law. Democrats admit they made a mistake in that they listed some offenses that would be ineligible for the extra 10 percent time off, but not others. When lawmakers convened in February 2010, they approved Senate Bill 1007, which made more offenders ineligible for a further 10 percent reduction. Monnes Anderson and Senate Democrats referred us to state Sen. Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, chairman of Senate Judiciary. He called the oversight inadvertent and emphasized that the bill set up the possibility of early release, but did not guarantee it. He said that they fixed the problem. Not surprisingly, Republicans find his remarks irrelevant. "Legislators are responsible for the outcomes of the bills they vote on, whether something is inadvertent or not," said Michael Gay, spokesman for The Leadership Fund. "Criminals were released early because of a bill passed by the Legislature. If my family had been hurt directly because of that bill, I'd want to hold someone accountable, whether it was inadvertent or not." The Oregon Anti-Crime Alliance opposed the legislation. Doug Harcleroad, a senior policy adviser with the group, said it’s OK to target Monnes Anderson with the language we’re checking. "They should take responsibility for their votes," he said. "You don’t get to walk away from your vote like that, and it’s fair to say in the political realm that this is what they voted for." But Shannon Wight, associate director of the Partnership for Safety and Justice, an advocacy group that stresses prevention, takes the opposite view. "They didn’t vote for the early release of prisoners," she said. The legislation "allowed for the possibility of some prisoners to become eligible -- only eligible -- for an earned time increase … but this was not automatic." Obviously, legislators voted for the bill hoping some offenders would get out early and save the state money. To date, more than 5,300 inmates have earned a 30 percent reduction in their sentence time and been released, including people sentenced for the first time after the law went into effect. Nearly 900 inmates were denied extra time off. The average number of days "saved" is around 50. PolitiFact Oregon generally finds that scare tactics -- for example, accusing a candidate of voting to "cut" Medicare -- are misleading. But we’re also guided in our ruling by the principle that legislators are responsible for the votes they take, unintended consequences and all. Monnes Anderson and other Democrats voted for legislation that offered early release to inmates, some of whom had committed "violent" crimes against another person. Senate Republicans’ statement about Monnes Anderson is accurate, but it needs additional information and clarification. In this case, the legislators realized the error and fixed it. The law also applied to inmates already eligible to get out early. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-15348	"Jay-Z and Beyonce Attempt to Buy Rights to Confederate Flag to Prevent Further Use."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/09/blog-posting/its-hoax-jay-z-and-beyonce-arent-trying-buy-rights/	PunditFact and PolitiFact have recently checked the history and facts surrounding the Confederate flag flying outside the South Carolina statehouse. PunditFact has also looked into the extent to which retailers are prohibiting the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. Now, in the latest line of Confederate flag related news, comes another claim from Newswatch33 that has caught the attention of a variety of other media sources. The headline to the Newswatch33 article claims that Jay-Z and Beyonce are attempting to purchase the rights to the Confederate flag. With various websites alternately posting this claim as either fiction or reality, PunditFact decided to take a closer look. According to Newswatch33, the Carters want to purchase the resell rights to the Confederate flag for close to $280 million. This means that anyone who would want to sell merchandise with the flag’s image would have to request permission from the couple or risk a lawsuit. The article includes a quote by a person identified as the couple’s attorney, Ralph Hammerstein, in connection to the matter. Is there any truth to this? The short answer is no. It’s a well-conceived hoax. Can someone even buy the rights to the Confederate flag? Again, no. About Newswatch33 Newswatch33 is masking as a real news source. Its own disclaimer says that relying on the "accuracy (or) reliability" of the website information is at users’ "own risk." Some of the other articles published by Newswatch33 have already been proven to be bogus. WPDE.com, a website powered by ABC 15, recently wrote that the events in a hate crime "news" story published by Newswatch33 never happened. Here is a cached image of the article that appears to have been taken down. Snopes.com took a look at another article from Newswatch 33 that claimed that South Carolina church shooter Dylann Roof received $4 million in supporter donations. Snopes rated this claim False. Other claims from the website seem just as ludicrous. Why you can't buy rights to the Confederate flag There’s no evidence Hammerstein is really the Carters’ attorney, nor any other verifiable account of this story. Even if the quote were accurate -- which it’s not -- getting the rights to the Confederate flag would be a fool’s errand. Not even for $280 million? "No," said Christopher Jon Sprigman, a law professor at New York University. "Because the flag was created under the laws of the Confederacy, even if there was a copyright on this, it’s a question of whether it would still be covered (by that copyright)," Sprigman said. The particular design that we now associate with the Confederacy was actually rejected as the Confederate States of America’s national flag in 1861. Designed by South Carolinian Rep. William Porcher Miles, it was later an unofficial emblem of General Robert E. Lee’s army in Virginia. It is unclear whether Porcher legally laid claim to his design, but either way, federal law only protects an author’s copyright for 70 years after his or her death. The Porcher estate’s claim to the flag has long run out; he died in 1899. Just like the American flag, the Confederate flag is now in the public domain, free to reproduce and distribute. Furthermore, it would be extremely difficult to file a trademark on the flag. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), "a refusal (of the trademark) must be issued if the design would be perceived by the public as a flag." We could only find one instance throughout history of a flag being successfully copyrighted: Australian artist Harold Thomas sought and won the exclusive rights to the flag he created for Australia’s Aboriginal people. Our ruling Newswatch33 reported that "Jay-Z and Beyonce Attempt to Buy Rights to Confederate Flag to Prevent Further Use." The website has published dubious stories before, and this seems to be yet another fabrication. We were unable to locate the story’s main source, and the power couple’s legal teams have said nothing about the matter. It is impossible to purchase the right to the Confederate Flag, a public domain item. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2015-07-09T14:55:26	2015-07-09	['None']
pomt-01738	Says U.S. Rep. Ann McLane Kuster used $293,000 of taxpayer money to send campaign mail.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/aug/04/marilinda-garcia/gop-challenger-marilinda-garcia-says-us-rep-kuster/	Voters in New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District are accustomed to getting a bundle of campaign mailings when election season rolls around every two years. The 2nd District seat has changed hands three times in the last decade. It was captured most recently by Democrat Ann McLane Kuster, who spent nearly $3.2 million in her bid to defeat former Republican Congressman Charles Bass. All that politicking means it’s not unusual for voters to find lots of glossy campaign material in the mailbox as the November election approaches. But when a full-color postcard bearing Kuster’s name and likeness was distributed at taxpayer expense, it drew fire from her opponents. The campaign staff for one of Kuster’s GOP opponents, Marilinda Garcia, accused Kuster of using taxpayer money to send campaign mail, which would be a violation. Kuster "used 293K of your tax $ for campaign mail," tweeted Tom Szold, Garcia’s campaign manager. We decided this was a job for PolitiFact. Rules in place for more than a century allow U.S. senators and representatives to use federal money to communicate with their constituents, using their signature to take the place of postage on mass mailings. The Congressional "frank" -- as the privilege is called -- is meant to allow elected officials to keep voters apprised of what’s going on in Washington. Politicians are forbidden from using the privilege for campaigning or self promotion. Kuster’s use of franked mail came under scrutiny by the New Hampshire Union Leader, which reported in June 2013 that Kuster has spent close to $293,000 on franked communications -- six times more than the rest of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation combined, the newspaper reported. The paper highlighted a postcard encouraging constituents to visit Kuster’s website and sign up for her electronic newsletter. Rules of the frank Congress has wrestled for decades with the question of what material is appropriate to send with taxpayer money without crossing into the realm of electioneering. Most recently, a six-member commission on Congressional mailing standards authored a detailed manual in 1998 laying out guidelines for material that can be sent using the frank. Guidelines in the manual discourage politicians from using their names or referring to themselves -- or even using a personal pronoun -- more than eight times on a single page. The regulations also prohibit most autobiographical material, reports on family life, personal hobbies or community service activities. Politicians also are prohibited from using franked mail for birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence messages or holiday greetings. When it comes to political content, franked mail cannot contain specific references to past or future campaigns or elections, including re-election announcements and schedules of campaign related events. Politicians are asked to avoid "excessive" use of party labels -- defined as generally being more than two per page -- and materials used in campaign literature or campaign pledges or promises, including photos, logos and slogans, can’t be reproduced in franked mail. Before any communications are authorized, they must be reviewed by the Franking Commission, a body established under the Committee on House Administration. Staff members serving under both Democratic and Republican committee members review the material to ensure it adheres to the guidelines. Kuster’s communications Politifact New Hampshire analyzed 26 franked communications Kuster was authorized to send out since she took office in 2013. They ranged from welcome letters for new residents -- offering her assistance ordering flags or planning visits to Washington D.C. -- to newsletters, surveys and scripts for telephone town halls. Kuster was also authorized to use her franking privilege to purchase several advertisements on Facebook asking constituents to "Like" her Facebook page. "Granite Staters have a problem solver in Congress. Like my page and follow me!" reads one advertisement that was authorized in 2013. It was accompanied by a photo of the Congressional seal. Garcia’s campaign argues the franked communications raise red flags because they don’t offer specific explanations of Kuster’s policy positions, and instead make generic statements that have the ring of election stumping. Garcia’s camp also criticized Kuster for using franked mail to invite residents to follow her social media accounts, and for including material that resembles her campaign literature. Szold said that the talking points used in Kuster’s 2014 re-election campaign mirror the subjects she has highlighted in her franked communications. Kuster’s spokeswoman, Rosie Hilmer, defended the use of franked mail, saying it helps Kuster advocate for the needs of her constituents in Washington. She pointed out that every piece of mail undergoes a rigorous approval process by the Franking Commission. "Franked mail is an important tool that gives Congresswoman Kuster an opportunity to communicate directly with her constituents and let them know about important resources and issues they care about," Hilmer said. Campaign-like statements We couldn’t find any flagrant violations of the franking commission’s guidelines, but Garcia’s campaign has a point that some statements that appear in Kuster’s franked mail bear resemblance to material in her campaign literature. For example, when Kuster was campaigning in 2012, she wrote in an op-ed published in The Telegraph that she hoped to "bring a new approach to Washington that’s focused on common-sense solutions to create jobs, strengthen our economy and grow the middle class." Similar language appears in a constituent survey that was authorized by the Franking Commission in 2013. It reads: "Your voice matters and helps me as I work with members of both parties to find common sense solutions to help create jobs, grow New Hampshire's economy, and strengthen our middle class." When she was seeking to advertise an upcoming job fair in 2013, Kuster prepared a robocall script that stated her "top priority in Congress is helping create jobs and opportunity for middle class families." A similar phrase now appears on Kuster’s 2014 campaign website, which states that since taking office, "Annie has made creating jobs and opportunity for Granite State families her number one priority." The campaign website indicates that Kuster is focused on passing measures to grow New Hampshire’s economy and create middle class jobs -- a package of legislation Kuster refers to as her "Jobs and Opportunity Agenda." Kuster also referenced her "Jobs and Middle Class Opportunity Agenda" in an automated phone call that was authorized by the Franking Commission in 2014, and highlighted her "Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Agenda" in a piece of franked mail. Another automated phone call authorized by the Franking Commission focused on women’s issues. "I'm holding a live Telephone Town Hall to share with you my Women's Economic Agenda and hear your thoughts on how we can level the playing field for New Hampshire women," the script reads. Kuster’s 2014 campaign website contains similar language. "Annie also recently unveiled an Economic Agenda for Women and Families, which advocates support for critical reforms that will help level the playing field for Granite State women and their families," it reads. Our ruling Marilinda Garcia’s campaign said that Kuster uses taxpayer money to send campaign mail. Kuster did spend a good deal more on franked mail than other members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, and some of the language that appears in those communications is similar or identical to language used in her campaign materials. In the same vein, some of the subjects that came up in Kuster’s newsletters and telephone town halls track closely with the issues highlighted on her campaign website, such as student loan debt, support for veterans, advocacy on women’s issues and protection for Social Security and Medicare. But as Kuster’s spokeswoman pointed out, all of the franked communications were reviewed by a panel of both Republicans and Democrats, and those that were authorized weren’t found to violate any of the Franking Commission’s guidelines. Those guidelines are designed to ensure franked mail isn’t being used to support a reelection campaign. While some voters may have trouble distinguishing between Kuster’s franked mail and her campaign mail, it appears Kuster stayed within the letter of the law. The Franking Commission has not received any complaints about her communications, nor has it found she violated any rules. There’s an element of truth to Garcia’s statement, but overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Marilinda Garcia	None	None	None	2014-08-04T14:33:14	2014-06-27	['United_States']

pomt-11176	"I’ve lived" in Milwaukee "all 61 years of my life."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/23/andy-gronik/democratic-candidate-governor-says-he-lives-milwau/	When businessman Andy Gronik filed papers to run for governor, he listed his residence as N. Beach Drive in Fox Point, an upscale suburb in Milwaukee County. Gronik’s Twitter account and campaign website also say he lives in Fox Point, where his home has an assessed value of $1.4 million. But Gronik portrayed himself as much more urban at a May 13, 2018, education forum for the Democratic candidates for governor, which was co-hosted by the Milwaukee teachers union and partly focused on central city kids. He went so far as to say: "I’ve lived (in Milwaukee) all 61 years of my life." What’s going on here? When it comes to living in Fox Point or Milwaukee, Gronik seems to want it both ways. ‘Our neighborhood’ in MKE Gronik and lawyer Matt Flynn were the only candidates on the dais at one point during the forum, which was held at a theater on Milwaukee’s east side -- where Flynn has lived for nearly 40 years. In a wide-open primary contest with a crowded field, connecting with voters in heavily Democratic Milwaukee is important. Gronik and Flynn were asked their position on choice (also known as voucher) schools, which are focused on central city Milwaukee families who are unhappy with their neighborhood public schools, not suburban families. Flynn made it a point to say he is the only gubernatorial candidate who lives in the city. When it was his turn, Gronik said he would gradually wind down voucher schools in the city -- and suggested he lives in Milwaukee. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Gronik said: So, for me as governor, I’m going to focus resources on public schools -- and hear me on this -- stop the expansion of vouchers, sunset those things over five years. We have a real plan to make it happen. But I’m going to also make sure that we’re not taking any kid out of a productive learning environment until that school in their neighborhood is the best choice. I want to put it in just stark terms here, because I did speak to parents all throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee. And I’ll give it to you in just blank terms here. Black families are sick of white people telling them where to send their kids to school; that’s just the reality. So I am going to be a governor that’s going to fight for every kid. We have lost generations -- generations of children -- and we’re not losing another generation on my watch. So, in the context of choice schools in the city, Gronik says he "did speak to parents throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee." And the neighborhoods that he refers to as having "lost generations" of children are in Milwaukee. Not his neighborhood in Fox Point. ‘I’ve lived here’ A few minutes later, responding to a question about supporting unions for teachers, Gronik again gave the impression he lives in the city, saying: We need to make sure that we restore teachers’ voices in that classroom, (that) we spend more one-on-one time with those kids, that we have the resources to help kids that are at-risk; that before we lose another generation of children in my neighborhood, too -- I’ve lived here all 61 years of my life. And I’ve watched what’s happened with kids throughout these neighborhoods, our neighborhoods, kids that do not have the kind of bright future that they should have. It’s a huge reason I’m here. Again, Gronik’s reference to a lost generation, and to kids lacking a bright future, is to kids in the city, not "in my neighborhood" in Fox Point. Latest Gronik fact checks: "Black Americans still earn less than 73 percent of what white men make." Half True. Wisconsin 'guaranteeing' nearly $3 billion to Foxconn with no job guarantees. Half True. Scott Walker "has taken money away from internet expansion in our state." Mostly False. His explanation Gronik promptly called us when we told his campaign spokesman that we would be fact checking his claim that he’s lived in Milwaukee his whole life. He started off by acknowledging that he grew up in Glendale, another Milwaukee County suburb, and lives in Fox Point. Gronik also told us: 1. "As you well know, when I plug in my ZIP code (53217), it says Milwaukee." If you run a Google search of Gronik’s street address, depending on the website you choose, some responses show Fox Point while others show Milwaukee. But that doesn’t change the fact that Gronik lives in Fox Point, not Milwaukee. 2. "I consider Milwaukee to be my hometown. I’m not trying to suggest that I grew up other than where I grew up." Gronik is trying to have it both ways -- saying he’s from Milwaukee, but not denying that he grew up in a suburb (and now lives in another suburb). 3. "I’ve never made any bones about the fact that I live in Fox Point. I really think that you’re splitting hairs. I am in no way, shape or form misleading anybody as to my address. But I do consider everyone in Milwaukee County to be part of my community." If Gronik were asked in an airport in Atlanta where he lives, saying Milwaukee would be fine; most people have not heard of Fox Point. But in speaking to Milwaukee teachers about Milwaukee schools, to say you’re from the city when you really live in a high-income suburb, is misleading. Our rating Gronik told an audience made up largely of Milwaukee teachers at an education forum in Milwaukee: "I’ve lived here (in Milwaukee) all 61 years of my life." Gronik acknowledged to us that he grew up in one Milwaukee suburb, Glendale, and now lives in another, upscale Fox Point. "Milwaukee" as sort of a blanket term for the city and its close-in suburbs is not entirely wrong. But in the context of Gronik’s claim, it’s misleading. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-03111	"More than 400 car crashes occur each year on the current, congested Columbia River Bridge."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/20/dennis-richardson/are-there-400-crashes-interstate-bridge-each-year/	The Columbia River Crossing -- the maybe-dead-maybe-not proposed bridge project to connect Oregon and Washington -- is nothing if not controversial. Even the folks who agree that it’s needed can’t agree on how to pay for it. In a recent newsletter to his constituents, Oregon Rep. Dennis Richardson argued against Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber’s plan for Oregon to build the bridge on its own without a financial commitment from Washington. Richardson, a Republican, lists a number of reasons, ultimately concluding "I do not approve of the Governor's plan to go forward with the CRC Project." Even so, he mentions throughout the newsletter that there are several reasons a new bridge would be beneficial, calling it "a much-needed infrastructure project." As support, he notes the traffic accidents on the bridge. "More than 400 car crashes occur each year on the current, congested Columbia River Bridge," he wrote. "This exorbitant number of collisions results in broken cars, broken lives and broken hearts for hundreds of Oregonians and the families of those injured or killed in Columbia River Bridge traffic every year." This caught us by surprise. Some quick mental math and you realize that means there would have to be at least one accident a day on the bridge. Now, PolitiFact Oregon knows it’s a busy bridge, but we haven’t seen an accident on our many trips to the Washougal River this summer, so we decided to see if he had his stats right. Richardson got back to us straight away and explained that he’d gotten his figures from a September 2012 briefing on the Columbia River Crossing. He emailed us a copy of the document and indeed, it noted that "there are approximately 400 vehicle crashes per year in the CRC project area, making it one of the most accident-intensive sections of the corridor." We were able to verify this figure through Dave Thompson, spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation. He pointed us to a passage in the Columbia River Crossing’s final environmental impact report, which noted that during the five-year period between Jan. 1, 2002, and Dec. 31, 2006, "2,051 crashes were reported on mainline I-5 and its ramps within the CRC project area." If you take that figure and divide it by five, you wind up with 409 crashes a year on average during that time period -- or about 1.12 per day. Here’s the rub, though. That figure isn’t just for the bridge, it’s for the entire project area, a considerably larger area, it turns out. Thompson told us, and we did a little Google Map work to back check him, that the project area is close to five miles long while the bridge itself is about 2/3 of a mile. Naturally, we wondered, then, how many accidents actually occurred on the bridge. That took a little longer, but Thompson was able to get an answer for us. Over the same five-year time period, 248 crashes happened on the Washington side of the bridge and 294 happened on the Oregon side. That’s a total of 542 -- or an average of 108 per year. There are some caveats for this data, too. These figures don’t include accidents on the ramps and they were collected using DMV and police report data, meaning they won’t include unreported accidents. Still, the number of crashes on the bridge itself seems to be about a quarter of the number in the project area, which is the number Richardson cited. When we called Richardson to get his take, he said the numbers were never presented in a very clear way. He pointed to the environmental impact statement and the way it describes crashes as having been "reported on mainline I-5 and its ramps within the CRC project area." "I try my best to be honest and accurate," he said. Honestly, we agree, the data weren’t presented in the clearest of terms. And, to be fair, it’s not as though Richardson’s larger point about safety is completely invalid. There are an exceptional number of accidents occurring around the current Columbia bridge. According to the same environmental impact study, the crash rate in Washington’s project area is about 60 percent higher than it is on other similar highways, and in Oregon’s project area it’s about 50 percent higher. That said, Richardson wrote to constituents that "more than 400 car crashes occur each year on the current, congested Columbia River Bridge." That’s not even close. The statement is False.

pomt-04979	Says New Hampshire has the third-highest property tax in the country.	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/23/jackie-cilley/no-income-or-sales-tax-new-hampshire-does-rely-hea/	New Hampshire typically ranks among the wealthiest and healthiest states in the country, but, according to gubernatorial candidate Jackie Cilley, the Granite State boasts one distinction that isn’t as complimentary. In a candidate forum last week in Nashua, Cilley, a former state senator, took aim at New Hampshire’s tax structure and, specifically, the property tax, which she claimed ranks among the nation’s highest. "We have the third highest (property tax) in the country," Cilley, a Barrington Democrat, told the audience gathered Monday, July 16, 2012 at Nashua City Hall. "That is not the way to fund a government," she said. On its face, the claim seems feasible. New Hampshire is one of nine states in the country without an income tax. The Granite State is one of five without a statewide sales tax, and it’s one of only two, along with Alaska, without either. This leaves New Hampshire legislators leaning heavily -- too heavily, according to some -- on property taxes as a revenue source. But are the Granite State’s property taxes really the nation’s third highest? We decided to look at the numbers. Currently, New Hampshire is one of 37 states to charge property taxes at both the state and local level. Because the local taxes vary from town to town or county to county, it’s difficult to identify a total state property tax rate. Instead, tax analysts determine property tax rankings based on the average amounts collected from each taxpayer. And, based on 2009 data -- the most recent available -- New Hampshire property taxes do rank among the country’s highest. In 2009, the U.S. Census reported the state raised about $3.2 billion in total state and local property taxes, which ranked 42nd among the 50 states. But when you spread that among all New Hampshire residents, it works out to $2,424 per person, according to calculations by the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. That figure places the state third on the list -- behind only Connecticut, which averaged $2,498 per person in 2009, and New Jersey, which averaged $2,671 per person, according to the policy center. Numbers reported by the Tax Foundation differed slightly, showing New Hampshire’s average property tax bills at $2,440. However, that figure also ranked the Granite State’s property taxes as the third highest in the nation, also behind Connecticut and New Jersey. These rankings may show Cilley’s claim to be on track, but they don’t tell the whole story behind New Hampshire’s tax structure, analysts said. To paint a fuller picture of the Granite State’s tax climate, voters should consider all the state and local taxes, according to Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Based on the same 2009 Census data, New Hampshire ranked 23rd that year among states in terms of total local and state taxes, charging taxpayers an average of $3,765 per person, according to the center. Comparing that average to per capita income, state taxpayers pay about 8 percent of their income in taxes, according to the Tax Foundation ranks the Granite State 44th in the country in percent of income paid, meaning people in 43 states pay more of their earnings in taxes. "Property tax may be high (in New Hampshire), but there aren’t many other taxes, so the overall tax burden is pretty low," said Nick Kasprak, a Tax Foundation analyst. "I generally find it misleading to just rank based on a specific tax," added Rueben, of the Tax Policy Center. "New Hampshire will have high per capita property tax because it doesn't really have sales or income taxes." Our ruling: Cilley’s claim that New Hampshire has the nation’s third highest-property taxes is spot on. Using Census data, the leading tax advocacy organizations show that New Hampshire ranks third, behind only Connecticut and New Jersey, in property tax charges. It’s worth noting, though, that Cilley does not paint a full picture of the Granite State’s overall tax landscape. Looking at overall tax burden, New Hampshire residents fund the government with a relatively low percentage of their incomes in comparison to other states. We rate this statement True. Note: The original number reported for New Hampshire's total state and local property taxes was incorrect and has been changed.

pomt-11926	"Our tax code has nearly doubled since 1985."	true	/missouri/statements/2017/oct/17/roy-blunt/tax-code-so-long-nobodys-really-sure-its-length/	The tax code has been a big topic since President Donald Trump visited Missouri in August. Trump called for tax cuts and policies that he said would grow the economy. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., continues to voice these ideas to Missourians. Blunt said that Missourians need a tax code that is simple and fair. "Our tax code has nearly doubled since 1985," Blunt said in a tweet on Sept. 8, linking to an opinion piece with the same line from the Kansas City Star. Has tax code really doubled in 32 years? We decided to see if Blunt is right. Tax code We reached out to Blunt’s office and were pointed to an article from the Tax Foundation. "In 1955, the Internal Revenue Code stood at 409,000 words. Since then, it has grown to a total of 2.4 million words: almost six times as long as it was in 1955 and almost twice as long as in 1985," the website said. The Tax Foundation defines itself as an independent, nonprofit think tank. The Internal Revenue Code is a list of regulations that govern how taxes are submitted and collected. However, the Tax Foundation also points out that tax code isn’t the only thing that Americans must deal with to complete their taxes. It talks about the 7.7 million words of tax regulations from the IRS and the 60,000 pages of case law that is tax related. These are not law, but are also important pieces of understanding taxes. We wanted to dig a little deeper still. The length If you download the Internal Revenue Code from the United States Code, also known as Title 26 in the document, the file is 6,550 pages long. Not all of that is the text of the code itself, but that is still rather lengthy. Blunt definitely got it right that the code is long, but has it doubled since 1985? "Since it was last reformed in 1986, there have been thousands of additions and changes to the Tax Code over the last 30 years," said Caroline Bruckner, the Managing Director of the Kogod Tax Policy Center at American University. A report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service to Congress in 2008 about the complexity of the tax code, outlined how the word count of tax code has grown from 1.395 million words in 2001 to 3.7 million words when the report was done. That’s a 265 percent growth in word count in seven years. "The Code has grown so long that it has become challenging even to figure out how long it is," the report said. The report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service stated the length of the code has more than tripled since 1975. A similar report published in 2012 by the Taxpayer Advocate Service noted 4 million words at the time of the report. That is a 286 percent growth in word count from the 2001 figure. Why does it grow, though? Bruckner pointed to the continuous changes that are passed by Congress to raise revenue and address problems as well as the IRS publishing changes to tax rules yearly to factor in inflation. "Our tax laws are not static; and, in fact, when they are, they tend to create more problems than not for taxpayers. That’s one reason why Congress adjusts the Tax Code so often," she said. What’s the big deal? Why are politicians so fascinated with the size of a document? "Outdated tax policies are stifling our economy and taking money out of the pockets of hardworking Missourians," Blunt said in the article for the Kansas City Star. Some view the volume of the tax code as the problem, but others think it is the complexity of the code and the process of collecting taxes. Bruckner believes there are ways to streamline the taxation process. "The majority of adults in the U.S. now have a smartphone — who cares how long the tax code is if you could just pay your taxes using an app that tracks your expenses, deductions and credits for you? The challenge is how do we do that without compromising taxpayer privacy and security concerns," she said. The report from the IRS and the Taxpayer Advocate Service also discuss the amount of hours it takes Americans to complete their taxes and how much money it costs to hire people to assist. Our ruling Blunt said the tax code has nearly doubled since 1985. Government and independent reports suggest the number of words used in the tax grown has grown even more than that. We rate this claim True.	None	Roy Blunt	None	None	None	2017-10-17T10:37:15	2017-09-08	['None']

pomt-07316	"Eighty-seven percent of private insurance plans currently include (abortion) coverage."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/16/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-critical-house-bills-potential-i/	The use of federal dollars for most abortions has been prohibited since Congress first passed the Hyde Amendment, a "rider" attached annually to health appropriations bills, in 1976. A bill passed by the House this month would use the tax system and federal health care reform to extend restrictions to private insurance coverage. The "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," proposed by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., one of the House's leading abortion opponents, would not allow small businesses to deduct the cost of private employee insurance plans if the plans cover abortion. The tax deductibility of policies is the foundation of employer-provided health insurance. Sen. Sherrod Brown called the bill the "latest declaration of war on women." "Eighty-seven percent of private insurance plans currently include such coverage," the Ohio Democrat said in a fundraising letter to supporters. If that figure is true, the bill would tightly narrow the range of policy choices or lead insurance plans to drop abortion coverage. We wondered where it came from. Because Brown's statement came in a fundraising message, his office referred us to his sole current campaign worker, Sarah Benzing. She cited stories from the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times and other sources using the 87 percent figure, which is attributed to the Guttmacher Institute -- an independent nonprofit whose statistics are used by both sides of the abortion debate. The institute conducted a federally supported study in 2002 with the aim of "assessing levels of insurance coverage for a wide range of reproductive health services," and found that 87 percent of typical employer-based insurance policies "covered medically necessary or appropriate abortions." A similar study, cited by Guttmacher, was conducted at about the same time by the Kaiser Family Foundation and released as part of its 2003 Annual Employer Health Benefits Survey. It found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortion. The studies asked different questions, helping explain the disparity in results. While Guttmacher reported on policies, Kaiser counts covered workers. Membership in plans would not be evenly distributed. The bottom line, to the institute, is that "most Americans with employer-based insurance currently have coverage for abortion." So where does Brown’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? A study by the Kaiser Foundation yielded a much lower figure for coverage, but it is a percentage of covered workers, not plans. Brown’s claim specifically cites "87 percent of private insurance plans." His figure, widely cited in the news media, comes from an organization that both sides of the debate rely one for information. But while the source Brown used is widely cited, it is worth noting that it is not a recent study. The study, attributed to the Guttmacher Institute, was done nearly a decade ago. That’s an additional piece of information that helps put the data in context. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim as Mostly True.

pomt-06815	On how money from a possible lease of the Ohio Turnpike would be used	half flip	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/11/john-kasich/has-gov-john-kasich-veered-his-vow-use-turnpike-pr/	Gov. John Kasich has made no secret of his wish to privatize a number of state entities to create new revenue for the fiscally challenged state. One idea that he has revived is leasing the Ohio Turnpike to a private concern. State lawmakers helped pave the way in June by including an item in the state budget that allows the administration to pursue a lease or sale. The General Assembly would need to approve a request for proposals the administration is in the early stages of preparing, but the legislature will not have the opportunity to sign off on the final deal, still about 18 months off should Ohio reach an agreement. A key selling point for Kasich is that the billions of dollars the state would get for leasing the toll road would be pumped into improvements for the state’s roads, bridges and waterways and not used to fill state budget gaps. At least that’s what the Republican governor and his minions have said on more than one occasion. In a February speech in Columbus to the Ohio Newspaper Association, the governor said his ideal agreement would bring Ohio $3 billion. "I can take that money and I can put a billion dollars into infrastructure," he said. Kasich’s spokesman Rob Nichols told The Plain Dealer in March that the governor doesn’t favor using the onetime money to pay bills or to operate government. In April, Ohio Department of Transportation director Jerry Wray told the Toledo Blade’s editorial board that lease proceeds would be "dedicated" to infrastructure improvements such as highway construction and harbor dredging focused mainly in Northern Ohio. A fact sheet the administration prepared on the turnpike proposal in July just before Kasich visited Toledo to promote the leasing idea suggested the same: money would be used for infrastructure. It caught PolitiFact’s ear recently when Kasich began to switch his tune a bit. During that stop in Toledo, the governor for the first time suggested the lease money could be used to support other areas of the state budget. In an interview with The Plain Dealer last month, Kasich said: "It is my intention to use this money for infrastructure. But I never said where all this money was going to go. I’m just saying I want to put it in infrastructure -- the bulk will go into infrastructure. But with the federal government, God only knows what those people are capable of doing. If they blow a big hole in our state, we have to look at it. But it’s not my intention. "Look, we’re already balanced," he continued. "We already have a rainy day fund. We already have money beyond the budget that is appropriate. I don’t anticipate" having to use turnpike lease money for a budget deficit. "But I’m also not going to say, ’no way, no how.’ You always have to have a few options." The governor might be correct to exercise caution and leave his options open, considering the economy continues to be unpredictable for states like Ohio trying to climb from the grips of recession and fighting to stay below double-digit unemployment rates. But the idea of leasing the turnpike is a controversial plan opposed by many Northeast Ohio planning groups and political and civic leaders. They worry that the well-kept turnpike will suffer from higher tolls or lax maintenance if it falls into the hands of a private operator interested in maximizing profit. As far as the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency and its sister organizations are concerned, the turnpike isn’t broken, so don’t try to fix it. Kasich is sensitive to their concerns. His administration has tried to ease the tension by dispatching ODOT officials to the area to assure leaders in Northern Ohio, where the turnpike stretches from Pennsylvania to Indiana, that proceeds from the deal will be spent on infrastructure projects around the turnpike and that any private operator would be held to standards to maintain the reputation of the toll road.

pomt-08448	Marco Rubio says "Solo Ingles" (English only).	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/15/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-says-marco-rubio-too-extreme-florida/	Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek is launching a new series of attacks that say his Republican opponent Marco Rubio is "too extreme for Florida." The attacks are housed on Meek's campaign website and include a number of provocative claims -- that Rubio doesn't believe in global warming, that he wants to privatize Social Security, and that he wants to borrow $700 billion from China to fund "tax cuts for the rich." Those claims sound dubious, but we decided to focus on the attack Meek launched on Oct. 15, 2010. The website included an altered comic-like photo of Rubio standing in front of a border fence. The image has a word bubble coming from Rubio's mouth that says, "Solo Ingles," which means English only. The claim got our attention because Rubio is a child of Cuban immigrants who speaks both Spanish and English fluently. Rubio also has been airing an ad for his Senate campaign in Spanish. So we wondered if it is true. There's no doubt Rubio supports English as the official language of the United States. In June 2009, Rubio said, "We have to have a common language that unites the people,'' and said that language should be English. In September 2009, Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Burgos reiterated that position, which Rubio again confirmed during a Univision debate. "Marco believes learning English is essential for success in the United States, and should be the official and unifying language of America," Burgos told a reporter. But while there's no doubt Rubio supports English as the official language, there's also no doubt he opposes any proposal to ban other languages. From that same June 2009 interview -- "I'm not in favor of banning other languages, but my name is spelled the same way in Spanish as it is in English." And then again from the Univision debate in September -- "That doesn't mean English only," he says. "People should learn as many languages as they can … But the most important thing that recent arrivals can do for their children is make them proficient in the English language." What's the impact of making English the official language? Not much. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has examined this question several times, most recently in January 2007. It concluded that designating English the "official" or "national" language would have no practical impact. An official designation alone would not cancel government programs, for instance -- although several pieces of separate legislation proposed in Congress would repeal some federal mandates on things such as non-English ballots. Rubio hasn't staked out a position on anything like that. Instead, Rubio supports making English the official language of the United States, but says he wouldn't want to ban other languages. We don't think that equals an "English only" policy. English, for instance, already is the official language of the state of Florida (been that way since 1988), yet the state publishes driver's license forms, state voting materials and public school districts information all in Spanish. We rate the claim Falso (False).	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-10-15T17:33:30	2010-10-15	['Marco_Rubio', 'England']
pomt-04068	"Poverty levels (are) at an all-time high."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/23/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-poverty-us-all-time-high/	The rich should pay more taxes because of rising income inequality, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in a Jan. 7, 2013, interview on MSNBC. Sanders’ comments came after anchor Thomas Roberts asked him whether he, President Barack Obama and Democratic lawmakers are ready to "go after corporations that in some cases pay no taxes at all." Roberts asked, "Do Democrats smell blood in the water here?" Sanders responded, "Well, Thomas, it's not smelling blood in the water. What it is is looking at reality, and the reality is that we have growing wealth and income inequality in America. People on top in large corporations doing phenomenally well. Middle class disappearing. Poverty levels at an all-time high." The part of Sanders’ comment that caught our eye was that "poverty levels" are "at an all-time high." We wondered, is that really the case? Is it really higher now than during the Great Depression? So we looked at U.S. Census Bureau data. This data goes back only to 1959 -- which poses the first problem for Sanders’ claim. Because the federal government did not calculate poverty statistics before then -- here’s a brief history of how the statistic came about, and some of the critiques of it -- we don’t have official data for much of the nation’s history, including, for instance, the Great Depression. This is problematic because Sanders used the phrase, "an all-time high." There’s a second problem: The poverty rate in the most recent year, 2011, isn’t even the highest rate since the data began in 1959. In 2011, the poverty rate was 15.0 percent. Here are the other years that matched or exceeded that rate: 2010: 15.1 percent 1993: 15.1 percent 1983: 15.2 percent 1982: 15.0 percent 1964: 19.0 percent 1963: 19.5 percent 1962: 21.0 percent 1961: 21.9 percent 1960: 22.2 percent 1959: 22.4 percent In other words, the rate in 2011 was tied for the 10th-highest since 1959. And while poverty in 2010 was the highest it had been in 17 years, it actually dropped, albeit slightly, between 2010 and 2011. In fairness, we should note that Medicare started in the mid 1960s and Social Security was indexed for inflation in the 1970s, and poverty rates haven’t been as high since then. Sanders vigorously defends both programs. When we asked Sanders’ office to explain how they came up with the statistic, a spokesman said the senator was referring to the overall number of people living in poverty, not the rate as a percentage of the national population. "In 2010 and 2011, more Americans lived in poverty than at any time on record," said spokesman Jeff Frank. "That was the point that the senator was making." It’s correct that the raw number of Americans in poverty hit a high in 2010, since data began, though the number fell modestly in 2011, from 46.3 million to 46.2 million, according to the Census Bureau. We asked economist Tara Sinclair of George Washington University whether it’s reasonable to justify what Sanders said by referring to total numbers of people rather than the rate. She noted that Sanders did say "levels," rather than "rates," which could be interpreted as being consistent with using raw numbers. "There are reasons to care about the sheer number of poor people, even if the growth in the number of poor people is in part due to population growth," Sinclair said. But she added that the rise in population shouldn’t be discounted, either. "There are more people in the U.S. than ever before, and that's why people often look at rates," she said. Our ruling The numbers do not entirely support Sanders’ claim. The best evidence in his favor is that the raw numbers of Americans in poverty hit an all-time high in 2010, at least since records have kept. However, they fell modestly in 2011, the most recent year available. Meanwhile, the sweeping nature of Sanders’ comment -- that "poverty levels (are) at an all-time high" -- is problematic. If you factor in population growth, the rate of Americans in poverty in 2011 was only the 10th-highest since 1959. And it’s impossible to know how many years prior to 1959 were higher, including the Great Depression. On balance, we rate Sanders’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-07235	House Republicans required the use of Styrofoam cups in House cafeterias that are "part of Koch Industries."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/01/jim-moran/rep-moran-says-gop-requires-use-cups-house-cafeter/	At a recent Democrat-sponsored rally to end "corporate dominance of our Democracy" at George Mason University, Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, used Styrofoam to make a point. Lecturing on what he sees as the growing influence of corporations, Moran suggested a link between between the billionaire Koch brothers of Kansas -- the influential conservative owners of Koch Industries -- and a recent preference for Styrofoam in House of Representatives cafeterias. "As soon as the Republicans took over the House of Representatives, they threw out all of the biodegradable utensils we were using in the cafeterias and they required us to buy Styrofoam cups and plates and so on that are manufactured by Dixie, and, in fact, this is part of Koch Industries," he said. Moran added: "The CEO was one of the partners of Koch Industries that is now benefiting from what we have to buy because we’re basically a captive audience in the House of Representatives." That sounds like a conspiracy theory worthy of an Oliver Stone movie. But a PolitiFact check is the best we can offer. We asked Moran’s press secretary where the congressman came up with his information. She didn’t get back to us. Moran’s initial statement begs two questions: 1) Did GOP leaders require the government to buy Styrofoam products from Dixie; and if so, 2) does Koch Industries benefit from that decision? Now for the answers. When Republicans took control of the House in January, House Administration Committee Chairman Dan Lungren, R-Calif., suspended the chamber’s composting program, part of the "Green the Capitol" initiative launched by former House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The program -- which required use of biodegradable corn-based cups, dishes and utensils in the cafeteria -- was costing $475,000 a year to run and a review revealed that it had increased the House’s overall energy consumption, Lungren said. Democrats were quick to pounce on the decision as environmentally unfriendly, even though the move had been recommended by outgoing Administration Committee Chairman Robert A. Brady of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, in December. The decision did in fact lead to a move to Styrofoam. Beyond that piece of truth, however, Moran’s claim runs into serious problems. First, Republicans didn’t make the decision to go to Styrofoam, much less to a Koch-related company. Instead, Restaurant Associates, a company that manages the cafeterias, was given discretion to do what they wanted. "We just said, `Look, you don’t have to use compostable -- it’s not working. It’s increasing our energy, it’s not reducing our carbon emissions, and it’s costing a half a million dollars a year,’" said Salley Wood, spokeswoman for the House Administration Committee. "Of course, they’re going to go to the most cost-effective" products, she said. They went with WinCup, which makes Styrofoam products. And while Dixie is a brand under Georgia-Pacific, owned by Koch Industries, WinCup has no affiliation whatsoever with Dixie apart from the fact that its owner, George Wurtz, years ago served as executive vice president at Georgia-Pacific, which was acquired by Koch Industries in 2005, a year before he left. "Restaurant Associates is not currently using Dixie products," said Dan Weiser, a spokesman for the House chief administrative officer. So let’s look back. Moran claims that upon taking the House, Republicans "required" a move to Styrofoam products made by Dixie, a brand under the Koch Industries umbrella. Problem is, he’s wrong about everything. The vendor, not House Republicans, decided to move to Styrofoam as a cost consideration after the composting program was discontinued for its ineffectiveness and high costs. And even that decision was based on a recommendation by Democrats. Next, the company the vendor chose, WinCup, is not at all related to Dixie or Koch Industries, and is in fact a competitor. The fact that the man who owns WinCup once worked for a company that was bought by Koch Industries is irrelevant. Moran must have been wearing a tin foil hat on the day he came up with this one.

pomt-11131	Says the California state auditor "found (John) Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars," as state controller.	half-true	/california/statements/2018/jun/01/gavin-newsom/did-john-chiang-lose-track-31-billion-californias-/	In a recent TV attack ad in the California governor’s race, Gavin Newsom’s campaign claimed "the state auditor found (John) Chiang lost track of $31 billion," when he was state controller. But did the ad get its facts straight? Here’s the full text of the TV spot: Narrator: "As California Controller, John Chiang’s job was to count the money. But the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars. That’s right. Billion with a "B." And Chiang made tens of billions in accounting errors. What was John Chiang paying attention to? His special interest campaign contributors. The Sacramento Bee found Chiang gave millions in tax breaks to big developers who gave big money to John Chiang’s campaign. John Chiang for Governor? Doesn’t add up. This is a screen shot from the ad. View the full ad by the Gavin Newsom for Governor campaign here. In this fact check, we focused on the ad’s eye-popping claim: the state auditor found Chiang, who is now state treasurer, "lost track of $31 billion." Background on candidates Newsom is a Democrat, the state’s lieutenant governor and a former mayor of San Francisco. He has consistently led in the polls in the race for governor — a late May survey showed him 13 percentage points ahead of second place Republican businessman John Cox. He was 26 points ahead of Chiang, who was next-to-last among the race’s prominent candidates. Recently, Newsom said he’d prefer to face a Republican in the November run-off, making his attacks on Democrats like Chiang appear to be part of his strategy. Chiang has served as treasurer since January 2015. Before that, he was the state’s controller, akin to the state’s chief financial officer, for eight years. The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff. Our research Asked for evidence that "the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion," Newsom’s campaign pointed to a May 2014 news article by CBS13, a Sacramento TV station. It was headlined "$31.65 Billion: California Accounting Errors Higher Than Combined GDP Of Jamaica, Iceland." The CBS13 article refers to a scathing May 2014 report by the California State Auditor’s Office that found deficiencies in the state’s internal financial reporting practices. The mistakes ranged from understating liabilities, to miscalculating debt payments, to a data-entry error that added three extra zeros to a revenue figure, changing it from millions of dollars to billions. "The number and magnitude of errors we found indicate the Controller’s Office lacks a sufficient review process to prevent and detect significant errors," Deputy State Auditor John Collins concluded in the report, which was submitted to Gov. Jerry Brown and top state lawmakers. Collins did not respond to requests for an interview. Stacking up $31 billion The state audit and a 2014 Sacramento Bee article, which summarized the audit, were both referenced in the ad. The Bee article used a less sensational headline: Audit: State Controller’s Office accounting riddled with errors, and had no mention of a $31 billion dollar figure. The audit itself does not literally say Chiang "lost track of $31 billion." The ad, however, overlays "$31 Billion" in large, bold numerals at the top of an image of the auditor’s report. The numbers even pop out at the viewer at one point. That $31 billion figure comes from the TV station’s article, which added up the dollar amounts of key mistakes cited in the audit. Here’s how CBS13 arrived at $31 billion: "The audit revealed: -- $7.7 billion – Understated federal trust fund revenues and expenditures -- $653 million – Overstated general fund assets and revenues -- $8 billion – Overstated California State University’s bond debt -- $9.1 billion – Reporting error that understated a public building construction fund Also there was a deferred tax-revenue figure posted as $6.2 billion when it was actually $6.2 million. All told, that’s more than $31 billion in mistakes." We checked and found all of those figures in the audit. More to the story There’s some truth to the ad’s claim, given the critical nature of the audit and the large dollar figure mistakes it found. But the use of the phrase "lost track of $31 billion" is somewhat questionable. It could leave the impression that Chiang’s actions led to the state actually losing that money, which it did not. The spot also omits the fact that Chiang’s office acknowledged the problems and was taking steps to correct them. "The (state controller’s office) concurs with the California State Auditor’s (CSAs) notation and believes that the challenges of high staff turnover and in recruiting qualified staff significantly contributed to the issues identified," the 2014 audit said. "Other contributing factors included budget cuts and denial of financial resources, as well as poor quality and late submission of the financial data by numerous agencies." What did subsequent audits show? In March 2015, the state auditor’s office released another report that "concludes that the State continues to experience certain deficiencies in its accounting and administrative practices that affect its internal controls over financial reporting." That report blamed agencies such as the Department of Education for inaccurate financial reporting, though it did not directly criticize the controller’s office. Subsequent auditor reports show apparent improvement in Chiang’s final years as treasurer and those immediately after. In its March 2017 report, for example, the auditor’s report "did not identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies" in financial reporting for the fiscal year that ended in June 2016. Response from Chiang’s campaign Chiang’s campaign downplayed the significance of the 2014 audit report. They said a separate document, called a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, issued later that year was more reflective of the performance of the controller’s office. "Nobody is more a financial expert in the state than John," Chiang’s campaign spokesman Fabien Levy said. "Nobody is more obsessed with getting the numbers right." Our ruling A TV attack ad by Gavin Newsom’s campaign for governor claims "the state auditor found Chiang lost track of $31 billion dollars," when he was state controller. A 2014 state audit supports part of the claim. It criticized the state controller’s office for understating billions of dollars in liabilities, miscalculating debt payments and making other errors. A TV news station added up some of the highest dollar figure mistakes and presented them as "$31.65 billion in errors." The state audit did not literally say the controller’s office made "$31 billion" in mistakes, nor did it imply that the money was permanently lost under Chiang, but instead that his office made numerous accounting mistakes. The ad also ignored that Chiang’s office, according to the audit, acknowledged the mistakes, worked to fix them and blamed the errors on staffing shortages. Newsom’s claim is partially accurate. But it takes information in the audit out of context and ignores key details. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.	None	Gavin Newsom	None	None	None	2018-06-01T13:09:08	2018-05-21	['California']
pomt-00074	Says Ken Paxton "shut down the world’s largest human trafficking marketplace."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/nov/01/ken-paxton/ken-paxton-airs-mostly-false-claim-about-texas-shu/	Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton approached Election Day with a warning about his Democratic challenger and a global crow about his own crime-fighting prowess. In a TV ad, Paxton accuses Democrat Justin Nelson of running a negative campaign — and then goes negative on Nelson’s "liberal agenda." The narrator closes by saying Paxton "shut down the world’s largest human trafficking marketplace." We were curious. Did Texas’ attorney general really do that? Jordan Berry, a Paxton campaign consultant, responded to our request for factual backup with an email stating the claim ties to the shuttering in April 2018 of Backpage.com, a classified ads website founded by Arizona-based partners in 2004 that especially flourished by posting ads focused on sex, Politico noted in a July 2018 story. Berry also pointed out another Paxton TV ad in which the narrator says Paxton "helped" shut down the "criminal enterprise." Largest trafficking marketplace? Human trafficking, Homeland Security says, "involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act." We didn’t spot confirmation in the materials offered by Berry that Backpage.com was the "world’s largest human trafficking marketplace." More limited: A 2017 U.S. Senate staff report that Berry pointed out deemed the site the "leading online marketplace for commercial sex." The report further says: "Operating in 97 countries and 943 locations worldwide—and last valued at more than a half-billion dollars—Backpage is the world’s second-largest classified advertising website. Backpage is involved in 73% of all child trafficking reports that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) receives from the general public (excluding reports by Backpage itself). The National Association of Attorneys General has aptly described Backpage as a ‘hub’ of ‘human trafficking, especially the trafficking of minors.’" For our part, we weren’t sure how to determine whether the site broke out to be the largest human trafficking marketplace. Among experts on trafficking, Laura Agustín, who has studied migrants and sex work, responded to our query with an email saying that individuals turned to ads on the Backpage site for varied reasons. "There is no ‘marketplace,’" Agustín wrote, "but rather all sorts of people selling and buying sex for their own reasons, some of them miserable." Other experts told us there’s no research to support Paxton’s largest trafficking marketplace characterization. Alexandra Levy, a University of Notre Dame adjunct professor who studies trafficking, said by email that as an empirical matter, you’d need to examine every "human trafficking marketplace" for comparison. Also, Levy said, "the general idea that Backpage was a cesspool of sexual exploitation is unfounded. It was certainly a place where law enforcement found a lot of victims -- but that might just be because it was a particularly visible venue," Levy wrote. Peter M. Zollman of Advanced Interactive Media Group, consultants in classified advertising and interactive media, said by phone that while there were instances of trafficking linked to ads placed on the Backpage site, there’s no proof that the site was a major conduit for trafficking. Zollman speculated that if any website leads the world in human trafficking, it’s one that’s on the dark web, which isn’t visible to search engines. Calling Backpage.com the world’s largest trafficking marketplace, Zollman said, is an "outright fabrication." Checking Paxton’s role So, did Paxton shut down Backpage.com? His agency had a hand in the shutdown, we confirmed, but the federal government did the deed. Berry noted that before the site and company were shut down, Paxton in 2016 established a unit in the attorney general’s office to combat human trafficking. Next, in October 2016, Paxton announced that in tandem with California authorities, Texas had arrested Backpage’s CEO, Carl Ferrer. The Texas attorney general’s office said in a press release about Ferrer’s arrest that a joint investigation by the offices of the Texas and California attorneys general "uncovered evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution through escort ads that appeared repeatedly on Backpage." The release also said: "Nearly three dozen members of the Texas Attorney General’s Law Enforcement Unit participated in Ferrer’s arrest and the execution of a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of Backpage, which is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States." An April 2018 seizure and shutdown We also clicked online to the defunct Backpage site, which we found mostly covered up by a message, dated April 6, 2018, indicating that Texas played a supporting role in shutting down the site and company. The message says that backpage.com "and affiliated websites have been seized as part of an enforcement action by the" FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Internal Revenue Service. The Texas AG’s office was mentioned in the message’s next section stating that agencies participating in and supporting the enforcement action "include the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, the office of the California Attorney General and the office of the Texas Attorney General." Our click on the message itself bounced us to an April 9, 2018 DOJ press release headlined, "Justice Department Leads Effort to Seize Backpage.Com, the Internet’s Leading Forum for Prostitution Ads, and Obtains 93-Count Federal Indictment." That release quotes Jeff Sessions, the U.S. attorney general, saying that on April 6, 2018, the Justice Department seized Backpage, which had been the "dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults." Now, Sessions said, "it can no longer be used by criminals to promote and facilitate human trafficking." The release closes: "The effort to seize Backpage was led by the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona, with significant support from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, the office of the California Attorney General, and the office of the Texas Attorney General." Levy, the Notre Dame expert, told us separately: "Paxton did not shut down Backpage -- the federal government did." Levy added that when Backpage.com was closed, the relevant federal law, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, didn’t generally give state attorneys general "the power to prosecute platforms (like Backpage) for content posted by third parties," though Congress subsequently amended the law, Levy wrote. Summing up, Levy said the Texas AG "could not by any stretch be credibly considered a primary enforcer" in the Backpage.com shutdown. What role, Texas? If Texas didn’t shut down Backpage by itself, we asked, what role did it play? Paxton, we confirmed, was focused on the company years before the shutdown. In an October 2016 press release pointed out to us by Kayleigh Lovvorn, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general’s office, Paxton announced that Ferrer had been taken into custody on a California arrest warrant after he arrived in Houston on a flight from abroad. "A lengthy joint investigation" by the Texas and California attorney general offices "uncovered evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution," the release said, "through escort ads" on Backpage.com. The release said nearly 36 AG employees participated in Ferrer’s arrest and in executing a search warrant on the Dallas headquarters of Backpage, "which is considered the largest advertiser of adult escort services in the United States," the release said. At the time, an Associated Press news story said Ferrer had agreed to be extradited from Texas to California to face sex-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The story, citing a sworn statement filed by the Texas AG’s office for a search warrant, also said that the online ad portal received more than 90 percent of its revenue from the adult escort ad portion of its classified advertising business. The story said Ferrer "was told directly by law enforcement officials about prostitution on the site and," according to the Texas affidavit, is "regularly copied on the hundreds of law enforcement subpoenas and requests that Backpage.com receives each year related to prostitution and sex trafficking of both adults and minors on the website," the story said. California authorities said that state's three-year investigation found many of the ads involve victims of sex trafficking including children younger than 18, the story said. State plea bargain From Berry, we fielded what he described as filings demonstrating that action spearheaded in state court by the Texas attorney general’s office led to Ferrer agreeing to shut down Backpage. The documents were filed April 9, 2018 in a Nueces County state district court--three days after authorities shut down Backpage though the same day Sessions announced that shutdown. They include a "Plea Bargain Agreement" in which Ferrer agreed to immediately take steps to permanently shut down Backpage.com globally. Ferrer also pleaded guilty to money laundering and, granted "use immunity," agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in Texas and California. According to another document filed with the court, Ferrer pleaded guilty to trafficking and engaging in organized criminal activity in what the document described as actions related to one minor compelled to do sex work in connection with Backpage.com. We asked Levy to review the provided documents. Do they demonstrate Paxton’s agency steered the multi-government effort to close Backpage? Levy said not, writing: "The feds had already seized Backpage by the time those pleas were signed." Our ruling Paxton says he "shut down the world’s largest human trafficking marketplace." We see an element of truth to this claim: The Texas attorney general’s office helped shut down the Backpage website, which is what another Paxton ad says. However, the federal government led the shutdown and officials in other states pitched in. Significantly too, we otherwise landed no confirmation that the Backpage site, which profited from ads about sex, also was the world’s largest trafficking marketplace--a classification that experts found dubious and unverifiable.

pomt-01746	Rhode Island's state pension system "underperformed the median three out of the four years that Mr. [Frank] Caprio was in office."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/03/seth-magaziner/seth-magaziner-says-state-pension-investments-earn/	In the Democratic primary contest for Rhode Island's general treasurer, in which former treasurer Frank Caprio is looking to get his old job back, challenger Seth Magaziner is making the past performance of the state's pension fund an issue. During a debate that aired July 13, 2014 on WPRI-TV, Magaziner claimed that when Caprio oversaw the fund, its performance was below par. "Our state's pension system has been underperforming our peers for years," Magaziner said. After some back-and-forth with Caprio, who disputed figures Magaziner cited, Magaziner made this statement: "Whether you measure it by calendar year or by fiscal year," he said, "we underperformed the median three out of the four years that Mr. Caprio was in office." (The median is the "middle" number in a ranked list.) Before we begin, we should note that we will be dealing with two definition of "year" -- the calendar year that begins Jan. 1 and the state fiscal year, which begins July 1. Caprio was in office for four full calendar years and three full fiscal years, the periods that are relevant. When we asked Magaziner's campaign for his supporting documentation, it sent us a spreadsheet with the earnings from 107 state plans for the fiscal years 2007 to 2011 based on information from Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. "The data clearly shows that in only in one of the years when he was in office did Mr. Caprio (barely) outperform most other states, hence Seth's assertion of 'three out of the four years Mr. Caprio was in office,'" said Evan England, Magaziner's campaign manager. But that list turned out to be less than accurate. When we forwarded the spreadsheet to Caprio for comment, he quickly found 11 plans in 9 states that were not valid comparisons because their rate of return was calculated using a different fiscal year than Rhode Island's. "This is like using the score from the 5th inning of a baseball game and saying that's the final score," Caprio said. In response, the Magaziner campaign sent us an updated list that eliminated 25 of the 107 plans. "Unfortunately for Mr. Caprio, the result is the same. The R.I. plan still underperforms the median four out of the five fiscal years he was in office," said England. Yet he was referring to two fiscal years during which Caprio wasn't in office for half the period. Even that new list wasn't perfect. Nebraska was still included even though its reporting year is out of synch with Rhode Island's and Massachusetts was dropped from the list even though it should have stayed on. It should be noted that during the three fiscal years when only Caprio was in office, the rates of return for the Rhode Island plans were always within 1 percentage point of the median. Magaziner's campaign also offered as evidence an analysis comparing Rhode Island's rates of return (based on reports from the Rhode Island State Investment Commission) to a national index developed by Wilshire Associates, a respected California-based investment management firm. By that measure, Rhode Island underperformed in three out of four calendar years, as Magaziner said. (The exception was Caprio's first year in office.) During the three fiscal years when Caprio served a full term, Rhode Island underperformed the Wilshire during the first two years, one fewer than Magaziner claimed. How reliable is the Wilshire index? "It’s among the largest and most representative indexes for measuring institutional investment performance," said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. However, Brainard cautioned that comparison is difficult because, if nothing else, each pension plan has its own unique mix of investments based on its needs. "Really, the best benchmark is its own internal benchmark" which is determined in advance based on that investment mix, Brainard said. So we checked that. Monthly reports for Rhode Island's investment plan, compiled by State Street Investment Analytics, show that Rhode Island's performance was lower than its own benchmark in two of the four calendar years (2007 and 2009) Caprio was on the job. It was also lower than the benchmark during two of the three complete fiscal years of Caprio’s tenure. By that measure, it's Magaziner's criticism that underperforms. In response, Caprio noted that the overall rate of return for the three fiscal years he served as treasurer was -4.63 percent, compared to the State Street's benchmark of -5.28 percent, which means that the state lost less money than the benchmark during the recession. Magaziner's campaign responded by saying that the benchmark in the investment commission report "has nothing to do with Rhode Island's performance relative to other public pension funds." Our ruling Seth Magaziner said that Rhode Island's state pension system "underperformed the median three out of the four years that Mr. Caprio was in office," which is the claim we're checking. There is no uncontested gold standard against which the "median" can be determined. Using the benchmarks Magaziner wants to use -- Boston College's data on pension returns in other states and the respected Wilshire index -- Magaziner is off the mark a bit, in part because Magaziner wants to count fiscal years in which Caprio wasn't serving a full term as treasurer. But the government pension experts with whom we spoke cautioned that such comparisons are not always fair, because different plans use different investing strategies based on their history and funding requirements. If you look at the predetermined benchmark used for Rhode Island's plan, the state's pension program performed below the median in two of the four calendar years that Caprio was in office, and in two of the three full fiscal years that included his tenure. The bottom line: The state’s plan underperformed benchmarks, as Magaziner said, but not quite as often as he said. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, such as an alternative measure of success that tells a slightly different story, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15363	"Hundreds of thousands of (illegal immigrants are) going to state and federal penitentiaries."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/trump-immigration-claim-has-no-data-back-it/	Despite the backlash, Donald Trump has remained steadfast in his position that illegal immigrants from Mexico bring rampant crime to the United States. "You have illegal immigrants pouring through the country," the ultra-wealthy businessman and Republican presidential candidate said on Fox Business Network July 1. "They're incarcerated. Many of them are in jails. You have hundreds of thousands of people going to state and federal penitentiaries. That just came out in a Homeland Security Report." We wondered if Trump was right that there are "hundreds of thousands" of illegal immigrants in the nation’s state and federal prisons. We polled experts and asked government agencies and found no data that speaks to this claim conclusively. "The basic claim is at best unsustainable or more likely pure fiction. A fact created out of thin air," said Ramiro Martinez, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University. "There is no substance to the Donald Trump assertion since the data do not exist." We reached out to Trump’s staff multiple times and didn’t hear back, though he did cite a recent Department of Homeland Security report. However, it doesn’t seem like such a report exists. Turns out Homeland Security doesn’t regularly track the number of incarcerated illegal immigrants, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement Press Secretary Gillian Christensen. The most recent comprehensive number we could find comes from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In total, there were around 90,000 noncitizens incarcerated in federal and state prison systems at year end in 2013. But this doesn’t tell us much; the noncitizen group includes both legal and illegal immigrants, and the report does not separate the two. But in any case, we know that there are definitely not "hundreds of thousands" of illegal immigrants in state and federal penitentiaries. The Bureau of Justice Statistics report also does not talk about immigrants among local jail population, which Trump mentioned. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report gets us a tiny bit closer. In 2009, state prisons reported about 90,000 incarcerated individuals of illegal or unknown immigration status, and local jails reported about 204,000. While this might seem to add credence to Trump’s claim, the GAO data does not represent the number of unique individuals because a person could be incarcerated multiple times within one or more districts. Additionally, the report admits there are no fully reliable sources for state and local incarcerated populations. It’s also worth noting that in fiscal year 2014, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported just under 178,000 illegal immigrants convicted of a crime, about 56 percent of all deportations. This is similar to previous years. So in Trump’s defense is the fact that there might be, at any given point, more than 100,000 immigrants in the United States convicted of a crime. The fact that many immigrants are detained for immigration violations awaiting deportation -- as opposed to committing some other type of crime -- makes incarceration statistics hard to evaluate, said Mary Waters, a sociology professor at Harvard University. The GAO study found that immigration violations were the most frequent offense leading to detention, followed by drug and traffic violations. We also wanted to note that every expert we polled said there is a consensus among scholars that undocumented immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens. They sent quite a few studies our way. (If you’re curious, the May 2014 issue of Criminology and Public Policy has a good roundup of the latest research.) The near certainty that an undocumented immigrant will be removed if convicted of a crime has been found to be a strong crime deterrent among immigrants, according to a paper co-authored by Waters. One 2007 study out of the Immigration Policy Center, a pro-immigration think tank, found that American men of Mexican descent ages 18 to 39 had an incarceration rate of 5.9 percent, while foreign-born Mexicans living in the United States had an incarceration rate of 0.7 percent. The overall incarceration rate for American-born men ages 18 to 39 is 3.5 percent. In 2009, the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, published a report analyzing government and academic data that found higher rates of criminality among immigrants, though noting, "The overall picture of immigrants and crime remains confused due to a lack of good data and contrary information." But the bottom line on Trump’s specific claim is that there’s no definitive number, or even a good ballpark figure, of how many illegal immigrants are currently incarcerated. Our ruling Trump said "Hundreds of thousands of (illegal immigrants are) going to state and federal penitentiaries." In 2013, there were fewer than 100,000 noncitizens -- legal and undocumented -- in federal and state prisons. If you add in local jails, it’s quite possible but uncertain that the total number of incarcerated illegal immigrants is above 100,000, though it’s also possible that many of these individuals are held for immigration violations as opposed to other crimes. We just don’t have solid data on this point. Without any good information to back it up, Trump’s claim falls flat. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05881	Says Chris Christie "inherited the highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/08/committee-our-childrens-future/ad-claims-chris-christie-inherited-highest-taxes-a/	When Gov. Chris Christie took office, New Jersey distinguished itself in two unflattering ways. The state had the highest taxes in the nation and the worst unemployment in the region, according to a television ad recently released by the 501(c)(4) advocacy group Committee for Our Children’s Future. Now, the group’s ad claims, Christie is working to cast off those unfavorable rankings. "They inherited the highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region, but Chris Christie and New Jersey reformers are cleaning up the mess," the narrator of the ad posted to YouTube on Jan. 31 says. "The result: the most job growth in 11 years, millions in new education funding, two budgets balanced. Now, Chris Christie and reformers are fighting to strengthen our economy, improve education and cut income taxes for all New Jersey families. So join our reform movement. Keep New Jersey moving forward." PolitiFact New Jersey previously checked two ads released by Committee for Our Children’s Future. In those rulings, we found it’s true New Jersey had the most private-sector job growth in 11 years and the governor increased education funding in his latest budget. It’s also true he’s balanced two budgets, as required by law. Now, we’re assessing the claim that when Christie took office New Jersey had the "highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region." Highest taxes New Jersey’s taxes are high, but whether they are the highest in the nation is debatable. Brian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children’s Future, cited an analysis of state and local tax burdens by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues. New Jersey tops a list compiled by the Washington, D.C.-based group for its state and local tax burden. The Tax Foundation defines tax burden as "effective tax rates calculated by totaling state-local level taxes paid by taxpayers in each state, then dividing by their income." In 2009, the year before Christie took office, New Jersey had a state and local tax burden of 12.2 percent. New York was a close second at 12.1 percent, followed by Connecticut at 12 percent. So, the group is right, according to the Tax Foundation. But other studies on tax burdens show New Jersey isn’t the highest. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio addressed this issue in a September 2010 ruling. They found that tax experts disagree over how best to define tax burden and "rankings can vary wildly depending on which taxes are included, which data sets are employed and which projections are applied." In an analysis by the Federation of Tax Administrators, which provides services to state tax authorities and administrators, New Jersey ranks ninth for the percent of personal income spent on state and local taxes. Alaska ranks first. However, Ronald Alt, senior research associate at the Federation of Tax Administrators, said there are caveats to the rankings. For example, Alaska takes in a large share of its taxes from oil revenues and Alt said, "most likely their citizens don't pay a large portion of that." The Tax Foundation puts Alaska 50th in the nation for its state and local tax burden. Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation, said his group sometimes calculates total tax collections as a percent of income, but "we just don't think it is appropriate to call that a ‘tax burden’" because it doesn’t address issues such as taxes shifting across state lines. Alt said New Jersey’s taxes are high, but "it's very difficult to come out and claim that one state has the highest overall just because there are many different ways of looking at it and there many different types of taxes." Worst unemployment The group also claimed New Jersey had the "worst unemployment in the region" when Christie took office. Jones said his group was defining the region as New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- all of which had lower unemployment rates than New Jersey when Christie took office. "We’re not getting up into New England," he said. In January 2010, New Jersey’s unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent. The same month New York’s was 8.9 percent, Pennsylvania’s was 8.8 percent and Delaware’s was 8.8 percent. It’s worth noting that the U.S. Census Bureau classifies New Jersey as part of the northeast region with Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Rhode Island. The region is split into two divisions. New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania belong to the middle Atlantic division. So, New Jersey’s jobless rate was higher than the two other states in its Census division. But among states in the northeast region, Rhode Island had a higher unemployment rate of 11.8 percent than New Jersey in January 2010. Our ruling Committee for Our Children’s Future claims in an ad that the governor "inherited the highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region." A business-backed group ranks New Jersey worst in the nation for its state and local tax burden. The advocacy group is correct by that measure. But there are other measures of tax burden where New Jersey doesn’t rank first and there isn't clear consensus on how best to define tax burden. New Jersey had the highest unemployment rate among its neighbors when Christie took office, and still does. Among all the states in the northeast, only Rhode Island’s jobless rate tops New Jersey’s.

pomt-00660	More money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than what's spent combating "Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/14/michael-mccaul/does-homeland-security-put-climate-change-above-on/	Federal officials have been warning for several years that violent Islamic extremists are using the Internet to inspire people already in America to commit acts of terror. The shootings in Garland, Texas, seemed a textbook example. According to CNN, two men in Arizona responded to social media from overseas and set out to gun down people at an anti-Islamic gathering. Although the FBI had been tracking one of the men and had alerted Texas law enforcement, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, faults the White House for not doing enough to stop this kind of activity in the first place. "I think (FBI) Director James Comey is spot on when he talks about the threat inside the United States," McCaul said May 10, 2015, on Fox News Sunday. "And yet this administration, its budget allocates zero dollars towards combating homegrown violent extremism. In fact, within the Department of Homeland Security, more money, in fact, millions of dollars, are dedicated to climate change rather than combating what I consider to be one of the biggest threats to the homeland, and that's the violent extremists radicalizing Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America." McCaul’s statement might strike you as sweeping -- we spend more money on climate change than domestic terrorism threats. But in reality it’s a tightly scripted message comparing spending within the Department of Homeland Security on climate change to the money spent preventing Islamist terrorists from using the Internet to spread messages in the United States. Through that small window, McCaul’s claim is right on the numbers. But that ignores all that’s going on at the FBI and other federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security budget Each year, federal agencies send Congress a fairly specific justification for the amount of money they want and how they plan to spend it. McCaul’s staff pointed us to the Homeland Security department’s submission for fiscal year 2016, which included $10 million "for analyses of climate change impacts on infrastructure critical to national and economic security, and national public health and safety." Climate change programs show up elsewhere in the DHS budget, bundled in with other initiatives. There is $6 million in the Federal Emergency Management Agency budget (which is part of homeland security) for "climate workshops and regional resilience coordination" done by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. So, on the low-end, the Department of Homeland Security asked for $10 million for climate change and maybe more. What’s the request for dealing with radicalizing over the Internet? The administration’s budget documents don’t show much. We found $275,000 to cover travel to send staff to a number of cities such as Houston, Atlanta and Chicago to draw more people into the discussion of how to spot and prevent radicalization. We saw $1 million budgeted for a database to analyze past violent extremist incidents and see what sort of programs work best to head off attacks. A House Homeland Security Committee spokeswoman told us that there are four to eight full-time staff assigned to countering violent extremism. The department has a senior level official who serves as the coordinator of Countering Violent Extremism, but his office has no separate line item in the budget. All together, at the outside, the budget submissions show less than $2 million focused on stopping radicals from attracting recruits over the Internet. The bigger picture As we noted, McCaul was talking about a very specific type of terrorism spending -- to prevent terrorist recruiting over the Internet. But there’s plenty more spending inside the Department of Homeland Security as it relates to detecting, investigating and thwarting terrorists. The Department of Homeland Security asked for $57 million in 2016 just for technology programs to counter terrorists. It wants another $14 million to detect and predict hostile activity. Part of its $1 billion National Preparedness Grant Program to state and local governments could be spent on projects to spot early signs of terrorist planning. Extending matters into other parts of the federal government pulls in many additional programs. The FBI would like $1.9 billion and over 7,000 staff to focus on counterterrorism. It’s Intelligence Division seeks $1.6 billion to "prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur." The Justice Department would like $30 million for its own intelligence work, and another $14 million to target and disrupt homegrown threats. The State Department recently received $188 million to directly engage on the social media front to undermine violent extremism. Our ruling McCaul said that the Homeland Security budget has more money dedicated to climate change than combating the violent extremists radicalizing Islamist terrorists over the Internet. That is a very narrow comparison. It concerns only the Homeland Security Department and only programs designed to prevent Islamic extremists’ use of the Internet. Within that limited frame, McCaul’s comparison holds up. However, any complete analysis would show that federal departments and agencies spend significantly more money targeting terrorists than they do targeting climate change. McCaul's statement needs that additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Michael McCaul	None	None	None	2015-05-14T09:49:14	2015-05-10	['United_States']

pomt-12134	Says Jose Felix Diaz supports President Donald Trump's "plan to slash Medicare, charge older Americans an age tax and cut coverage for pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/aug/14/florida-democratic-legislative-campaign-committee/democrats-mislead-attack-linking-florida-senate-ca/	Florida Democrats are trying to attach President Donald Trump to the Republican in a Miami state Senate race seen as a crucial battleground. Millions of dollars are expected to be spent on the race between former Republican state Rep. Jose Felix Diaz and Democrat Annette Taddeo for Senate District 40. The Sept. 26 special election was called to replace Sen. Frank Artiles, who resigned after using sexist and racist language. The Florida Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the state Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, released a new TV ad featuring Taddeo. It links Diaz to Trump’s support for repealing Obamacare — using a photo of Diaz and Trump together at the inauguration as more proof of their lockstep bond. "Jose Felix Diaz supports Trump's every move including his plan to slash Medicare, charge older Americans an age tax and cut coverage for pre-existing conditions," states the ad. The ad is referencing Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare and is a nod to efforts in the U.S. House and Senate to repeal and replace the law. Diaz was a consistent vote against the Affordable Care Act as a statehouse member, even though his actions could not influence the federal law. But the ad exaggerates the support Diaz lent to the U.S. House and Senate legislation this year. He has mostly been quiet on the issue. Diaz fought against Obamacare years ago The Democrats offered no proof of Diaz speaking in favor of the Obamacare repeal proposals that Congress debated and voted on in 2017. Diaz has avoided the topic in his bid for state Senate. That isn’t too surprising since if he wins, he would have no ability to vote on a federal replacement. We could not find any evidence in news archives or campaign literature showing Diaz weighing in on federal proposals in recent months to repeal or replace Obamacare. That’s a problem for the Democrats’ accusation. In the absence of any supportive Diaz comments, the Democrats detailed four anti-Obamacare votes Diaz took as a state representative in 2011 and 2012. Those votes were largely symbolic, and they had no connection to the specific policy advocated in the GOP repeal-and-replace efforts in Congress in recent months. (The risk to Medicare patients, an "age tax" and charging Americans more for pre-existing conditions were specific consequences of parts of those bills, as determined by health care analysts.) Resisting the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010, was a persistent theme for the Republican-led Legislature when Diaz served. • In 2011, Diaz co-sponsored a bill to prohibit most individuals from being forced to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. Although the bill passed, it could not supercede federal law. In a debate on CBS4 Miami Aug. 13, Taddeo attacked Diaz for voting on a bill that "essentially dismantled Obamacare." Diaz responded: "The state cannot dismantle anything so I’m not even sure what that means." • In 2011, Diaz also voted for the "Health Care Freedom Act" bill to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban individuals from being forced to buy insurance or companies from having to provide insurance. Florida voters rejected it in 2012. • In 2012, Diaz voted in favor of a bill to urge Congress to repeal the federal health care law. It passed the Florida House but died in the Senate. • In 2012, Diaz voted for an amendment within an appropriations bill in support of providing funds to challenge the constitutionality of the federal law. (The amendment was essentially a political move -- Attorney General Bill McCollum already sued in 2010 to challenge the federal law and Pam Bondi later took over that effort.) The Democrats offered one piece of evidence from 2017, but it also does not prove Diaz supported any of the repeal proposals. Diaz was one of several Florida lawmakers invited to Washington in February for two days of closed-door meetings with Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio to discuss the Affordable Care Act, flood insurance, water issues and tax reform. After the meetings concluded, Rubio said that "among the issues we discussed, repealing and replacing ObamaCare was a top priority." There is no public record to review whether Diaz mentioned repeal. (The Tampa Bay Times posted a video after the meeting in which Rubio, seated at a table with Diaz and other state lawmakers, spoke on a variety of issues, including his criticism of Obamacare. Diaz did not speak.) In the CBS4 debate, Diaz said during his visit to Washington, D.C. "I did not advocate for anything that had to do with dismantling Obamacare." When we asked Diaz about his position on the repeal and replace efforts, the statement we received didn’t clearly answer if he favored the proposals. He replied that many voters in the district "believe that Obamacare is a failed product" and said if "Obamacare is indeed repealed, we need to ensure that everyone that is currently covered continues to be covered, including pre-existing conditions." Campaign spokesman David Custin pointed to an effort by Diaz to expand health care coverage as a state House member in 2016. Diaz sponsored a bill that allowed eligible children of legal immigrants to apply for the state and federal Kidcare program. The language was folded into another bill that became law. TV ad cites reports about 2017 repeal efforts Before we issue our ruling, we wanted to briefly explain the other points in the ad about the Republican plans to repeal or replace Obamacare in the U.S. House and Senate. While the House narrowly passed a bill in May, the Senate failed to pass a new plan in July before it went on recess. While the GOP health care plan didn’t include explicit changes to Medicare, the legislation could hurt the 11 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are dual enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. These "dual eligibles" would be affected by congressional efforts to cut and cap Medicaid funding, according to the Commonwealth Fund. The so-called "age tax" already exists, although GOP plans would have made it even steeper. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. House and Senate bills increased the ratio up to five times. While that change would reduce premiums for younger people, it would increase premiums for older people in that age bracket. The Affordable Care Act included a ban on denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. The House GOP plan had literal language which said that insurers have to provide access for those with pre-existing conditions, but it didn’t address costs. The legislation would have allowed insurers to set premiums based on the "health status" of individuals -- which would have meant higher costs for sicker patients with pre-existing conditions. One more time: We don’t know Diaz’s position on these bills. Our ruling A Florida Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee TV ad says Diaz supports Trump's "plan to slash Medicare, charge older Americans an age tax and cut coverage for pre-existing conditions." The ad provides no evidence that Diaz, as a state representative and now a state Senate candidate, has taken stances on the efforts in 2017 by Trump and Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate to repeal or replace Obamacare. Instead, the Democrats point to a series of anti-Obamacare votes Diaz took in the state House years ago that ask Congress to repeal the law and declare opposition to the individual mandate. Those votes aren’t mentioned in the ad, and they obviously don’t address support for the 2017 proposals in Congress that analysts said would hurt some Medicare users and lead to higher costs for older adults and people with pre-existing conditions. Votes by Diaz show that he opposed the federal law while in the statehouse, but that’s not what the Democrats’ ad says. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10583	"He told gay organizers in Massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even Ted Kennedy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/31/john-mccain/pretty-much-yes-but-its-not-special/	A day ahead of the Florida primary, John McCain unleashed an attack on rival Mitt Romney in an automatic phone call to Republican voters. It's identical to something Rudy Giuliani said about Romney when the former New York mayor was still in the race. We examined the Giuliani charge and concluded it was Mostly True. As reported by Politico.com , the McCain robocall is a woman apparently concerned about Romney's social conservative record. A McCain spokesman confirmed for us that the call came from the campaign but did not provide the official text. Here is the transcript of the call courtesy of Politico : "I'm calling with an urgent Mitt Romney [unintelligible]" "We care deeply about traditional values and protecting families. And we need someone who will not waver in the White House: ending abortion, preserving the sanctity of marriage, stopping the trash on the airwaves and attempts to ban God from every corner of society. These issues are core to our being. "Mitt Romney thinks he can fool us. He supported abortion on demand, even allowed a law mandating taxpayer funding for abortion. He says he changed his mind, but he still hasn't changed the law. He told gay organizers in Massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even Ted Kennedy. Now, it's something different. "Unfortunately, on issue after issue Mitt Romney has treated social issues voters as fools, thinking we won't catch on. Sorry, Mitt, we know you aren't trustworthy on the most important issue and you aren't a conservative. "Paid for by John McCain 2008." The statement the the call refers to comes from Romney's 1994 U.S. Senate campaign against Kennedy. During the race, Romney wrote a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay Republicans, thanking them for their support. "For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponent's record in this area," Romney wrote in October 1994. "But I believe we can and must do better. If we are to achieve the goals we share, we must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern. My opponent cannot do this. I can and will." As with our previous ruling on this same attack, we find it Mostly True. McCain is right that Romney promised to be more supportive of gay rights than Kennedy had been, but he loses some points by using the term "special rights." What Romney actually advocated was equality for gay and lesbian Americans; nothing "special." Yes, it's a small point. But for a politician like McCain, who took such grief over the misuse by his opponents of the term "amnesty" to describe his proposal for illegal immigrants, it's reasonable to expect a little more precision.

pomt-02954	"Test scores had gone up steadily for 40 years until No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/27/diane-ravitch/education-critic-diane-ravitch-says-test-scores-we/	Education analyst and professor Diane Ravitch is a harsh critic of many recent trends in education, from high-stakes testing to privately run charter schools. Ravitch supported many of those efforts when she was assistant secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush. But she later concluded they didn’t work. And she has been especially critical of both the 2002 federal No Child Left Behind Act, championed by President George W. Bush, and President Obama’s 2009 Race to the Top grant program. Ravitch offered some of her insights in a speech Oct. 15, 2013, at the University of Rhode Island. Part of her argument is that champions of such so-called reforms are overstating the problem. She said a decades-look back at standardized test scores shows more student improvement than the nation’s public schools get credit for. "Test scores had gone up steadily for 40 years until No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top," she said. We wondered whether scores had increased so steadily and whether, as her statement implies, they leveled off or dropped after the two federal programs took hold. Ravitch told us her 40-year claim was a condensed version of a point she makes at greater length in her new book, "Reign of Error: The Hoax of The Privatization Movement and the Danger to America’s Public Schools." She said that claim is backed up by the results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress Long-Term Trend Assessments, a nationwide standardized test that has been given to students since the early 1970s (From 1997 to 2004, Ravitch was a member of the NAEP Governing Board, which oversees the test.). The NAEP tests are given every few years to 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds and 17-year-olds. The reading part of the test was first administered in 1971 and the math in 1973. Since then, except for a 2004 update, the test has remained substantially unchanged. That constancy has enabled educators to use it as a way to compare student performance year-to-year and even decade-to-decade. "NAEP is the only gauge of change over time," Ravitch wrote in "Reign of Error." That brings us to the time period Ravitch was using. She cited a steady trend over 40 years, until the No Child Left Behind Act and Race to the Top. The time spans are actually 32 and 38 years, respectively. No Child Left Behind was implemented in 2003. We made that the end point for our examination, because it’s the first marker Ravitch cited and because the act made more sweeping changes and has been in effect longer. Our beginning points were 1971, when the NAEP reading test was first administered, and 1973, when the math test began. Test scores for the periods are found in "NAEP 2008 Trend in Academic Progress", published by the U.S. Education Department’s National Center for Educational Statistics. From 1971 through 2004 -- the closest test date to No Child Left Behind -- average reading scores did go up overall, except for the oldest students. In 1971, 9-year-olds had an average score of 208; in 2004, their average score was 219, a gain of 11 points. For 13-year-olds, the average score went from 255 in 1971 to 259 in 2004, a gain of 4 points. The 1971 and 2004 scores for 17-year-olds were identical: 285. Math scores also went up from 1973 through 2004. Again, scores of younger students showed bigger improvement: 9-year-olds scored 219 in 1973 and 241 in 2004, a gain of 22. Thirteen year-olds scored 266 in 1973 and 281 in 2004, a gain of 15. The increase for 17-year-olds was only 4 points over that period, from 304 to 307. Somewhat contrary to what Ravitch claimed, not all the math and reading scores increases went up steadily. There were a few small dips along the way, although the overall trend was up. Then there’s the word "until" in Ravitch’s statement. It implies that the rising trend stopped or reversed after No Child Left Behind. In fact, according to the 2012 Nation’s Report Card, the increases continued for nearly all age groups through 2012, the most recent testing period. In reading, scores increased 2 points for 9-year-olds, 4 points for 13-year-olds and 2 points for 17-year-olds. In math, scores increased 3 points for 9-year-olds and 4 points for 13-year-olds. They decreased by 1 point for 17-year-olds. Our ruling Education critic Diane Ravitch said, "Test scores had gone up steadily for 40 years until No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top." There are a few problems with her statement. First, the time spans for the scores she cites are 32 and 38 years, not 40. Second, while the scores increased overall, there were a few dips. And for 17-year-olds, the overall increases were insignificant. Finally, despite her implication that the increases stopped after No Child Left Behind, scores actually rose for all age groups in 2008 and for nearly all in 2012, the next two testing periods. Because Ravitch’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, the judges rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03169	The number of African-American men in prison has increased fivefold since he left office.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/06/jimmy-carter/carter-cites-number-argue-kings-dream-not-reality/	Former President Jimmy Carter joined tens of thousands of Americans last week to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and its leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Carter reflected on the progress America has made since 1963 to achieve King’s dream of racial and economic equality. But Carter, a former Georgia governor, spoke about some issues he believes would pain King, a fellow Georgian. Carter said one trouble spot would be the number of African-American men in prison. Carter included some specifics that made us curious about whether they were accurate. "I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to having more than 835,000 African-American men in prison, five times as many as when I left office," Carter told the massive crowd on the National Mall. Carter continued by saying about one-third of black men are "destined to be in prison in their lifetimes," a statistic frequently cited in news reports. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the number of black men in prison had increased that much since Carter left the White House. We thought we’d do some research, considering the speech was broadcast live and Carter’s statistics have since been widely reported in various news outlets. When Carter left the White House in January 1981, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported there were 160,442 black men in American prisons. That was nearly the same amount as the number of white men in prison (183,202), although at that time there were more than seven times as many white men as black men in the U.S. The number of black men in the United States increased by more than 45 percent between 1980 and 2010, U.S. Census figures show, from 12.5 million to 18.2 million. Their incarceration rates have been a constant subject of consternation and conversation among many civil rights activists, conservatives and criminologists. One often-repeated claim is that there are more black men in prison than in college. The most recent statistics suggest that assertion is false. Ivory Toldson, an associate professor at Howard University, talked about such claims earlier this year during an interview with NPR, citing numbers that support Carter’s claim concerning how many African-American men are currently in prison. Toldson pointed us to a table from a June 2010 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report that said about 841,000 African-American men were in prison or in jail in 2009. An estimated 694,000 white men were in prison or jail that year. That is nearly four times the total number of white men in prison or jail in 1981. Carter, too, based his claim on that report, said Steven Hochman, the director of research for the former president. Case closed? Not entirely. A BJS statistician cautioned us that the number of African-Americans in prison may be misleading as some inmates could be counted twice. For example, a person who served part of the year in jail and part of the year in prison might be counted as two inmates -- one while incarcerated in a local jail, another after a transfer to prison. At the end of 2011, the BJS reported about 555,300 African-American men in state and federal prisons. In 2011, the BJS reported that about 276,400 African-Americans were in local jails. There was no breakdown for how many prisoners in local jails were men. Typically, about 90 percent of incarcerated inmates, regardless of race, are men, BJS statistics show. We must also note another point. Many law enforcement officials will point out that there is a difference between a prison and a jail. "Jails are designed to house people awaiting trial," said Terry Norris, executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association. Prisons, Norris said, were created to house people once they’re sentenced. Norris noted that some people still sit in county jails after being sentenced, due to a variety of issues, including prison overcrowding. In August, 6 percent of state-sentenced inmates were housed in county jails, according to numbers compiled by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. The percentage of state-sentenced inmates in county jails was as high as 13 percent in 2009. Norris believes the percentage will decrease in the future as a result of the state’s recent changes to the criminal justice system. Georgia has removed the mandatory minimum sentencing requirement in some limited cases involving nonviolent offenders. To sum up, Carter said in a speech that the number of African-American men in prison has increased fivefold since he left office in 1981. Carter would have been more accurate if he had said "incarcerated" instead of "prison" because his count included inmates in jail. In 1981, the number of black men incarcerated was about 160,000. A 2010 federal report said it was 841,000. Federal officials have cautioned that some of those inmates in the 2010 report may have been counted twice. The BJS reported that about 555,300 African-American men were in state and federal prisons as of 2011. That’s about 3.5 times as many as when Carter left office. But if you add in jail inmates -- prisoners awaiting trial and serving sentences locally -- you approach Carter’s numbers. Carter’s overall point is that the number of African-American men incarcerated has increased substantially since he left office. He’s right about that. But you have to include some context to get the whole picture. We rate Carter’s statement Mostly True.	None	Jimmy Carter	None	None	None	2013-09-06T00:00:00	2013-08-28	['None']

pomt-01252	Says Obama's net neutrality proposal "puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service and what types of products and services can be delivered."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/13/ted-cruz/cruz-net-neutrality-regulations-put-government-cha/	Net neutrality is the "biggest regulatory threat to the Internet," according to Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz took to social media to denounce a policy from President Barack Obama on Nov. 10 that was seen as a big step in favor of net neutrality. Obama said he wanted "the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality." Cruz called the proposal "Obamacare for the Internet" on Twitter, and he got more specific in his complaint on Facebook. We wanted to fact-check if net neutrality would in fact put the government in charge of "determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered." We found that Cruz is mostly talking about a slippery slope. With Obama’s proposed rules, the Federal Communications Commission could theoretically impose regulations on Internet prices and products -- but the scope of those regulations would be limited. And Obama specifically called on the FCC not to regulate Internet prices. For us, Cruz’s statement conjured images of FCC officials sitting around a table and drafting household Internet service plans. That’s not what Obama is proposing. What is net neutrality? First, a quick primer on net neutrality, which is a pretty complicated topic. The New York Times’ Upshot framed the issue well, comparing it with the difference between electricity and cable TV. For electricity, people pay a monthly bill, the electricity comes into the house, and they use the electricity however they see fit, using whatever electrical devices they want. These same people pay a monthly bill for cable television, but the cable company gets to pick out the channels for the cable packages. These packages are often constructed based on financial agreements between the cable provider and the TV channels. Supporters of net neutrality think Internet service should operate like electricity. Consumers pay a fee to an Internet service provider (like Comcast and Verizon), and they get equal access to the whole Internet -- every website, big and small -- without any interference from the service providers. But this isn’t possible without some government regulation. The FCC makes the final call on how the government regulates the Internet, and the agency is in the process of designing regulations, after a federal appeals court struck down standing FCC net neutrality protection rules in January. Some Internet service providers, however, don’t want this kind of government regulation. Regulations would stop Internet service providers from entering into financial arrangements that would give particular websites prioritized access to Internet users (kind of like cable companies’ arrangements with cable channels). For example, Netflix has a financial agreement with Comcast so that the video streaming website will have better access to customers. Proponents of net neutrality worry that if this trend continues, websites that are able and willing to pay Internet service providers for prioritized access to consumers would have an unfair advantage over smaller operations or startups. In order to stop this trend and protect net neutrality, Obama said the FCC should "reclassify" Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning they would be treated as public utilities, such as phone service. Currently, the Internet is classified as an "information service," which greatly limits how much the FCC can regulate it. Under the common carrier classification, however, Internet service providers would not be allowed to give advantages to particular websites. Cruz and other critics of Obama’s proposal think reclassification would create a lot of red tape for Internet service providers. We asked Cruz’s staff for evidence to back up his claim, and they noted some potential impact of Obama’s net neutrality proposal -- pointing to studies that said more Internet regulation could harm the economy and kill jobs. "The president’s call for the FCC to designate the Internet a public utility means that the five unelected bureaucrats at the FCC will become the arbiters of pricing, terms of service, and types of products delivered," said Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier. "This changes a relentlessly innovative and growing part of our economy into one that must wait for permission for any new ideas." It’s a bit more nuanced, though. Prices In theory, Title II would give the FCC some say over Internet service providers’ prices. However, Obama urged the FCC to also adopt a forbearance against price regulation. A forbearance is a legal way of choosing not to enforce part of the law that is unnecessary or irrelevant. "I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act — while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services," Obama said. But let’s talk about what would happen if the FCC reclassified Internet service providers under Title II without that forbearance, just for kicks. Under Title II, the FCC is authorized to "determine and prescribe" charges. However, this does not mean that the agency would decide what prices should be and force companies to abide by them. What would happen is that Internet service providers would set their own prices, and the FCC would intervene if it thinks those prices are "unjust or unreasonable." The idea is that if a service provider is the only operator in an area, it should not be able to hike up consumer costs unreasonably, knowing the consumers don’t have access to a cheaper option. Even this limited level of price regulation likely wouldn’t be sustainable, said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge, an open Internet advocacy group. The FCC doesn’t enforce price regulations for other Title II services, like mobile phones and land lines, and has had trouble defending price caps in court. "As a practical matter, that’s totally not going to happen," Feld said. Brent Skorup, a telecommunications research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center and an opponent of net neutrality regulations, said he thinks Cruz’s statement is fair, because of the authority Title II gives the FCC. But he agreed that any price regulation would likely be "short lived" because of Obama’s call for a forbearance and precedent concerning other Title II services. Products and terms of service If Internet service is reclassified under Title II, the FCC would have limited authority over the products that Internet service providers can offer. Like the pricing issue, this isn’t to say that FCC officials would draft up Internet service packages that a service provider would have to offer consumers -- the companies would still do that themselves. But if an Internet service provider offers a product that gives undue advantage to particular websites, the FCC could stop them -- and the FCC would decide what constitutes an undue advantage. In this case, the "product" would be an Internet service package that involves giving particular websites paid prioritization. For the most part, experts we spoke with said this would be -- to some degree -- government oversight of a particular product. Supporters of Obama’s proposal, though, said Cruz mischaracterizes the extent of government control. Feld described it this way: The rules are such that the FCC wouldn’t be able to stop an Internet service provider from offering a particular product unless that particular product (in this case paid prioritization) prevents other companies from having a fair shot at reaching that consumer. Evan Engstrom, policy director of tech advocacy group Engine, said the regulations aren’t about dictating what products a company can offer -- they’re about preventing "egregious market abuses." Saying net neutrality means government regulation of products and services is "like saying laws against extortion put the government in charge of determining what sorts of ‘protection services’ the Mafia can offer," Engstrom said. Feld noted that even under Title II, it’s possible that an Internet service provider could find a way to offer products with paid prioritization anyway. Like Obama’s proposed forbearance against price regulation, Feld said it would be possible for an Internet service provider to petition the FCC for a forbearance against blocking a particular product. Our ruling Cruz said, Obama’s net neutrality proposal "puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service and what types of products and services can be delivered." While theoretically possible, Obama said specifically that he does not want the FCC to regulate Internet prices, and the FCC typically does not regulate prices for similar things, such as telephone services. In terms of product offerings, the proposal would allow the FCC to prevent Internet service providers from giving certain websites priority over others. But Cruz’s statement conjures an image of FCC officials sitting around a table designing Internet service packages and their prices, and this is not what Obama is proposing.

pomt-08899	For every $1 spent on afterschool programs, "we can save over $5, almost $6, in crime costs down the line."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/30/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-claims-1-spent-afterschool-programs-save/	During a speech seeking the endorsement of the state Democratic Party in his race for attorney general, lawyer and former police officer Rep. Peter Kilmartin promised to work hard to prevent crime as well as prosecute it. "It's about the attorney general, when I'm attorney general, advocating and increasing afterschool programming for children," he said. "For every dollar we can invest and parlay from private charitable foundations and the federal government, we can save over $5, almost $6, in crime costs down the line." Sounds like a good investment. But claims based on the so-called multiplier effect always make us suspicious. While they often have the ring of authority, they are sometimes based on a pile of assumptions. We wondered where Kilmartin got his numbers. His spokesman, Brett Broesder, quickly produced a copy of "A Report to the Legislature: Rhode Island Afterschool and Summer Learning Program Act" released in May by the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The report, which argues for financing afterschool and summer programs for at-risk children and youth, says in two places: "For every one dollar invested in expanded learning opportunities, there is a savings of up to $5.29 in decreased criminal justice costs." The RIDE report said the savings come in "criminal justice costs," which we took to mean the costs incurred by the police, courts and corrections departments. "Crime costs," the term used by Kilmartin, would also include the broader costs to the victims and their families, both tangible and intangible. When we looked into the RIDE number, our suspicions were confirmed. The RIDE report says its information came from a 2001 analysis from the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, a 174-page examination that tries to assess how much various social programs cost and how much they would save the state of Washington over the long term. It's clear from Page 15 that the $5.29 figure comes with some significant caveats, none of which were mentioned by RIDE in its pitch for more money: * The Washington analysis is based on just two studies of mentoring programs conducted outside the criminal justice system, one run by Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. The Big Brothers study never documented a drop in the crime rate as a result of mentoring; instead it asked participants for the number of times they hit someone. From that, the Washington researchers estimated that the two mentoring programs reduced the crime rate among participants by 4 percent. * The Washington analysis estimated that there was no direct benefit to the taxpayers from the mentoring programs when they looked at how much would be saved in decreased criminal justice costs. "Overall, taxpayers just break-even for this investment," the authors concluded. In other words, even though the RIDE report used the qualifying statement "up to $5.29," which technically covers every dollar estimate down to zero, it strikes us that RIDE misstated the findings. Twice. So where does the $5.29 figure come from? The Washington authors factored in their estimates of the costs of compensating victims of a crime, including the cost of lost quality of life. (Sample costs that they used: $8,734 for robbery victims and $3,137,793 for murder victims.) The authors then plugged in several other numbers -- including the $1,054 cost of mentoring one person and their estimate of the cost of the crimes that mentoring prevented -- to arrive at $5.29. Fortunately for Kilmartin, his mischaracterization of RIDE's conclusion (saying a $1 investment reduces "crime costs" instead of "decreasing criminal justice costs") makes his characterization of the Washington analysis more accurate than RIDE's. Steve Aos, director of the Washington State Institute for Public Policy, said citing the 2001 analysis in 2010 -- instead of a later update -- would be like investing in the stock market today using investment advice given in 2001. The most recent analysis, from 2004, estimates that society saves $3.28 for every dollar spent, not $5.29. If a mentoring program uses paid workers instead of volunteers, according to Aos, "the program breaks even." We contacted RIDE spokesman Elliot Krieger to ask why the department cited an outdated study and failed to alert the legislature to some significant caveats. The department responded that "we are not persuaded" that the 2004 study refutes or negates the 2001 analysis. "There are obviously many studies examining the value of afterschool programs, using many different methodologies, assumptions, and definitions. Experts in the field are free to debate the validity of the various methodologies. RIDE cited several studies in the report on afterschool and summer-learning programs. All were cited accurately and properly footnoted to enable readers to check the sources." Well, the one cited source we checked -- because it impressed Kilmartin -- turned out to be a study that RIDE misrepresented. Kilmartin was quoting a report he thought he could trust. So we'll give him a Half True.	None	Peter Kilmartin	None	None	None	2010-07-30T00:01:00	2010-06-28	['None']

pomt-06452	"We buy 35 percent of all Chinese exports."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/20/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-35-percent-chinas-exports-land-/	Bipartisan legislating has not left the Senate. Strong support from both sides of the aisle brought passage this month (Oct. 11) of the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011 -- legislation designed to address China's undervaluation of its currency and consequent trade advantage. The bill was sponsored and introduced by Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown and supported by Ohio Republican Rob Portman, both of whom have acknowledged expertise on trade: Brown wrote a book on it ("Myths of Free Trade"), and Portman served a year as U.S. Trade Representative. The legislation could lead to higher tariffs on Chinese imports that supporters say are priced artificially low. At a news conference after its 63-35 passage, Brown called it "the largest bipartisan jobs bill" to win approval in many months. Opponents said they feared the legislation could spark a trade war with China at a time when the U.S. economy is already weak. Brown responded: "Ohio workers and Ohio manufacturers already know that we are, in fact, in a trade war, and the Chinese have done very well, thank you. "The reason that this won't start the kind of trade war where the Chinese start being more aggressive even than they have been is we buy 35 percent of all Chinese exports," he said. "They can't go to a trade war with a country that is such an important customer to them." The claim that more than one-third of China’s exports are sold in U.S. markets got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We decided to take a look. Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, immediately told us that Brown "misspoke when he said 35 percent. The figure is closer to 25 percent." She referred us to the most recent statistics from the World Trade Organization. They show that China's exports totaled $1.2 trillion in 2009, and the U.S. imported $310 billion of them, or 26 percent. We looked further and found statistics from the U.S.-China Business Council, the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S Trade Representative that also showed the U.S. accounting for roughly 25 percent of Chinese exports. They showed that the United States is China's largest export market by a wide margin, spending about 30 percent more than second-ranked Hong Kong, more than twice as much as third-ranked Japan and buying more than four times the volume of fourth-place South Korea. The United States buys more than the next six countries in the top 10 combined. By coincidence, we found that Portman made a slip of the tongue several months ago while discussing trade with China, just a Brown did here. We rated that claim Half True and said then that his underlying point remained. In this case, Brown gave an incorrect number for the U.S. percentage of Chinese exports, which his staff readily pointed it out and corrected. Regardless of that slip, he is correct that the United States is China’s top export destination. A one-quarter share is not as hefty as a one third share would be, but either way, the United States remains the most significant market for Chinese exports. But while PolitiFact Ohio isn’t looking to play Gotcha!, a key tenet is that words matter. In this case, Brown’s number is nearly 30 percent greater than the correct figure. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2011-10-20T06:00:00	2011-10-12	['China']

pomt-14412	"Republican Bob Donovan" has "run as a Republican time and again."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/11/tom-barrett/milwaukee-mayor-tom-barrett-says-challenger-bob-do/	Polarized though they be, if Wisconsin Democrats and Republicans agree on anything, it’s that Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is a nice guy. Yet more than a month ahead of the April 5, 2016 mayoral election, it was Barrett who leveled a double-barreled personal attack on his challenger, Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan. After being targeted himself by radio advertisements from an outside group, Barrett responded by airing two radio ads hitting Donovan. In one of the ads, the former Democratic state lawmaker and congressman ties Donovan to GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. In a city that is heavily Democratic, Barrett essentially uses Republican as a dirty word. "Donovan’s run as a Republican time and again," a female narrator says partway into the ad. "And Donovan sided with Scott Walker and the Republicans in the state Legislature when they’ve tried to hurt Milwaukee." The ad closes with: "Republican Donovan -- Donald Trump erratic behavior, Scott Walker ideas. He’d be a disaster for Milwaukee." Mayor and aldermen are nonpartisan offices in Milwaukee. And though Donovan is generally considered conservative, he hasn't readily been identified with a political party. So let’s check both parts of Barrett’s claim: Has Donovan run "time and again" as a Republican and is he a Republican now? Early 1980s Even many people familiar with Milwaukee politics don't know that in 1982 and 1983, Donovan ran as a Republican for a Milwaukee seat in the state Assembly. Both times, he was unopposed in the GOP primary and lost to the Democratic candidate in the general election. Donovan was a 26-year-old shift foreman for Milwaukee Solvay Coke in 1982 when he made his first run for public office. He was chairman of the South Side Republican Club. The Milwaukee Sentinel editorial board recommended Donovan, saying he "has a zest for public office that seems missing" in first-term incumbent Joe Czarnezki, but Czarnezki won. Czarnezki then went on to win a state Senate seat, causing the need for a special election in 1983 to fill the Assembly slot. Donovan lost that race Peggy Krusick. At that time, Donovan was still chairman of the local GOP club and worked as a security guard at Southridge mall. As alderman, Donovan has reached out to Walker and state Republican lawmakers, particularly when it comes to clashing with Barrett over issues such as crime in Milwaukee. And he announced his mayoral run on conservative talk radio. On the other hand, we could not find that Donovan has made any contributions to any state candidates -- of either party. And Barrett’s campaign couldn’t cite any evidence that Donovan currently is a Republican -- instead pointing to a November 2013 profile and arguing Donovan simply wants to avoid the label to maintain his ability to win in Milwaukee. "I ran as a Republican in Milwaukee County," Donovan told Milwaukee Magazine. "That will give you an indication of how incredibly naive politically I was at the time." The article also said Donovan "eventually conceded that being labeled a Republican could count against him in some voters’ eyes, even in a nonpartisan race." But it also quotes Donovan as saying he was no longer a Republican, and instead calling himself "a proud nonpartisan." And it quotes a Milwaukee County GOP spokesman as saying he had never seen the alderman at any Republican event in the past 20 years. Donovan’s campaign spokesman, Steve Schumacher, told us Donovan hasn’t been a member of any party since shortly after his second run for the Assembly. Schumacher said Donovan "wouldn’t shy away from ‘conservative,’" as a label, but he is independent and not beholden to either party. Our rating Barrett says "Republican Bob Donovan" has "run as a Republican time and again." Donovan identifies as a conservative, but there’s no evidence he is currently a Republican, or a member of any party. The "time and again" is accurate if perhaps misleading, in that Donovan twice ran as a Republican for the state Assembly in the 1980s. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2016-03-11T05:00:00	2016-03-07	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-06898	"Active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/26/cliff-stearns/cliff-stearns-pushing-research-funding-says-milita/	War, needless to say, is fraught with danger — bullets flying, bombs exploding. But one Florida congressman recently targeted a silent killer that attacks soldiers from within. Rep. Cliff Stearns recently sought — and received — House approval to shift $16 million in Pentagon funding to beef up research for prostate cancer for military members. The Ocala Republican pointed out in a press release that prostate cancer was the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among American men. No argument there. After all, according to the American Cancer Society, only skin cancer is more common than prostate cancer among American men. And only lung cancer kills more of those sufferers. What caught our attention, though, was Stearns’ follow-up assertion: "In addition," he said, "active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts." Twice as likely? Really? We asked Stearns’ office about the congressman’s sources, and spokesman Paul Flusche provided a trio of publications. One looked at how Agent Orange might have caused a spike in prostate cancer rates among Vietnam War vets. Another focused on prostate cancer rates strictly among Air Force personnel. The third, which Flusche labeled as the "most important" in supporting Stearns’ claim, was conducted by a team of scientists who compared the rates at which a variety of cancers, including prostate cancer, strike soldiers relative to civilians. That study, conducted by the U.S. Military Cancer Institute, or USMCI, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, was led by Dr. Kangmin Zhu. Zhu’s team actually reviewed six types of cancer — breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, testicular and cervical — for soldiers ages 20 to 59. The data they studied covered from 1990 to 2004. For prostate cancer, the study population included 910 soldiers and 42,751 civilians. In some instances, such as with testicular cancer, there were no differences in the rate of occurrence between the military and civilian populations, the report said. But Zhu and his colleagues, based on their analysis of the numbers, concluded: "Prostate cancer rates in the military were twice those in the general population." So Stearns is citing a verifiable statistic contained in a reputable story. The natural question, of course, is why would military members be more prone to prostate cancer? The Zhu study could only speculate. For instance, researchers found discrepancies between military and civilian healthcare providers in how cancer incidents are reported, which could explain at least part of the difference. Zhu also hypothesized that better and more frequent health screening for soldiers might explain why prostate cancer is more prevalent among U.S. troops. Exposure to depleted uranium also might account for the results. But Zhu ultimately said that he could not determine a reason and suggested further study. We ran the findings by Dr. Jonathan Simons, president and CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based philanthropic organization that has raised roughly $450 million and helped fund 1,500 researchers at 200 institutions in 12 countries. (The foundation was not connected to Zhu’s work.) Simons observed that Zhu’s mission was not to find why military members seemed more likely to get prostate cancer, but to simply crunch the numbers. In that context, Simons said Stearns was "absolutely correct" and justified in stating that military personnel were twice as likely as civilian men to contract prostate cancer. For one thing, Simons noted, "This is not the junior varsity that did the work. These are really top people." Still, Simons cautioned that the potential for drawing a "false correlation" existed -- namely that military members are more likely to get prostate cancer than non-military members. If military service meant a greater risk of developing cancer, then one would expect soldiers to exhibit higher rates of the disease across the board, Simons said. That was not the case here. Yet he reiterated that much more research into prostate cancer occurrences among soldiers was necessary to determine whether the findings were a "fluke" or if there was a definite connection — and if so, what might cause it. And that, Simons observed, was Stearns’ goal in pushing for more funding. "I actually compliment Representative Stearns for elevating it," Simons said. "Congressman Stearns did a really important bit of public health policy here." Back to Stearns’ comment. In pushing for $16 million in Pentagon funding to beef up research for prostate cancer for military members, he said that "active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts." Stearns is correct that research shows that military members are diagnosed with prostate cancer at twice the rate as non-military members. However, that same research doesn’t conclude that military members are twice as likely to "develop" prostate cancer as Stearns said. The study hypothesizes that one reason for the different diagnosis rate may be because military members are subject to more frequent health screenings. Getting to the bottom of the discrepancy is actually why Stearns requested the money. That’s a needed clarification when considering Stearns’ comment. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-12496	"There's no real evidence in the last 20 years that" growth from tax cuts has made up lost revenue.	true	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/28/rana-foroohar/trumps-tax-plan-prompts-question-can-tax-cuts-real/	The Trump administration unveiled a one-page list of tax reform principles inspired by the theory that tax cuts can unleash enough economic growth to cover lost revenue. President George H.W. Bush famously derided this as "voodoo economics," and present-day critics are no less dismissive of what they see as magical thinking by the White House. "The Trump administration will say, 'Well, hey, tax cuts are going to create growth, growth is going to create revenue, that's going to offset all this deficit,'" Rana Foroohar, a CNN economic analyst and Financial Times columnist, told CNN April 26. "Well, there's no real evidence in the last 20 years that that has happened." We decided to investigate this claim. First, the big changes under the White House proposal: the business tax rate drops from 35 to 15 percent for both big and small corporations alike, personal income tax brackets go from seven brackets to three (10, 25, and 35 percent), and the so-called standard deduction -- the amount of personal income not subject to federal income tax -- will be doubled, while some other deductions are removed. There’s isn’t much more detail than that, making it difficult to put a price tag on the proposal. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, or CRFB, attempted to analyze the one-pager’s potential effect on the debt, making a lot of assumptions along the way. Their best guess, which was quickly eaten up by Trump’s critics on TV, was an increase to the debt of $5.5 trillion, or somewhere between $3 trillion to $7 trillion. There’s other ways to offset tax cuts than economic growth: you can raise rates on other taxes, like through a tax on imports, as House Republicans want. Or you can limit tax breaks, cut spending, or do some combination of these, and it’s certainly possible the Trump administration will explore these options. A White House fact sheet by chief economic advisor Gary Cohn on April 26 did make a passing reference to nixing some tax breaks for the wealthy. But the administration has offered no specifics on paying for the cuts, and as of April 20 Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was still insisting, "The deal will pay for itself." So let’s set aside for now the other ways the administration may seek to offset lost revenue from tax cuts. For Trump’s tax cuts to pay for themselves, the economy would have to grow by $5.5 trillion, or roughly a sustained 4.5 percent, for the next 10 years, according to CRFB. That’s a mark that any president is unlikely to hit. Trump promised during the campaign to have 4 percent growth per year. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has since said the target is 3 percent growth. In reality, the average annual growth rate since 2001 has been 1.8 percent, according to Vox. Most experts we interviewed concurred with Foroohar that the idea that tax cuts could spur the level of growth needed is not realistic. One economist went further than Foroohar, noting that steep tax cuts may actually impede economic growth. Several experts cautioned that isolating tax cuts as the sole cause of whatever economic conditions are to follow is more than a little tricky, since good or bad economic conditions can coincide with tax cuts and affect federal revenue. Another caveat is that tax cuts can be manipulated to look as if they’re boosting growth when they’re really not -- as we’ve shown before. While tax cuts don’t pay for themselves fully, tax cuts can generate some growth. For instance, take a 2005 study by the Congressional Budget Office that asked what would happen if Americans got a 10 percent income tax cut. Under CBO’s most optimistic projection, nearly one-third of the tax cut would be offset by additional tax revenue over 10 years. (We’ll get to their pessimistic projection soon.) N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University economist and former chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, shared a similar view. "A reasonable rule of thumb, in my judgment, is that about one-third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped via faster economic growth," Mankiw said. Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at the University of Southern California, said smart corporate tax reform could stimulate the economy somewhat -- but at a net loss. "A really well-designed corporate tax reform package, including a rate cut, would be accretive to growth," he said, "but not enough to pay for any resulting large-scale deficits." So tax cuts can create some growth, according to the experts. But are there any historical cases of tax cuts producing so much growth they fully pay for themselves? "I am not aware of any credible evidence (in the U.S.) over the last several decades of a broad-based tax cut paying for itself," said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. "I don't think this is at all controversial among actual economists." Kleinbard was similarly emphatic: "There is no time in modern history where tax cuts could be said to pay for themselves." According to Kleinbard, the 1981 tax cuts triggered massive federal deficits and were largely reversed within three years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was basically revenue neutral, he said, meaning tax cuts were virtually offset by spending cuts. He added that President Bill Clinton’s tax hike was followed by robust growth, while the George W. Bush tax cuts led to anemic growth. None of the experts interviewed cited evidence that tax cuts under President Barack Obama produced sufficient growth to pay for themselves either. On the contrary, there’s some evidence that tax cuts can be a drag on the economy -- like the 2005 CBO study mentioned earlier. When the CBO studied the effects of a hypothetical 10 percent income tax cut for Americans, not all the projections were as rosy as the finding above. Under the CBO’s most pessimistic projection, tax cuts would lead to a 3 percent increase in lost revenue over 10 years. Indeed, tax cuts can have a number of adverse effects that may actually impede growth, according to Kleinbard. One example is a phenomenon known as the "crowding out" effect. The basic idea is that tax cuts create deficits that cause the government to borrow more money and therefore enter deeper debt, which can make private sector borrowing more expensive. Our ruling Foroohar said, "There's no real evidence in the last 20 years that" growth from tax cuts has made up lost revenue. We searched high and low and found no economic experts who could point us to evidence of tax cuts fully paying for themselves. Neither the modern historical record (using fair benchmarks) nor government analyses we looked at supported the claim that tax cuts create enough growth to eventually offset lost revenue. On the contrary, there’s evidence that tax cuts may actually hinder economic growth. We rate Foroohar’s statement True.	None	Rana Foroohar	None	None	None	2017-04-28T11:16:16	2017-04-26	['None']
pomt-05183	Rob Portman shares "radical, ideological views" toward women.	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/14/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-rob-portman-shares-radi/	We mean no blasphemy. But what do you call a male, Methodist, Republican lawmaker who supports a measure -- backed by many Catholics -- to allow employers and schools to opt out health-care law mandates on moral or religious grounds? Is he a supporter of religious rights? Or is he a politician with radical, ideological views toward women? The issue here, as may be obvious, is whether employers should be able to omit contraception coverage in their health insurance plans because they believe the use of certain birth control methods or medications is a sin, or they have other moral objections. The issue arose after President Barack Obama’s administration ruled that contraception should be covered, with no co-payment, as an essential health and prevention benefit under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The requirement takes effect in August. Churches were exempted from the requirement but in February, after fierce debate with groups supporting reproductive or religious rights, the administration also exempted religion-affiliated schools and charities. Women whose church-employers opt out can still get contraception coverage but must do so through the insurer, without paying another premium, rather than through the workplace. Critics of the health law, including U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said the exemption was too narrow. Portman supported an amendment by Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, to let any employer opt out of coverage if they objected on religious or moral grounds. The amendment, attached to a highway bill, had broad Republican support. Democrats said the amendment was just another attempt to weaken the Affordable Care Act and would open the act to all manner of other carve-outs. On March 1, the Senate voted 51-48 to table the Blunt amendment. With that vote, this episode seemed to be over. But now that Portman is said to be on Mitt Romney’s short list for vice presidential candidate, the Ohio Democratic Party is using it to question Portman’s intent or sincerity. According to a news release the Ohio Democrats issued on June 3 (with multiple claims, one of which we have addressed already), Portman’s vote on the Blunt amendment showed that he "shares Romney’s and Mandel’s radical, ideological view toward women." That would be Josh Mandel, the Republican Ohio treasurer running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. PolitiFact Ohio is not about to go over every statement made by Romney or Mandel to determine whether either holds radical, ideological views toward women. That’s a political, and arguably presumptuous, judgment. But the Ohio Democrats make it easy to explore the basis of their claim when it comes to Portman because they listed two points of evidence. First, they cited comments that Portman made March 5 to host Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s "Hardball" program. Specifically, the Democrats noted, Portman said, "The issue was about religious freedom, as you know. And it`s a legitimate issue." Portman was discussing the Blunt amendment when he made the cited remark. PolitiFact Ohio listened to the rest of Portman’s comments about the amendment to see if they supported the claim that he holds "radical, ideological views" toward women. Here’s the rest of what he said: "I’m up here in Cleveland tonight and there are a lot of folks who are concerned about it. Twenty-five percent of the people up here get their health care through religious organizations and so that religious freedom issue is very important to them." Next, the Ohio Democratic Party noted Portman’s vote. "Rob Portman was the lone Ohio senator to support the Blunt amendment," the Democrats said. Well yes, he was. But each state only has two senators (Ohio currently has Brown and Portman). So if one voted no, the other would be the "lone" yes. It’s not as ominous when you have that bit of context, is it? Who else voted for the Blunt amendment? Before answering, it’s important to know that while some critics considered the Blunt amendment to be an assault on women’s reproductive rights, this issue was important to a number of Catholics. According to the National Catholic Register, the U.S. Senate has 24 Catholic members, and 11 of them supported the Blunt amendment, as did the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Thirteen Catholics in the Senate voted to table the measure. But here’s the number that matters most: 48. That’s the number of senators who supported the Blunt measure, and it was just shy of half the chamber. That number included three Democrats: Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Could every one of those 48 senators hold "radical, ideological views toward women?" We do not doubt the sincerity of either side on this issue. But for the Ohio Democratic Party to accuse Portman of holding radical, ideological views on the basis of comments in an interview that were anything but inflammatory and a vote that clearly split the Senate is itself an extreme characterization. And to criticize him as the "sole" Ohio senator voting no, when this nation has exactly two U.S. senators representing every single state, is laughable. Civics lessons, anyone? The flimsy evidence simply does not support the Ohio Democratic Party’s claim about "radical, ideological views. The statement is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.

pomt-10311	On the Bush tax cuts.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/john-mccain/mccain-used-to-oppose-tax-cuts/	Sen. John McCain was one of the few Republicans who opposed tax cuts proposed by President George W. Bush in 2001, and he opposed them again when they came up for renewal in 2003. In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package, arguing that the tax cuts didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending. Two years later, McCain again citied fiscal prudence for opposing $350-billion in additional tax cuts, specifically citing the unknown costs for the war in Iraq. "No one can be expected to make an informed decision about fiscal policy at this time," McCain said. "Let us wait until we have succeeded in Iraq." When they came up for renewal again in 2006, though, he voted in favor of them. McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which also reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because "American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect." In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, McCain expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent. "I had significant tax cuts, and there was restraint of spending included in my proposal," McCain said during the appearance on Hannity & Colmes . "I saw no restraint in spending. We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today." Justifications aside, this is an actual change of position for McCain, so we rate his change on the Bush tax cuts a Full Flop.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-04T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['None']
pomt-05189	Says lawyer appointed by Eric Holder to investigate government leaks helped and donated to Obama's campaign, vetting vice presidential prospects.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/13/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-obama-appointed-campaign-donor-wh/	U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called June 12, 2012, for Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation, saying Holder is stonewalling about a botched investigation that involved moving guns across the U.S.-Mexico border. Holder disputed Cornyn's characterization of his responsiveness about Operation Fast and Furious, also pointing out he ended the gun-walking program. Yet Cornyn also aired another criticism, both at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and in a commentary placed the same day on the Fox News website. In the commentary, Cornyn said Ronald Machen, one of two U.S. attorneys just named by Holder to lead the government’s investigation of information leaks, "has donated thousands of dollars to President Obama’s political campaigns; he vetted vice presidential candidates for the Obama team in 2008; and he got his first job as a federal prosecutor from, you guessed it, Eric Holder. In short, Mr. Machen’s inquiry will not seem truly independent. It is insulting for the attorney general to pretend otherwise." We wondered if Machen, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, is indeed a former Obama campaign donor who vetted vice presidential hopefuls. Who leaked information has been a hot topic in Washington since the New York Times published lengthy news articles on May 29, 2012 and June 1, 2012 detailing Obama’s oversight of secret terrorist kill lists and his hand in planning cyber-attacks on Iran. Republicans including Cornyn have called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to track down leakers. Obama has condemned any leaks as well, while Holder on June 8, 2012, announced he was appointing Machen and Rod J. Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, to lead criminal investigations into possible recent instances of unauthorized disclosures of classified information. Machen, a former assistant U.S. attorney, won Senate confirmation in his post in February 2010. Rosenstein, initially appointed to his job by President George W. Bush, was retained by Obama. Holder said: "These two highly respected and experienced prosecutors will be directing separate investigations currently being conducted by the FBI. I have every confidence in their abilities to doggedly follow the facts and the evidence in the pursuit of justice wherever it leads." At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cornyn challenged Machen’s independence. After Holder confirmed that he had earlier hired Machen as an assistant U.S. attorney, Cornyn asked him: "Would it surprise you to know that he is a political contributor to President Obama’s campaign and indeed served as a volunteer in Obama for America and assisted in the vetting of potential vice presidential candidates?" Holder replied: "I am confident that he has the ability, the capacity to investigate this case in a nonpartisan, independent, thorough and aggressive way." Asked for backup information, Cornyn spokeswoman Megan Mitchell later pointed us to research by the Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign donations, indicating that Machen, identified on the center’s site as a resident of Silver Spring, Md., and an attorney in the WilmerHale firm, donated a total of $4,100, in four chunks, to Obama’s presidential campaign from Feb. 8, 2008, through Sept. 30, 2008. In February 2010, the firm, whose full name is Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr, issued a press release identifying Machen as a partner. Machen joined the firm in 1993, then worked as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1997 to 2001 before returning to the firm, according to the release. Mitchell also pointed us to a Jan. 19, 2010, news blog post in Legal Times, which covers legal news in Washington and nationally. The post says Machen revealed on a Senate questionnaire he filled out fo as he faced confirmation that he had volunteered for Obama’s campaign and vetted vice presidential prospects for Obama’s campaign. The blog post says vetting work "generally consists of standard background checks of personal information, public speeches, and writings." We emailed Obama’s campaign about Cornyn's claim. Spokeswoman Kara Carscaden declined to comment except to stress Holder’s response to Cornyn about Machen’s ability to perform his newly assigned task. Our ruling We are not judging here whether Machen's donations to Obama's 2008 campaign and his self-declared vetting of vice presidential prospects disqualify him from fully investigating any leaks.

pomt-10762	Thompson "voted against $250,000 caps on damages (and) almost anything that would make our legal system fairer."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/25/rudy-giuliani/update-some-truth-some-stretching-/	Rudy Giuliani criticized Fred Thompson's votes against tort reform bills at a Republican debate in Orlando on Oct. 21, 2007. "Fred was the single biggest obstacle to tort reform in the United States Senate," Giuliani said. "He stood with Democrats over and over again." Giuliani said Thompson "voted against $250,000 caps on damages, which they have in Texas. He voted against almost anything that would make our legal system fairer: 'loser pays' rules, things that would prevent lawsuits like that $54 million lawsuit by that guy who lost his pants . . . Fred Thompson, along with very few Republicans, blocked tort reform over and over and over again. That is not a conservative position." We find Giuliani has his facts only partially right and is stretching the truth with his rhetoric. Giuliani is correct that Thompson cast a vote against a $250,000 cap on punitive damages, but that's only part of the story. Thompson's no vote back in 1995 was on an amendment to a product liability bill. The cap as written in the bill originally had been $250,000 or three times the economic damages, whichever is greater. The amendment lowered it to $250,000 or double the economic damages. Thompson was one of only six Republicans to vote against lowering the cap. But the following year, when the amended bill came back for final passage, Thompson voted for it. President Clinton later vetoed the legislation. Giuliani is right that Texas has a $250,000 cap on the amount individuals can receive in punitive damages in a health care liability case, although claims against separate hospitals and health care institutions can collect awards as high as $500,000. He would have been more accurate if he had said the cap as on "punitive damages on medical claims." As our friends at FactCheck.org noted in their report on this topic, Giuliani overreaches with his claim that Thompson was "the single biggest obstacle to tort reform in the Senate." For example, Thompson was one of six Republicans who opposed the $250,000 cap but has also voted with his party on other tort reform bills. Having voted on both sides of the issue, he was not considered the leader of either side. Giuliani is exaggerating with his claim that Thompson opposed "loser pays" rules. Giuliani's claim that his rival opposed "loser pays" rules is based on Thompson's vote (on the winning side) to strip language from the 1996 bill that would have forced only the defendants — not the plaintiffs — to pay attorney and court fees if they refused to settle of court and the refusal was "unreasonable or not made in good faith." But this doesn't really fit the definition of "loser pays"; instead, striking the language did more to benefit the corporate defendants. Overall, we find Giuliani's attack on Thompson to be Barely True. UPDATE: We originally ruled this Half True, but we discovered we had only examined some of Thompson's votes on the $250,000 cap. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01915	U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue’s company took $3 million from the federal stimulus program that President Barack Obama created.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/30/jack-kingston/kingston-claim-more-rhetoric-reality/	In a provocative ad now airing on television and radio, U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston tries to tie his Republican runoff opponent, businessman David Perdue, to President Barack Obama. An Obama impersonator leaves a faux voicemail for Kingston, asking him to "ease up" on Perdue because "he’s my kind of guy." Perdue and Kingston, a veteran U.S. congressman from Savannah, are locked in a heated Republican runoff to be the party’s nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. In November, the winner of the July 22 runoff faces Democrat Michelle Nunn. In his ad, Kingston claims Perdue's company took $3 million from the federal stimulus program that Obama created to jump-start the economy. Kingston opposed the stimulus, and some critics say it was a waste of taxpayer money. But is the claim about a Perdue company taking stimulus money true? Or is it more rhetoric than reality? PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know. Kingston is hardly the first candidate to try to discredit an opponent with claims of connections to the president or to one of Obama’s polarizing initiatives – mainly, the health care overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the "stimulus plan." In 2012, Mark Neumann, the leading tea party candidate in Wisconsin’s GOP Senate primary, was on the defensive after acknowledging that his company took $80,000 in stimulus money. He lost the primary to former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. In his ad, Kingston is referring to $3.4 million in stimulus that went to Alliant Energy Co., a Midwest energy holding company that reported $3.2 billion in operating revenue in 2013. Perdue, best known for his leadership of Dollar General, has been on Alliant’s board of directors since 2001, earning about $1.3 million in directors fees, according to records of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, Perdue reported making between $2.1 million and $8.1 million from investment income and corporate board memberships. At the time, in addition to Alliant’s board, he was serving on the board of Sandy Springs-based Graphic Packaging International Inc., California-based Easton-Bell Sports Inc. and Washington-based Liquidity Services Inc. Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said this week that Perdue has acknowledged in the past that he knew of the stimulus grants to Alliant. "If he was aware, why didn’t he take action to stop them?" Crawford said. "If he didn’t take an ownership role in leading the company, why did he take $1 million from the company?" Perdue campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey said the ad is representative of "the kind of false and misleading accusations we have come to expect" from Kingston. Perdue didn’t receive any stimulus money personally and neither did any company he managed, Dickey said. He said Perdue doesn’t recall any board of directors vote at Alliant on the stimulus money and isn’t a fan of that initiative. "David believes that overall, like most spending by Washington politicians, the stimulus was a waste of taxpayer money that missed its mark while piling on even more debt," Dickey said. (Perdue’s campaign has stressed the need to reduce the federal debt and has a running debt clock on its website.) We attempted to contact Alliant to see whether we could review the minutes of the board of directors’ meetings, specifically to see whether there were discussions and/or votes on the stimulus money. We didn’t receive an immediate response. We also reached out to Robert S. Chirinko, a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in corporate governance issues. We asked him about the fairness of an ad suggesting that the stimulus money went to "one of Perdue’s companies" when his role at Alliant is as a member of the board of directors. Members of a board of directors "are merely the trustees of the company and they represent the shareholders’ interests," he said. "In principle, the board makes sure the shareholders/owners get treated fairly and applicable laws and regulations are followed. It could well be the case that the board was not involved in the decision to accept stimulus money." With a major company the size of Alliant, "$3.4 million may fly below the board’s radar screen," Chirinko said. The Kingston ad mentions the $3 million in stimulus funds. But the Kingston camp says much more stimulus money went to Alliant or its affiliates. The company’s 2012 annual report shows that it has three wind farms that took at least $64 million in stimulus-provided production tax credits and another that took a $62.4 million stimulus cash grant, Crawford said. The Hill also has reported that Graphic Packaging, another company that has Perdue on its board, received a $500,000 stimulus grant. Perdue’s camp suggests Kingston has questions of his own to answer about the stimulus. Dickey said Kingston voted against the stimulus but lobbied for and put out press releases about the federal money being received in Georgia. In summary, the ad makes the claim that one of Perdue’s companies took stimulus money. Perdue sat on four company boards, including at Alliant. That’s a lot different than owning, running or working day to day for a company. We think it’s misleading to say Alliant is his company in an attempt to link him to the president’s stimulus program. It is a company with which he has an affiliation, so there is a bit of truth here, but just a bit. We rate the attack ad statement as Mostly False.

pomt-10551	"Hillary's main extracurricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/15/chain-email/she-did-not-help-the-black-panthers/	Hillary Clinton and the Black Panthers. It makes for quite the unlikely image. But according to a chain e-mail that originated with an Internet article by Dick Morris, the former Clinton adviser turned foe, Hillary Rodham was a student radical at Yale Law School who dedicated herself to helping violent Black Panthers on trial for murder. "Hillary's main extracurricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent," Morris wrote. "She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal." Often repeated on the Internet, the claim turns out to be largely embellished, but they are not without a grain of truth. Here's the history. In 1970, eight Black Panthers, including national chairman Bobby Seale, were brought to trial in New Haven, Conn., on charges of murdering a fellow member, Alex Rackley, who was suspected of being a police informant. He was not a federal agent. The trial consumed the Yale campus, and many Yale students rallied in support of the black defendants, or at least for their right to a fair trial. In her autobiography, Clinton said in reference to the Black Panthers that "J. Edgar Hoover's FBI infiltrated dissident groups and, in some cases, broke the law in order to disrupt them. Law enforcement sometimes failed to distinguish between constitutionally protected, legitimate opposition and criminal behavior." She does not mention any personal involvement, except to relate that she participated in a bucket brigade to help put out a fire that broke out at the International Law Library just prior to a May Day rally. Clinton played a "minor" role in the doings that year, said Paul Bass, a journalist who spent years researching the Black Panther case for a book he co-authored called Murder in the Model City. She co-chaired a committee whose main role was to prevent violence at the May Day demonstration, Bass said. They made arrangements for medical care should any demonstrators get hurt. Friends recalled that Clinton took a moderate tone, Bass said. The committee also vowed to offer legal advice to demonstrators who got arrested and to monitor the trial for any civil rights abuses. If that monitoring ever happened, said two sources at the trial interviewed by the St. Petersburg Times , one thing is certain: Clinton was not an every-day trial watcher, as Morris claimed. Nor did she "help" the defense. David Rosen, who was less than a year out of Yale Law School, was a junior member of the defense team for Seale. "I can't say she was never in court," Rosen said. "But she was not there every day. In fact, I don't even remember seeing her there at all." "I know she didn't do any work for the defense team," Rosen said. "I was on the defense team, and she didn't do anything for us." According to Carl Bernstein's biography A Woman in Charge, Clinton was among the student-observers from professor Tom Emerson's civil liberties class who attended the trial daily "to report possible abuses by the government, discuss them in class, write papers about them and prepare summaries for the American Civil Liberties Union." That last part is news to Mike Avery, who was hired by the ACLU as a staff lawyer to work on the Black Panther case, to keep tabs on any civil rights violations that came up at trial. He doesn't remember the ACLU receiving summaries from any student group, and he specifically does not remember Clinton being a regular at the trial. "To my knowledge, she didn't have any involvement at all," said Avery, now a law professor at Suffolk Law School in Boston. "I didn't see Hillary Rodham anywhere around the place, and I would have known." People involved in the case, even peripherally, all knew each other, he said. They socialized together. "She was not in that crowd," he said, "by no stretch of the imagination." Nevertheless, the distorted versions from Morris and others have been picked up on thousands of Web pages, and widely circulated via chain e-mail. They also have been echoed by conservative political commentators like Sean Hannity. "What the right has done is just a travesty," said Bass, who added that he is no fan of Clinton. "She wasn't any kind of student leader on this. I couldn't find a person who saw her anywhere. The attempt to use this incident to claim Clinton was an apologist for violence is really insidious." Clinton's campaign did not respond to inquiries from the Times. Even if Clinton helped to observe the trial as part of a law class, that's different than "helping" the Panthers, who were on trial. And the claim that Clinton went to court every day to monitor the trial is, according to witnesses, just not so. Morris appears to have taken a minor involvement by Clinton and spun it into a much more prominent and controversial role. We rate his claim False.

pomt-14757	"David Simpson actually voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/dec/11/bryan-hughes/bryan-hughes-mostly-wrong-about-david-simpson-voti/	Republican candidates for an East Texas state Senate seat disagree over whether one of them has voted for permitting driver’s licenses for Texas residents who lack legal permission to live in the country. State Rep. David Simpson of Longview emailed reporters a Nov. 30, 2015, statement saying Rep. Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods. The two are competing for a chance to succeed Kevin Eltife of Tyler representing the Senate's District 1. Simpson said: "I have always opposed driver’s licenses for illegal aliens." Hughes disputed that in a Dec. 1, 2015, press release stating Simpson "actually voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants." Is that right? Some perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribune news story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card. Mindful that Hughes said Simpson, a third-term legislator, voted for giving driver’s licenses to immigrants, we reviewed Simpson’s legislative record. We ultimately found no direct votes by Simpson on licenses for immigrants. In contrast, he joined most House members in voting for the 2011 mandate that the state request proof of legal residency from driver’s license applicants, arguably a sign he wasn’t champing to ease the way for unauthorized residents to get licensed. Still, his vote on a 2013 House proposal leaves room for speculation about his consistency. 2011 In summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for driver’s licenses by placing an amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security. See the agency's explanation of the requirement here. And on June 9, 2011, nearly every House member (including Simpson) approved the amendment to Senate Bill 1. House video reveals no debate of the matter after Rep. Charles Geren, R-Fort Worth, told colleagues the amendment "addresses an issue of people getting Texas driver’s licenses that don’t live in Texas and it also allows the department to issue a license only for the length of time that a person is entitled to be here." According to the House Journal, eight members, Simpson not among them, asked to be recorded voting against the amendment. Records show too Simpson voting against the overall fiscal matters proposal several times; those votes occurred on June 9, June 10 and June 28, 2011. By email, Simpsons told us he opposed the measure "due to its accounting gimmicks—namely, the deferment of Foundation School Program payments and the speed-up of tax payments—and its misplaced priorities, not because of the license provision, which I supported." He provided a copy of a May 2012 letter to House constituents stating that he "voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses" but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used "smoke and mirrors" to balance the state budget. So, there are no votes by Simpson in favor of driver’s licenses for immigrants. But there does appear to be fodder for speculation about Simpson’s consistent opposition. 2013 In 2013, Simpson voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We don’t know of an independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on driver’s licenses. But on May 20, 2013, Simpson edged a step farther by voting in favor of one of the failed amendments, the Texas House Journal shows. An amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said that under the legislation, which generally authorized a pilot project enabling a few counties to update or renew driver’s licenses, a license should include "any Texas resident driver’s permit authorized by law." And what did that mean? In debate, opponents said Cook’s language related to unauthorized residents getting a driver’s permit. Similarly, Simpson and Hughes’ campaign each nudged, conservative advocacy groups characterized the amendment as opening driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. In a scorecard of the 2013 Legislature, for instance, the Young Conservatives of Texas said Cook’s amendment "would have allowed for illegal immigrants to receive driver’s licenses." We didn’t reach that conclusion. By email, Simpson told us Cook’s amendment "in no way authorized illegal aliens to receive driver’s licenses." Asked why he voted for it, Simpson said: "I voted yes to the amendment because it would only include licenses or permits already" authorized by law. In the House debate, Cook didn’t dispute that his proposal might legalize more drivers; he also stressed that another change in law would be needed for the envisioned driving permits to become a reality. And while his proposal drew 72 votes, with 67 members voting no, it still died because Cook offered the proposal during final consideration of SB 1729; at that stage, 100 House votes were needed to amend legislation. A few days earlier, on May 17, 2013, Cook rolled out a longer amendment to SB 1729. He described the longer proposal--which was shortly derailed on a parliamentary point of order--as identical to a committee-approved version of House Bill 3206 by Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas. Alonzo’s unsuccessful plan called for state-issued driving permits for residents who lack proof of legal residency, also requiring recipients to obtain auto insurance. Under the proposal, every applicant would have to submit to fingerprinting and clear a criminal background check. Before his proposal was felled, Cook told House members the permits wouldn’t look like driver’s licenses and couldn’t be used as IDs to board planes or vote. "We have a growing population of non-citizens driving every day to school, to church, to work, all without insurance," Cook said, posing risks to all residents. The same month, Hughes’ campaign pointed out, Simpson was on the losing end of an 87-60 House vote setting aside Alonzo’s amendment to another House measure authorizing the state to let public schools and driving schools give the driving test required to get a license. Before that May 21, 2013, action, Alonzo told House colleagues that under his amendment, schools could give driving tests to individuals who obtained resident driving permits, provided such permits were legalized. "Texas has a problem," Alonzo said, with people driving without auto insurance or a driver’s permit. By phone, Alonzo told us he favors giving undocumented individuals an opportunity to legally drive in Texas and his 2013 proposal’s described permits could have nudged the state toward fulfilling that goal though, he said, it didn’t provide for full-fledged licenses. Our ruling Hughes said Simpson "voted for driver's licenses for illegal immigrants." No such vote occurred. In the clearest vote we could find, Simpson voted to make it harder, not easier, to obtain licenses when, in 2011, he joined nearly every House member in approving a new mandate that applicants for driver’s licenses be required to document their legal residency. But we did find an element of truth to Hughes’ statement. Simpson voted in 2013 for an unsuccessful proposal that could generously be interpreted as foreseeing a path to individuals living here without authorization getting resident driving permits, though significantly such permits as sought by Alonzo and others didn’t (and don’t) exist. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-06415	Says it wasn't until he and a Senate colleague were able to "wrangle the actual streaming video" from BP that scientists were able to calculate the oil spill flow.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/26/bill-nelson/sen-bill-nelson-said-his-battle-bp-video-allowed-s/	It's been a year and a half since oil suddenly gushed from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig into the Gulf of Mexico. In the early days, rig operator BP estimated about 1,000 barrels a day might be escaping into the gulf. The true number? More like 50,000 to 60,000 barrels — or more than 2 million gallons — every day, for nearly three months. How did we learn it was so high? U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., says it wasn't until he and a Senate colleague were able to "wrangle the actual streaming video" from BP that scientists were able to calculate the flow. Nelson spoke about the spill Oct. 11, 2011, on the Senate floor, where he urged his colleagues to find a way to fund gulf research. He began: "As one of the senators from a state that borders the Gulf of Mexico, naturally we have been quite concerned in the followup to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. You will remember that was an oil spill that at first BP said: Oh, it was only 1,000 barrels a day. It was not until Sen. (Barbara) Boxer, the chairman of the environment committee, and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out. It was not anywhere close to 1,000 barrels a day. In fact, it ended up being 50,000 barrels of oil a day that was gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of that total number of days, almost 5 million barrels of oil has gushed into the gulf, we can expect some serious economic and environmental consequences and particularly the consequences on the critters." The senior senator from Florida, responsible for lifting the veil on a disaster unfolding 5,000 feet underwater? For this fact-check, we're weighing the statement, "It was not until Sen. Boxer ... and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video (of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill) from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out." We reached out to scientists, reviewed news and video from the time, checked official reports on the spill and spoke with the senator's office. • • • On April 20, 2010, an explosion ripped through the drilling rig, killing 11 crew members. As flames raged above water 49 miles off the coast of Louisiana, something equally violent was happening beneath the surface. It wasn't yet clear what. But within a day, a nonprofit group called SkyTruth, led by a geologist who had worked for the energy industry, began collecting and analyzing satellite images of the spill — brown swirls a reporter would later say resembled peanut butter. The group got help from Florida State oceanographer Ian MacDonald. On April 24, BP said that a broken riser pipe was leaking 1,000 barrels a day. A few days later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration boosted the estimate to 5,000 barrels. That was the first official "flow rate estimate." It would be used for weeks. It wasn't based on much. In late April and early May, SkyTruth said satellite images and Coast Guard maps of the slick showed the flow might be more than four times that. But none of those estimates could fully account for what was happening below the surface, where chemical dispersants created tiny droplets that spread in underwater plumes. • • • On May 12, BP released a 30-second video of oil and gas spilling from the end of a broken pipe — and scientists scrambled to update their estimates, which now ranged from 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. By mid May, media reports spread additional doubt about the 5,000-barrel estimate. Rep. Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who chaired the Energy and Environment Subcommittee, sent BP a letter questioning the size of the spill. A few days later, Sens. Nelson and Boxer sent their demand for underwater video. They soon got seven hard drives of high-resolution digital imagery, thousands of hours, said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin. Low-resolution streaming video — what you may have seen online — wouldn't give scientists the detail they needed, so the senators' offices also uploaded high-resolution files to large-file transfer sites on the Web and in some cases even copied the hard drives and sent them to researchers, such as Timothy Crone at Columbia University. In June, the senators repeated their call for video evidence, this time for all video records. In the Oct. 29, 2010, issue of Science magazine, a report co-authored by Crone said the oil's flow was at least 10 times higher than first reported. It credited high-resolution video data "provided by the office of Senator Bill Nelson and by the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works." "Sen. Nelson was one of the strongest proponents of open data access, and his work along with the work of others on that committee were critical for the work of independent scientists to go forward," Crone told PolitiFact Florida. Paul Ruscher, a Florida State professor who along with MacDonald urged that BP release more information, said much of what scientists suggested was initially ignored. "It was a staffer from Sen. Nelson's office who was contacted at some point, and whom I then contacted, to try to encourage both Senate and House energy committee members to get involved," he said. Ruscher said Nelson and other politicians, including Sen. John Kerry and Markey, should get full credit for pushing NOAA, the Coast Guard and BP to release video. Final official estimates came from the Flow Rate Technical Group, which used several methods to estimate the amount of oil that streamed from Deepwater Horizon. Among its evidence: high-resolution video. Our ruling Nelson told his Senate colleagues, "It was not until Sen. Boxer ... and I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video (of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill) from 5,000 feet below the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists could then calculate how much oil was coming out." Scientists quickly challenged BP's early estimate based on satellite images and Coast Guard maps. Independent estimates improved when BP released short video clips. But scientists who specialize in flow rate calculations based on high-resolution, time-stamped video didn't have access to data they needed until Nelson's and Boxer's offices pushed for it. Some of those files were indeed downloaded from Nelson's website, while some were on physical hard drives that had to be mailed. A casual listener might think scientists were unable to make early calculations that challenged BP's word without video from Nelson's website — and that's not quite the case. Meanwhile, other lawmakers also pushed for greater openness. But letters, press releases and interviews show Nelson did play a key role in the release of critical data, and for that we'll rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08596	"Our county now has the fastest growing airport in America, attracting nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/24/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-milwaukee-airport-fastest-growin/	On Sept. 14, 2010, after winning the Republican nomination for governor, Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker in a victory speech rattled off a list of on-the-job accomplishments -- from holding down taxes to cleaning up county government. Among the items Walker listed: "Our county now has the fastest growing airport in America, attracting nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs." Every month seems to bring a new announcement from Walker’s county office of a new record for passengers at Mitchell International Airport. But is Mitchell’s traffic growth really leading the nation? And what about those 1,000 jobs? A review of county records shows these are boom times at Mitchell -- thanks to consolidations and convulsions in the airline business. Airlines are adding flights to and from the airport and more passengers are coming through the gates. In July 2010, the airport set a single-month record with 928,497 passengers, the 11th consecutive month of record passenger growth. In the first quarter of 2010, the airport handled 2,192,859 passengers -- a 35.3 percent increase over the first quarter of 2009. That first quarter performance put MKE near the top of an international list. According to Airports Council International, an industry group, Mitchell’s year-over-year passenger growth was the world’s fourth largest, behind Istanbul, Turkey; Phuket, Thailand; and Moscow. Milwaukee was the only U.S. airport in the top 30 list. So what is going on at Mitchell, and is Walker right to claim county credit for it? It’s simple, according to aviation consultant Michael Boyd, of Boyd Group International in Evergreen, Colo.: Three airlines -- AirTran Airways, Southwest and Republic -- are "trying to kill each other." "It has nothing to do with county government," Boyd said. "It has to do with airline economics." After the former owner of Midwest Airlines slashed the number of flights by 40 percent and cut hundreds of jobs, the others moved in on the business. AirTran established a second national hub at Mitchell, increasing departures from 18 to 47 in the past year. Southwest began service in November 2009, adding 10 departures. And Republic, the new owner of Midwest (now operating as Frontier Airlines), began restoring service. It now has 90 flights a day, five less than what Midwest offered a year ago. So the airport is leading the nation in passenger growth -- in part because it is working its way back up of the decline that came when Midwest cut its flights. But what about the "nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs"? No one counts "airport" jobs. Not the state, county or the Metropolitan Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, which compiles area employment reports each month. When asked for documentation, the Walker campaign responded with three clippings -- one each from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ("Republic Airways to add up to 800 jobs here"), BizTimes.com ("Southwest Airlines to begin with 12 flights out of Milwaukee") and WISN.com ("AirTran Brings More Jobs to Milwaukee"). Tallied together, they covered 940 new jobs. The clips were all from 2009, so we contacted the airlines for fresh information. Republic said it has added 500 jobs. AirTran said it added 100. Southwest added 41. That’s about 640 jobs -- far short of those promised of the 940 promised , though AirTran and Republic have said they plan to continue to add jobs into next year. Of course, the new jobs come against the backdrop of lost jobs, as Midwest struggled to stay afloat. The airline cut 2,600 jobs nationwide between early 2008 and the fall of 2009. In Wisconsin, Midwest notified the state of plans to lay off 1,600 workers -- 1,379 in 2008 and 234 in 2009. The other airlines will, no doubt, hire some of those laid-off workers. But employment remains far short of where it was before Midwest’s fall. So, let’s see if Walker’s statement flies. When it comes to growth in passenger count, Mitchell International Airport is leading the nation -- though much of that is through regaining traffic that had been lost in recent years. Experts note this is due to an airline battle, more so than any direct action by Walker or the county. On the jobs side, the new (and promised) jobs won’t replace all the jobs that were lost. If they ultimately come through, Walker’s election-night number of "nearly 1,000" may be on target, but for now that portion of his claim can be marked "Flight delayed." We rate Walker’s statement Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2010-09-24T09:00:00	2010-09-14	['United_States']
pomt-05804	"The governor is trying to take credit for recent actions taken by these companies. The problem is that for all three companies, the decision to move or stay in New Jersey happened before Chris Christie became governor."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/23/new-jersey-senate-democrats/senate-dems-claim-christie-wrongly-takes-credit-bu/	In emphasizing New Jersey’s economic road to recovery, Gov. Chris Christie gave a shoutout to three companies during his State of the State address in January, associating their locations with his "Jersey Comeback" theme. Specifically, Christie noted that Bayer put its North American headquarters in Morris County, Novo Nordisk came to Middlesex County and LG Electronics to Bergen County. Senate Democrats also issued a shoutout on the matter, but theirs wasn’t as flattering as the governor’s. "The governor is trying to take credit for recent actions taken by these companies," the Democrats said in a Jan. 18 news release. "The problem is that for all three companies, the decision to move or stay in New Jersey happened before Chris Christie became governor." The Democrats correctly note that all three companies decided to make New Jersey home before Christie became governor, but at least two of the firms announced expansions after he took office, PolitiFact New Jersey found. First, let’s look at when each company came to New Jersey. Christie was elected governor in November 2009 and took office in January 2010. LG Electronics came to Englewood Cliffs as part of a reorganization, according to a press release it issued in 2004. Bayer announced in 2007 that its U.S. headquarters would be in New Jersey. A year later, Novo Nordisk announced an expansion of its U.S. headquarters in Princeton. So the three companies began putting down roots in the Garden State before Christie was elected governor. But that doesn’t mean his office hasn’t had any involvement with keeping those firms here. In Bayer’s case, the pharmaceutical giant announced in April that New Jersey would also become the "home" of Bayer HealthCare’s consolidated East-Coast business site. Bayer has a contingent purchase agreement for a property in Whippany, according to spokeswoman Rosemarie Yancosek. The deal is in the due diligence process, she said in an e-mail. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak did not respond to our request for comment but the governor said in an April Bayer news release, "Bayer’s commitment to stay and expand in New Jersey is another signal that our state is growing and that this administration’s job creating policies are paying dividends. Bayer’s planned investment in New Jersey will help keep us the premier state in the nation for the pharmaceutical industry in addition to creating needed jobs and giving a boost to our state’s economy." Novo Nordisk spokesman Ken Inchausti told us in an e-mail that the Danish pharmaceutical company last October announced plans for another expansion, on Scudders Mill Road in Plainsboro. It’s worth noting that the Democrats cited Novo Nordisk’s move to Princeton in their Jan. 18 release, but that’s in Mercer County. Christie’s address cited the company’s location in Middlesex County, which is the Plainsboro expansion announced three months ago. Democrats spokesman Chris Donnelly declined to comment further on the release, which doesn’t clarify whether Christie was talking about the businesses’ initial arrival in New Jersey or expansion plans. But the governor’s words do give an impression that the companies are new to the state. "People are recognizing the New Jersey Comeback all around the world … Bayer put its North American headquarters in Morris County, Novo Nordisk in Middlesex County, and LG Electronics in Bergen County," Christie said in his address. LG Electronics did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling The state Senate Democrats issued a news release in January claiming that Christie, in his State of the State address, was trying to take credit for Bayer, Novo Nordisk and LG Electronics coming to New Jersey under the "Jersey Comeback" heading. We found that the three companies arrived in New Jersey before Christie became governor and anyone heard of a "Jersey Comeback," but Bayer and Novo Nordisk announced expansion plans after Christie’s election.

pomt-04463	Says Mitt Romney plans to "fire" Big Bird.	pants on fire!	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/09/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-wants-fire-big-bird/	Scare tactics have a long history in American politics. Now, the Obama campaign is trying to scare preschoolers -- and their parents -- with a claim that Mitt Romney wants to fire Big Bird. It all started with Romney's remark in the last debate that he opposes federal subsidies for PBS. "I’m sorry, Jim," Romney told debate moderator Jim Lehrer during the debate at University of Denver on Oct. 3. "I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. … I like PBS, I love Big Bird. I actually like you, too. But I’m not going to — I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for." The towering yellow fellow stole the show again on Monday in Derry, N.H., when a plucky Big Bird impersonator from President Barack Obama’s reelection team hoisted a sign stating, "Romney-Boehner. Tough on Sesame Street; Soft on Wall Street," outside U.S. House Speaker John Boehner’s speaking event stumping for the former Massachusetts governor. Big Bird didn’t have much to say, but his handler, Holly Shulman, communications director for Obama for America-New Hampshire, did. "Mitt Romney’s plan is to give $5 trillion in tax breaks skewed toward the wealthiest Americans," Shulman said, "while getting rid of the things that people care about, getting rid of Planned Parenthood, firing Big Bird and voucherizing Medicare." Nationwide, surrogates for Obama are harping on the future of the Sesame Street hero to highlight another way they say Romney is out of touch. On Tuesday, Obama released a sarcastic campaign commercial, mocking Romney for taking on "menaces to our economy" like Big Bird, "no matter where they nest." Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street, has since cried fowl over the ad and asked the campaign to take it down. But we wondered whether the campaign was going too far with its claim that Romney would "fire" the Sesame Street icon. And as Big Bird often says, "Asking questions is a good way of finding things out!" First we contacted Obama’s campaign for sources. They chirped about the small impact reducing public broadcasting appropriations would have on the federal budget, and cited articles where Romney talks about the cuts and PBS news releases about their station’s reach. We asked Romney’s campaign for some background. In an interview with Fortune magazine earlier this year, Romney ticked off a number of so-called subsidy programs he would eliminate if elected, including the one behind PBS. For fiscal 2013, the federal government appropriated $445 million for public broadcasting according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Washington Post compared that with the $1.42 billion the government spent for Amtrak, and the $146 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities -- two other subsidies Romney said he would cut. "Some of these things, like those endowment efforts and PBS I very much appreciate and like what they do in many cases, but I just think they have to stand on their own rather than receiving money borrowed from other countries, as our government does on their behalf," he told Fortune. The current appropriation is just over one one-hundredth of one percent (.01 percent) of the federal budget -- approximately $1.35 per person per year, Jan McNamara, senior director of PBS’ Corporate Communications told PolitiFact in an email. It accounts for about 15 percent of the revenue for public television and public radio overall, she added. The way the system works is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting administers the funds with a "definitive, federally mandated" formula. The federal appropriation doesn’t go directly to PBS. "By statute, the majority of funds are distributed directly to the approximately 1,300 locally owned public television and radio stations currently serving viewers and listeners," McNamara said. "These locally governed, community-based stations depend on this critical seed money, which they leverage to raise the addition (sic) funds needed to provide content and services that are available to everyone, regardless of geography or ability to pay for a cable or satellite subscription." For each dollar in federal funding invested in local stations, the stations raise an additional $6 on their own, including millions of contributions from volunteer supporters as part of a public-private partnership. PBS, a nonprofit public broadcasting television network, has nearly 360 member stations, according to its website. Sesame Street has been one of its staple programs for about 43 years. Forbes also noted almost 60 percent of funding for public television comes from private donors or grants, with additional funding coming from dues paid by member stations. Big Bird's nest egg According to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s public affairs office, it provided $1.25 million to Sesame Street through a National Program Service grant to PBS in fiscal 2011, along with an $8 million grant to Sesame Workshop, for "The Electric Company: Phase II." And in fiscal 2012, Sesame Street got $1.4 million in funding through the National Program Service grant, which supports children’s and prime-time television programming that "engages, inspires, and educates," including other PBS programs such as Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, PBS NewsHour and NOVA, officials said. According to Sesame Workshop’s most recent 990 form, filed for its 2010 year ending June 30, 2011, government grants and contributions accounted for about 5 percent of the $133 million revenue they brought in. Because much of the government money goes to other programs, the subsidy for Sesame Street is even lower. And MSN Money pointed out that Sesame brought in $46.9 million in licensing revenue for toys and other merchandise in 2011. So how much would slashing the public broadcasting appropriation impact the feathery, eight-foot-two-inch friend everyone’s so worried about? Not much, according to an interview CNN did with Sherrie Westin, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Sesame Workshop. "Sesame Workshop receives very, very little funding from PBS. So, we are able to raise our funding through philanthropic, through our licensed product, which goes back into the educational programming, through corporate underwriting and sponsorship," Westin told CNN. "So quite frankly, you can debate whether or not there should be funding of public broadcasting. But when they always try to tout out Big Bird, and say we’re going to kill Big Bird – that is actually misleading, because Sesame Street will be here." On Monday, Westin blogged about the issue again on Sesame Workshop’s website, explaining her conversation on CNN was only "half the story." "Sesame Workshop has created a financially sustainable model to fund production of our educational programming here and around the world," Westin wrote. "But Sesame Street would not exist were it not for PBS and its local stations, which is the distribution system for Big Bird and friends to reach all children across the United States, particularly the low income children who need us most." "A CNN poll said 7% of the American public think that PBS gets as much as half the US budget! 30% think it’s 5%. In reality it’s 0.014%. Let’s keep that in perspective and also not forget the return on that investment: millions of children who have benefited from early childhood education brought to them by the letters, P. B. S.!" Our Ruling In its latest attempt to portray Romney as heartless, the Obama campaign is making a serious allegation that he wants to put one of America's most beloved children's characters in the unemployment line. Romney has been clear that his plan for PBS is not specific to Big Bird (nor to Jim Lehrer for that matter). He simply wants to end federal subsidies. It's a ridiculous stretch to equate that with firing the 8-foot-2 yellow bird. Just as Democrats have scared senior citizens about losing Medicare, they are now scaring preschoolers about losing Big Bird. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01924	Says Charlie Crist signed "the nation’s harshest marijuana laws."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jun/27/progressive-choice/charlie-crist-signed-nations-harshest-marijuana-la/	A radio ad attacking former Gov. Charlie Crist accuses him of signing the nation’s "harshest marijuana laws." And it’s aimed at a voting bloc that overwhelmingly sides with Democrats: African-Americans. "While Crist was coddling the gun lobby, he was cracking down on us," says the ad from Progressive Choice Florida, a 501(c)4 group that’s been attacking Crist from the left. " Passing maximum sentencing laws. Signing the nation’s harshest marijuana laws. And enacting the country’s strictest penalties against non-violent offenders – many of whom just happen to be black." We wanted to know if Crist had signed "the nation’s harshest marijuana laws." That claim caught our attention because one of Crist’s chief backers is attorney John Morgan, who’s been bankrolling a campaign urging a constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana. Our research showed that Florida is tough on those busted for pot, but that reputation began long before Crist was governor. Marijuana law during Crist’s tenure Progressive Choice Floridapointed to two bills signed by Crist: House Bill 173, the Marijuana Grow House Eradication Act in 2008, and the so-called "Bong Bill" outlawing drug paraphernalia in 2010. The grow house law made it a second-degree felony to grow 25 or more plants; the previous law set the threshold at 300 plants. The bill also allowed law enforcement to destroy bulky grow house equipment and simply take photos or video. While law enforcement widely supported the bill, advocates for marijuana and the ACLU of Florida opposed it. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and only one representative, Broward Democrat Evan Jenne, voted against it. Jenne told PolitiFact Florida that he opposed the provision that allowed law enforcement to destroy evidence. Though Crist signed the bill, the champion of it was then-Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum, who two years later lost a primary in the governor’s race against Scott. William Shepherd, who worked for McCollum at the time, said he doesn’t know what "harshest" would mean or how Florida’s law compared to other states. (The federal standard was 100 plants.) However, he said the grow house bill was a major change for Florida. "We definitely ramped up the marijuana production laws," he said. In March 2008, Crist told a Miami Herald reporter that he favored Florida's tough drug laws and didn't support reviewing whether to lessen penalties for some crimes such as nonviolent drug possession. Two years later, the bong bill made it a crime to sell smoking devices such as pipes and bongs at most head shops. We found no evidence that Crist pushed hard for the bill, which he signed after the Legislature unanimously passed it in 2010. Were Florida laws 'harshest'? We reached out to experts on marijuana laws to ask if Florida held some sort of record for having "the nation’s harshest marijuana laws." Comparing state drug policies is difficult at best, because each state codifies offenses and sentences in different ways, according to Tamar Todd, an attorney with the pro-decriminalization Drug Policy Alliance. "One of the challenges of cross-state comparison is that some states might be harsher, in that cultivation of any amount is a felony with a harsh sentence, but at the same time cultivation in the presence of a minor is not a separate more serious offense," Todd said. "Other states classify crimes differently than degrees of felonies." He added that how much time offenders actually get may differ, because states often employ diversion programs or habitual offender statutes, muddying the waters concerning sentencing records. Other advocates for legalizing at least some uses of marijuana or reforming marijuana laws told PolitiFact Florida that the state had long had a reputation for tough marijuana laws -- and that didn’t suddenly occur when Crist was governor. Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML which advocates for reform of marijuana laws, pointed to a handful of states that he said have laws that are equally or more harsh than Florida’s including Georgia, Texas, Idaho, Missouri and Wyoming. "Florida, ever since the early 1980s, has historically (and) traditionally always had pretty harsh laws," St. Pierre said. The bills Crist signed as governor didn’t change Florida’s reputation in terms of marijuana laws, he said. "In general, no drug policy reform group, including NORML, viewed the passage of the 2008 anti-cultivation laws as being particularly harsh as much as we did out-of-touch with where most rest of the country is moving politically on cannabis policy," St. Pierre told PolitiFact Florida. Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, wrote an article in 2011 about "The Five Worst states to get busted with pot." The "top 5," in order of severity, were Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Louisiana and Arizona. "No other state routinely punishes minor marijuana more severely than does the Sunshine State," he wrote. "Under Florida law, marijuana possession of 20 grams or less (about two-thirds of an ounce) is a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one-year imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Marijuana possession over 20 grams, as well as the cultivation of even a single pot plant, are defined by law as felony offenses – punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine." A Progressive Choice Florida spokeswoman cited an analysis of state laws and sentencing guidelines written by Jon Gettman, a former NORML director. He wrote that, "The states with the most severe overall penalties for marijuana possession are (in order of severity) Florida, Montana, Arkansas, Georgia and Oregon (tied) and Missouri." But Gettman’s article was based on 2007 arrests and laws in place before Crist was governor. NORML board member Florida attorney Norm Kent told PolitiFact Florida that he considers our state’s laws "draconian and amongst the toughest" but doesn’t consider Florida the worst in the nation. (Kent endorsed Crist earlier this year.) "What happens on the third strike in Texas is you can get life in prison if it’s a marijuana charge," he said. Our ruling A radio ad says that Charlie Crist signed "the nation’s harshest marijuana laws." As governor, Crist signed laws that cracked down on grow houses and bong sales. But both bills sailed through the Legislature without any particular advocacy from Crist. In both cases, the laws didn’t change Florida’s pre-existing reputation as having tough marijuana laws.

pomt-13518	"There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-mostly-right-about-countries-refusing/	In his immigration speech in Phoenix, Donald Trump said he’d buck a trend of countries refusing to allow people deported from America to return to their native homes. "There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States," Trump said, "including large numbers of violent criminals. They won’t take them back. So we say, ‘Okay, we'll keep them.’ "Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me." We decided to check to see if Trump was correct about the number of countries unwilling "to take their people back," and whether they include "large numbers of violent criminals." 23 countries The figure Trump cites comes directly from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement document dated July 14, 2016. The document, which outlines a speech from Daniel Ragsdale, the deputy director of ICE, says that the process for removing those ordered to leave the United States is affected by the range of cooperation offered by foreign nations. As of May 2, 2016, ICE documented 23 countries that are considered "recalcitrant" in taking back their citizens. The list includes Afghanistan, Algeria, China, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Zimbabwe. This classification was determined by a country’s cooperativeness with the deportation process, which included factors like refusing to grant flights back into the country, the country's political environment and the timeliness of granting travel documents. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote a letter to Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, that also cited the 23-county figure. "Lives are being lost, the public’s safety is at risk, and Americans families are suffering," Grassley wrote. "It cannot continue." Both Grassley’s letter and Ragsdale’s comments say the problem has been exacerbated by a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In Zadvydas vs. Davis, the Supreme Court ruled that the United States can hold convicted criminals only for 180 days if a country refuses to take them back. Grassley said in the fiscal year 2015, 2,166 individuals were released after being held for more than 180 days. Based on the Immigration and Nationality Act, the secretary of state is required to stop giving visas to immigrants or nonimmigrants after being notified the country is hindering the accepting of one of its citizens. Yet according to Grassley and the New York Times, that’s only happened once -- in 2001 against the nation of Guyana. Violent offenders So Trump’s number is well sourced. But what about his claim that these people include "large numbers of violent criminals"? That’s harder to verify with concrete data. According to ICE statistics, 19,723 people living in the United States were convicted of a combined 64,197 crimes in 2015. The data notes that the number of convictions is higher than the number of illegal immigrants because one illegal immigrant may have more than one conviction. The top three types of convictions for people living here illegally are traffic or drug-related offenses. Driving under the influence, traffic offenses, and the use, sale or possession of illegal drugs account for almost half, 30,104, of all convictions. Violent offenses make up a smaller percentage of all convictions, but still, add up. There were 1,728 assault convictions, 1,347 domestic violence and 101 homicide convictions, among people living here illegally, according to ICE. There is no crime data specifically on people who were to be released back to their country. Our ruling Trump said "at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. They won’t take them back." Trump’s figure comes from the federal department in charge of immigration and is accurate. But the second half of his statement about "large numbers of violent criminals" is harder to verify. Out of all convictions for anyone known to be in the United States illegally in 2015, 101 were for homicide while more than 30,000 were for traffic-related or drug-related offenses.

pomt-05545	"We gave every public employee in the state the freedom to choose whether or not they want to be in a union."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/09/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-gave-every-public-/	As he prepares for a recall election, Republican Gov. Scott Walker is defending his record in various media appearances. In a March 19, 2012 appearance on Fox News, Walker told talk host Greta Van Susteren that big out-of-state unions were behind the protests in Madison last spring -- and are leading the recall effort against him now. "The national unions, for them, this is all about the money," Walker said. "It’s not just about the budget or collective bargaining. We gave nearly every, well, we gave every public employee in the state the freedom to choose whether or not they want to be in a union or not and I think that’s really why this is a Waterloo for them." That caught our attention. One of the most controversial aspects of Walker’s law stripping collective bargaining for public workers was who the bill did not cover: Police and firefighter union members. The law limits the ability of public unions to bargain collectively for anything except raises controlled for inflation. It ended bargaining over benefits, overtime and work conditions. It also required annual union recertification votes and made payment of union dues optional. The governor got the crux of the new law right -- that state workers could opt out of paying dues and each year the unions would face a recertification vote. Some unions chose to fold rather than be subjected to the annual effort. But Walker said the new law applied to "all" state workers. The law also mandated that local employees participating in the state pension and health systems contribute at least 12.6 percent of their health care premiums and at least 5.8 percent of their salary toward their pension. Again, this did not apply to police and firefighters. At the time the law was passed, Walker said he did not include police and firefighters in the changes so there was no question that law enforcement would be available in the event of strikes or work stoppages. We asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews about the governor’s characterization of the law. She acknowledged Walker did not mention the police and firefighter exemptions and said the governor was speaking in generalities for a national audience and didn’t have time to be more specific. "He was attempting to give the viewers outside of the state of Wisconsin an idea of how things shaped up here," Matthews said. Matthews added that Walker might have given a shorthand answer because he felt rushed: "I think from a contextural standpoint, Greta tends to be a quick interviewer." Walker was interviewed by Van Susteren in person in a Milwaukee studio. It lasted 16 minutes and included asking him respond to a previously recorded interview with Madison firefighters union president Mahlon Mitchell, who is running for lieutenant governor in the recall election. What about Waterloo? Walker’s statement also prompted us to dust off our history books. He’s not the first politician to refer to this 200-year-old European battle when it comes to an important election. But does that match up to history? The Battle of Waterloo took place June 18, 1815, at the border of France and Belgium and it was Napoleon’s final defeat by a coalition of British, German, Belgium, Dutch and Prussian forces, and the end of his role as Emperor of France. Napoleon attacked the combined forces but wound up losing. "Waterloo decisively saw the end of 26 years of fighting between the European powers and France. The French star was eclipsed and the German began its ascendancy. For Britain, Waterloo is not just a battle. It is an institution," according to Britishbattles.com. So what does this bloody battle have to do with Wisconsin politics? Not much, according to Matthews. Walker, she said, was trying to say that the election was an "all or nothing" proposition for the unions. The Waterloo details aren’t as important, she said. Our conclusion Walker appeared on national TV and discussed the state’s repeal of collective bargaining rights for most public employees. The governor knows the extent of the law, and that it does not cover police and firefighters. Indeed, he started his answer apparently with that in mind: "We gave nearly every, well, we gave every public employee in the state the freedom to choose whether or not they want to be in a union or not," he said. Walker almost got it right. But he then backed away. And in the course of doing so, he got it wrong. We rate his statement False.

pomt-01463	"I recently had the opportunity to vote to give the president limited authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/01/bruce-braley/bruce-braley-says-he-give-president-limited-author/	During this busy time for domestic and international news, the emergence of the Islamist militant group ISIS in Syria and Iraq -- and how the United States should respond -- is attracting much of the media’s attention. So it’s no surprise that the topic came up during an Iowa Senate debate between Democratic U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. Braley and Ernst are locked in a tight contest that could help decide control of the Senate. During the Sept. 28, 2014, debate, Braley said, "I recently had the opportunity to vote to give the president limited authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria. ISIS is a threat that must be stopped, and any time American citizens are attacked by a terrorist group, they need to be brought to justice or to the grave. That's what's happening and that's what we'll continue to do." So did he vote to give the president authority to begin strikes? Actually, no. On Sept. 17, less than two weeks before the debate, the House took two votes relevant to this question. The first was whether to attach an amendment -- one related to the situation in the Middle East -- to a broad spending bill. The House voted, 273-156, to attach the amendment to the bill. The second was on passage of the bill itself, including the amendment. The bill passed, 319-108. In both cases, Braley voted in favor, along with a bipartisan majority. However, in the debate, Braley misstated what he was voting on. Here’s the relevant text from the amendment that passed along with the rest of the spending bill: "The Secretary of Defense is authorized, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to provide assistance, including training, equipment, supplies, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals. … Nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances." In other words, this legislative language is all about the United States providing training and supplies to the Syrian rebels -- not about authorizing the president "to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria." "I don’t see how Rep. Braley’s remarks can be construed as accurate at all," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "He did not vote to use U.S. forces to strike targets in Iraq or Syria. All he voted for was the authorization to arm, train, and equip elements of the Syrian opposition to fight ISIS." Indeed, President Barack Obama has indicated so far that he doesn’t need congressional approval for strikes. Obama has been ordering airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks, claiming authorization under the Authorization for Use of Military Force that Congress passed in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks. Congress approved that authorization years before Braley entered Congress. In recent weeks, the White House hasn’t pushed hard for new, specific authorization for striking ISIS, and while some individual lawmakers have urged Congress to debate passage of a new authorization, congressional leaders have been content to let Obama take the lead. When we contacted Braley’s campaign staff, they offered a few points of additional context. One is that the moderator and Ernst followed up Braley’s comments without challenging his wording. The moderator followed Braley by saying, "Ms. Ernst, just to follow up, would you have voted as Congressman Braley did to allow that attack to go forward?" She responded, "Yes, I would have supported that vote also." In a similar vein, the campaign noted that Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., seemed to indicate during floor debate that "this proposal strictly limits the use of United States ground forces in the region. ... Any airstrikes or aid would come at no additional cost to our country." In the debate, Braley "clearly spoke of his vote in Congress to facilitate strikes against ISIS in Syria by training and equipping Syrian rebels, and Joni Ernst agreed that Braley was right to have taken that vote," Braley spokesman Sam Lau told PolitiFact. But while these are points worth noting, what this ultimately means is that the other speakers were just as misinformed (or distracted) as Braley was about what the legislation actually said. Finally, the campaign pointed to the statement Obama made on Sept. 18 after the authorization passed Congress. (Obama signed it into law the next day.) Braley’s camp suggested that Obama was indicating that what Congress passed was meant to lead to strikes to push back against terrorists. But that’s not how we read Obama’s comments. In the statement in question, Obama was careful to frame the legislation narrowly. He talked quite specifically about a "plan to train and equip the opposition in Syria so they can help push back these terrorists. … With this new effort, we’ll provide training and equipment to help them grow stronger and take on ISIL terrorists inside Syria. … The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission; their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. As I told our troops yesterday, we can join with allies and partners to destroy ISIL without American troops fighting another ground war in the Middle East." Our ruling Braley said, "I recently had the opportunity to vote to give the president limited authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria." Braley did cast votes recently on U.S. policy in Syria and Iraq, but they concerned supplying and assisting the Syrian rebels -- not whether to give the president the authority to launch strikes. Some have even criticized Congress for not directly voting to authorize strikes. We rate Braley's claim False.	None	Bruce Braley	None	None	None	2014-10-01T17:06:38	2014-09-28	['Iraq', 'Syria']

pomt-03943	Says "If Oregon’s Legislature simply authorizes $450 million for the CRC, it will … leave Oregon holding the bag for a great deal more cost responsibility."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/20/bob-stacey/will-washington-leave-oregon-holding-bag-columbia-/	Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are expected to vote this year on local funding for the Columbia River Crossing, raising the stakes of the political wrangling around the replacement of the Interstate 5 bridge. Inthe early planning stages of the CRC, officials in Oregon and Washington agreed to split the cost of the bridge, which could be as much as $3.5 billion. Oregon’s Gov. John Kitzhaber included $450 million in state funding for the bridge in his proposed 2013-15 budget. (The rest of the money is supposed to come from Washington, the federal government and tolls on the bridge.) Metro Councilor Bob Stacey says Oregon could wind up paying more, thanks to provisions of a 2012 bill passed by the Washington Legislature that approves tolling of the new Interstate 5 corridor. Amendments to that bill put a $3.412 billion funding cap on the project and barred tolling on the Interstate 205 bridge, which also crosses the Columbia River between Portland and Vancouver. In a memo to the Metro Council, Stacey said that the Oregon Legislature needs to fight back with provisions of its own -- making light rail a priority and limiting Oregon’s spending on the project to $450 million. "If Oregon’s Legislature simply authorizes $450 million for the CRC, it will be implicitly accepting Washington’s limitations, which will leave Oregon holding the bag for a great deal more cost responsibility — or with a great deal less from the CRC project for our communities." Mega-projects like interstate bridges are complicated, but we were surprised to hear that something Washington did could leave Oregon "holding the bag." We thought we’d check. First, let’s look at tolling. Federal law generally prohibits tolling on an interstate bridge unless the money is used to pay for the bridge. That makes the Washington Legislature’s prohibition of tolling on the I-205 bridge meaningless because neither state could do it without a federal waiver. With no tolls on I-205, Stacey could be right in saying that drivers would avoid the I-5 bridge and go to I-205. It is also possible, as he says, that tolls from the new bridge could be less than projected. That would create a shortfall in paying for the bridge. If that happens, who is holding the bag? To answer that, let’s go back to the original interstate agreement to build the bridge. In 2006, Oregon and Washington representatives signed an intergovernmental agreement stating that both state transportation departments are "to jointly be responsible for the cost of the Columbia River Crossing Project." Sounded like an even split to us, but to be sure,we checked with officials in both Oregon and Washington. Pat Egan, chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, says jointly means equally. "That’s the declared working agreement," Egan said. Egan said he’s confident the final price tag for the bridge will be closer to $3 billion than $3.5 billion. But even if the bridge exceeds the cap, he said, it will be up to both legislative bodies to approve more funding. North of the river, we talked to Sen. Ann Rivers, the La Center Republican who wrote the Washington project cap amendment. She wants to control the costs but doesn’t see Washington doing that unilaterally. "I think we can count on overruns and I expect them to be split evenly," she said. But what about that cap that Washington passed? History shows it may be better to think of the cap as a goal. Legislative bodies pass capital plans, including caps. Sometimes costs go up. Lawmakers don’t like it, but they usually approve more money. The city of Portland approved additional funds for the Portland Aerial Tram when it went over budget, for instance, and the Oregon Transportation Commission did the same this year for the rebuilding of U.S. 20. In the end, Stacey’s right that if legislators greenlight the CRC, the state could ultimately owe more than $450 million on its share of the bridge. But setting a cap on the project or limiting Oregon’s share with legislative riders won’t stop that. And thanks to the agreement between Oregon and Washington to pay for the bridge jointly, if Oregon ever needs to pay more, Washington would need to join in. PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t do prophecy. We can’t say whether the bridge will be over budget -- as much as history might tempt us to offer a guess. What we can say is that the Washington toll rule won’t matter. The Washington Legislature’s cap won’t matter. Bottom line? The intergovernmental agreement covers the responsibility. Both states are left holding the bag. Stacey’s statement is inaccurate. We rule it False.	None	Bob Stacey	None	None	None	2013-02-20T03:00:00	2012-11-26	['Oregon']
pomt-01634	Says President Barack Obama released a statement on the "death of brother Robin Williams before ... a statement on brother Michael Brown."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/26/cornel-west/cornel-west-obama-reacted-quicker-robin-williams-d/	President Barack Obama is being criticized on the left and right for his response to the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer. Conservatives have accused Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of siding with protesters before the facts of the shooting have been established. Some liberals say Obama has been too silent on the case. In an Aug. 25 interview with Salon, ultra-liberal African-American professor Cornel West blasted Obama for posing as a progressive while actually being a "counterfeit" centrist. Obama’s need to find the middle ground, West argued, is apparent in his recent handling of the Ferguson protests. "The Obama administration has been silent. Completely silent," West said. "All of a sudden now, you get this uprising and what is the response? Well, as we know, you send out a statement on the death of brother Robin Williams before you sent out a statement on brother Michael Brown." We wondered if Obama commented on Williams’ death before he addressed Brown’s. A tale of two statements It's important to note that the two deaths are hardly similar. Williams was a worldwide celebrity and news of his death quickly spread. His death did not spark protests or involve questions of police misconduct. Statements from political leaders and the White House when celebrities die are often fast and received without controversy. Brown, meanwhile, was mostly an unknown figure to the world when he was killed Aug. 9, and it took time for the story of his death to spread. The New York Times, for instance did not put a story about Brown or the city of Ferguson on its front page until Aug. 12. But as comparisons go, West has his facts correct. Obama issued a statement hours after Williams’ death was announced by police officials on Aug. 11. In his statement, Obama praised the late actor as "one of a kind" and offered his condolences to Williams’ loved ones and well-wishers. "He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit," Obama wrote. "He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets." Brown was shot at noon Central Time on Aug. 9, and news broke of the police-involved shooting that afternoon. Obama, who was on vacation in Martha’s Vineyard at the time, did not release a statement until Aug. 12, three days after Brown’s death. That’s also one day after his statement about Williams. Obama said that Brown’s passing was "heartbreaking" and offered his and Michelle’s condolences to Brown’s family and community. "I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding," Obama wrote. "We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve." In his statement, Obama alluded to an earlier statement made by Holder. Holder’s statement, which did not mention Brown by name and largely discussed the role of federal investigations, was released on Aug. 11 -- two days after Brown’s death. Seen but can’t be heard An Aug. 22, a New York Times/CBS poll reported that 60 percent of African-Americans were satisfied with Obama’s response, compared to 35 percent of whites. But Obama’s words and actions around Brown have been targeted by conservatives, liberals and netizens alike. A day after Brown’s shooting, an online petition was launched, calling for Obama to issue a statement on the deaths of Brown and two other black men, and to demand congressional action. On Aug. 11, Twitter users began pointing out the disparity between his quickness to comment on Williams’ passing and his silence on Brown’s death, reported the International Business Times. Obama made additional comments about Ferguson on Aug. 14, describing Brown’s death again as "tragic and heartbreaking." Following the statement, conservative columnists accused him of being racist against whites. Meanwhile, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the labor union for law enforcement officials across the nation, said to the Hill that Obama was being unhelpful by "discussing police tactics from Martha’s Vineyard." When Obama discussed the subject again on Aug. 18, speaking only of the reaction and investigation, his comments were blasted as "tone deaf and disappointing" by an MSNBC analyst and drew derisive complaints from Twitter users who wanted to see a more emotive, assertive stance. And Obama’s recent decision to send a delegation of White House officials to Brown’s Aug. 25 funeral sparked additional ire from the right. All this has proved that Obama is too polarizing a figure to talk freely and talk effectively about matters of race, wrote Vox’s Ezra Klein. According to Fox News’ Howard Kurtz, Obama’s past comments and actions on Trayvon Martin and other racially tinged cases over the years had been equally divisive, and so Obama has learned to keep mum. Our ruling West said that Obama released "a statement on the death of brother Robin Williams before (he) sent out a statement on brother Michael Brown." While the two cases are hardly similar, West is right on the facts. It took Obama three days to issue a statement regarding Brown’s Aug. 9 death and about three hours to comment on Williams’ passing, which was reported on Aug. 11. We rate West’s claim True.

pomt-04956	Says David Dewhurst "explicitly advocated" a guest worker program for all illegal immigrants.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/26/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhurst-advocated-guest-worke/	In a televised debate July 23, 2012, the Texas GOP candidates for U.S. Senate sought to bolster their conservative credentials before the July 31 primary runoff election. "Amnesty" is a dirty word in this context, and Ted Cruz tacked his opponent’s name right onto it. "The Dewhurst amnesty," Cruz claimed, "would take every single illegal alien in the United States and give them a guest worker permit." His source for that, he said, was a 2007 speech by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst "where he explicitly advocated a guest worker program for every single illegal alien in the United States today" -- more than 11 million people, by the Pew Hispanic Center’s 2010 estimate, though of course not all would be adults qualified for a guest-worker program. Is that what Dewhurst said? Lauren Thurston, a spokeswoman in Dewhurst’s state office, emailed us a copy of the February 17, 2007, speech given when Dewhurst was named "Mr. South Texas," an annual honor bestowed by a Laredo civic group. The speech’s reference to guest workers is this: "I support secure borders both north and south and I support a guest worker program for those here today illegally. Labor and skilled workers are critical to our Texas economy." Thurston didn’t address our request for more information about the program Dewhurst said he supported. Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch told us by email that Dewhurst was not referring to any specific program and has consistently opposed "any amnesty." Dewhurst faced questions about his 2007 speech in a July 24, 2012, interview by Andrea Watkins of Houston’s KRIV-TV, which aired the debate; his campaign posted video of the interview online. Excerpts: Andrea Watkins: Did you support a guest worker program in that speech? David Dewhurst: In the speech, then and now is my same position. There’s no room for any discussion on doing anything until we secure the border. ... Once the border is secure, would you still support a guest worker program, as you were saying in that speech? I would want to look at all of our options and see what is available. … What I was really focused on is that we need a sensible legal immigration policy. That’s what I’m after. Mr. Cruz thinks, though, that a guest worker program that you were supporting is even more broad than the amnesty … the new policy that president Obama has adopted … President Obama would allow about eight hundred thousand people in the United States to stay, and your guest worker program would be for everyone who is in the United States illegally. First of all, it’s not my guest worker program. I wasn’t recommending any specific changes to our immigration policy, just that once we secure our borders -- and the federal government has not done a good job -- then Congress, I believe, needs to take up the issue and look at … how we try and identify those people that are here, that are national security risks to the United States. … Again, I’ve always been categorically opposed to amnesty, which is a pathway to citizenship for those who live here right now. PolitiFact researchers often explore different uses of the word "amnesty" in connection with illegal immigrants, recently reaching a definition similar to Dewhurst’s "pathway to citizenship" in a June 20, 2012, fact-check. Generally, amnesty consists of giving a group of lawbreakers a permanent guarantee that they won’t be punished for their offense. In immigration debates, we wrote, it is most accurate when applied to policies that give illegal immigrants a way to achieve permanent legal status. So: A pathway, without punishment. Permanently. We searched the Nexis newspaper archive for instances of Dewhurst otherwise declaring his views on guest worker programs and found one mention. An April 25, 2007, Houston Chronicle news story says Dewhurst told the paper in an interview that he "has long urged Congress to enact a guest worker program for immigrants." The story does not quote Dewhurst in any way about securing the border. We did find, though, stories and opinion pieces mentioning prominent Texas Republicans’ support in 2006 and 2007 for immigration reforms urged by President George W. Bush that included a guest-worker program. Congress failed to reach agreement on such a plan in September 2006. A McClatchy News Service news story June 2, 2007, said that different forms of the guest worker program had specified a maximum number of participants that ranged from 200,000 to 600,000 per year. We also note that in May 2012, Dewhurst accused Cruz of supporting amnesty. Dewhurst got a Pants on Fire rating from us June 1, 2012, for his radio ad claiming his opponent helped steer two groups that led the national push for amnesty. Cruz was on the board of one group Dewhurst named -- the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute -- and that group wasn’t even close to leading the drive for comprehensive immigration reform (possibly to include a limited path to legal residency). Our ruling Dewhurst’s 2007 speech advocates a guest-worker program for "those here today illegally," a view he seems to have aired again in an interview a couple months later and one that he also has not forsworn, far as we can tell. So, it can fairly be said Dewhurst advocated a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants already here. Would every single illegal immigrant be in the program, as Cruz says? As a practical matter, probably not, but Dewhurst’s speech laid out no limits. His speech did, however, cite the need for border security, and of late, Dewhurst has said secure borders should be ensured before a guest-worker program is implemented. This significant clarification isn’t acknowledged in Cruz’s claim, which we rate Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2012-07-26T11:04:14	2012-07-23	['None']

pomt-01452	Says female genital mutilation is "a central African problem," not an Islamic problem, as Bill Maher suggested.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/02/reza-aslan/fact-checking-reza-aslans-retort-bill-maher/	Comedian and HBO host Bill Maher is outspoken about his atheism, a fact not lost on many viewers of his recent rant about the passive approach of some liberals toward human rights abuses in Muslim countries. Yet a scholar of religion called his commentary "not very sophisticated" on national TV. Why? Maher was condemning the collective uproar over racist, homophobic or distasteful comments by American celebrities Donald Sterling, Jonah Hill, Rush Limbaugh and Mel Gibson when more serious offenses against women in Muslim countries are usually overlooked. "Not only does the Muslim world have something in common with ISIS, it has too much in common with ISIS," Maher said at one point. As an example, Maher brought up female genital mutilation, which refers to procedures that remove, in part or in whole, external genitalia for a non-medical reason. International groups such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF and Human Rights Watch condemn the practice as a flagrant example of gender inequality -- one that carries risks of prolonged bleeding, infection, infertility and complications during birth. When performed, the procedure is usually done on young girls. Maher said 91 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of Somali women have been cut that way. CNN Tonight hosts Don Lemon and Alisyn Camerota picked up this thread the following day in an interview with Reza Aslan, an author and University of California-Riverside professor of religious studies. Aslan criticized Maher for making "facile arguments" when he generalized about Muslims and mislabeled female genital mutilation an Islamic problem. "It's a central African problem," Aslan said. "Eritrea has almost 90 percent female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. Ethiopia has 75 percent female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. Nowhere else in the Muslim, Muslim-majority states is female genital mutilation an issue." Aslan later tweeted an infographic showing a swath of African countries where female genital mutilation is concentrated. Is Aslan’s point accurate? The map, taken from a July 2013 UNICEF report, shows the percentage of girls and women ages 15-49 who have undergone female genital mutilation in 27 Central African countries and two Middle Eastern countries (Iraq and Yemen). Seven of the top eight countries with very high rates of female circumcision are majority Muslim, including the "almost universal" levels in Somalia, Egypt, Guinea and Djibouti. But Eritrea, as Aslan said, is No. 5 among countries with high prevalence at 89 percent, and it is home to more Christians than Muslims, according to Pew Research’s Religion and Public Life Project. Ethiopia, which is 63 percent Christian and 34 percent Muslim, has a moderately high rate of 74 percent, making it No. 11 on the list. So the countries in which female genital cutting is a practice are mostly Muslim, but they are not exclusively Muslim. Of the 29 countries tracked by UNICEF, 14 are home to more Christians than Muslims. The two Middle Eastern, and predominantly Muslim, countries, Yemen and Iraq, have much lower rates of 23 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Other majority-Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not listed. "It is extremely clear that in many countries that have a very high population of Muslims, female genital mutilation/cutting is not practiced," said Francesca Moneti, the UNICEF senior child protection specialist who co-authored the report. Experts say the practice stems from social pressure to conform to traditions passed down for centuries -- one that predates not just Islam but also Judaism and Christianity. (The origins of the practice are subject to some dispute, but some scholars say it may correspond to areas of ancient civilizations, in which the cutting of females "signalled controlled fidelity and the certainty of paternity," the UNICEF report states.) In areas of high prevalence today, "this is perceived to be the normal and correct way of bringing up a girl," Moneti said. "If a girl is not cut, she may be considered impure and not marriageable, and she and her entire family may be ostracized." While it stems from neither Christianity nor Islam, some women in Chad, Guinea and Mauritania report a "religious requirement" as a benefit of cutting. Some communities consider a clitoridectomy -- one type of female genital mutilation -- as "sunna," which is Arabic for "tradition" or "duty," according to the UNICEF report. However, it is not a requirement of the Koran and has been specifically rejected by some Muslim leaders in Egypt. "There are different positions within Islam on the issue," said Marit Tolo Østebø, a University of Florida lecturer on human rights and culture, global sexuality, and anthropology of religion. "So you would have some Islamic scholars who will say, and might use parts from the hadith, to support that it’s good to do some cutting, but they will often emphasize that it is not an obligation." (The hadith refers to commentary about the Koran that explains the traditions of the Prophet Mohammad.) The fact that it is also practiced by Christians and other groups with ancient beliefs makes it hard to say the practice is particularly Muslim, she said. "Very often we tend to think that Islam is one thing -- that it’s one homogeneous religion," she said. "But if we just look at Christianity, there are so many different traditions and views on things. That is exactly the same in Islam." Aslan acknowledges that some may object to his "central African" characterization. He said he was trying to refer to the "stripe" of countries across Africa along the equator where this practice is common. However, UNICEF and international groups consider it a "global" problem since it happens in parts of Asia, Europe and North America because of immigration. "All of this is to say that while it is almost impossible to come up with some sort of connection that binds countries that have (a female genital mutilation) problem, it is clear that whatever that connection is, it’s not religious," Aslan told PunditFact. Our ruling Aslan rejected Maher’s characterization of female genital mutilation as an Islamic problem, saying instead that it’s actually "a central African problem." Due to immigration, the term "central African" may be too restrictive, but his larger point -- that this is not a problem in only Muslim countries -- is valid. Countries with majority-Christian populations also carry out this practice, while Islamic-majority countries like Iraq and Yemen have rates on the lower side. We rate Aslan’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-14752	"We're practically not allowed to use coal any more. What do we do with our coal? We ship it to China and they spew it in the air."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-how-much-coal-us-has-been/	Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough broke from questions about Muslims and immigration recently to ask Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump about another issue: what he would do about climate change. Trump initially responded by saying he wanted clean air and water. When Richard Haass, Council on Foreign Relations president and a panelist on the show, noted those are environmental concerns not directly related to climate change, Trump went on to tout the "many" environmental awards his company had won for building projects. After more prodding, Trump said,"Remember this. We're practically not allowed to use coal any more. What do we do with our coal? We ship it to China and they spew it in the air." A reader asked us to check whether this was accurate, so we took a closer look at Trump's full statement. Trump’s campaign did not reply to an inquiry for this article. "We're practically not allowed to use coal any more." There’s a grain of truth here, but it’s buried under significant exaggeration. In August 2015, as we’ve noted, the Obama administration announced Clean Power Plan regulations that would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. Advocates say the reduction would help ease global warming along with cutting emissions that create soot and smog. But the regulatory effort has alarmed the coal industry and its allies in Congress. "This administration’s regulatory assault on coal has had the intention — and increasingly the practical effect — of taking coal out of the market," said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association. (The plan continues to be challenged in court.) Several factors — tighter government regulations, yes, but also lower natural gas prices, and changing consumer and industry preferences — have combined to reduce the amount of coal used for electricity generation by about one-sixth since 2008. But contrary to what Trump asserted, Popovich said, "coal is not going away." The U.S. electric power sector consumed 858.3 million tons of coal in 2013, the most recent full year for which Energy Information Administration data is available. It was a little over 1 billion tons in 2008, the last year before the most recent recession. Despite the decline, coal remains the single-most common source for electricity generation in the United States. In 2014, coal accounted for 39 percent of electricity generation, followed by natural gas at 27 percent, nuclear at 19 percent, hydropower at 6 percent, and other renewable sources at 7 percent. In its most recent future projection, the Energy Information Administration predicted that coal would maintain its top spot for electricity generation. Under the most basic economic parameters, coal would decline in future years due in large part to the retirement of aging coal-fired plants but would still account for 34 percent of energy generation in 2040. The enactment of policies that put coal at a disadvantage could drop that percentage further by 2040. Beyond electricity generation, 43.3 million tons of coal were used for other industrial purposes in the United States in 2013, and 2 million tons were allocated to commercial and institutional uses. In other words, coal usage may be slipping, but it’s still in wide use around the country and will continue to be a major source of energy for the next quarter century. "We ship (coal) to China and they spew it in the air." China is a major world user of coal, and scientists say its emissions are a major factor in climate change. But very little of the coal produced in the United States goes to China, so any change in United States trade policy would have little effect on China’s coal usage. According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. exported 1.8 million tons of coal to China in 2014. That’s less than 2 percent of all U.S. coal exports for that year, which totaled 97.3 million tons to all countries combined. By comparison, the United Kingdom imports more than five times as much U.S. coal as China does. Germany imports more than twice as much U.S. coal as China does, and the Netherlands imports about seven times as much. U.S. coal exports don’t account for much of what China uses, either. While U.S. coal has been gaining market share in Asia in recent years, the Energy Information Administration reported, it comprised less than 4 percent of Asia's coal imports in 2012, and less than 1 percent of total coal consumed by the four biggest Asian importers, which are China, Japan, India and South Korea. And since that figure is for all four countries combined, China’s share is just a fraction of that. The major foreign coal suppliers to China include Australia and Indonesia, Popovich said. The United States’ exports to China are "very small," he said. Our ruling Trump said, "We're practically not allowed to use coal any more. What do we do with our coal? We ship it to China and they spew it in the air." He has a point that the Obama administration has worked to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from U.S. sources, including placing additional burdens on power plants that burn coal. But Trump’s language vastly overstates his case. Despite recent declines in coal usage, electric companies in the United States still burned more than 850 million tons of coal in 2014, making it easily the most common energy source for electricity generation. Trump’s point about the U.S. shipping coal to China is even less accurate. U.S. coal exports to China comprise only a tiny fraction of all U.S. coal exports, and U.S. coal accounts for just a tiny fraction of all of the coal that China imports. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14143	"There's only three countries in the entire world where there's no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/may/03/alan-grayson/grayson-right-about-lack-paid-vacation-us-misses-d/	American workers aren’t getting the compensation they deserve, in either time or money, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson said at a recent Orlando debate. At a Senate campaign debate with U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, on April 25, 2016, Grayson said he supported a higher minimum wage. Providing more pay won’t hurt the businesses, he said, because other nations have higher wages with no ill effects. Furthermore, many countries also guarantee paid time off and their economies are fine, Grayson said. But not the United States. "There's only three countries in the entire world where there's no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them. The other two are in Africa," he said. That stat stopped us cold, and not just because we’re overdue for a long weekend off. Could Grayson be right that the United States is one of the only countries in the entire world that doesn’t grant a legal right to paid time off? Well, not exactly; Grayson’s campaign admitted he had misspoken. But available research shows he’s not far off the mark by suggesting that America is unique by not guaranteeing vacation time. Zero guarantee Grayson campaign spokesman David Damron told us via email that the Orlando Democrat meant to say only a handful of island nations in the Pacific Ocean joined the United States in not guaranteeing paid time off — not two countries in Africa. Those five countries, according to Wikipedia, were Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau and Nauru, he said. "The congressman accidentally conflated guaranteed paid vacation and paid sick time in his recollection of which countries fell into this category of weak worker protections with the United States, which was the basis for his reference to Africa (rather than the Pacific)," Damron wrote. We don’t take Wikipedia’s word as gospel, of course, but we could not get experts to speak to specific conditions in those five countries. Together, they have a population of around 300,000 — or about the population of Pittsburgh. The biggest repository of trusted data we found came from UCLA’s World Policy Analysis Center. Their database showed 13 countries, including the United States, with no guaranteed paid annual leave. Their list did include Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Nauru, but also larger countries like Pakistan and India. Now, sometimes leave varies by how long a worker is at a job or some other classification. The World Policy Analysis Center’s database notes they "report the lowest amount of leave guaranteed to a worker with at least one year of tenure." The World Bank has its own detailed numbers for vacation available to workers based on tenure. The bank measured paid annual leave for 189 economies, including splitting some countries into large metro areas. The United States, for example, is split into New York and Los Angeles. The bank’s table did list five Pacific island nations that did not guarantee paid leave time for any workers with one or more years of service: The Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Palau and Tonga. It didn’t have data for Nauru, where unemployment among its 10,000 or so residents hovered around 90 percent in 2004. If it sounds to you like those aren’t the kind of countries normally associated with a global economic powerhouse like the United States, you’d be right. Most studies on this issue stuck to smaller sets of much more comparable nations. These usually involved grouping countries with words like "developed" or "rich." For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries, notes that in 2014 the United States was its only member country with no statutory minimum of paid days off. A 2011 Business Insider roundup using data from global human resources firm Mercer said 39 developed countries offered more vacation time than the United States. Mercer’s Worldwide Benefit and Employment Guidelines, last updated in 2015, tracks 74 countries across the planet (the Pacific island nations Damron cited are absent). It notes the United States ranks the lowest among the surveyed countries with no "statutory holiday entitlement." Often cited in media reports is the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s 2013 study, No-Vacation Nation Revisited. That paper compared paid vacation and paid holidays in 21 countries with advanced economies: 16 in Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. France led the pack with 30 paid vacation days. While the French get one paid holiday, Austrians get 13, plus 25 vacation days. The United Kingdom offers 28 vacation days. But almost every country in the CEPR study had more than 20 paid vacation days, except Canada and Japan, which only awarded 10. America came in dead last in guaranteed time off, with a grand total of zero days. Many employers do offer paid vacation and holidays, but there’s no law that says they must. And businesses do take advantage of the fact. "In the absence of a legal requirement for paid vacation and paid holidays, about one fourth of the U.S. workforce has no paid vacation or paid holidays in the course of their work year," the CEPR report read. "The sum of the average paid vacation and paid holidays ― 16 in total ― offered in the private sector in the United States would not meet even the minimum required by law in 19 other rich countries analyzed here." Our ruling Grayson said, "There's only three countries in the entire world where there's no paid vacation by law, we happen to be one of them." Grayson’s claim, taken literally, is incorrect. A Grayson spokesman said the congressman had fumbled his talking point a bit, especially the part about a pair of African nations being the other two. But the point he was trying to make to viewers and voters largely holds up. The United States is certainly one of just a few countries that does not guarantee paid vacation as a right, and an outlier among developed nations. In that sense, Grayson’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2016-05-03T14:03:28	2016-04-25	['None']
pomt-06041	Mitt Romney’s and Bain Capital’s profits from KB Toys, which later went out of business, were "described by the Boston Herald as ‘disgusting.’"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/king-bain-video-says-boston-herald-called-bain-pro/	This is a classic case of attributing a quote to a newspaper that the paper never said. The 28-minute video "When Mitt Romney Came to Town" -- an attack on the Republican presidential candidate’s experiences with the private equity firm Bain Capital -- seeks to paint Romney as a "predatory corporate raider" who "looked for businesses he could pick apart." The video, produced by the pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC Winning Our Future, highlighted four examples, including toy store chain KB Toys, from the more than 100 companies that Bain backed over the years Romney led the private equity firm. About eight minutes into the "documentary," you can hear puppets singing an old jingle ("Hot we got at KB Toys!") along with this narration: "Romney and Bain bought the 80-year-old company in 2000, loaded KB Toys with millions in debt, then used the money to repurchase Bain stock. The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed." That the chain failed isn't in dispute: KB Toys dissolved in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. We’re checking the video’s overall portrayal of the Bain-KB relationship in another item. Here, we’ll check one specific claim made in the video: "Mitt Romney and Bain saw a 900 percent return on their investment" in KB Toys, the video says. "Romney and Bain’s profits at the expense of 15,000 jobs was described by the Boston Herald as ‘disgusting.’" In addition, the on-screen visual emphasizes the point, showing the text, "‘disgusting profits,’ Boston Herald, 11/17/2009." That suggests the comment came from a Herald editorial or columnist. So we looked back at the article the video referenced -- a news story headlined, "KB Toys worker blasts Bain for execs' payout." The story is about the campaign of Stephen Pagliuca for the Democratic nomination to fill the U.S. Senate seat made vacant upon the death of Edward Kennedy. Pagliuca is managing director of Bain Capital as well as co-owner of the Boston Celtics. The story quotes a former KB Toys employee attacking Bain for its role in KB Toys’ demise, which the story says resulted in 450 job losses in the Boston area. Here’s an excerpt: "‘They were supposed to be coming in to create jobs and help the company grow when they took us over. What happened?'’ asked Mark W. Dean, a 45-year-old Pittsfield resident who has been out of a job since KB Toys went out of business earlier this year. "It's just another political promise.' "Pagliuca spokesman Will Keyser said the Celtics co-owner wasn't directly involved in managing the KB Toys takeover, although he did profit from the deal. "‘He has acknowledged over the course of the campaign that businesses he or his company invested in have failed, but the record of successes he's been involved in far outnumber the failures,’'' said Keyser in a statement. ... "Dean, who worked at KB Toys for 22 years, is still outraged by the $121 million payout to execs and investors. "‘That was disgusting. There were a lot of employees who were upset about that,’' Dean said." So what we have is a Boston Herald news story quoting an angry former employee -- not an impartial newspaper expressing outrage in its own voice, which is what the voice-over suggests. Nowhere does the ad note that the sentiments were actually expressed by a worker laid off by the company. Our ruling The story referenced by the video does contain the "disgusting" quote. But in both in the voice-over and the video, the "King of Bain" video suggests that the comment was spoken in the editorial voice of the Boston Herald. It wasn't -- it came from a laidoff worker.

pomt-13715	"We have the most productive workers in the world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/joe-biden/biden-almost-right-us-workers-most-productive/	On the third night of the Democratic convention, Vice President Joe Biden took vigorous exception to the Republican message of a nation teetering on the brink. "Not only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world," Biden said. "We have the most productive workers in the world. And given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never ever ever let their country down." Does American have the most productive workers? Not quite. We checked the numbers and found that we rank third, not first. Productivity is a measure of how much value comes out of each hour worked. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development tracks the performance of the world’s higher income nations. When the OECD compares the GDP per hour worked across 47 countries (using dollars corrected for inflation and the purchasing power in each nation), it consistently reports that Luxembourg and Norway have more productive workers than the United States. This table shows the top six countries since 2010. 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Luxembourg 78.4 78.2 76 78.4 79.3 81.2 Norway 77.8 77.2 77.8 78.3 78.9 79.7 United States 61.9 62.1 62.2 62.2 62.4 .. Belgium 61.8 61.6 61.4 61.7 62.2 .. Ireland 58.2 60.7 61 60.2 62 .. Netherlands 59.6 60.1 59.9 60.1 60.6 61.3 For 2014, the most recent year for which we have complete data, America ranks third, as it has since 2010. For each hour worked in Luxembourg, that country gains $79.30. In Norway, the amount is $78.90. In the United States, the value is $62.40. We reached out to Biden’s press office and were told that when he’s made this comparison before, he has referred to other larger economies, which means the United States ranks first. He left out that qualification this time. Our ruling Biden said that America has the most productive workers in the world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development tracks how much value comes out of each hour worked in the world’s higher income nations. According to its data, Luxembourg and Norway have more productive workers than America. That ranking has been in place since 2010. Third is not first. But to place in the top three out of the world’s 47 most wealthy nations is still an achievement. Biden is wrong on the details, but the general point is correct.

pomt-11620	Mexico is "now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/24/donald-trump/mexico-isnt-deadliest-country-world-trump-said/	Defending the wall at the heart of a government shutdown, President Donald Trump pitched a fishy claim about Mexico’s security levels. "We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country," Trump tweeted on Jan. 18, 2018. "We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Drug trade and policy experts generally agree a border wall likely would not have the impact Trump envisions, we found in a previous report. This time around, we decided to take a look at Mexican security. Was Mexico just rated the most dangerous country in the world? While there are multiple ways to measure danger, there is no single ranking for the most dangerous country in the world. The White House did not repond to our inquiry on the record. Mexico does rank first or third for the number of journalists killed for doing their jobs. However, it is out-ranked by other countries in other lists, such as countries’ homicides per capita. Deadly for journalists The only way Mexico falls first is if we only consider the International Press Institute’s number of journalists who were killed in 2017. The global journalism network tallied at least 14 journalists killed in Mexico in its December 2017 report. The Committee to Protect Journalists confirmed six cases of murder in retaliation for the journalists’ work, placing Mexico third for killings worldwide and first after conflict zones. The number of journalists killed in Mexico with confirmed motives reached a historical high in 2017, the committee found. Not so much for the broader public Outside of journalism, Mexico scores high on danger levels, but not first. The Institute for Economics and Peace produces an annual Global Peace Index report, which measures the world’s most peaceful countries using 23 qualitative and quantitative measures of safety, security, ongoing domestic and international conflict, and militarization. Read inversely, the countries at the bottom of this list could be considered the "least peaceful." Mexico was ranked 22nd from the bottom of that list. Syria was worst. Frank Zimring, a crime expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said the two most useful measures of danger are the homicide rate of a country and the rate of some index of reported crime. Comparing crime across countries is difficult and discouraged due to disparities in legal definitions, incident reporting and data collection. The main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations’ Office of Drug Control. The figures don’t include war-related killings and deaths from internal conflicts, which are generally far higher than intentional homicides. Mexico was 10th on the list in 2015, and El Salvador was first. There were 16 intentional homicides for every 100,000 people in Mexico, whereas El Salvador had 109 per 100,000 population. (The United States, by the way, was 54th.) "While Mexico has a significant problem of violence, it is manifestly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world," Mexico’s foreign ministry retaliated in a press release about Trump’s tweet. "According to UN figures for 2014 (the most recent international report), Mexico is far from being one of the most violent countries. In Latin America alone, other countries have homicide rates higher than Mexico's (16.4), which is far below several countries in the region." The most recent year, however, did see Mexico’s highest homicide count since the government began counting in 1997: 29,168 homicide cases in 2017, Mexico’s interior ministry told the Associated Press. That places it slightly above the regional average, according to Eric Olson, the deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Latin American program. "To maintain that Mexico is the most violent country in the world would be a very subjective claim, and to say it’s the most homicidal is certifiably wrong," Olson said. Trump tweeted a similar claim in June: "Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world, after only Syria." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The source of that claim was a report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies that said Mexico’s 2016 intentional homicide total, 23,000, was second only to Syria. After the statistic garnered heavy media attention, a press release revealed a "methodological flaw" in their fatalities calculation, which spokeswoman Anais Auvray said researchers are working to fix. Regardless, the report measured the gross number of homicides, which have little comparative value. For context, in 2015 the United States had half the homicide rate as Mexico, yet recorded 15,696 intentional homicides, to Mexico’s 20,762, according to the United Nations. The report also excludes other violent Latin American countries, like Brazil, which do not fit the institute’s criteria for armed conflict. "The Armed Conflict Database and Survey do not measure homicides on either an absolute or per capita basis," a June 23, 2017, news release said. "We estimate deaths directly related to conflict. We do not provide an assessment of the levels of violence in any country." Our ruling Trump tweeted that Mexico is "now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world." That is the case for journalists, according to two groups that track retaliatory murders. But it is not true for the risk to the broader public, which is not mentioned or clarified in Trump’s Twitter feed. Experts offered homicide measures as the best measure of a country’s security. By that token, Mexico ranked 10th in the United Nations’ homicides measures in 2015. Mexico’s homicide count reached a record peak last year, according to government statistics. While certainly a cause for concern, that’s doesn’t make Mexico the "number one most dangerous country." We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-04389	Frank Guinta voted to make middle class taxpayers pay over a $1,000 more a year in taxes.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/18/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-point-votes-om-ryan-budget-evidence-rep-/	Despite his claims, U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta is no friend of the working man or woman, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And his vote on this year’s House budget proves it, the Democratic group charged in an ad released on New Hampshire airwaves. "Say you're a regular person with a regular job," a narrator says in the ad, "Regular," which launched Monday on WMUR-TV in New Hampshire. "Frank Guinta voted to make you pay over a $1,000 more a year in taxes. "Frank Guinta is looking out for them, not you," the ad concludes. The Guinta campaign quickly disputed the ad, calling it "false" and "misleading," and asking WMUR to remove it from the air. The DCCC stood by its ad, pointing to an ABC News report from August to support the claim. And WMUR said it has no plans to pull the ad. The ABC News story, aired August 14, referenced a report from the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee that suggested the House Republicans’ 2013 budget proposal would raise taxes on middle class families. The Joint Committee report, prepared by the staff of the committee chairman, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), concludes the House budget proposal, headed by Republican Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan, would raise taxes by $1,358 on households with an income between $50,000-$100,000. Guinta voted March 29 in favor of Ryan’s budget proposal, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate. So the Joint Committee’s numbers match the DCCC claim. But, according to some analysts, the committee used some funny math to reach its conclusions. As noted in past PolitiFact reports, the Casey report assumes, without knowing, House Republicans would eliminate deductions on state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, among others. In the budget, Ryan, like his presidential running mate, included few specifics regarding tax deductions and other expenditures. But, keeping the budget revenue neutral, as Ryan has stressed, would require the elimination of these and other deductions, according to Joint Committee economists. "The remaining large tax expenditures … all deliver significant benefits to the middle class, and removing these tax expenditures would hit middle-income taxpayers hard," they wrote in the report. Still, to make those assumptions was too big a leap for other tax analysts. The business-backed Tax Foundation, which did not conduct its own review of the Ryan budget, had no competing figures to offer. But, foundation economists still offered a critical review of the Joint Committee report. "(The analysis) is quite speculative in that it assumes certain things about the plan that were not specified publicly," William McBride, the foundation’s chief economist, wrote in an email to PolitiFact New Hampshire. "It also assumes no economic growth." In its analysis, the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, did not assume the elimination of any deductions or expenditures. The review, published in March, concluded that middle class families, earning between $50,000-$75,000 a year, would see a $975 tax cut under Ryan’s plan, while families earning $75,000-100,000 would average a decrease of$1,692. But, unlike the Joint Committee report, the center review wasn’t intended to project the tax impacts of the budget proposal, according to Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate for the center. Rather, it looked to provide a snapshot of the spending plan as it was presented, he said. "The details matter tremendously," Rosenberg said. "Which tax expenditures you target, or which preferences you target makes all the difference. ... It’s hard to know (what the impacts will be) without that level of detail." Our ruling: Frank Guinta, who is running against Democrat Carol Shea-Porter in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, voted in favor of the House Republicans’ 2013 budget. That much is clear. But, whether the spending proposal would have increased taxes on middle class families remains in question. The study by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, which is chaired by a Democrat, suggests the budget plan would have increased taxes by $1,358 -- more than the $1,000 referenced in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad. But, it assumes the budget would eliminate a host of deductions and expenditures -- assumptions that are too big a stretch for other tax analysts. Had it passed, the House budget may have increased middle class taxes as the ad suggests. But, given the lack of specifics, there isn’t enough evidence to know for sure, as the DCCC claims to do. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2012-10-18T16:11:45	2012-10-15	['Frank_Guinta']
pomt-14900	Texas legislation "would allow… teachers to kill their students if they felt it was needed."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/nov/06/greenville-gazette/website-says-texas-legislation-allows-teachers-kil/	A reader asked us to look into an article headlined: "This new bill would allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was needed." Good thing Texas lawmakers are no longer in session, eh? The article, posted in February 2015 on a website called the Greenville Gazette, said the Teacher’s Protection Act "would allow teachers to use deadly force on school property, a school bus, or at an event sponsored by a school either in self-defense or defense of students at the school." Use of force in the classroom has made headlines. On Oct. 28, 2015, most recently, a school resource officer in South Carolina was fired after a video surfaced of him throwing a female high school student on the ground. So, was there a proposed act permitting Texas teachers to kill their students if necessary? The Teacher’s Protection Act No one at the Gazette responded to us. But a web search led us to a proposed Teacher’s Protection Act. State Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Van, filed House Bill 868 on Jan. 22, 2015 but it didn’t advance into law or draw a hearing; the last action shown in legislative records was its referral to the House Public Education Committee on March 4, 2015. The bill says: "An educator is justified in using force or deadly force on school property, on a school bus, or at a school-sponsored event in defense of the educator’s person or in defense of students of the school that employs the educator if (he or she) reasonably believes" themselves to be "justified under" sections 9.31, 9.32, 9.33 and 9.43 of the Texas Penal Code. Those sections establish that a person can use force or deadly force against another in self defense or in defense of property if the person "reasonably believes" it to be "immediately necessary." Under the legislation, a teacher would be shielded from from criminal and civil charges "for injury or death that results from the educator’s use of force or deadly force." While the measure didn’t specify a teacher could kill a student, we asked Flynn if it left that option open. By phone, Flynn said that was not his intent. "That’s a ridiculous statement," he said. "It totally mischaracterizes the bill." Flynn said the proposal’s purpose was to protect any teacher from facing criminal or civil charges for defending himself or herself against a student assault. "You hear all the time," Flynn said, "that teachers are getting broken noses, being slapped, being pushed around, being taken to the floor by overzealous students who know that they can do it without fear of reprisal." He did not provide specific examples. Asked about the legislation permitting a teacher to use "deadly force," Flynn said he used the same language that otherwise broadly appears in existing law, perhaps referring to the penal code provisions permitting a person to use force or deadly force against another in self defense or in defense of property if the person "reasonably believes" it to be "immediately necessary." Call in the lawyers Next, we asked lawyers by phone to appraise the proposal: Would it allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was necessary? All four said Flynn’s proposal would allow a teacher to kill a student, but only if the action was justified under the existing penal code conditions—a limit stressed by Shannon Edmonds of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association and Sam Bassett, president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. Edmonds and Bassett also said teachers may currently use deadly force in keeping with the penal code, though attorney Paul Tapp of the Association of Texas Professional Educators suggested Texas teachers cannot yet typically use deadly force. Tapp pointed us to section 9.62 of Texas Penal Code, which says teachers can use "force, but not deadly force" to "maintain discipline in a group." After surveying the lawyers, we followed up with Flynn, who maintained that his proposal was not redundant and that teachers are currently not protected from prosecution. He cited "bad press and a lack of understanding about what we’re trying to accomplish" as reasons for the bill not advancing and he said he plans to offer a version of the measure afresh in the 2017 legislative session. Our ruling The website declared: "This new bill would allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was needed." This statement is partially accurate in that a bill was introduced in 2015 to give teachers greater legal protection if deadly force were employed against a student. But saying that it would "allow Texas teachers to kill their students if they felt it was needed" is a stretch that suggests that the bill would allow teachers to just start firing away.

pomt-10515	"The board of a nonprofit organization on which Obama served as a paid director ... granted funding to a controversial Arab group."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/14/tennessee-republican-party/group-not-controversial/	A news release from the Tennessee Republican Party titled "Anti-Semites for Obama" seeks to cast doubt on Sen. Barack Obama's public pronouncements of support for Israel, in part, by noting Obama's role with the Woods Fund, a Chicago grantmaking foundation whose goal is to "increase opportunities for disadvantaged people." The release says: "The board of a nonprofit organization on which Obama served as a paid director ... granted funding to a controversial Arab group that mourns the establishment of Israel as a 'catastrophe.' " Deborah Harrington, president of the Woods Fund, said Obama was, in fact, a director from 1994 through 2001, when the board approved a $40,000 grant to the Arab American Action Network for "community organizing." The source for the allegations can be traced to a Feb. 24, 2008, article written by Aaron Klein for WorldNetDaily, an Internet publication. The story takes issue with the founder of AAAN, Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia University professor who is "a harsh critic of Israel and has made statements supportive of Palestinian terror." The article also notes that the AAAN co-sponsored an art exhibit that featured "works related to what some Palestinians call the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe' of Israel's founding in 1948" (although the exhibit came years after Obama left the Woods Fund board). Other blogs note that in a July 2006 interview, AAAN's executive director, Hatem Abudayyeh, referred to the "Israeli government and its military killing machine." Abudayyeh has been bombarded with media calls from the likes of Time and Newsweek. In an interview with PolitiFact, he dismissed the WorldNet article and others that have parroted it as misguided attempts by "marginal right wing, anti-Muslim" Internet voices to try to discredit Obama. The AAAN has no foreign policy agenda, Abudayyeh said. It is a nonprofit "community-based organization working to improve the social, economic, and political conditions of Arab immigrants and Arab-Americans in the Chicago metropolitan area." The AAAN provides Chicago-based adult education, social services, youth development programs, domestic violence prevention and "community empowerment" through community organizing, activism and leadership development, Abudayyeh said. There are hundreds of organizations in the Chicago area that serve many different communities, he said, and "individuals within those organizations have different political viewpoints on domestic and foreign policy." But those viewpoints have no bearing on the services provided by the organization, he said. Louise Cainkar, an associate professor of sociology at Marquette University, formerly served on the AAAN board and specifically remembers the 2001 grant from the Woods Fund. "It was after the Sept. 11 attacks," said Cainkar. "Many Arab-Americans were being victimized by hate crimes. It was a hostile environment. That was an essential grant to cope with what community members were facing." Money was used to educate Arab-Americans about their civil rights, how to report hate crimes to law enforcement and to organize the community. Chicago has the country's largest Palestinian-American community, said Cainkar, who is writing a book about the Arab-American experience after 9/11. Many of them are critical of Israeli government policies, she said. "Does the organization takes sides? No," she said. "Do individuals? I'm sure they do. "AAAN is a community organization and they are careful about not getting involved in anything with foreign policy." Harrington, president of the Woods Fund, called it "pretty ridiculous" to suggest the AAAN promotes anti-Israeli ideas. The Woods Fund's goal is "to increase opportunities for less advantaged people and communities in the metropolitan area, including the opportunity to shape decisions affecting them." The foundation works with a diverse array of nonprofits "engaging people in civic life, addressing the causes of poverty and other challenges facing the region, promoting more effective public policies, reducing racism and other barriers to equal opportunity, and building a sense of community and common ground." Among those who have gotten grants in recent years: Protestants for the Common Good, the Black Ensemble Theater Group, the Japanese American Service Committee and the International Latino Cultural Center of Chicago. "It just seems like, why this one?'' Harrington said of singling out the grant to the AAAN. "It's a witch hunt." So what do we have? Seven years ago, Obama was a director of the Woods Fund when the board approved a grant to the AAAN. And some of the leaders of AAAN have made statements that could be interpreted as anti-Israel. The release implies that Obama's public pro-Israel stance should be questioned based on the opinions of leaders from the AAAN. But there's no evidence the AAAN used any of the Woods Fund money to promote an anti-Israel foreign policy agenda. In fact, the AAAN's focus is on local initiatives, and has no foreign policy. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01189	Says Barack Obama has "the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/04/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-says-barack-obama-has-wor/	Public concern about America’s debt load tends to wax and wane, but it never really goes away. Recently, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, brought up the national debt again, right around the time the broadest measure of national debt broke through the $18 trillion barrier for the first time. On Dec. 2, 2014, Priebus said that President Barack Obama has "the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt," according to an account in The Hill newspaper. He went on to call the growth in debt "immoral" and said voters had "tired of Democrats’ free-spending ways." We wondered how accurate it was for Priebus to describe Obama as having "the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt." (While the Obama administration has touted its success in helping shrink the annual federal deficit, Priebus was clearly referencing debt, not the deficit, even though the two are obviously related.) When we checked with the RNC, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said the gross federal debt -- the amount of debt held by the public plus the amount of debt held by government entities -- had risen from $10.6 trillion to about $18 trillion during Obama’s time in office, making it the largest increase in raw dollars during any presidency. Meanwhile, she added, the subset of debt that’s held by the public has more than doubled under Obama. When we looked into these numbers, they checked out. However, given the snowballing effect of inflation and debt accumulation, it’s not surprising that whoever the most recent president is -- Republican or Democrat -- would experience the biggest increases in raw dollars of debt. So we looked at two other measurements that give a better sense of context for how much the debt climbed under Obama. We used the Treasury Department’s daily database of federal debt, called Debt to the Penny, for data going back to 1993. For earlier presidencies, we used historical data from the Office of Management and Budget. We decided to use the broader measure of gross debt rather than the narrower measure of public debt -- even though both are valid measures of debt -- because for the past three presidents, data on gross debt is more consistently accessible. Meanwhile, to limit the impact of irregular presidential tenures, we looked at nine presidential periods of either four or eight years each: Eisenhower; Kennedy and Johnson combined; Nixon and Ford combined; Carter; Reagan; George H.W. Bush; Clinton; George W. Bush; and Obama. (We didn't go further back than Eisenhower because the high debt levels in the World War II era were a historical anomaly.) Debt as a share of GDP The first measure we looked at was growth in debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP. Experts say this is an important yardstick because it gives a sense of how burdensome the debt is on the economy. Smaller economies can sustain smaller debt loads; bigger ones can tolerate bigger debt loads. Using this measure, Priebus has a point. The Obama years rank first -- that is to say, worst -- among the nine presidential tenures when measured by the increase in debt as a share of GDP. At the end of fiscal year 2008, around the time Obama took office, gross federal debt accounted for 67.7 percent of GDP. The estimate for fiscal year 2014 is 103.2 percent. That’s a 35.5 percentage-point increase over six years -- far higher than any prior president we looked at, even those who served for a full eight years. (The end of fiscal 2008 was a few months before Obama took office -- a fact that has caused us headaches in the past -- but in this case, the gap is so wide that the discrepancy doesn’t make a significant difference.) So big is the gap between Obama and the other presidents, in fact, that only three of the other eight tenures we studied saw any increase at all in debt as a share of GDP. Debt as a share of GDP went up by 18 percentage points under Reagan, by 12.3 points under George W. Bush, and by 11.7 percentage points under George H.W. Bush. By contrast, every other president or combined presidential tenure saw a decline in the share of debt within GDP. Under Carter it went down by 2.6 points, under Nixon and Ford it fell by 5.9 points, under Clinton it fell by 6.8 points, under Kennedy and Johnson it was down by 13.3 points, and under Eisenhower it fell by 18.2 percentage points. Percentage increase in debt from inauguration to end of tenure However -- if you use a second measure, the numbers are more favorable toward Obama. We looked at how much the gross debt grew from day one of the presidency to the end of that presidency, then adjusted for the length of time in office. On this list, the debt under Obama grew at the third-fastest pace -- and, awkwardly for Priebus, the two presidents under whom debt grew faster were both Republicans. Reagan saw the biggest percentage increase in debt on his watch, at about 23 percent per year, followed by George H.W. Bush at about 13 percent per year and Obama at 11.5 percent per year. Those who saw slower debt growth than Obama were Carter (an increase of 11 percent a year), George W. Bush (10.8 percent a year), Nixon and Ford (8.8 percent a year), Clinton (4.6 percent per year), Kennedy and Johnson (3.3 percent per year), and Eisenhower (1.5 percent per year). So, whether Obama ranks as "the worst" at debt accumulation depends on how you measure it. Who gets the blame? Another important factor to consider: How much is Obama responsible for this increase in debt? Presidents do have an impact on the debt accrued during their tenure, but that impact is not all-encompassing. Presidents propose budgets and sign off, along with Congress, on final spending and revenue numbers. Programs they initiate cost money and, unless enough other spending is cut to produce a surplus, debt inevitably goes up. In addition, debt tends to rise particularly quickly during recessions -- and Obama came into office with a doozy of a recession under way. In the debt per GDP measure, Obama was hit coming and going, since the numerator (debt) rose even as the denominator (GDP) fell during the recession. "Certainly the Great Recession had a big impact" on debt accumulation under Obama, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The recession, he said, meant both higher spending (on programs to aid the newly jobless and financially struggling) but also a loss in tax revenue (as once-employed Americans stopped earning wages they would have to pay taxes on). In addition, the Baby Boomer generation retired in increasing numbers under Obama, meaning both higher spending and fewer tax revenues. "So it’s a mixed bag, and all presidents are a bit trapped by their time," Ellis said. "Did Reagan-Bush policies help create the surpluses experienced under Clinton? Republicans say so. Did the George W. Bush policies create the economic downturn that sent the debt soaring under Obama? Democrats say yes. Ultimately, all presidents are impacted by their predecessors’ policies and can be roiled by external forces." This suggests that Obama bears some responsibility for the rise in debt, but hardly all. Our ruling Priebus said Obama has "the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt." On Obama’s watch, debt as a share of GDP rose far faster than it did during any prior presidency. But if you look at the current amount of debt compared to where he started, the rise was not as fast as it was under Reagan and the elder Bush, two Republican predecessors. And while presidents bear some responsibility for debt accumulation, much of the equation -- economic and demographic changes and the consequences of prior president’s actions, in particular -- is out of their control. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2014-12-04T17:00:00	2014-12-02	['United_States']

pomt-12627	"Ken Starr’s plane just disappeared on his way to D.C. to testify against Hillary (Clinton)."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/31/blog-posting/fake-news-post-wrongly-says-ken-starr-died-plane-c/	A fake news story claimed that the lawyer who investigated former President Bill Clinton prior to his impeachment died in a plane crash while on his way to give testimony about former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. "Ken Starr’s plane just disappeared on his way to D.C. to testify against Hillary," read the headline on a March 24, 2017, post on ConservativeFlashNews.com. The post was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to curtail fake news. While this post appears on several other websites, ConservativeFlashNews.com indicates that they "cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information." There is no immediately apparent way to contact the site. The story, which is fake, said Starr was flying to Washington when his plane crashed in Wilkershire, Md. — a town that, as far as we can tell, does not exist. The post said five people were killed in the crash. The post also said that Starr was going to testify before "special investigative committee that has recently found itself investigating crimes from the 1990s," led by U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. There is no such committee, but Gowdy’s name likely was invoked because he was chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. That committee submitted its final report in July 2016. Starr’s investigation into the Clintons, starting with former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster’s death and the Whitewater land deal, eventually unearthed details of Bill Clinton allegedly lying in a deposition about an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. The allegations in the Starr Report led to Bill Clinton’s 1998 impeachment. More recently, Starr served as president and chancellor of Baylor University, but left amid accusations that he mishandled a sexual assault scandal to protect players on the school’s football team. As for the story that he died, its origins have roots in a well-known source of fabricated news. ConservativeFlashNews.com copied the story that appeared on the same date on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The post featured a photograph of a real fatal plane crash during a 2015 air show in England. The site has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. As is the case here, TheLastLineOfDefense.org’s posts end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without attribution about its origin. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t indicate that this or any other story is fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."

pomt-12505	In the federal government, "there’s $16 billion in duplicate programs" that can be cut.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/27/jon-ossoff/checking-jon-ossoff-16-billion-government-waste/	Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate making a strong run in a historically Republican House district, recently aired an ad in which he sought to burnish his credentials as an opponent of unnecessary government spending. Speaking directly to the camera, Ossoff, a former congressional aide, said in part, "Both parties in Washington waste too much of your money. When I worked there I helped expose waste and abuse by government contractors. We need stricter oversight and tougher penalties. They need to be held accountable. And there’s $16 billion in duplicate programs. That can be cut." We wondered where that $16 billion figure came from, so we did some due diligence. When we contacted the Ossoff campaign, they sent us to a report published every year since 2011 by the Government Accountability Office, the respected, nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress. The report, which is mandated by law, is designed to point out programs, offices and practices in government that could be eliminated or changed because they duplicate other government functions or fail to provide value for the taxpayer. Ossoff’s campaign said the $16 billion figure came from several line items in the GAO report that the candidate has reviewed and believes can be eliminated in short order and without significant harm. Here’s a list. (For readers who want the full, in-the-weeds description of these programs, you can refer to the GAO report.) • Consolidate federal data centers: Save $5.4 billion. • Use "strategic sourcing" at the Defense Department: Save $4 billion. • Expand joint basing at the Defense Department: Save $2.3 billion. • Improve "demonstrative spending" at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: Save at least $2 billion. • Improve management of oil and gas resources on federal lands: Save $1.7 billion. • Consolidate mobile communications: Save $388 million. • Improve oversight of state spending under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: Save at least $200 million. These seven items add up to almost exactly $16 billion. That said, it’s worth noting that only some, not all, are duplicative in the strictest sense; with some of these recommendations, the GAO is calling for improved oversight or management. Also, the $16 billion figure doesn’t include all recommendations in the GAO report -- or even all of those that stem specifically from programs or efforts that GAO deemed duplicative. We found at least two recommendations from the report that suggested savings from duplicative programs: • Prevent individuals from collecting both full disability insurance benefits and unemployment insurance benefits that cover the same period: Save $1.9 billion from 2016 to 2025. • Terminate the U.S. Family Health Plan and have other DOD health care contractors take over its duties: Save $189 million over fiscal years 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, the report includes a wide range of other recommendations that Ossoff has not explicitly said he supports. (We excluded recommendations where GAO was unable to provide a specific dollar figure.) They include: • Conduct timely children’s disability reviews to ensure that only eligible children receive Supplemental Security Income benefits: Save $3.1 billion over five years • Obtain better data to better enforce offsets and ensure benefit fairness in Social Security. Save $2.4 billion to $7.9 billion over 10 years. • Limit the subsidy for crop insurance premiums for individual farmers: Save $2 billion annually • Permanently rescind the U.S. Enrichment Corp. Fund: Save $1.6 billion • Market the Energy Department’s excess uranium: Secure $1 billion in additional revenue. • Modify how Medicare pays certain cancer hospitals: Save $500 million annually. • Broaden the Internal Revenue Service’s authority to correct simple tax return errors in order to avoid audits: Secure $274 million in additional revenue over fiscal years 2018 to 2026. • Achieve greater cost efficiencies with checked baggage inspection: Save $234 million in 2015 to 2027. • Adjust the air passenger immigration inspection user fee to fully recover the cost of inspection activities: Save almost $175 million. So when Ossoff says "there’s $16 billion in duplicate programs" that can be cut, he’s actually undercounting. GAO found at least $13 billion in additional specified savings that Ossoff did not allude to in the ad, plus even more when savings of unspecified amounts are included. (The campaign told PolitiFact that there "a lot of additional areas for cutting wasteful government spending that he thinks are worth examining as well.") A final note: $16 billion is real money, but it’s still a fairly small fraction of overall federal spending. Total federal spending is about $4 trillion for fiscal year 2017, and even if you exclude mandatory spending on such programs as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and interest on the accumulated debt, the government still spends more than $1 trillion a year on "discretionary" programs. Our ruling Ossoff said that in the federal government, "there’s $16 billion in duplicate programs" that can be cut. There are indeed $16 billion in cuts recommended by a credible study published by a nonpartisan arm of Congress, though not all are examples of duplication. The actual universe of cuts offered by GAO is even higher -- somewhere north of an additional $13 billion. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-08818	Ken Mercer "wants Sean Hannity and James Dobson included in social studies texts."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/aug/14/rebecca-bell-metereau/rebecca-bell-metereau-says-ken-mercer-wants-sean-h/	Democrat Rebecca Bell-Metereau, trying to unseat Republican Ken Mercer on the State Board of Education, calls him "an extreme partisan with a set agenda" in a campaign flier that we recently snagged from a pile laid out in the Texas AFL-CIO building in Austin. Among Bell-Metereau's statements: Mercer "wants Sean Hannity and James Dobson included in social studies texts." We wondered whether Mercer was really in favor of Texas schoolchildren learning about a conservative political commentator -- Hannity -- and the founder of the evangelical Christian group Focus on the Family -- Dobson. We've previously checked four claims related to the board's rewriting of the state's social studies curriculum standards this year, including one by Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee and another by Kathy Miller of the Texas Freedom Network, which bills itself as a watchdog group that monitors "far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders" and has been critical of some changes the board made this year to the standards. Accusations that a seven-member conservative bloc on the 15-member board is infusing the process with politics has thrust the body into the national spotlight. Conservative stalwart Mercer, a San Antonio businessman initially elected to the board in 2006, waxed a well-funded challenger in March's GOP primary. Mercer's district, No. 5, includes Travis County south of the Colorado River, northern Bexar County and parts or all of 10 other counties. For this article, we asked Bell-Metereau, a professor at Texas State University, how she concluded that Mercer wants Hannity & Dobson in Texas textbooks. Her consultant, Harold Cook, pointed us to an August 2009 San Antonio Express-News news article about the social studies curriculum standards stating that Mercer "would add James Dobson's Focus on the Family, conservative talk-show host Sean Hannity and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to the list of conservatives" that students could study in a high school U.S. history course. The article starts by saying that under the first draft of the standards, high school students would learn about "such significant individuals and milestones of conservative politics as Newt Gingrich and the rise of the Moral Majority — but nothing about liberals." It notes too that the standards are the basis of public school textbooks; that's in keeping with state law. The first draft of the U.S. history standards, dated July 31, 2009, said students would be expected to "identify significant conservative advocacy organizations and individuals, such as Newt Gingrich, Phyllis Schlafly, and the Moral Majority" as part of learning about "the circumstances of the U.S. as it emerges into the 21st century." According to the Express-News story, that's the list Mercer was referring to when he mentioned Hannity and Dobson. The story also quotes Mercer saying students should "study both sides." At "the end of the day," Mercer is quoted saying, "we will want the young students to be able to identify what's conservative, what's their advocacy and who are the conservative groups, individuals and leaders. And what is liberal in contrast." According to the story, Mercer suggested adding as examples of liberals the National Education Association, MoveOn.org, Planned Parenthood and the Texas Freedom Network. When we asked Mercer about his position on putting Hannity and Dobson in textbooks, he said he offered those examples of whom to include in response to the reporter's asking about adding liberal groups to the standards then being drafted. He said the groups and people in the standards such as the Moral Majority were examples of past conservative movements so his point was that if contemporary liberal groups were added to the curriculum, some of their conservative counterparts such as Huckabee and Hannity should be added as well. The Moral Majority, an evangelical Christian organization founded by the late Jerry Falwell, was a powerful political player during the 1980s. The board adopted a final version of the standards this May after approving revisions in January, March and May. We hunted for signs of Mercer advocating for Dobson and Hannity to be added to the standards during board deliberations. Our finding: When the time came to offer amendments to the standards, Mercer didn't propose adding Hannity or Dobson, although he proposed at least 15 amendments, including to put Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Wallace Jefferson on a list of people whom fourth-grade students could learn are examples of "important individuals who modeled active participation in the democratic process." He also proposed changing "growth of the slave trade" to "Atlantic Triangular trade" in an objective for eighth-grade social studies students learning "why various sections of the United States developed different patterns of economic activity." The former survived the amendment process and is in the final version of the standards; the latter did not. Dan Quinn, a Texas Freedom Network spokesman, and Debbie Ratcliffe, the education agency's communications director, said they did not recall any board attempts to add Hannity or Dobson to the standards. And we didn't find mention of them in the adopted versions. From another vantage point, a note in the first draft stated that several members of the panel of educators and others who wrote it were in favor of adding a requirement that students learn about liberal groups. In the end, that didn't happen, though a specific mention of conservative groups survived the amendment process. The final version of the standards says high-school U.S. history students are expected to "describe the causes, key organizations, and individuals of the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s, including Phyllis Schlafly, the Contract with America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority, and the National Rifle Association" as part of learning about "the impact of political, economic, and social factors in the U.S. role in the world from the 1970s through 1990." The word "liberal" doesn't appear in the high school standards. We asked Mercer why a mandate to study liberal groups didn't become a part of the standards. He said a separate requirement wasn't needed because liberal groups were already well represented. As to Bell-Metereau's statement, she's correct that Mercer spoke about adding Hannity and Dobson to the state's social studies curriculum standards -- although Mercer says the comment was intended to make a point about preserving ideological balance. Sorting who provoked what in that exchange is beyond us; that's between Mercer and the reporter. And although judging someone's wants is difficult, we find it significant and persuasive that neither Mercer nor other board members made a motion to include Dobson and Hannity in the standards, meaning there's been no push thus far to include them in textbooks. That earns Bell-Metereau a rating of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05039	Says the federal government is spending $765,828 to subsidize "pancakes for yuppies" in Washington.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/11/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-765828-federal-money-spent-sub/	Roger Williams, facing a July 31, 2012, runoff against Wes Riddle for the Republican nomination in the state’s 25th Congressional District, vows in a mailer to voters that he’d "just say no" to wasteful spending. His mailer lists as objectionable expenditures half a dozen items including the nearly $800 billion economic stimulus package sought by President Barack Obama in 2009. As we’ve written before, various experts credit the stimulus with protecting or creating jobs. A reader asked, though, if other items on Williams’ list hold up such as purported spending on a remake of "Sesame Street" in Pakistan; a New York video game preservation center; an art exhibition in Italy; a documentary on how rock music fed the collapse of the Soviet Union; and a study of how college students use mobile devices for social networking. For this article, we’re chomping solely on the mailer’s tastiest claim -- $765,828 in federal spending to "subsidize ‘pancakes for yuppies’ in the nation’s capital." A caveat: We’re not going to judge whether the proclaimed expenditure is wasteful. That’s Williams’ opinion. Still: Pancakes for yuppies, supported by Uncle Sam? We'll accept that Washington has its share of yuppies; Merriam-Webster defines a yuppie as a "young college-educated adult who is employed in a well-paying profession and who lives and works in or near a large city." Williams’ mailer offers as its basis a Dec. 20, 2011 online announcement by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., of his "Wastebook 2011" report. The report includes a short chapter stating that the hundreds of thousands of federal dollars were provided to help build an International House of Pancakes restaurant in the Columbia Heights section of Washington, breaking down to $500,000 "as an equity injection in DC Pancakes LLC for a 19 percent ownership interest" in the project with remaining funds going to "training costs for new employees, and other consultants." Coburn’s report says Columbia Heights, which is north and west of the Capitol, "has become a local shopping hot spot for some and ― one of Washington‘s more desirable neighborhoods. Other businesses in the area include Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, Best Buy, and Starbucks." Coburn says in his footnotes that he drew on a Nov. 24, 2010, commentary in the conservative Washington Examiner and research by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, which apparently confirmed the grant amounts and purposes. In the Examiner article, writer David Freddoso quotes Butch Hopkins, who was then CEO of the Anacostia Economic Development Corp., as saying that his organization had applied for and received the grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2009 to invest in the restaurant in exchange for a minority equity stake. Freddoso questions the benefit to taxpayers of subsidizing the restaurant’s creation in a neighborhood, he writes, that was already a popular yuppie shopping, dining and drinking locale. It quotes Acting HHS Assistant Secretary David Hansell, on hand at the IHOP’s opening, as saying that a lot of folks came out looking for jobs there. We sought to confirm the grant and then to gauge if it’s reasonable to characterize the restaurant as catering to yuppies. The economic development corporation, founded in 1969, says it has developed single and multi-family housing, neighborhood retail and office projects and a shopping center to serve residents living in Washington east of the Anacostia River. On a web page, the corporation says it teamed with an investment company to open the IHOP restaurant, drawing on support from HHS’s Office of Community Services. "This venture will employ over 150 DC residents," the web entry says, "the majority of which are from AEDC’s primary target area in Ward 8," which is mostly in southeast Washington. By email, HHS spokesman Kenneth Wolfe told us the agency gave a $765,828 Community Economic Development grant to the economic development corporation, which proposed to spend $500,000 from the grant to make a 30 percent equity ownership investment in the Jackson Investment Company to build and open an IHOP in Columbia Heights, creating 70 full-time jobs for low-income individuals otherwise eligible for Temporary Aid to Needy Families. A summary Wolfe provided says the grant would leverage about $2 million in other funds, about which he did not elaborate. We weren’t sure how to determine whether the IHOP caters to yuppies. Generally, according to news accounts, Columbia Heights appears to be gaining retail momentum after decades of disuse in the wake of riots and fires that broke out after the April 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. A Jan. 9, 2005, news article in the Washington Post, described the local residents as diverse, singling out mostly poor immigrant and African American teenagers. A Nov. 21, 2010, Post news article on the initial onslaught of applicants to work at the IHOP, on Irving Street near 14th Street NW, describes it as located in "fast-gentrifying Columbia Heights -- home to Target, Best Buy and a gastropub featuring $7 pints of British draft beer." A Dec. 21, 2011, Huffington Post story about Coburn’s criticism of the federal grant says the IHOP is in a "massive Columbia Heights shopping center, part of a major mixed-use redevelopment of a once-vibrant commercial corridor that had been fairly barren even years after a Green Line Metrorail station opened." By telephone, IHOP corporate spokeswoman Becky Madeira said the neighborhood is so diverse, it would be a mischaracterization to say the restaurant caters to yuppies. "There is a diversity of ages and a broad band of ethnicities" in the area, Madeira said. In a telephone interview, Tyoka Jackson, the local franchisee, told us the restaurant employs 100 workers: "We took people who were on welfare, who were unemployed, we’re talking ex-offenders, military, single mothers and fathers, and they have jobs now. To me, as a taxpayer, that is money well spent." Jackson also said his customers are a diverse mix. "I would never characterize it as yuppie," Jackson said, adding that if Williams is in Washington, he’s welcome to see for himself. "If he wins, I would suggest he come in and have a stack of pancakes and take a look at who is sitting around him... not only who is sitting around him, but who is serving him," Jackson said. Finally, J.B. Wogan of PolitiFact in Washington scouted the restaurant at about 9 a.m. on a weekday. Wogan reported back that the surroundings have tell-tale signs of "yuppy-ism": a bike rack out front, a tea shop across the street, a Bed, Bath and Beyond next door, two Starbucks within short walks, a Vitamin Shoppe and a Panera Bread nearby. Also, there are four banks within a two-minute walk, perhaps a sign that people living or working in the area have money to deposit and withdraw. And as Wogan entered the IHOP, he encountered a white man in a teal plaid shirt carrying a laptop. Then again, he also counted four older black women, two teenage boys and two families. And despite an advertisement for free Wi-Fi, no one had a laptop out. No one appeared to be on break from a white-collar job -- Wogan was the only customer wearing a button-down shirt. Maybe Wogan stopped in at the wrong time or on the wrong day. Still, he didn’t spot yuppies eating pancakes. Williams’ campaign did not respond to an inquiry about this claim. Our ruling A $765,828 federal grant helped an IHOP open in a part of the capital that has been gaining retail cachet. It makes sense, too, that the restaurant’s customers include yuppies. Who doesn’t like pancakes? But the intimation that the grant was awarded just to satisfy yuppie appetites fails to acknowledge that people of all stripes (and ages and income levels) order short stacks. Also, the grant enabled dozens of down-and-out individuals to land jobs -- a result not acknowledged in the campaign mailer. We rate Williams’ claim Half True.

pomt-05564	"This is the only state in the country that bypassed the General Assembly to authorize [in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants]."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/05/doreen-costa/rhode-island-state-rep-doreen-costa-says-rhode-isl/	In a far-reaching decision last September, the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education voted to make undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state tuition at public colleges. The move was backed by Governor Chafee, but it came only after years of failed attempts to make the change through the General Assembly. After the vote, opponents complained that the Chafee administration had forced through a sweeping change in state policy through the back door. And almost immediately, some legislators started working to have the decision overturned. State Rep. Doreen Costa is among those leading the charge in the General Assembly. During a recent appearance on WHJJ’s "Helen Glover Show," the North Kingstown Republican talked about legislation she introduced in January that would repeal the Board of Governors’ decision. "This is the only state in the country that bypassed the General Assembly to authorize this," Costa said during the March 26 show. "There was a process that should have been done and the governor chose not to do it." Much has been written in The Journal and other publications about Rhode Island’s decision to offer reduced tuition to undocumented immigrants. Many of those stories have said that Rhode Island is the only state that did so without first passing a law enacting the policy. But in light of the controversy that continues to swirl around the issue, and Costa’s claim, we thought it would be helpful to revisit that specific question. First, some background. State Rep. Grace Diaz, D-Providence, has introduced bills in the General Assembly every year since 2004 to extend in-state tuition to undocumented students in good academic standing. But those bills never got far. During the Carcieri administration, Diaz and other supporters of the policy had also tried unsuccessfully to get the Board of Governors to consider the change. Only after Chafee took office last year did the board -- with new members appointed by Chafee -- take up the issue. And on Sept. 26, its members voted unanimously to adopt the change. In the days afterward, Costa and other lawmakers made no secret of their displeasure with the vote, saying the decision was for the General Assembly to make, not the board. In response to a Journal poll, 19 of the 38 state senators and 26 of the 75 state representatives said they opposed the board’s decision. Under the new policy, which is set to go into effect this September, undocumented students are eligible for reduced, in-state tuition if they meet certain guidelines. Those include that they have attended an approved Rhode Island high school for three or more years or received a GED, and continue to live in Rhode Island; and that they file an affidavit with their chosen college saying they have taken separate action to legalize their citizenship status, or will do so as soon as they become eligible. The vote by the Board of Governors made Rhode Island the 13th state to adopt such a policy. (Wisconsin, which had passed a law on reduced tuition in 2009, repealed it last year and is not included in the list.) And, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, every other state that has the policy did in fact pass a law first, starting with Texas in 2001 and followed by California (2001), Utah (2002), New York (2002), Washington (2003), Oklahoma (2003), Illinois (2003), Kansas (2004), New Mexico (2005), Nebraska (2006), Maryland (2011) and, most recently, Connecticut (2011). We double-checked the legislation in each state. The NCSL’s information is correct. Our ruling State Rep. Doreen Costa said that Rhode Island is the only state that decided to allow in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants without enacting a law first. The Rhode Island Board of Governors made the move as a matter of policy. In the dozen other states that offer reduced tuition to undocumented students it is a matter of law. State Rep. Grace Diaz has once again submitted a bill to write the policy into law. But until her legislation passes, the Ocean State will stand alone on this issue. We rule Costa’s statement True.

pomt-08221	Small businesses that have "$250,000 in gross sales for the business. They're the ones that are looking at massive tax increases."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/17/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-250000-gross-sales-tax-increase/	Tax rates will go up in 2011 unless Congress acts to extend the current rates. Members are talking about voting on the matter before the end of the year. The sticking point is exactly what a final tax package will look like. President Barack Obama campaigned on making permanent the current rates for the middle class, but raising rates for couples who make more than $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Most Republicans (and some Democrats) would like to see all the current rates made permanent. Now various compromise ideas are being floated, with ideas for extending some rates temporarily or attempting reforms of the tax code. Tea party favorite Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., told George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America that she was willing to accept a compromise as long as all the current tax rates stayed the same for taxpayers of all incomes. But, she said, she opposed a compromise that would be attached to extending unemployment benefits. Stephanopoulos then asked why it was okay for the wealthy to get their tax cuts extended, but not okay to extend unemployment benefits for the jobless. "Well, remember again what this is. It's a massive tax increase, and it's on the people who are the job creators," Bachmann said. "And people want to think that these are millionaires, sitting in leather chairs, lighting their cigars with $100 bills. That's not what we're talking about. These are people who, who are carpet layers who maybe employ two or three other guys, or a plumber, maybe himself and his brother, and it's $250,000 in gross sales for their business. They're the ones that are looking at massive tax increases." That's probably a compelling narrative for Bachmann -- big government taxes the little guys. We first fact-checked similar claims during the 2008 election, when Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, aka Joe the Plumber, worried he'd get a tax increase under Obama's plan if he bought a company that took in around $250,000 a year. It wasn't true then, and it isn't true now. Here's why: Plumbers -- or any other small business owner -- get to deduct their business expenses, so they'd have to be bringing in more than $250,000 in gross sales. The tax laws allow small business owners to deduct all kinds of business expenses: employees' pay, supplies, a car or truck, fuel costs, advertising, association dues, utilities, shop repairs, and the list goes on. (For more details, read chapter 8 of the Tax Guide for Small Business published by the IRS.) Bachmann said that the tax increases kick in at "$250,000 in gross sales," which traditionally means total sales at invoice values, or everything the plumbers billed. And, she said the plumbers would be looking at "massive tax increases," when actually the top two rates would be increasing from 33 percent to 36 percent, and from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. Finally, of all taxpayers who declare business income, about 2 percent declare enough income to see tax increases if the rates on the top brackets expire. Most small business owners would not see a tax increase, though the most profitable small businesses would. We're not sure why Bachmann distorted the point about gross sales. As we said, it's something that's been explained several times. Good Morning America posted a note on its website after Bachmann's appearance, noting that her statement was wrong. We asked her spokesperson for a comment but didn't hear back. The proposed increases have been discussed many times and for several years. Her misstatement of the facts on Good Morning America seems designed to scare small business owners into thinking they're in line for a tax increase, even if their income is modest. For distorting the tax proposals to a ridiculous extent, we rate her statement Pants on Fire.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2010-11-17T18:18:02	2010-11-16	['None']
pomt-10609	The Bush administration has "the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/21/hillary-clinton/her-words-are-somewhat-misleading/	The dig by Sen. Hillary Clinton makes the Bush administration's treatment of wounded veterans seem almost so heartless as to be implausible. "The Bush administration sends mixed messages," Clinton said during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas. "They want to recruit and retain these young people to serve our country and then they have the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again." The Army suggests this issue may all be a tempest in a political teapot, that it simply made a clerical error in asking a wounded vet to return a portion of his signing bonus. But there's another issue, one that may be a bit more legitimate: whether wounded soldiers ought to be guaranteed future installments of enlistment bonuses, bonuses pegged to future years of service they were not able to complete. In 2007, nearly 39,000 army recruits received an average of $16,500 in enlistment bonuses, according to Maj. Nathan M. Banks Sr. of the Department of the Army Public Affairs. The issue Clinton addresses was first raised in July 2007 by the bipartisan Dole-Shalala Commission, when, in the course of work with veterans and their families, they noticed that "service members' remaining enlistment bonuses were not being paid when they were injured and medically retired or separated from active duty." The Defense Department assured the problem was fixed. In October 2007, Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pa., introduced the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act to formally ensure that wounded veterans are paid the entirety of any signing bonus they were promised within 30 days after discharge for combat-related wounds. A Senate version of the bill was introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., in November 2007. The Senate bill has 18 co-sponsors, including Clinton. The issue gathered steam that month when a Pittsburgh television station reported the story of Jordan Fox, an army private who was partially blinded in one eye from the explosion of a roadside bomb in Iraq. After Fox returned home with a medical discharge, he got a letter from the Army asking him to repay $2,800 of a $7,500 enlistment bonus. While Fox was held up by many politicians as Exhibit A in the case for the new legislation, his case also may have muddied the waters. The Army says it simply made an "error in pay processing." Defense Department policy is clear: Bonuses already paid should not be recouped if "injury or illness of the service member was not the result of the service member's misconduct." The Army contends Fox's was an isolated case. In fact, when it set up a hotline for pay problems, it received just two calls on that issue. So are we talking about legislation to fix a problem that may have affected just three people? As it relates to wounded soldiers having to return portions of paid bonuses, perhaps. And certainly a lot of politicians made a lot of political hay about that. But that's different than unpaid, future installments of bonuses. Say a soldier who got a $10,000 up-front bonus, and was promised an additional $5,000 at the end of each of three years of completed duty. If he was injured and medically discharged in his first year of service, would he get the final two years of unpaid bonuses? Defense Department policy there is less clear. The secretary of the Military Department may decide to pay the soldier unpaid installments if he or she determines that not paying would be "against equity and good conscience, or contrary to the best interests of the United States." The legislation Clinton co-sponsored would require the military to pay all future installments upon medical discharge. No one knows, still, how many wounded veterans this may affect. The Congressional Budget Office informally told congressional staffs that the proposed legislation — to include unpaid installments — might cost about $1-million a year. That may seem like a lot of money, but considering the number of wounded vets, it doesn't suggest they think this is a widespread, institutional problem. The Senate bill seeks an accounting by the military to find out. So while Clinton highlights a legitimate issue — paying future installments of enlistment bonuses even after wounded veterans have been discharged — her wording is somewhat misleading, suggesting wounded veterans are being forced to return bonus money. There is little evidence to suggest that happened to more than a couple veterans, and the Army admitted its mistake. Also misleading is her suggestion that there was some kind of Bush administration effort to deny future bonus payments promised to wounded vets. But she may be right that some were denied future bonus payments (although it is far from clear that this is still happening), and the legislation co-sponsored by Clinton would make it crystal clear they are to be paid. And so we rate her statement Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-01-21T00:00:00	2008-01-15	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'George_W._Bush', 'The_Pentagon']

pomt-04626	Says Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy "voted against paying our soldiers" and "against increasing combat pay" while voting "to protect his own pay."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-duffy-voted-against-pay-incr/	The TV ad that mocks Republican congressman Sean Duffy as a selfish pol who opposed pay for U.S. troops is one of the toughest we’ve seen in the fall 2012 campaign. As combat soldiers trudge under a hot sun, a narrator begins: "They fought for us, walked a mile in these boots." The camera pans to shiny black wing-tips: "Congressman Duffy walked in these, ahem, shoes." The ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee continues: "Facing a government shutdown, Duffy voted against making sure our soldiers got paid...against increasing combat pay." Onscreen: Duffy voted against paying our soldiers. The narrator contemptuously adds: "But Duffy made sure he got paid." Onscreen: Duffy voted to protect his own pay. Pretty serious stuff -- and Democrats are raising the same votes against other Republican candidates. So, did Duffy -- who faces Democrat Pat Kreitlow in his bid for a second term -- really vote to stop military pay raises while shielding his own pocketbook? Turns out the votes cited -- in those footnotes at the bottom of the screen -- are not the whole story. Not even close. The votes referenced in the ad all come from spring 2011, when an extended partisan tussle over spending cuts brought the federal government close to a shutdown. One of the sticky issues was how to deal with congressional pay and military pay if a shutdown occurred. There was plenty of maneuvering for partisan advantage and both parties claimed they were on the side of the troops. To back up its claim, the DCCC pointed us to votes on Democratic-sponsored amendments to three bills. Here’s what we found on the votes in congressional roll calls, the official legislative history and media reports. -- "Voted against paying our soldiers." April 7, 2011: As President Barack Obama and Republican leaders negotiated one day before a shutdown deadline, the GOP-controlled House passed a one-week appropriations bill (H.R. 1363). It funded the Department of Defense for a longer period, the remainder of the fiscal year, through Sept. 30, 2011. Obama had warned that a shutdown would threaten troop pay. Republicans, trying to keep the pressure on, called their measure a "troop funding bill." But Democrats complained it cut too deep and included an unacceptable ban on public funds for abortions in Washington, D.C. Less than 10 minutes before the final approval of the bill, Democrats forced a vote on a different motion. That motion sought to ensure that members of the military would continue to get paid in the event of a shutdown. The maker of the motion, U.S. Rep. Bill Owens, D-New York, argued Obama planned to veto the Republican appropriations for the military, so the troops still would not get paid. Owens did not explain how he expected to protect troop pay through an amendment to a bill the president had pledged to veto. U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, sponsor of the spending bill, said on the floor: "This motion is purely a political gesture and should be defeated ... The real fact is that if you vote against this bill, you are voting against the troops who are engaged in three wars." Duffy voted no on the motion along with all but one other Republican. But he was in the 247-181 majority, including 15 Democrats, that approved the underlying bill. So, did Duffy "vote against paying our soldiers" as the ad says? No. He opposed one amendment, but the effect of his votes would have kept money flowing to the military for the rest of the budget year. -- Voted "against increasing combat pay." May 26, 2011: After the 2011 funding crisis was averted, the House debated a defense authorization bill for the following year, 2012. Democrats called for a vote on a motion to boost pay for combat troops. U.S. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, called it transparently political: "We had all kinds of time to bring an amendment that would be helpful like this, then they bring this one. There's no offset. This would just put us again above the allocation from the chairman. This is really more Democrat increasing spending." The motion failed, with Duffy in opposition. What the DCCC ad doesn’t say is that the full bill -- supported by Duffy, nearly all Republicans and 95 Democrats -- already included a pay hike of 1.6 percent in the monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services. That covered combat troops as well. So, Duffy didn’t vote for the additional bump proposed at the very end of the process, but he voted for the increased pay level in the underlying bill. He did the same in 2012, on a 1.7 percent pay increase. Think of it this way: There is a bill to increase spending by $500,000 for a particular program. An amendment is offered to increase it to $750,000. If a person votes against the amendment but for the bill, are they "voting against an increase in spending" for the program? -- "Voted to protect his own pay." April 1, 2011: During the shutdown crisis, Republicans controlling the House approved a bill (H.R. 1255) directing that its version of budget cuts become law if the Senate did not act by April 6, 2011. Both parties maneuvered to score points during debate on the bill, resulting in separate actions that were largely symbolic and arguably unconstitutional. While the GOP claimed the House action alone could make the bill law, Roll Call pointed out the bill "would not become law unless the Senate also approves it and the president signs it into law, neither of which is expected to occur." The budget-cuts bill included a prohibition on paying members of Congress and the president during a shutdown (members get paid during a shutdown while most federal employees do not). But as even some Republicans pointed out, under the constitution pay cannot be reduced mid-term. To address that concern, some proponents argued members would get paid retroactively for any loss of salary. Democrats pounced on that -- and went further, seeking an amendment to bar any retro payments. But The Washington Post reported that they got a surprise on the floor when when a Republican member revealed an email from Obama’s Justice Department questioning the constitutionality of the motion. Duffy and all but one Republican voted against the Democratic motion, which failed. Duffy voted in favor of H.R. 1255, including the ban on paying members during a shutdown. It passed but died in the Senate. Both measures -- as dubious legally as they were -- were attempts to erase the pay protections that members of Congress have in current law for getting paid during a shutdown. Indeed, it is standard for all federal employees to get retroactive pay once a shutdown ends is standard, PolitiFact National found in a 2011 Truth-O-Meter item. So saying that Duffy was out to protect his check is a big stretch. A final note: The Democratic amendments in question were "motions to recommit," a prerogative of the minority party since the first Congress. They are motions, partly procedural, that attempt to send a bill back to committee just before passage. "Both parties, when in the minority, have used these to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage," said Donald Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules who was a key Republican staffer for the House Rules Committee in the 1990s. "It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy." Indeed, Democrats complained bitterly in 2007 when then-minority Republicans used "MTRs" to stall and score political points, the Post noted. For example, in March 2007, Democrats tried to pass a bill to give the District of Columbia a vote in the House. From the Post: "Republicans moved to recommit the bill to committee, attaching new language that would have thrown out the District’s strict anti-gun laws. Worried that conservative, pro-gun Democrats would feel compelled to vote with GOP and kill the bill, Democratic leaders yanked it from the floor." Both parties, when in the minority, contend the motions can have merit and are not purely procedural. Our rating A Democratic TV ad charges that Duffy "voted against paying our soldiers" and "against increasing combat pay" while voting "to protect his own pay." The claims are based on Duffy’s votes on "motions to recommit" that preceded final votes on military and congressional pay. Such motions are routinely denied by the majority party as procedural moves. That gives the minority party the chance to structure them for partisan advantage. That’s what is playing out in the ad now. We rate the claim False.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2012-09-16T09:00:00	2012-08-29	['United_States', 'Sean_Duffy']
pomt-05480	Says Ted Cruz represents a Chinese company found guilty of stealing blueprints from an American manufacturer.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/19/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-ted-cruz-represents-chinese-co/	U.S. Senate candidate David Dewhurst, whose campaign last fall sent email blasts depicting candidate Ted Cruz as a China sympathizer, popped a TV ad April 17, 2012, revisiting Cruz’s representation of a Chinese company. Dewhurst’s ad says Cruz, the state’s former solicitor general, is helping the Shandong Linglong Tyre Co. put a U.S. company out of business. Next, Jordan Fishman, identified as an "American manufacturer," appears on screen, saying: "Ted is defending a Chinese company who stole things from an American citizen -- and it’s not only from us, it’s from the people who work for us." The narrator then says: "Cruz’s Chinese client stole American blueprints and the courts found the Chinese company guilty, liable, for stealing blueprints." The commercial closes with mention of the U.S. firm, which is not identified, winning a judgment of $26 million though, the narrator says, with Cruz’s help, "the Chinese keep stalling in court, they keep counterfeiting, and Ted Cruz keeps getting paid." We wondered if Cruz, a partner at Houston’s Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, indeed represents a Chinese firm found guilty, or liable for, stealing U.S. blueprints. Cruz’s campaign posted a response to Dewhurst’s ad, saying: "Ted works in the private sector as an appellate lawyer at a major law firm that represents clients on different sides of litigation. One of the clients of the firm is a tire company based in China. That private company was sued in a trademark dispute and hit with a judgment, and the firm was hired to handle the appeal." The response also says Cruz did not represent the client in the original trial. "And the appeal concerns technical issues," the response says, "like the court’s jurisdiction and the appropriate statute of limitations." To back up the stolen blueprints’ claim, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed us to a Dewhurst website, titled the "Real Ted Cruz," featuring links to a few articles touching on the legal dispute. Among them: An Oct. 3, 2011, blog post by Texas Monthly’s Paul Burka mentioning a story placed Sept. 28, 2011 on Plaza de Armas, a San Antonio news blog. The Plaza de Armas story describes Fishman as a Florida businessman who designs and produces underground mining tires. In the 1990s, the story says, Fishman created a version containing a three-inch layer of rubber on the outside, enabling it to withstand movement in confined spaces. Fishman is quoted saying that behind his back, his company’s sales and marketing manager attempted to negotiate a contract with a Chinese company to make the product for himself; when Fishman found out, the employee was fired. "About two weeks later," Fishman is quoted saying, the former employee "was in contact with the people in Dubai and ultimately China, and turned over the blueprints to them. They copied the blueprints, which you can’t do. You can go and buy a product and retro-design it, but you can’t copy a blueprint." Fishman filed suit against Shandong Linglong and in 2010, after a six-day trial, a federal jury in Virginia awarded him $26 million in damages, the story says. Cruz later filed the still-pending appeal on behalf of the Chinese company, the story says. Also noted by Dewhurst: A July 28, 2010, Sarasota Herald-Tribune news story recapping a judge’s decision to uphold the damages award which attorneys for Fishman rate as one of the largest ever for individual copyright infringement. The story, quoting from the lawsuit, says that in 2005 former sales manager Sam Vance began providing trade secrets to Shandong Linglong Rubber Co. and Al Dobowi Tyre Co. of Dubai, a distributor. "The information included design blueprints, customer lists and pricing information," the story says. "Tire Engineering, which does business as Alpha Mining Systems, sued Vance in 2005, and two years later discovered a ‘conspiracy’ among the foreign companies to steal and profit from those trade secrets," the story quotes the lawsuit as saying. Separately, the newspaper said, Fishman's company also had sued the former employee in local court. The story says the company was awarded $59 million in damages in 2008, but a state appellate court later tossed that judgment. Dewhurst’s site also points to a July 22, 2010, press release stating the federal judge upheld $26 million in damages "resulting from the illegal copying of Mr. Fishman’s blueprints for unique asymmetrical underground mining tires." The release identifies August J. Matteis, Jr. as Fishman’s lead lawyer. Matteis, a Washington lawyer, told us in a telephone interview that the jury found the Chinese firm, and others, liable for misdeeds including stealing tire design blueprints from companies owned by Fishman. He said too that Fishman ran across early evidence of the sneaky work when he saw foreign-made tires based on his designs at a Las Vegas trade show. Matteis forwarded the jury’s July 15, 2010, verdict and the July 21, 2010, order from U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis, III. The jury found the defendants liable for violating laws related to copyright, registered trademark, unfair competition deceptive trade practices, conversion and civil conspiracy. Matteis said the "conversion" verdict refers to the stealing of blueprints. The verdict also shows the jury awarding $26 million in damages, a figure based on recovering profits made by the other firms by taking the blueprints, Matteis told us. Ellis’s order states, in part, that the "evidence was sufficient to prove that defendants unlawfully obtained copies of plaintiffs' blueprints." Matteis said the word "guilty" in Dewhurst’s ad is incorrect because that term applies to criminal charges while the judgment and award was reached after a civil trial. Our ruling Matteis’s comment about the word "guilty" strikes us as valid; viewers might take "guilty" in Dewhurst's ad as hinting that Cruz represents someone convicted of a criminal act. This is not so. Cruz is representing a Chinese firm found liable for stealing blueprints. We rate Dewhurst’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-14322	"Big soda has a lot of money. They make a lot of profit off their product and they market in neighborhoods that suffer from these very things that we’re trying to cure."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/30/jim-kenney/big-soda-and-profits-mayor-kenney-convinced-it-ear/	Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney’s justification for his proposed sugary drinks tax: soda companies still bring in considerable profits, he says. "Big soda has a lot of money," the mayor argued in an interview with KYW. "They make a lot of profit off their product and they market in neighborhoods that suffer from these very things that we’re trying to cure." Billy Penn has covered how low-income consumers drink more sugary beverages than higher income ones. Advertising is more heavily featured in poor neighborhoods of color, research has shown. So, we decided to look into Kenney’s comment on profits. In the last decade, soda sales have fallen dramatically. In 2014 in the U.S., Coca Cola and Pepsi together sold 1.4 billion cases fewer than they did in 2004, Fortune reported, the sum of "modest declines" for 10 years straight. The Philadelphia Inquirer detailed that Coca Cola in particular had lost $1 billion in sales each year since 2012. These drops have meant big changes for Big Soda: Investing in foreign markets, implementing cost-cutting measures, bottling drinks in smaller sizes too for higher profit margins or raising prices altogether, to name a few. Beverage Digest Editor Duane Stanford highlighted price hikes in an interview. "Companies have increased prices for their products, so they’ve been making money even though they’re selling fewer beverages," he said. But! "Soft drinks are still profitable," he continued. Soda corporations "still have pricing power because their brands are powerful." Judging how big profits have been is "entirely dependent on the company themselves," said Stanford. "It’s a relative statement." Big soda to some commentators refers to the carbonated drinks industry as a whole. To others, it speaks to the biggest soft-drink selling corporations in the game: Coca Cola, Pepsi and, if the bronze-level company is in the discussion, Dr. Pepper Snapple. (Kenney’s communication director shared data on Coke, Pepsi, and Coca Cola FEMSA, the company’s Mexico-based bottler, in response to a fact-check inquiry for this report.) Coca Cola reported $7.4 billion in net income, Pepsi reported $5.5 billion and Dr. Pepper Snapple $764 million. Dr. Pepper Snapple and Coke experienced slight profit boosts over the year before, while Pepsi’s numbers took a $1.1-billion dip. News reports on annual and quarterly reports deemed profits for all three companies better than expected. Our Ruling Kenney stated that big soda makes a lot of cash. Profit-wise, despite current consumers trends that may signal a bleak future for soft drink sales, carbonated beverages remain profitable, thanks, in notable cases, to reorganization and new pricing. We rate this claim true.	None	Jim Kenney	None	None	None	2016-03-30T08:45:00	2016-03-27	['None']
pomt-11032	"The European Union … they send us Mercedes, they send us -- by the millions -- the BMWs -- cars by the millions."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-mercedes-bmw-import-cars-us-mil/	During a June 28 visit to Mount Pleasant, Wis. -- the site of a planned Foxconn manufacturing facility -- President Donald Trump defended his hard line on international trade, which has included the imposition of tariffs against both historical friends and adversaries. At one point, he singled out German cars. "The European Union … they send us Mercedes, they send us -- by the millions -- the BMWs -- cars by the millions," Trump said. This assertion is wrong. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) German car sales in the U.S. We turned to data from the Center for Automotive Research, an Ann Arbor, Mich., think tank. In 2017, the Center for Automotive Research found, BMW sold 354,110 cars in the United States, while Daimler sold 375,311, mostly Mercedes-Benzes. That’s 729,000 vehicles -- not even one million, much less "millions." Volkswagen, another German automaker that Trump didn’t mention by name but which is also based in the European Union, sold 625,068 cars in the United States that year. Adding the three companies together, that works out to 1.35 million German cars sold in the United States last year. That’s not exactly "millions," either -- but the problem with Trump’s assertion runs deeper than that. What’s an import? The big three German automakers all have operations in the United States as well as overseas. So care needs to be taken to clarify where the German cars are made before they are labeled "imports." BMW’s largest assembly plant in the world is in Spartanburg, S.C., while Mercedes has a facility in Tuscaloosa County, Ala., and Volkswagen has a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. Production levels for German cars in the United States have risen in recent years, with some of those cars sold in the United States and some exported overseas. When we inquired with Edmunds.com, an automotive website and analytical group, they sent us data showing that about 330,000 of the 1.35 million German cars sold in the United States in 2017 had been built here. That leaves about 980,000 German cars built elsewhere but sold in the United States. To take one example, according to the Center for Automotive Research, BMW made 371,000 cars in the United States in 2017, exported 272,000 of these, sold the remaining 99,000 U.S.-built cars in the U.S. market, and imported roughly 255,000 cars for U.S. buyers in 2017. "For sure, the raw number of imports are nowhere near ‘millions,’ " said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. German carmakers didn't just ship cars from Germany, but also from Mexico, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Hungary, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, France and Italy, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. A little less than half of German car imports to the United States actually came from Germany directly, she said. It’s also worth noting that even U.S. carmakers import cars into the United States. In fact, collectively, they import cars on a larger scale than the German companies do. Specifically, Ford imported 100,000 cars into the United States on net, while General Motors imported 760,000 cars on net and Fiat-Chrysler imported 920,000 on net. For the record, sales by the the three German carmakers are modest in the U.S. market, accounting for 8.5 percent of all sales in 2017, according to the Center for Automotive Research. By contrast, the Big Three U.S. automakers accounted for about 48 percent of U.S. sales that year. Economic benefits of German carmakers in the United States Meanwhile, Trump’s formulation also leaves out the economic benefits of having German automakers operating factories in the United States. Collectively, these plants employ an estimated 50,000 workers, and they have spillover effects on the local, regional and national economies. "American workers are building some of the most popular vehicles with U.S. shoppers: SUVs," said Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto industry analysis with Edmunds.com. "As more and more Americans opt to trade in their sedans for an SUV, the percentage of U.S.-built German vehicles on the road is on the rise." Our ruling Trump said, "The European Union … they send us Mercedes, they send us -- by the millions -- the BMWs -- cars by the millions." Together, Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen imported less than a million cars into the United States in 2017, not "millions." More importantly, Trump ignores that a large proportion of German cars sold in the United States were also built here, using American workers and suppliers whose economic fortunes are boosted by Germany’s carnakers. Other U.S.-built German cars were sold as exports. We rate the statement False.

pomt-03041	"Every month, we get the reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that say even more people have given up looking for work."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/08/ted-cruz/cruz-claim-about-more-americans-giving-job-searche/	Saying the new health care law is undermining the economy, Ted Cruz declared that ever-more Americans are giving up on looking for work. The junior U.S. senator from Texas, who hammered the 2010 law in a Senate floor speech that ran from mid-afternoon Sept. 24, 2013 to noon the next day, made this claim after suggesting Washington is broken because lawmakers don’t heed constituents. Americans are not calling for "more pork," Cruz said. "The calls are from people who are saying: ‘Listen, jobs and the economy is my No. 1 priority.’... When you have one job, it lets you begin to climb the economic ladder to a better job and a better job and a better job. That is the American spirit. Yet we have tens of millions of people in this country out of work. Every month, we get the reports from the (U.S.) Bureau of Labor Statistics that say even more people have given up looking for work." Americans giving up on job searches factor significantly into monthly jobless rates. That’s because the government does not count individuals who did not look for work in the latest four weeks as being "in the workforce." Cruz continued: "The odd way our unemployment statistics work, that makes the number the newspapers report go down. Because when a few hundred thousand people say: ‘All right, I give up, it is so hopeless, I will never find a job,’ that, curiously, results in the unemployment number going down because the number that gets reported in the papers is a measure of a percentage of how many of the people looking for work are unable to find it." Americans giving up? Cruz did not specify the "reports" referenced in his speech, but economists told us individuals who have given up looking for work are what the government calls "discouraged workers," meaning persons "not in the labor force who want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months (or since the end of their last job if they held one within the past 12 months) but who are not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify." Such workers are a subset of workers classified as "marginally attached" to the workforce, meaning individuals who want a job, have searched for work during the prior 12 months and were available to take a job during the referenced week but had not looked for work in the past four weeks. By email, Bureau of Labor Statistics economists guided us to its estimates of the number of discouraged workers, which has gone up and down month to month. According to a searchable bureau database, the number of "discouraged workers" averaged a decade-high of nearly 1.2 million in 2010, surely because of the recession. But the monthly average of discouraged workers decreased to 989,000 in 2011, the bureau says, and dropped again, to 909,000, in 2012. In the most recent 12 months before Cruz’s speech, from September 2012 through August 2013, the number of discouraged workers increased six times and decreased six times, according to the agency’s figures. Most recently, the bureau estimated 866,000 discouraged workers in August 2013, which was down from 988,000 and slightly over 1 million workers in the immediately preceding months. For a tighter comparison, we calculated the monthly average of discouraged workers through the first eight months of 2012 at 906,000, which was greater than the comparable 2013 eight-month average of 874,000. By email, bureau economist Steve Haugen agreed that the agency’s quantifications of "discouraged workers" are often cited to tally people who have given up looking for work. Labor force participation on slide Alternatively, Haugen wrote, one could look at changes in the nation’s labor-force participation rate, meaning the proportion of the civilian adult population either working or actively looking for work. That fell sharply during the recession, Haugen said, and "has continued to decline" even as the economy recovers. "The latest monthly figures suggest that the participation rate has continued to drift down over the past year," Haugen wrote. Haugen added that while government survey results "generally don’t enable us to precisely answer the question as to whether all of the decline in participation can be ascribed to persons who have abandoned their job search," related research suggests "that weak labor market conditions have played a role, as have longer-term demographic factors, such as retiring baby boomers." He pointed out a July 2013 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston stating that participation in the nation’s labor force has largely been on the downslide since around 2000 and was projected to drop by another 2.2 percentage points between 2010 and 2020. In contrast, the paper says, if participation had held at the level of December 2007, then 6.2 million additional people would have been in the force in the first quarter of 2013. However, the paper does not say that the shrinking workforce is due only to the recession and slow recovery. Rather, it says, a "significant portion" of the decline is attributable to demographic changes. The bank analysis footnotes a BLS article published in January 2012 stating that through 2020, various factors will decrease the labor force participation rate. "The baby-boom generation’s exit from the prime-age workforce and entry into the older age groups will lower the overall labor force participation rate significantly," the article says, knocking down annual growth in the labor force to 0.7 percent. To be sure, most economists express worry about the decline in labor-force participation -- precisely, the share of Americans 16 or older who are working or who are actively looking for a job. The percentage for August 2013 was the lowest it had been since August 1978. If fewer people are working, that’s a potential drag on economic growth. Still, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., recently noted in connection with another fact check that labor-force participation changes have greatly been affected by large numbers of baby boomers retiring because they no longer want to work. And determining how much of the decline in labor-force participation has been due to the poor economy, as opposed to broader demographic trends, is tricky. PolitiFact noted news reports about the latest BLS employment report indicating that between July 2013 and August 2013, the economy created a net 169,000 additional jobs, while the size of the civilian labor force dropped by 312,000. (The civilian labor force refers to working-age people who are either employed or were unemployed but looking for work.) That supported House Speaker John Boehner’s comment that more Americans are leaving the workforce than finding jobs. However, the cited figures mixed numbers from different surveys not really producing apples-to-apples comparisons. Also, using the full labor force to gauge how many people are "leaving the workforce" isn’t perfect. Americans are aging; the leading edge of the baby boomers is turning 67. This means that every month, large numbers of Americans are retiring. Also, the labor-force rolls in Americans as young as age 16, and many Americans between that age and their early 20s aren’t part of the labor market because they are going to school. How much do these factors skew the numbers? It’s hard to say for sure, but in August 2013, just under 7 percent of the Americans categorized as "not in the labor force" were also categorized as "want a job now." The bulk of the remaining 93 percent were likely school- and retirement-age Americans. So, many non-workers aren’t people actively engaged in the job market. PolitiFact reached a better estimate by focusing on those who wanted a job in August 2013 in contrast to those said as much in August 2012. Upshot: The number of people not in the labor force but who wanted a job fell by 740,000 over that year-long period, while the number of people employed over the same period rose by more than 2.2 million--both favorable economic signals. A Texas take For our part, we turned to Texas A&M University research economist Luis Bernardo Torres who said by telephone that by the discouraged-workers’ metric, Cruz’s statement does not hold up. Separately, he agreed by email, a "drop in the labor force participation rate does not mean necessarily that less people are looking for work because some (have) retired, married, gone back to school, etc." Our ruling Cruz told senators: "Every month, we get the reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that say even more people have given up looking for work." Per the 12 latest months of data available before Cruz spoke, the number of Americans considered by the bureau to be "discouraged workers" fluctuates month to month, sometimes going up and sometimes going down. Separately, a years-long decline in the nation’s labor-force participation rate has significantly been affected by baby-boomer retirements, which by and large are not driven by the economy’s health. We rate this claim, which has a thread of truth but ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression, as Mostly False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03050	Says a man opted out of Obamacare after the marketplace launched on Oct. 1, 2013, and was informed he owed a $4,000 fine.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/04/facebook-posts/closer-look-facebook-post-mans-struggle-obamacare-/	Shortly after the the Obamacare insurance marketplace launched on Oct. 1, users of social media experienced a burst of complaints on Twitter and Facebook, ranging from technical glitches to substantive concerns. But for our readers, one post stood out. Many readers sent us a Facebook post that went viral and has since been circulated by chain-email. It was originally posted on the Facebook page of Healthcare.gov, the federal government’s portal to the new insurance marketplace created under President Barack Obama’s health care law. The marketplace is designed to offer one-stop shopping for health insurance plans for Americans whose employers do not offer coverage. The Facebook post claims to be from a man named Will Sheehan. (We couldn’t confirm his identity.) The post says that he tried to sign up for Obamacare and then decided to not go along with it; he then said he received an email detailing fines he would face. Here’s the full text of the post: "I actually made it through this morning at 8:00 A.M. I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 ‘Silver Plan’ and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I ‘opt-out’ and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the ‘REPERCUSSIONS PORTION’ for ‘non-payment’ of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with ‘Non-Payment’ and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy ‘Automatically withdraw’ your ‘penalties’ weekly, bi-weekly or monthly! This by no means is ‘Free’ or even ‘Affordable’." We will check a number of the post’s claims below. • "There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I ‘opt-out’ and chose to continue along with no insurance." According to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that runs the marketplace, this is not how the system works: "There's no way for people to complete the online application and then affirmatively ‘opt out’ at the end. They would simply close the website or not enroll in a plan." • "I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me" about the fines I would face. This is wrong on several levels. First, the system would not send any user an email if they failed to complete an application. Second, any fines would be calculated as part of the user’s overall income tax form 1040 -- they wouldn’t be sent as a bill. And third, any taxes would be owed by April 15, 2015 -- a year and a half from now. Someone being assessed a tax penalty by the Internal Revenue Service in early October doesn’t even make any sense, since the applicant has many weeks to find another insurance plan and avoid a penalty. • "My fine would be $4,037." This number is way out of line. Under the law, the penalty fee in 2014 is 1 percent of your yearly income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. The fee increases every year. In 2016 it is 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher. If we are to take this Facebook user’s claims at face value -- that his "income base was 45K-55K annually"-- and if he has no dependents, he would not have to pay any more than $550, by 2015. To pay a penalty of $4,037 in 2014, you would need to be making making more than $403,700 a year. • "Your drivers license will be suspended until paid." CMS told PolitiFact that nobody’s driver's license will be suspended as a noncompliance penalty under the Affordable Care Act. Nothing in the law mentions that as a penalty, and driver’s licenses are administered by state governments. • "If you go 24 consecutive months with ‘Non-Payment’ and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home." A Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the law specifically bars the IRS from using their normal means of collecting unpaid taxes, including the use of liens and levy.

pomt-11299	Says Sen. Jon Tester "took an income raise in the omnibus bill."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/20/matthew-rosendale/did-congress-vote-give-itself-pay-raise-year/	A Republican candidate for Montana’s U.S. Senate seat painted his opponent, Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, as a greedy Washington insider by claiming Tester voted to give himself a pay raise this year. Matt Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, said Tester’s compensation bump was part of the $1.3 trillion "omnibus" spending bill signed into law March 23. "If you send me to Washington, D.C.," Rosendale said, "no more will we have a senator who takes and votes against tax cuts for you, while he just took an income raise in the omnibus bill." Tester did indeed vote for this year’s Consolidated Appropriations Act, a spending package that funds everything from the military, to assistance for the nation’s opioid problem to border security. But Rosendale’s claim that Congress received a pay raise is flat wrong. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Montana state Auditor Matt Rosendale announces his bid for the U.S. Senate on July 31, 2017. (AP/Bobby Caina Calvan) How are lawmakers’ salaries determined? The Constitution requires Congress to determine its own salary. The Framers deemed in Article I, Section 6 that, "the Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law." In 1789, senators and representatives earned $6 a day for attending congressional sessions. But a law signed that year bumped senators’ pay up to $7 a day — the first congressional pay raise in American history. Fast forward about 200 years and you’ll find the last instance that Congress enacted specific legislation to change its pay. Since around 1989, pay has been determined by laws that use formulas to automatically adjust members’ wages. Here’s a snapshot of how members’ salaries changed over several years under a law that codified a pay adjustment formula: As the chart above shows, most senators and representatives earned an annual salary of $174,000 in 2009. That year is significant for another reason: it’s when Congress stopped giving itself raises. Yes, you read that correctly. Members’ salary levels were frozen in 2009. Lawmakers achieved this through a series of laws blocking their scheduled yearly adjustments. 2018 bill didn't include raise For Rosendale to be correct that Tester voted himself a raise, the 2018 omnibus would have to have resume Congress’ yearly pay bump. So, did it? Nope. The omnibus bill continues the pay freeze for the remainder of the year. As Section 7 of the bill states: As this Congressional Research Service chart notes, members’ salaries in 2018 is $174,000 — the same as it’s been since 2009. (There are exceptions for Speaker of the House, who makes $223,500, and the President pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, who make $193,400.) An aide to Rosendale said the candidate had been referring to the roughly $49 million increase in the Senate’s operating budget, as well as $12 million in salary increases for officers and other employees, which resulted from the omnibus spending bill. But Rosendale said Tester took an "income raise." It’s hard to imagine he was referring to anyone other than Tester. Our ruling Rosendale said Tester "took an income raise in the omnibus bill." Congress’ pay has been frozen at $174,000 per member since 2009. Under the omnibus spending bill, it remains frozen through 2018. Rosendale has no basis for his claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-15202	"F: The grade given to Florida for college affordability under Jeb Bush's leadership."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-tweets-florida-got-f-college-affor/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush (or at least their staffs) engaged in a snarky Twitter exchange shortly after Clinton gave a speech about college affordability. In the exchange, on Aug. 10, 2015, Clinton and Bush cheekily traded barbs about education policy. The original tweet, from Clinton’s camp, was straightforward, saying, "Cost won't be a barrier to an education. Debt won't hold you back. Read Hillary's plan: http://hrc.io/college." The Bush camp replied by tweaking the original visuals and saying, "100%: The increase in student debt under this Democratic White House." Then the Clinton camp shot back by "scribbling over" Bush’s graphic with the following claim: "F: The grade given to Florida for college affordability under Jeb Bush's leadership." It cited the the Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. So did Florida received an F for college affordability when Bush was governor from 1999 to 2007? There is some evidence to back this up, but Clinton's jab leaves out important context on the cost of Florida higher education during the Bush years. (We separately checked Bush’s claim about the increase in debt.) The claim comes from the Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, which shut its doors in 2010. The independent group, funded by philanthropies such as Pew Charitable Trusts and the Ford Foundation, graded states every two years on a variety of metrics for higher education. One was "affordability." In looking at this subject, the group sought to answer this question: "How difficult is it to pay for college in each state when family income, the cost of attending college, and student financial assistance are taken into account?" To do this, researchers considered such criteria as tuition for community colleges and public and private four-year colleges and universities; the degree of state investments in need-based financial aid; and the extent of student debt. For the year cited in Clinton’s tweet -- 2006 -- Florida did receive an F for affordability. And it wasn’t the only time: In 2004, the study also gave Florida an F. But Florida was hardly alone in flunking the affordability test. In 2006, the year the Clinton camp selected for the tweet, every state but seven received an F, and those "lucky" seven states didn’t do much better: Five ended up with a D while two got a C. The missing context from the tweet, then, is that Florida was not uniquely bad -- not by a longshot. Our own previous fact-checking concluded that while tuition went up under Bush, it did so at a rate slower than the national average. We found that Bush signed budgets in which the Legislature increased tuition substantially, but we also found that in-state, undergraduate tuition in Florida was still modest compared to to other states when Bush left office. Bush’s team cited several policies he helped institute on education: He put in place a First Generation Matching Grant for Floridians who are the first in their families to attend college; gave the Florida Student Assistance Grant Program a record 21.9 percent increase in 2006; and expanded the lottery-funded Bright Futures Medallion Scholarship program to cover 100 percent of community-college tuition fees. Still, the reports cannot be discounted entirely. Troy Miller, associate director for research and policy for the student advocacy group the Florida College Access Network, said the reports were important because they looked at whether state’s residents could typically afford the price tag of college in their state. "The way the authors evaluate affordability is valid, even if their grading scale is arbitrary," such as the fact that most states received an F, Miller said. Miller added that Florida may have suffered in the ratings because of the Bright Futures program, which was a merit-based program, not one that was need-based. The report points out "that Florida awards little state aid on the basis of need relative to other states," he said. Our ruling Clinton said that under Jeb Bush, Florida got an F for college affordability. The report on which her campaign is basing the claim confirms that in 2006 Florida received an F in this category. Still, it’s worth noting that 43 of the 50 states scored an F in 2006, meaning that Florida’s grade wasn’t uniquely bad. And while tuition did increase on Bush’s watch, the rate of increase was smaller than the national average. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-14T10:00:02	2015-08-10	['Jeb_Bush']

pomt-04131	Says "Detroit dumping a bunch of sewage" in Lake Erie "causes big problems" for Ohio.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/07/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-sewage-dumped-water-detroit-causi/	John Kasich is no Michigan fan. Ohio’s governor hinted as much when he spoke to reporters following an Ohio Farm Bureau speech on his administration’s new nutrient management plan to help the algae-infested Grand Lake Saint Marys. After praising farmers for their role in helping to try to stem the problems from agricultural runoff at Grand Lake Saint Marys, the Republican governor (and graduate of The Ohio State University) turned to the state shaped like a mitten, saying he was upset that waste from Detroit fouls the waters of Lake Erie. "We made great progress in Grand Saint Marys, and we are up in the Lake Erie watershed making sure we made great progress there," Kasich told reporters in Nov. 29 . "We have a problem with Detroit dumping a bunch of sewage in the lake that causes big problems..." But is the collective waste of Kid Rock and the other 700,000 Detroit residents being dumped into Lake Erie really "a big problem" as Kasich has stated? We strapped on our hip boots, and waded on in. Great Lakes experts are quick to point out that Lake Erie is particularly susceptible to pollution from farms, factories and humans because it is both the most shallow and most fish-filled of the five major lakes that that straddle the United States border with Canada. But amid the various contaminants, what emerges as the biggest threat to the health of the lake? The foremost expert on Lake Erie’s water quality is David Baker, the director emeritus of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidelberg College in Tiffin, who has studied the waters of Lake Erie for nearly 40 years. The biggest threat to the health of the lake has come from toxic blue green algae which has appeared in recent years — most noticeably in 2011— and can turn a thriving aquaculture into a marine dead zone, according to Baker. "I would say that the blue green algae is the biggest problem that affects the Lake and the health of the water," Baker said. "The bulk of the evidence—and the widespread scientific assessment — is that the dissolved phosphorus from agricultural runoff is the primary source of the problem." Agricultural runoff is funneled into Lake Erie when it washes away after fierce storms, and comes more from the Maumee River near Toledo than any other place, Baker said. And while Detroit does have a massive — and somewhat antiquated — wastewater treatment plant serving 76 communities that dumps sewage into the Lake, Baker said the algae problems did not come from Michigan. "We can look at pictures from satellite photos that show us this pretty clearly--we just don’t see big blooms of algae moving down the Detroit River," Baker said. A particularly dry spring 2012 — just a year after the worst algae blooms on record in Lake Erie — further proved this point as the blue-green algae blooms were mostly absent with no agricultural runoff after storms to feed it, according to Baker. "In a way, last year was a great experiment, and we got to see the Lake respond rather quickly to what the loading was from the agricultural watershed," Baker said. "We just did not see the widespread blue green algae blooms problem in 2012." Baker said that problems with waste from Detroit being dumped into the Lake Erie were "very minor" because the phosphorus loads from wastewater remain relatively constant over time and are relatively diluted compared to the agricultural runoff that can funnel in after a storm. "Things are always a little bit more complicated than what can be summarized by a governor," Baker said. Largely agreeing with Baker was Kristy Meyer, director of Agricultural and Clean Water Programs for the Ohio Environmental Council. Meyer said agricultural runoff is the top issue for Lake Erie, not waste from Michigan, because it accounts for nearly half the phosphorus dumped into the Lake. "It’s always nice to have a finger to point, and why not point the finger somewhere else?" Meyer said. She did say that both are "big problems" in her view. Backing the governor’s statement was Sandy Bihn, executive director of Lake Erie Waterkeeper Inc., a non-profit advocacy and education group focused on trying to improve Lake Erie’s water quality. Bihn said she agreed with the governor’s characterization that Detroit sewage was a big problem noting that thousands of tons of sewage sludge were dumped into the Detroit and Rouge Rivers in recent years. "What he said is a true statement," she said. "When five percent of the phosphorous is coming from one place, that is something we need to be focused on." Problems with sewage being dumped into Lake Erie from Michigan grew worse in the last several years when equipment began to degrade and Detroit’s government couldn’t afford to fix or replace it, Bihn said. She credited the Kasich administration with pressing Michigan officials for action on the issue of the phosphorus flowing from the wastewater treatment plant in Detroit. So where does that leave us? As he was talking to reporters about improving water quality at Grand Lake St. Marys, Kasich praised farmers for doing more to limit agricultural runoff. Turning to Lake Erie, Kasich blamed Michigan for "dumping sewage" into the Lake that causes "big problems." Kasich’s statement was partially accurate. Sewage from Detroit is being dumped into Lake Erie and it does certainly contribute to water quality problems in the Lake. But there are important details needed to fully understand the claim. Agricultural runoff is the biggest problem facing the shallowest of the Great Lakes as it causes toxic algae blooms, according to the foremost Lake Erie water quality expert. He called the impact of Detroit’s waste floating into the lake "very minor." Other Lake Erie water experts, though, seemed a bit more concerned about the impact of the Detroit waste in the overall mix. But by praising farmers for limiting pollution being dumped into waterways and then blaming Michigan in the next breath for wastewater from Detroit funneling into the Lake, Kasich’s claim downplayed the impact of agricultural runoff in the lake. That impact is an important detail needed to put the governor’s claim in context. On the Truth-O-Meter, the governor’s claim rates Half True.

pomt-10216	Palin "stopped the Bridge to Nowhere."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/08/john-mccain/a-bridge-to-exaggeration/	In the 10 days since Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was named John McCain's running mate, the McCain campaign has portrayed her final blow against the Bridge to Nowhere as a prime example of her opposition to wasteful spending and her willingness to challenge the status quo. "I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere," Palin said at the Republican National Convention. Now comes the McCain campaign with a new TV ad that makes the same claim, even more boldly. "She stopped the Bridge to Nowhere," the ad says, as the screen shows a photo of a stern-looking Palin superimposed on an aerial picture of blue water and islands. We've addressed the bridge claim twice before, giving her a Full Flop for having first supported the bridge before opposing it, and a Half True for her original "thanks-but-no-thanks" claim. But since the campaign is making an even stronger boast with this TV ad, we are going to address it separately here. First, we should point out that the ad is misleading because it appears to justify the claim with a newspaper article on the screen. "PALIN FLIES HIGH AS A REFORMER," says the headline from the Anchorage Daily News that scrolls onto the screen as the announcer says "she stopped the Bridge to Nowhere." We think many viewers will get the impression that the Anchorage Daily News article backs up the claim. But alas, it is TV ad sleight-of-hand. The article merely says she "ordered her administration to seek fewer congressional earmarks" after the bridge became a symbol of pork-barrel spending. There are no other details about the project or her role in ending it. The bridge, estimated to cost nearly $400-million, was to connect the city of Ketchikan (population 8,200) to Gravina, an island with just 50 residents but also an airport, and only accessible by a five-minute ferry ride. The project came into national prominence when Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that opposes wasteful spending, cited it as an extreme example of pork-barrel spending. The bridge's national notoriety was cemented with a Parade magazine cover story that ran Nov. 6, 2005, under the headline, "Are Your Tax Dollars Being Wasted?" The project also raised bitter debate in Congress, and several attempts were made to yank funding for the project. In the fall of 2005, Congress removed the language specifically directing money to the bridge, but it kept the funding in place and left it up to Alaska to decide which transportation projects the state would like to spend it on. (Alaskans could have built the Bridge to Nowhere, but they no longer were required to, as had previously been the case.) By the time Palin pulled the plug on the Gravina bridge project in September 2007, much of the federal funding for the bridge had already been diverted to other transportation projects. The bridge would cost $398-million, Palin said then, and Alaska was $329-million short. "Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398-million bridge is not the answer," Palin said. "Despite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329-million short of full funding for the bridge project, and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island." Lois Epstein, director of the Alaska Transportation Priorities Project, which opposed funding for the Gravina bridge, said while it's true that Palin formally put an end to the project, "It wasn't really a bold move when she did it." Although the project had local support in Ketchikan, Epstein said, it was not a popular project around the state. Had Palin decided to continue the bridge project, Epstein said, it would have required either a lot more federal funding — which clearly was no longer supported in Congress — or for the state to pick up the bulk of the tab, at the expense of other more urgent road projects. Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, believes Palin has "hyperinflated her role" in killing the project. "She put the final stake in the project," Ashdown said. "But there was already tremendous momentum for the project to be scrapped. She gets credit for saying that they were not to go forward with the bridge, but it was at death's door." So, no, Palin wasn't the only one who stopped the bridge. The project was facing nationwide opposition and the state, which could have built the bridge anyway, had already spent much of the money on higher priorities. Palin didn't kill it, she just performed the last rites. And the ad is misleading because it cites a newspaper article that doesn't provide any evidence that the boast is accurate. So we rate the claim in the ad to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08671	Jeff Weems' "legal record is one of defending BP, Enron and just about every big oil company against the working man."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/12/david-porter/david-porter-says-democrat-jeff-weems-has-record-l/	Republican David Porter, facing Democrat Jeff Weems for a seat on the state body that oversees oil and gas production, suggests voters beware of Weems, a Houston lawyer, before electing him to the Texas Railroad Commission. Porter consultant Corbin Casteel said in a July 28 press release: Weems "claims to represent the ‘working man,’ yet his legal record is one of defending BP, Enron and just about every big oil company against the working man." We wondered if it's accurate to cast Weems, who has practiced law since the early 1990s, as a defender of Big Oil--including BP, widely blamed for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, and Enron, the Houston-based energy company that collapsed in scandal. Casteel, responding to our request for back-up, forwarded research by Porter’s campaign drawing from Harris County court records and news reports. First, to the Enron and BP connections. Two personal-injury lawsuits filed against Enron, both from 1993, appear in Porter's list of about 50 "known civil court" cases involving Weems from September 1989 to late October 2009. Casteel said the campaign, satisfied that Weems represented Enron, didn't dive into the lawsuits' particulars. As far as BP, an April 2010 Bloomberg News article calls Weems an oil and gas lawyer who has represented BP in Texas courts. Weems later told the Austin American-Statesman: "I do a very specific set of litigation representing BP" representing the company in cases in the northern part of West Texas and in the Panhandle "when they get sued by wealthy royalty owners who want more royalties." Porter's campaign also pointed to a "news" item posted online by the law firm where Weems is a partner, Harrison, Bettis, Staff, McFarland & Weems, LLP. Headlined "BP Wins!," the undated item says that in the weeks immediately following Hurricane Ike, Weems and two other lawyers "traveled to Levelland, Texas to represent BP America Production Company at trial in a multi-million dollar royalty dispute. The plaintiff royalty owners initially sought damages of over $10 million. After a two-week trial, the judge signed a final judgment ordering that the plaintiffs take nothing from BP America Production Company and further ordering the plaintiffs to pay BP America Production Company’s court costs." When we asked Weems about the BP America lawsuits, he said his representation of the company doesn't sully him in any way. Noting that Porter owns stock in Exxon Mobil, Weems said in an interview: "Would he be sullied if that (BP) well that blew up in the Gulf was an Exxon well? I wouldn't level that charge." (According to Porter's personal financial statement filed with the state and posted online by the Texas Tribune, his wife--not Porter--owns 100 to 499 shares of stock in Exxon Mobil Corp.) Per the Enron cases, Weems said in an e-mail that he didn't recall them. He speculated they were small personal-injury cases that a partner in the law firm assigned to him. Weems said: "The bigger picture is that I am an oil and gas litigation attorney... When you are an oil and gas attorney, with oil and gas companies as clients, it follows that you represent oil and gas companies." Weems declined to provide a breakdown of his clients, saying such information was private. He said in an e-mail that some clients have been BP America Production Company, Amerada Hess, Southwestern Energy Production Company, Wapiti Energy LLC, JM Huber and numerous "small operators, working-interest owners, royalty owners and land owners." In its back-up materials, Porter's campaign quotes from the Martindale-Hubbell Legal Directory listing "representative clients" of the firm where Weems is a partner. The clients are: Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Baker Hughes Inc., BP America Production Company, Cameron International, Inc., COACH USA, Dollar General, El Paso Corp., General Electric, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Loomis Armored US, Inc., National Oilwell Varco, Oil States International, Inc., Republic Waste Services, Inc., Southwestern Energy Company, United Resources LP and Waste Management, Inc. After confirming the list from the directory, we called Weems' firm where attorney Mitch McFarland, a partner, said 10 of the 16 representative clients are heavily involved in the oil and gas business and that Weems has represented or might have had a hand in matters involving five: BP America Production Company, Cameron International, Inc., El Paso Corp., Southwestern Energy Company and Anadarko Petroleum Corp.--an investor in the BP well that blew up in the Gulf of Mexico. Would it be correct to say the law firm represents "big oil" (Porter's words) companies? McFarland replied: "In our firm we represent individuals and major corporations. All we do is litigation ... There's no politics in our discussions about clients. We work for clients who call on us and who are good fine upstanding citizens, both individuals and corporations." What constitutes a big oil company anyway? According to a Web post at oilprices.org, there are six "supermajor" oil companies in the world: ExxonMobil, rooted in the United States; Royal Dutch Shell; BP; Chevron Corp.; ConocoPhillips; and Total S.A., based in France. "If considered as a group, the Supermajors have control over almost 5 percent of the world's oil and natural gas reserves," according to the Web post. "The other 95 percent of the world's oil and gas reserves are under the control of state-owned national oil companies, most of which are in the Middle East." Casteel of Porter's campaign said the oil companies cited in the July critique of Weems wasn't limited to super-sized ones. "The intent of the comment was yes, indeed, he represents big companies like BP," Casteel said. What about the charge that Weems represents oil interests against the "working man," as Porter's camp puts it? "Most of the work Jeff has done for the firm," McFarland said, "involves companies and (against) royalty owners, (who are) hardly considered 'working men.'" In an earlier e-mail, Casteel took issue with Weems' reference to his opponents in court as "wealthy royalty owners." Casteel said three cases in which Weems defended BP were against non-profits and private universities including Wayland Baptist University, William Jewell College, the Plum Foundation and the Helen Jones Foundation, a non-profit organization for the fine arts, public schools and college students. McFarland said some of the cited foundations are quite wealthy. He said casting them as working folk is like calling the University of Texas small. So how does Porter's statement shake out? Weems, an oil and gas lawyer, has represented numerous energy companies including BP and Enron, the latter almost 20 years ago. However, Porter saying Weems has represented "just about every big oil company" is a stretch on Weems' actual legal record. Resolving whether Weems has battled working folk in court would entail a careful review of his cases. Porter hasn't done that, far as we can tell, nor do we have the resources to undertake it. We have to punt on this part. We rate Porter's statement Half True.	None	David Porter	None	None	None	2010-09-12T06:00:00	2010-07-28	['BP', 'Enron']

pomt-07480	"In the last decade, the average income of the bottom 90 percent of all working Americans actually declined. The top 1 percent saw their income rise by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/14/barack-obama/obama-says-incomes-increased-more-250000-top-1-per/	In his April 13, 2011, speech on his vision for America’s fiscal future, President Barack Obama made it clear that, although he agreed to an extension of the President George W. Bush tax cuts in a compromise deal at the end of 2010, he will resume his fight to end Bush's tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 a year. Obama justified his position, in part, on the following statistic: "In the last decade, the average income of the bottom 90 percent of all working Americans actually declined," Obama said. "The top 1 percent saw their income rise by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each." This turns out to be a controversial statistic, so we decided to check it out. According to the White House press office, Obama's statistic is based on an analysis of IRS data on pre-tax income by economists Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Emmanuel Saez at the University of California at Berkeley. According to their analysis, the inflation-adjusted average income for the bottom 90 percent fell by $1,170 between 2002 and 2008 (a 4 percent decrease); while the average income for those on the top 1 percent rose by $261,930 (a 30 percent increase). The Piketty-Saez analysis is widely cited in economic circles, but it is not without its detractors. One of the most frequent and vocal critics has been Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. In a phone interview, Reynolds said that the Piketty-Saez analysis looks at income before taxes, including capital gains, and excludes "transfer payments," such as social security and unemployment benefits. "That's a fairly problematic thing," Reynolds said, as it leaves out a lot of personal income such as refundable tax credits. "If you leave out transfer payments, you leave out a big part of the story." In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on Dec. 23, 2010, titled, "Taxes and the Top Percentile Myth," Reynolds argued the Piketty-Saez figures "tell us nothing about whether the top percentile pays too much or too little in income taxes." In a published response to Reynolds' criticism, Piketty and Saez countered that nothing in Reynolds' critique invalidated their findings and that Reynolds' arguments "contain serious misunderstandings on our academic work." We're not going to wade too deeply into the fray between groups of economists. But we thought it would be helpful to note some of the caveats and assumptions contained in Obama's claim and to point to some other independent data related to the subject of income distribution. For one, the U.S. Census Bureau provides survey data on mean household incomes, but the data does not allow for a clean analysis of Obama's claim. The census reports on the mean household income received by each fifth of the population (which means they don't look at the "bottom 90 percent"). It also doesn't have a large enough sample to break out the top 1 percent, though it does give data on the Top 5 percent. Between 2002 and and 2008 (which we are citing for the sake of consistency), mean incomes increased in all the fifths of the population (contrary to the Piketty-Saez analysis which found incomes dropped for the bottom 90 percent). The census data also shows that the mean income for the top 5 percent rose from $251,010 in 2002 to $295,388 in 2008. That's not as dramatic a picture as the one portrayed by Obama, but again, Obama talked about the top 1 percent, and the Census figures are for the top 5 percent. Piketty and Saez argue the disparities rise considerably as you narrow the window from the top 5 percent to the top 1 percent. In addition, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office presents average pre-tax and after-tax household income for just the top 1 percent, but only through 2007. According to the CBO report, after-tax household income for the top 1 percent went from $1,038,700 in 2000 to $730,500 in 2002, and then to $1,319,700 in 2007. The CBO does not provide 2008 data, where we would expect to see a significant dip due to the recession. In other words, the results depend greatly on which years you choose. In an analysis of the Piketty-Saez data by the left-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities, Hannah Shaw and Chad Stone acknowledged that "the IRS data used by Piketty and Saez have some limitations, one of the most important of which is that they do not include people who do not file income tax returns." In addition, they note, "neither Piketty-Saez nor Census adjusts incomes for family size, which can distort trends when average family size is changing over time." The CBO report does adjust for family size, they wrote, and so it "provides the most comprehensive analysis of income distribution, but is not as timely as the Piketty-Saez analysis" because it only goes to 2007 (pre-recession, which hit the wealthy hard). We'd like to point out one other issue. Obama framed his statistic as "in the last decade," yet his press office referred to analysis between 2002 and 2008. Decisions about what years to include or not include can make a big difference. When we asked Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, about the accuracy of Obama's claim, he looked at Piketty-Saez figures between 1998 and 2008 -- in other words, the latest data available for a full decade. "The estimates imply real average income (before taxes) fell 4.2 percent between 1998-2008 in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution," Burtless wrote in an e-mail. "In the same period they increased 17.7 percent ($136,344) in the top 1 percent of the income distribution between the same years." If you look instead at the period between 2000 and 2008, Burtless said, real average income (before taxes) fell 7.7 percent in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution, while it increased 3.4 percent in the top 1 percent of the income distribution between the same years. "This justifies the President’s statement on the direction of change in pre-tax incomes in the two groups, but I do not know how his staff calculated that the average income gain per person in the top 1 percent exceeded $250,000," Burtless said. It takes a careful selection of years (and not even a full decade at that), and a number of assumptions about income for Obama's statistic to hold up. We rate the president's claim Half True.

pomt-02447	"Our economy (in Louisiana) has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/27/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-says-louisianas-growth-has-outpaced-n/	Louisiana’s Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, attracted some media attention recently while attending an annual meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington. At a press event after meeting President Barack Obama with a bipartisan group of governors, Jindal said, "The Obama economy is now the minimum wage economy. I think we can do better than that." That prompted Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, to come to the microphone and call it a breach of the traditional bipartisan decorum for such events. Jindal, a potential Republican presidential candidate, hit the airwaves again two days later when he was interviewed on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Panelist Mike Barnicle asked Jindal to defend his own economic record: "The last time the Census Bureau checked the per capita income of Louisiana, you were 47th lowest in the United States, not all under your watch. What have you done, as governor, to bring in all these better paying jobs and boost your people's per capita income?" Jindal responded, "Well, the great thing is, we're doing exactly what the president has not. Cut taxes, reform debt, make some investment in workforce training, make it easier for businesses to create jobs. And here's the record. In Louisiana, we now have more people working, highest incomes in our state's history. Larger population than ever before. And the president can't say all those things about the country. Our economy has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession." We wondered whether it’s correct that Louisiana has "grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession." When we asked Jindal’s office for more detail, they said he had been comparing the growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product for his state and the nation since 2007 -- a year he chose because it was the "baseline" year before he began his first term as governor. We looked at the numbers and found that Jindal actually understated the comparison. Between 2007 and 2012 (the last year for which data is available), inflation-adjusted GDP grew by 2.5 percent nationally, but by 6.4 percent in Louisiana. This definitely supports Jindal’s claim. However, we’ll note a caveat: While the timespan Jindal used certainly makes sense given his tenure as governor, it’s not the only way to define "since the national recession" -- the words he used in the MSNBC interview. The recession officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. So if you want to look at the period "since the recession," one could just as easily use the range 2008-12, 2009-12 or 2010-12. So let’s look at how these date ranges stack up. For 2008-12, Jindal would also be correct. During that period, Louisiana growth (7.9 percent) easily outpaced United States growth (3.2 percent). But he’d be wrong for 2009-12, when United States growth (6.7 percent) exceeded Louisiana growth (4.6 percent). And he’d also be wrong for 2010-12, when the United States economy grew (4.1 percent) and the Louisiana economy actually shrank (by 1.2 percent). United States growth also exceeded Louisiana growth between 2011 and 2012 -- 2.5 percent to 1.5 percent. Perhaps an easier way to look at it is to compare the year-over-year growth in GDP for Louisiana and the United States. The more robust statistic for each year is listed in bold. 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 United States -0.7 -3.3 +2.4 +1.6 +2.5 Louisiana -1.4 +3.2 +5.8 -2.6 +1.5 If you look at it this way, the United States economy has grown faster (or shrunk less) in three of these years, compared to two years when the Louisiana economy did better, which undercuts Jindal’s claim. This doesn’t surprise John Francis, an economist at Louisiana Tech. "Louisiana's economy is highly dependent on the energy sector which, no matter where in the business cycle we lie, is always in demand," he said. "So, when the economy is in a recession, we tend to do better than average. When the economy is doing better, energy demand is somewhat higher, but not dramatically so. So when the economy is doing well, we lag behind the U.S. average. I suspect that we were doing better when the economy was in the heart of the Great Recession, but we have fallen behind as the overall economy has rebounded." However, Jindal’s camp draws the following analogy: In a football game between the "United States team" and the "Louisiana team," the winner would be the one who ended up with more points, not the one who won more quarters. "By any objective analysis, Louisiana has outperformed the national economy since January 2008," said Michael Reed, a spokesman for Jindal. Our ruling Jindal said, "Our economy (in Louisiana) has grown 50 percent faster than the national GDP, even since the national recession." The time frame Jindal’s office said he used -- from 2007 to 2012 -- is a reasonable one, and using that period does make his claim accurate. However, it’s worth remembering that taking one crack at the numbers can tell an incomplete story. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Bobby Jindal	None	None	None	2014-02-27T10:32:37	2014-02-26	['None']
pomt-11353	Rep. Robert Pittenger "stood against funding for the border wall."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/05/mark-harris/did-nc-republican-oppose-funding-border-wall/	The Republican primary in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District has become a race to the right. Ads by incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger greatly exaggerated his opponent’s short-lived opposition to Donald Trump before Trump became president. His opponent, Mark Harris, falsely accused Pittenger of being one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress. Now, Harris is criticizing Pittenger’s vote on a recent spending bill. "Robert Pittenger stood against funding for the border wall," Harris posted on his Facebook page. The post goes on to say that Pittenger and others "left our President out on an island. The vote on the spending bill that funded almost every liberal priority from the left, did NOT include the money requested by our President to build the wall on the southern border." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Harris is referring to a $1.3 trillion bill Congress passed on March 22 to fund the federal government and avoid a shutdown. The legislation, known as an omnibus bill, combines several issues into a single package. PolitiFact contacted the Harris campaign about their claim that Pittenger opposed funding for the border wall. Harris spokesman Jason Williams responded by email and referenced a March 2017 story where Pittenger is quoted saying he believes the wall is a euphemism. That means he thinks Trump’s use of the word "wall" alludes to broad efforts to secure the southern border — not necessarily a single barrier. Williams also pointed to a March 21 article in The Atlantic, in which anonymous sources are quoted saying that Trump is upset that the bill didn’t fully fund the wall. "There are a number of articles that report the President’s dismay over lack of funding for the border wall," Williams wrote. "There is some funding for some fencing and some border security, but not the actual construction of the wall itself." Pittenger, for his part, said "as Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, I have always been in favor of building a wall and securing our porous southern border," he said in a statement. "The FY2018 omnibus and earlier legislation I supported clearly provides funding to begin construction, and President Trump himself tweeted that ‘much can be done with the $1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall.’ Mark Harris cannot continue to have it both ways. Either he supports President Trump, as I have done consistently with a 97 percent pro-Trump voting record, or he doesn't. The facts are very clear." What the bill funds The Harris campaign has a point about what the bill funds. As PolitiFact recently noted, the bill provides funding for projects that improve or replace fencing, but doesn’t fund any of the eight border wall prototypes ordered by the Trump administration. In total, the omnibus bill includes $1.5 billion for physical barriers and "associated technology" along the southwest border, according to a memo from Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. "This amount provides for more than 90 miles of ‘border wall system,’ going beyond the administration’s budget request for 74 miles" this fiscal year, Frelinghuysen wrote in the memo. The 2,232-page document specifies $251 million for 14 miles of "secondary fencing" along the southwest border near San Diego and a total of $641 million for border fencing near the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Even more specifically, the bill funds 33 miles of barriers in Hidalgo and Starr counties, the McAllen Monitor reported. In an interview with Fox News, House Speaker Paul Ryan elaborated on how the funding amount was determined. "Here is the deal on the border. We asked the border patrol: 'What do you need on the border?' What they tell us is, the conditions on the ground determine what kind of wall they want, different types in different places," Ryan said. "For instance, they want concrete barrier with a fence on top, with earth behind it in the Rio Grande Valley so it doesn't get washed away in floods," he continued. "In the desert they want a see-through wall, so they can see what is going on through it. So we do that." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Pittenger and the wall Harris’ broader argument is that Pittenger stood against Trump by not funding the wall to a level that Trump desired. However, Pittenger has been one of Trump’s most consistent supporters. Last July, Pittenger voted for a $790 billion spending bill that would’ve funded border security to the tune of $1.57 billion. (So did some of the same Republican Congressmen who described the recent bill’s $1.6 billion in border funding as too low) Pittenger again aligned himself with Trump on immigration as recently as last October. He said the first step toward immigration reform is securing the border. "This includes building a physical barrier along our porous southern border," Pittenger wrote in a column published by TheCharlotteWeekly.com. "Any attempt to fix immigration will fail without first stopping the flow of illegal immigrants." Pittenger has a record of supporting Trump and Trump’s agenda. So it’s disingenuous to say that Pittenger "stood against" funding for a border wall simply because he supported a bill that doesn’t fully fund the wall’s full construction – a bill which Trump, himself, wavered on. Trump and the bill Trump’s public stance on the bill wasn’t consistent. On March 21, Trump tweeted: "Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming." Later the same day, he again boasted on Twitter that he "had to fight for Military and start of Wall." Then, on March 23, Trump tweeted that he was considering vetoing the omnibus bill, "based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded." According to Vox, Trump’s demand for full-funding of the wall was a "last minute" request. The day before Trump tweeted his criticism of the bill, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the administration didn’t get everything it wanted in the bill. But, Mulvaney said, the bill included "more money than requested for technology and facilities" and that the White House was generally happy with the immigration provisions. "We asked for 74 miles worth of wall, we got 100," budget director Mick Mulvaney told Fox News. "Not exactly what we wanted, where we wanted. Congress chose to ignore some of the suggestions that [Customs and Border Protection] made on where the best kind of wall should go and that's unfortunate." Trump then signed the bill and promptly began touting funding for the wall, saying construction would start immediately after signing the bill. "We have a lot money coming to the border, and it will be coming over a period of time," Trump said. "We funded the initial down payment of $1.6 billion. We’re going to be starting work – literally – on Monday on not only some new wall ... but also fixing existing walls." On March 25, Trump tweeted, "Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!" Our ruling Harris said Pittenger "stood against funding for the border wall." Harris bases this claim on the idea that Trump wanted more money for the wall than Pittenger and other Republicans ultimately gave him. But just because Pittenger voted for a bill that doesn’t fully fund the wall doesn’t mean he stood against funding or doesn’t support the idea. PolitiFact found no evidence that Pittenger worked to block wall funding, so we rate this claim False.

pomt-09193	Sen. Barbara Boxer "passed only three bills in 18 years" into law.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/28/carly-fiorina/hot-air-movie-not-accurate-boxers-laws/	It's one of the weirdest political ads we've seen this year: "Hot Air: The Movie." It shows an animated Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., at a committee hearing in Congress. Her head starts expanding and expanding until it floats off into air, pulling Boxer from her chair and bursting through the Capitol dome. Then Boxer turns into a large blimp with loudspeakers on top and TV screens around the bottom, floating over the California landscape, broadcasting inanities. (No, we're not making this up. See the ad for yourself.) A creepily cheerful narrator says: "Soon her elitist self-image grew so that it overwhelmed the capital and drifted west ... westward, to tell us all how to live our lives ..." At seven and half minutes, the video runs too long to be a TV ad and is clearly aimed at an online audience. At about the halfway mark (after the senator-blimp has floated over what appears to be the L.A. skyline), the ad introduces Republican Carly Fiorina as a better alternative and a "successful leader." We decided to check one of the ad's more concrete criticisms of Boxer: That she's "passed only three bills in 18 years" into law. "One named a local courthouse. One named part of a river -- in Virginia. And the third brought California some money to retrofit bridges. Three bills," the narrator said. Following our standard practice, we contacted the Fiorina campaign for back-up. They told us they were counting only bills passed into law where Boxer was listed as the primary sponsor. But they also told us since the ad was made, they ran across two other bills, so the actual number they found was five. They contrasted this unfavorably with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who they said was the primary sponsor on 14 bills that became law. Of Boxer's legislation, the ad mentions a 1994 law that funded bridge retrofits; a 2007 law to name a U.S. courthouse in Fresno, Calif., the "Robert E. Coyle United States Courthouse; and a 2008 law to designate a portion of the Rappahannock River in Virginia as the "John W. Warner Rapids." The other two laws are a 2004 measure to provide for "the development of a national plan for the control and management of Sudden Oak Death, a tree disease caused by the fungus-like pathogen Phytophthora ramorum," and a 2009 law to re-name a San Diego post office as the "Cesar E. Chavez Post Office." (We verified that both passed.) But Fiorina's narrow accounting is misleading because it ignores the collaborative way that bills become law. Any single bill that lists a single senator as author is often the collective work of many senators. In some cases, entire bills become amendments to other bills that pass. We found that Boxer co-sponsored at least 72 bills since 1995. A good number of these were for less significant resolutions or post office namings. But some were more prominent pieces of legislation, such as the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act, which removed barriers so women can sue for gender-based pay discrimination, and the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights Act of 2008, which aimed to reduce counterfeiting and piracy of intellectual property. "It's the nature of the process that everybody participates," said Senate historian Donald A. Ritchie. "No one writes a bill all on their own with no other input." In the case of particular bills, it's often possible to piece together which senators contributed to a piece of legislation through research and reporting. But there's no standardized way to count meaningful contributions on a broad scale. "There is no good, strong, objective, consistent way to measure productivity as a legislator," said Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The statement in the Fiorina ad is "meaningless," he said. "It doesn't matter whether it's narrowly, factually accurate. It has nothing to do with Boxer's record as a legislator," he said. Ornstein also pointed out that Boxer is chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, so she's steered important legislation on energy and offshore drilling. Committee chairs don't always author the original legislation themselves, but they play a critical role by greenlighting bills they support and stopping bills they oppose. Boxer has used that power to advance her legislative agenda, Ornstein said. The Boxer campaign said she has contributed to several pieces of legislation that she didn't directly sponsor. She co-authored a successful amendment that permitted companies to claim a one-time tax reduction on profits made overseas if money is invested into the domestic American economy. They said she also contributed to laws that protected California wilderness areas, funded after-school programs, and set rules for 401(k) plans limiting how much employers could force employees to hold in company stock. We looked into a few different accounts of Boxer's legislative accomplishments. CQ's Politics in America 2008 edition noted that she had "pushed through" the tax change on overseas profits. It also said that she had "led efforts in 2001 to help communities deal with abandoned industrial sites." However, the 2010 edition said that "Getting major legislation passed has not been the trademark of Boxer's career," and noted the bridge retrofits bill. But it also said that she is very active in promoting environmental issues and has been a longtime proponent of "cap and trade" legislation to address carbon emissions and climate change. Such legislation is still pending in Congress and has yet to become law. In ruling on the statement in the "Hot Air" ad, we find a lot lacking. The Fiorina ad said that Boxer "passed only three bills in 18 years" into law. But now even the Fiorina campaign admits that number is wrong -- there are five. And more importantly, experts on Congress say the Fiorina campaign's methodology is a misleading way of assessing a senator's legislative accomplishments. The Fiorina campaign could still make a case that Boxer is not an effective legislator, but the campaign has failed to do it here. Using the count of bills authored is simplistic and doesn't reflect the reality of the legislative process. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04442	Says that Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/12/national-education-association/nea-says-josh-mandel-voted-let-insurance-companies/	Members of the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, teach all kinds of students. Some have autism, a disorder of brain development, and special education teachers are trained to deal with their social behavior and communication issues. Daria Denoia, a teacher in Columbus, Ohio, is one such teacher. She was featured in a recent commercial sponsored by the NEA Fund for Children and Public Education sponsored by the NEA Fund for Children and Public Education, a political action committee, as part of the union’s campaign against Josh Mandel’s election to the U.S. Senate. Mandel, a Republican, is Ohio’s treasurer but hopes to replace Democrat Sherrod Brown in the Senate. It is no surprise that the NEA takes sides in political races, especially considering recent tensions between public employees and state officials over collective bargaining rights. But something that the teacher said in the anti-Mandel commercial stood out -- a new and measurable charge in a race in which many other other issues are litigated over and over. Denoia said, "I read that Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism." This was actually the second claim in the teachers union ad. The first was that "I heard that Josh Mandel wants to allow insurance companies to deny medical coverage for pre-existing medical conditions." Mandel unquestionably supports repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which says that starting in 2014 insurers may not deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. Mandel says other portions of the act, including fines on employers who do not provide health coverage, could harm the economy. Since issuing a statement in June saying the law should be fully repealed, Mandel has said in interviews that he would support keeping some provisions, including the one on pre-existing conditions. Exactly how that would work is not known. Covering people with high health care expenses could drive up insurance costs, insurers say, unless nearly every American, healthy or sick, is required to have insurance and spread the financial risk. That very mandate is the cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. There could be other ways to block denial, including expanding state-based high-risk pools (which have their own cost issues) or passing reforms in less-divisive existing laws, conservative groups say. Could they work, or is this all just a political sop, as Democrats suggest? That is speculative. The NEA has made a claim based on what Mandel says he opposes but not on Mandel’s later statement of intent. He opposes the current law but says he could support something else to take care of pre-existing conditions. Since the form of that "something else" is not yet set and we cannot measure intent on a true-false spectrum, we cannot rate this claim by the NEA. But what about the claim that Mandel voted to deny autism coverage? Mandel has, in fact, voted on autism coverage. He was in the Ohio General Assembly at the time. A 2009 state bill would have mandated that health insurers cover autism. The bill, backed by autism-care groups, passed the Ohio House but never got out of the Ohio Senate. Mandel, in the House, was among the minority voting no. According to news coverage, opponents said they worried the mandate would drive up premiums, which small employers could not afford. This was also the view of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which lobbied against the bill. Yet the bill contained controls against excessive costs. According to the bill language and a related analysis we read from the Ohio Legislative Service Commission, the legislation stipulated that any company could opt out of the coverage requirement if it could show this mandate drove up its insurance costs by 1 percent or more. Mandel’s campaign communications director, Travis Considine, acknowledged Mandel’s "no" vote. But he pointed us to an amendment that Mandel supported before voting against the final bill. Intended to help control costs, the amendment would have required an attending psychologist or physician to develop a treatment plan for each autism patient using insurance, and to limit mandatory autism coverage to $36,000 a year, according to the bill language and a legislative summary. The amendment also would allow insurers to request reviews of treatment every six months. The amendment passed unanimously and its requirements were included in the final bill. That final bill had 57 "yes" votes and 39 votes of no, including Mandel’s, before moving the state Senate, where it died. The support group Autism Speaks says it expects a new version to emerge in Columbus soon. Considine also told us that in a separate matter, Mandel voted for state legislation providing money for a special education scholarship program. Special education students sometimes transfer out of their local schools and attend alternative programs to get the individualized attention their parents want for them. The scholarships are similar to vouchers, reducing parents’ costs, and have been popular among families with autistic children. This may help show that Mandel is not heartless. But it does not change the accuracy of the NEA claim that Mandel "voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism." The point of the commercial, in fact, comes in Denoia’s final line: "Ohio needs a senator who will stand up to the insurance companies..." Two points are worth mentioning. First, the NEA couched its claim with the teacher saying, "I read that Josh Mandel voted to let insurance companies deny coverage for autism." (Italics added for emphasis.) Some ad campaigns use similar words to get a little wiggle room if their accuracy is challenged. Hey, the teacher is only saying what she read. But in this case, no couching was necessary. The teacher’s reading comprehension was good. Second, as a point of semantics, Mandel did not actually vote to deny autism coverage; it was already denied by many insurers. But he voted against requiring coverage, which has the same effect as voting to allow insurers to deny it. That’s additional information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, the NEA’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	National Education Association	None	None	None	2012-10-12T06:00:00	2012-09-27	['Josh_Mandel']
pomt-12500	"The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/donald-trump/did-trade-deficit-cause-slow-growth-2016-donald-tr/	In an early-morning tweet, President Donald Trump took a not-so-veiled shot at his predecessor’s economic record. "The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly," Trump tweeted on April 26, 2017: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com We’ll look at the gross domestic product number first, then look at whether there is any linkage between a large trade deficit and weak economic growth. Slow GDP growth To check the growth in gross domestic product, we turned to the official data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Specifically, we looked at the year-over-year increase in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product. According to the final revision released on March 30, inflation-adjusted GDP increased by 1.6 percent between 2015 and 2016. How does that compare to previous years? As Trump said in his tweet, it is the lowest annual increase since the change between 2010 and 2011, when the year-to-year increase was also 1.6 percent. Here’s the annual change in GDP going back to 2000: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We should note, as we typically do with statements like this, that no president deserves full credit or blame for economic performance on their watch, because no president is powerful enough to singlehandedly shape the economy. Other forces, from technological advances to developments overseas, can have significant effects. Also, reasonable people can disagree about how good or bad 1.6 percent annual growth is. An advanced industrialized nation like the United States is not going to see high annual growth rates typical of developing countries. When the GDP numbers were announced in January, Beata Caranci, chief economist at TD Economics, told the Washington Post, "I know most people say ‘Oh, 2 percent isn’t that great,’ but in the current world it is. Many countries would be envious." What impact from the trade deficit? Contrary to the implication of Trump’s tweet, there is little direct relationship between a big trade deficit and weak GDP growth, at least for the situation the United States is in now. Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, took issue with Trump’s implication, saying that a trade deficit is mainly a reflection of underlying patterns of savings and consumption in the economy. For instance, she said, following a tax cut, the economy may be stimulated and the dollar will often become stronger relative to other currencies. That makes U.S. imports more expensive and imports cheaper. So Americans with newly flush wallets would tend to purchase more imports and fewer domestic goods than they ordinarily would, thus increasing the trade deficit. If the economy is operating below capacity -- generally defined as high unemployment -- then policies to reduce the trade deficit would tend to increase domestic production and employment, helping the economy, said I. M. 'Mac' Destler, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and author of the book, American Trade Politics. But if the United States is not in a below-capacity situation -- and it is not currently -- "then reducing the trade deficit, with increased demand for U.S. production, would lead to overheating the economy, inflation, and not much improvement in net welfare for Americans," Destler said. We will also note that Trump’s linkage between a high trade deficit and low GDP growth is undercut by recent data. The reality is that the United States’ trade deficit has been substantial for years, through periods of both faster and slower GDP growth. Here’s a chart showing the size of the annual trade deficit going back to 2000, the same period covered by the chart of GDP growth above. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com If anything, pairing the two charts shows that two of the years with a relatively small trade deficit -- 2001 and 2009 -- were two of the three weakest years for GDP growth during that time span. "The United States has had persistent trade deficits since the early 1980s," de Bolle said. "Between then and now, we've had recessions, and episodes of higher growth, all of them accompanied by trade/current account deficits. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that trade deficits led to weak GDP growth in 2016, based on historical data." Our ruling Trump said, "The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016). GDP up only 1.6%. Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly." Trump is right that GDP growth was slower in 2016 than in any year since 2011. But there’s little evidence to suggest that growth was sluggish in 2016 because of the trade deficit. A sizable trade deficit has been a fact of life for at least two decades, including years of both faster and slower economic growth. If anything, two recent years of smaller trade deficits actually coincided with weak economic growth. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-06522	Says Rick Perry "supported a guest worker program to help people who would otherwise be illegal aliens."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/10/libertarian-national-committee/libertarian-leader-says-texas-gov-rick-perry-backe/	The Libertarian Party has a message for Rick Perry: The country needs a president who will defend liberty, and it’s not you. In a video posted on the party's website, Wes Benedict, executive director of the Libertarian National Committee, gives five examples of why he won't be voting for Perry, including the Texas governor's 2007 executive order, later blocked by the Legislature, that girls be vaccinated against a virus that can cause cervical cancer. Yet Benedict, who suggested we take a look at the video, also notes one area on which to compliment Perry: immigration. "Libertarians like me embrace immigration and welcome people from Mexico and the rest of the world who seek a better life and the blessings of liberty," said Benedict, who used to live in Texas. "Compared to most Republicans, you have been pretty open to immigration. I credit you for being friendly to our southern neighbors. Rick Perry, I support amnesty, and I think you do too. You supported a guest worker program to help people who would otherwise be illegal aliens." Immigration has been a tough subject for Perry since he entered the Republican presidential contest in August. Fellow candidate Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, has criticized Perry’s continued support for a Texas law allowing some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. As has presidential hopeful Rick Santorum, who has publicly disagreed with Perry’s position that building a fence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border doesn't make sense. In response, Perry has cited Texas policies that he says show he is tough on immigration, including the spending of millions of dollars on border security while he has been governor. Given that Benedict opined that Perry supports amnesty, we're not treating that characterization as a factual claim. Broadly, "amnesty" for undocumented workers is a politically charged term that PolitiFact Georgia has analyzed. In this fact-check, we're focusing on whether Perry has supported a guest worker program. Bluntly, it looks like Benedict got this right, though we found no sign that Perry has spoken in favor of such a program since 2007. Asked for backup information, Benedict pointed us to a Dec. 7, 2006, Associated Press news article about a speech that Perry gave the day before to the Texas Border Coalition, which consists of border region mayors, county judges and economic development advocates. In the speech, according to the text of Perry’s remarks, he touched on several border-related topics — and criticized Washington's security efforts, including the border fence Congress approved earlier that year. "Strategic fencing in certain urban areas to direct the flow of traffic makes sense, but building a wall across the entire border is a preposterous idea," Perry said. Next, he turned to the subject of migrant workers. "Washington needs to seek real solutions that protect our economy, that take migrant workers out of the shadows by giving then an ID and allowing them to cross freely, and that at the same time recognizes the rule of law and the importance of not rewarding those who break our laws," Perry said. He then called for the creation of a guest worker program "that takes those workers off the black market and that legitimizes their economic contributions without doing the same for their citizenship." "I would rather know who it is that crosses our border legally to work than not know who it is that crosses our border illegally to work," Perry said. According to the AP story, Perry later told reporters that workers already in the country illegally should be given "an expanded period of time in which to come to register" for a guest worker program. In a review of Perry's speeches and public statements, we found seven other times from 2003 through 2007 that Perry touted the idea of a new federal guest worker program. In nearly every one, Perry also called for stepped-up border security. In some cases, he said a guest worker program could not "succeed" unless the security efforts happened first. In November 2003 remarks at a luncheon for Vicente Fox, then the president of Mexico, Perry said: "Let me say something about the migrant workers who cross our border to work. They provide a real value to our economy, and Texas benefits from the contributions they make. I will support reforms to our guest worker laws that allow migrant workers to contribute to our economy so long as the security of our border is in no way compromised." The following year, Perry’s office issued a news release the same day that then-President George W. Bush gave a speech calling for an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws and the creation of a temporary-worker program that would "match willing foreign workers with willing American employers when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs." Perry’s Jan. 7, 2004, statement recapped his comments on guest worker programs at the Fox luncheon and said Bush’s proposal "reflects" Perry's desire for a program that "balances" the economic realities of Mexico and the United States with the need for homeland security. If Bush's proposal had become law, foreign workers applying from their home countries and people already working here illegally would have been eligible for the temporary-worker program, which would have offered legal status for three years and the possibility of extensions. The latest instance we found of Perry expressing support for a new guest worker program was in his 2007 State of the State address to Texas lawmakers, in which he said "the best way to crack down on illegal hiring practices is for Congress to finally pass a guest worker program." Such a program, Perry said, would recognize the contributions of foreign workers and capture "their income in our tax system, ensuring they contribute to the public services we provide them." We asked Perry's office whether he still thinks a new guest worker program is a good idea. A spokeswoman replied by email: "The governor believes that our nation cannot have effective immigration reform without first securing the border. This must be our nation's priority. Once the borders are secure, then a discussion can be had about fixing our broken immigration system. Until then, it’s a moot point." Our ruling Perry has voiced support for giving temporary legal status to laborers who aren't authorized to enter the United States, including some immigrants already working here illegally. Still, Perry apparently hasn't spoken in favor of a guest worker program for years. Benedict's statement ignores that fact. So we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00815	"Since President Obama took office in January 2009, the federal government has issued more than 468,500 pages of regulations."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/mar/30/dave-brat/dave-brat-says-obama-has-issued-468500-pages-regul/	U.S. Rep. Dave Brat says President Barack Obama’s inauguration ushered in an era of sticky red tape. "Since President Obama took office in January 2009, the federal government has issued more than 468,500 pages of regulations," Brat, R-7th wrote in a March 17 statement heralding the release of a House GOP budget. Brat said the Republican plan takes aim at the "overwhelming amount" of rules enacted under Obama. We wondered if it’s true that the U.S. has issued nearly a half million pages of regulations since Obama took the oath on Jan. 20, 2009. Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Brat, told us the 468,500 figure comes from the GOP budget. The same page count also was cited in a Dec. 31, 2014 column in the Washington Examiner. The figure refers to the number of pages that were published in the Federal Register, a daily journal of the U.S. government that contains agency rules, proposed rules and public notices. Although rarely read by the general public, the Register is valuable to lawyers, lobbyists and policy wonks tracking the activities of agencies. In each edition, the Register posts a running tally of the pages printed so far the year. The final total at the end of December is often used as a gauge of regulatory activity during the year. Brat’s figure gives the total Register pages from Jan. 1, 2009 through Dec. 31, 2014. We tallied the total from the Jan. 20, 2009 start of Obama’s term through March 17, 2015, when Brat made his statement, and found there were 481,827 pages printed. So Brat slightly underestimated the volume under Obama. During the comparable period of former President George W. Bush’s term, the Register published 465,948 pages. But there’s a catch to these numbers. Many of these pages didn’t contain regulations. That’s because the Register also includes notices about agency meetings and public comment periods, presidential documents and other items that are not considered rules. Over the last 10 years, 58 percent of the Register’s pages have dealt with regulations, according to figures from the National Archives and Records Administration. Of almost 768,000 pages published during that span, 32 percent dealt with final regulations and 26 percent concerned proposed regulations. Overall Register page counts "may not be an accurate proxy for regulatory activity or measure of regulatory burden for several reasons," the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in November 2014 report. CRS noted that many of the pages "typically have little, if anything to do with federal regulations." And it said that many of the pages dealing with final rules don’t contain any regulatory language but rather record a "preamble" that has lengthy explanations about public comments on the rule. The CRS noted, for example, that a 2013 rule enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act filled 137 pages. But only 16 pages detailed the rule itself. Some rule changes are relatively routine, and some are temporary, CRS said. Any moves an agency makes to deregulate by eliminating a rule or streamlining it also have to be published in the Register. Cary Coglianese, a law professor and director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Register page count is often cited because it’s easy to find. "I wouldn’t use it as an indication of the level of regulation because it’s so prone to having so much else in it," Coglianese said. "The other thing to keep in mind is, just because you know something about the number of pages, (that) doesn’t tell you the wisdom of having those pages. It might be those pages are helping to save people’s lives or keeping banks from failing or airplanes from crashing." Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, is also leery of citing the page count, emailing us that it’s his "least favorite" way to measure regulation. Other analysts have written op-eds using the overall page count to give an idea of the country’s regulatory environment, including one from the conservative American Enterprise Institute and another from the Cato Institute. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact Virginia for a 2011 article that the annual page count "as a very broad measure" indicates more regulatory activity now compared to past years. Here’s some further insight: There have been an average of 6,113 final and proposed rules published each year during the first six years of Obama’s term compared to 6,536 during the same span in Bush’s term. The Government Accountability Office tracks the number of "major rules" enacted. These essentially are regulations that have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more. During the first six years of Obama’s term, 485 major regulations were published compared to 333 during the same time period under Bush. Our ruling Brat said under Obama, the federal government has issued an 468,500 pages of regulations. The congressman is referring to the number pages published in the Federal Register since 2009. While Brat is right on the page count, he omits important information. Many of those pages don’t concern regulations at all, but are simply notices, executive orders and statements from agencies discussing public comments about a planned rule. About 58 percent of the pages deal with proposed and final regulations. About 32 percent of the pages detail rules that were actually enacted by the White House. Those who believe Washington is too intrusive may be unswayed these distinctions, but it’s Brat who chooses to describe regulation in terms of pages and his eye-popping number overstates the sheer volume of rules Obama has put in place. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Dave Brat	None	None	None	2015-03-30T00:00:00	2015-03-17	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-14396	"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-guns-exceed-next-nine-categor/	In a speech posted on Medium, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun violence and minority youth. "Gun violence," she wrote, "is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined." We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014. Rank Cause of death Number of deaths Number gun-related 1st Homicide 2,416 2,256 2nd Unintentional injuries 1,135 47 3rd Suicide 448 230 4th Heart disease 172 -- 5th Cancer 161 -- 6th HIV 52 -- 7th Chronic lower respiratory diseases 47 -- 8th Congenital anomalies 38 -- 9th Anemia 33 -- 10th Diabetes 33 -- Total, 2nd through 9th place -- 2,119 -- So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think Clinton’s definition of "young" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, "Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined." As long as you define "young" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton’s statement is accurate, according to CDC data. We rate the statement True.

pomt-09647	"To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/08/mike-pence/pence-says-democrats-plan-spend-tarp-money-economi/	In a speech at the Brookings Institution on Dec. 8, 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a whole new batch of economic stimulus initiatives -- everything from tax breaks for small businesses to investments in roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. And Obama said the programs could largely be paid for with money realized by new forecasts that the cost of the bailout of financial institutions last fall, otherwise known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), will be $200 billion less than anticipated earlier this year. Some of that money would go toward reducing the deficit, Obama said, but some could offset the cost of the new programs. Many Republican leaders cried foul, saying any money unspent or paid back to the TARP program must go to pay down the national debt. U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, went one step further, saying Obama's plan would violate the law. "The TARP legislation actually rightly demanded that any money not used to purchase toxic assets in the bill be used to pay down the national debt," Pence said from the floor of the House on Dec. 8, 2009. "The legislation specifically says that any leftover TARP money goes to deficit reduction." "Let me be clear on this point," Pence added. "To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law, and it would betray the trust of the American people." Does the law really bar Congress from spending that TARP money on the kind of economic stimulus described by the president? Here's what the TARP legislation states in Section 106, Part D: "Revenues of, and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets purchased under this Act, or from the sale, exercise, or surrender of warrants or senior debt instruments acquired under section 113 shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt." But budget experts say there are ways Congress could get around that, legally. Congress could rescind the TARP money and then, in a separate action, use the savings to offset the stimulus, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "So technically, it would not be TARP money," Riedl said. "But in all honesty, it'd be a shell game to use what would have been used for TARP to offset these expansions of government. If they do it this way, I believe it would be legal, although it would definitely go against the spirit of the TARP program." Congress could also opt to simply change the TARP legislation it made last year, said James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at Heritage. But no matter how it's done, he said, to use money from TARP for economic stimulus would grow the national debt. "To say this is deficit-neutral is ignoring reality," Gattuso said. Legislators who proposed TARP never anticipated it'd lose all of the money. Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, assumes Congress would simply spend the new stimulus money as if the TARP program never existed. "The TARP money automatically reverts to the Treasury under the law," Baker said. "So when Obama says that he will use TARP money to pay down the deficit, he is just saying that he does not intend to violate the law. "Congress can of course vote to spend new money on anything it wants," Baker said. "If it votes to spend new money that it wants to call 'TARP money,' it is free to do so also. That seems to be what is going on here." For his part, Obama addressed the concerns about not putting the TARP money entirely toward direct debt reduction. "There are those who claim we have to choose between paying down our deficits on the one hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other," Obama said in his speech at Brookings. "This is a false choice. Ensuring that economic growth and job creation are strong and sustained is critical to ensuring that we are increasing revenues and decreasing spending on things like unemployment insurance so that our deficits will start coming down. At the same time, instilling confidence in our commitment to being fiscally prudent gives the private sector the confidence to make long-term investments in our people and in America." But our question is whether Congress can legally pull off what President Obama has proposed. Pence is correct that there is a provision in TARP that prohibits the government from directly spending TARP funds on some of the programs Obama outlined. But even conservative budget analysts say there are legislative ways for that money to be legally recycled back into federal coffers and then applied to economic stimulus projects. And so we rate Pence's statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8678f709-274e-47fc-a449-86cb41553c86	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-12-08T18:53:02	2009-12-08	['White_House', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program']
pomt-04486	Says she is a registered nurse.	false	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/07/laurie-monnes-anderson/laurie-monnes-anderson-registered-nurse/	State Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson, D-Gresham, is proud of her registered nursing credentials. She mentions it in campaign mailers, on her campaign website, on her legislative web page and in her official state Voters’ Guide statement, where she lists her occupation as "Registered Nurse and Senator." Monnes Anderson is defending her seat in District 25 against Republican Scott Hansen, also a resident of Gresham, but a dentist, not a registered nurse. The Leadership Fund, which is the campaigning arm of minority Senate Republicans and would love to pick up the seat, sent a press release this week to media with this bombshell: Monnes Anderson is not a registered nurse, as she claims. "Allowing her Registered Nurse's License to expire in 2009 is tragic," said Senate Republican Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, in the release. "Claiming the nurse's credential in the primary 2012 election may be excused as an oversight, but repeating the claim in the 2012 general election seems part of the pattern of disconnect typical of someone who has been in Salem too long. Voters in District 25 deserve better." Well, we don’t know what voters deserve, but we had to check this out for ourselves. Did Monnes Anderson, in fact, let her license lapse in 2009? And if so, does that negate her ability to call herself a registered nurse? We looked up Laurel Anderson in the nursing board’s online database, verified that her two-year license had expired in December 2009, and put in a call to the board to learn more about nursing licenses. Barbara Holtry, who handles press questions for the Oregon State Board of Nursing, explained that to get a license as a registered nurse, a person must meet education, examination, practice and English language requirements, and complete a background check. Licenses are good for two years. Renewal notices are sent about 6-8 weeks before the license expires. But here’s the critical takeaway from our conversation with Holtry. "The bottom line is: You need to have a license to be a registered nurse in the state of Oregon," Holtry said. Apparently, Monnes Anderson thought she was in compliance the entire time, until PolitiFact Oregon contacted Senate Democrats on Thursday to inquire. In an interview with us on Friday, she said she was in the process of preparing paperwork to submit to the board with her licensing application. Monnes Anderson, 66, is a retired public health nurse. "I truly believed that my license was current from 2009 on, and I’ve always gotten reminders to renew and when I get reminders I always renew," she said. (At this point, she will need to apply to reactivate her license. Renewals are allowed within 60 days of expiration.) We understand that people forget to renew their professional licenses, although it’s hard for us to fathom someone forgetting for three years. Monnes Anderson is not a registered nurse, per the Oregon State Board of Nursing. She was a registered nurse from July 1985 to December 2009 but cannot claim to have been one at the time she submitted Voters’ Guide statements for the primary election in May or for the general election in November. We rate the statement False, and note that her GOP opponent, Hansen, has an up-to-date professional license.	None	Laurie Monnes Anderson	None	None	None	2012-10-07T00:00:00	2012-08-30	['None']

pomt-01758	"We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/31/cory-gardner/cory-gardner-says-keystone-xl-pipeline-would-creat/	President Barack Obama’s indefinite delay of the Keystone XL pipeline has become a wedge issue between Democrats and Republicans as the midterm election season heats up. In the Colorado Senate race, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall recently voted against Congress fast-tracking the pipeline, but said the administration’s review process should continue. His likely Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, has called for swift approval, insisting it would be an economic boon to the state. In an interview on Univision Radio, a primarily Spanish-language station, Gardner accused Senate Democrats of holding up the pipeline to placate environmentalists in an election year. "The Keystone Pipeline would create good-paying jobs," Gardner said. "Not only where the pipeline is being built, good-paying construction jobs, but manufacturing and service opportunities in Colorado along with the Keystone Pipeline. We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built." The planned route for the pipeline, which would connect diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then Gulf Coast refineries, doesn’t go through Colorado. So we wondered if it was possible that "thousands" of jobs would be created by the pipeline there. We asked Gardner’s staff for the source of his claim. Spokesman Alex Siciliano pointed us to the written testimony of Gary Mar, who represented Alberta, Canada, in Washington and spoke at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing in February 2011. Mar cites a 2009 study from the Canadian Energy Research Institute that estimates over 15 years "the development of Alberta’s oil sands will boost U.S. GDP by an average of $31 billion per year, creating over 624,000 jobs in the U.S." We couldn’t find the original study, but a chart Mar appended to his testimony says Colorado would see 11,200 jobs between 2009 and 2025, about half of which would have come between 2011 and 2015. The chart, however, looks at the economic impact of the entire Alberta oil sands on the United States, not just the Keystone XL pipeline. In a subsequent 2011 study, the Canadian Energy Research Institute claimed job growth as a result of the oil sands could reach 600,000 in the United States, but only if existing pipelines were expanded and other projects came to fruition. A spokeswoman for the Canadian Energy Research Institute also said those numbers did not look at the economic benefits of the pipeline, but "only the benefits from upstream production of oil sands." Basically, it’s not measuring the benefit from the pipeline itself, rather the study estimates the effects of Canada being able to increase its capacity to produce oil. The study Siciliano showed us is also from 2009. As TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, told us previously, "The project has changed considerably since then, including substantial route changes and a new presidential permit application." TransCanada has stopped touting its own study on the the economic benefits of the pipeline from from the same time period, which estimated about 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, and another 118,000 spin-off jobs. Instead, in an email to PolitiFact this week, TransCanada pointed us to the State Department’s analysis of the project. According to that study, the Keystone XL pipeline would directly create the equivalent of 16,100 jobs if the project took one year. If the job lasted two years, the equivalent of 8,050 people would be employed over the course of the project. Of those jobs, 5,400 would be in states where the pipeline and support infrastructure will actually get built — Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The rest of those direct jobs would be created in other states. In all, about 42,100 jobs would be created over the course of the project — 30,000 of which would be outside the aforementioned four states. This includes jobs created directly by the pipeline (like the construction work), indirectly (like jobs created as a result of goods and services purchased by construction crews) and induced (jobs created by workers spending their wages in the economy). How many of those 30,000 temporary jobs would be in Colorado? It’s not clear from the State Department study, and a spokeswoman for the department said it wasn’t available. Ian Goodman, who co-authored a Cornell University study of the pipeline, said it’s unlikely that Colorado’s chunk of those 30,000 jobs would reach the thousands. Though Colorado could see some benefits from being in a state proximate to the pipeline, it is not expected to be a major supplier to the construction. "Most of these jobs would be in the states along the pipeline routing and most of the remainder would be in states heavily involved in the spin offs — pipeline supply chain and/or providing goods and services for Keystone XL workers," Goodman said. "Colorado is not likely to have a big roles in these spin-offs. So it is hard to see how Colorado could be getting thousands of jobs from Keystone XL." Goodman also said TransCanada has already spent about one-third of the pipeline's budget on engineering, design, permitting, and equipment and materials already procured and manufactured. That means that some jobs and economic development from that part of the project have already been realized. In a rosy scenario, Goodman estimated that at most 1,400 additional jobs could be created in Colorado, but more likely it will be less, perhaps closer to 500. As we’ve noted in the past, too, almost all of these jobs are not permanent, as is often the case with construction projects. The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation. Our ruling Gardner said, "We would create thousands of jobs in Colorado, if the Keystone Pipeline were to be built." Gardner based that statement off an old study that measured the overall impact of the Alberta oil sands on the U.S. economy, not the Keystone XL pipeline specifically. The State Department study cited by the company building the pipeline estimates that the equivalent of 30,000 direct, indirect and induced temporary jobs will be created in states outside the pipeline’s projected route. However, it doesn’t specify how many of those would be created in Colorado. We rate Gardner’s statement Mostly False.	None	Cory Gardner	None	None	None	2014-07-31T11:21:13	2014-07-28	['Colorado']

pomt-02721	"I’m ninth generation from New Hampshire."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/dec/20/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-his-family-roots-go-back-nine-gen/	Since he lost his Senate seat in Massachusetts, Republican Scott Brown has been keeping his options open for a potential run for office in New Hampshire. While he hasn’t filed to run for any office, he’s viewed as a potentially strong challenger to U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Speculation that he might run against Shaheen reached a fever pitch this week as news reports revealed he has a buyer for his home in Wrentham, Mass. and Brown confirmed he’s moving to New Hampshire. Brown has long owned a summer home in Rye, N.H. and he’s expected to renovate that house and make it his permanent residence. "Once we get settled, we will do what many other people have done upon moving into New Hampshire," Brown said in a statement released Thursday Dec. 19, 2013. "We will register to vote, get new licenses and enjoy the fact that there is no income or sales tax in New Hampshire." In his statement and in a series of speeches this year, Brown has played up his ties to the state. "I’m ninth-generation from New Hampshire," Brown told members of the Nashua Rotary Club in October. "My grandparents are buried, and my great-grandparents, right in Portsmouth cemetery. My mom, my sister, my aunts and my uncles, my nieces -- they all live in New Hampshire. I have a house in New Hampshire. New Hampshire’s a great state." Brown has repeated the claim about his ancestry several times, including in an interview with the New Hampshire Union Leader in October, and at a National Guard Association of New Hampshire state conference in Manchester in April. "I think it’s important to note that I do have ties to New Hampshire," Brown said, according to published reports. "Nine generations of ties to New Hampshire." Others have also made the claim on his behalf. Karl Rove wrote in the Wall Street Journal in May that Brown is a "ninth generation Granite Stater" and could wage a competitive race against Jeanne Shaheen. Discussing his move to NH this week, Brown acknowledged he has lived in Massachusetts for most of his life, but also cited his family roots in the Granite State. "For those who have read my book, you know that my first home was in New Hampshire," he said. "My family and I have long and strong ties to the Granite State that go back many generations." Not everyone is giving Brown a pass as a Granite Stater, however. At a GOP fundraiser in Nashua on Dec. 19, protesters from both the Republican and Democratic Party held signs labelling him a carpetbagger. "Brownbagger go home to Mass," a bright yellow sign read. Here at PolitiFact New Hampshire, we wondered whether his claim of longstanding New Hampshire heritage was true. So we decided to look into the former U.S. senator’s family history. Who’s "from" New Hampshire? Taken literally, Brown is claiming that eight generations of his family before him came from New Hampshire. But what it means to be "from" New Hampshire is open to interpretation. It’s clear that Brown has spent considerable time in the Granite State over the years. People who aren’t born in a state, but grew up there, often claim to be from that place. But here in New England, where family trees can often be traced back to the early colonists, there tends to be a more exacting standard. Put another way, the singer Ray Lamontagne was born in Nashua, N.H., but grew up in Utah and other parts of the country. He isn’t viewed as being "from" here. On the other hand, comedian Adam Sandler was born in New York and moved to Manchester, N.H. when he was five. He graduated from Central High School and his parents still live in the Queen City. Even though he now lives in Los Angeles, he is considered "from New Hampshire." We asked Brown to clarify his statement and discuss his family tree. In an email response, he thanked us for the inquiry, but refused to shed light on his familial claim. "If and when I decide to run for political office again, then I will be happy to make that information available to everyone," Brown wrote. We decided to look for ancestors in Scott Brown’s family tree who were either born in New Hampshire or developed significant ties to the state early in life. This provides some wiggle room to count ancestors who weren’t born in New Hampshire, but could fairly say they’re "from" the state. Tracing Brown’s roots There have been a few attempts to trace Brown’s family history. One of the most notable was conducted by the New England Historic Genealogical Society, which documented that Brown shares a common ancestor with President Barack Obama. A genealogist named Robert Battle also provided a thorough sketch of Brown’s ancestry online. This served as a jumping-off point for our own research, pointing us to some useful birth, death and marriage records, town histories and genealogy publications. In his autobiography, published in 2011, Brown wrote that he knows little about his father’s side of the family. His parents both married and divorced four times, and Brown’s relationship with his father, Claude Bruce Brown, was strained. Brown writes that his father likely grew up in Pennsylvania, and says that he doesn’t know much about his grandfather. "If you offered me a million dollars, I couldn't tell you anything about my father's father, not even his name," Brown wrote. For this reason, we didn’t consider him to be from New Hampshire and didn’t delve into Brown’s father’s side of the family. However, on his mother’s side of the family, Brown provides some useful details. His maternal grandfather, Philip Rugg, came from New Hampshire, growing up in Portsmouth. He moved to Cambridge, Mass. to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then became an electrical engineer working for Boston Edison. Brown’s grandmother, Bertha Louise (Coleman) Rugg hailed from Newington, and had ancestors who farmed in New Hampshire, according to Brown. Over the years, both grandparents were mentioned numerous times in The Portsmouth Herald, the daily newspaper covering the Seacoast area of New Hampshire and Maine. Their obituaries also provided the names of numerous relatives. Going back nine generations, we found that at least eight of Scott Brown’s ancestors resided in New Hampshire. One prominent branch of his family dates to 17th-century immigrant Francis Mathews, who sailed from Devonshire, England, to the area that became New Hampshire. Mathews bought land near the mouth of the Oyster River, which remained in the family’s possession for several generations. A burial ground known as Mathes Cemetery is located in the area, which is now called Durham Point. In their "History of the Town of Durham, New Hampshire," authors Everett S. Stackpole and Winthrop S. Meserve wrote that it is "doubtless" Mathews traveled to New Hampshire in 1634 as part of the colony established by Captain John Mason. Mason secured a grant to settle the area that became New Hampshire as an English colony in 1623, according to Wesley Balla, director of collections and exhibitions at the New Hampshire Historical Society. Mason coined the name "New Hampshire" for the territory, which included an arc of land stretching 60 miles inland from the Maine border, between the Merrimack and Piscataqua rivers. A map created around 1670 of the "Pascatway River" -- as it was known then -- shows the area where the Mathews family land was located, which would have been inside the boundaries of Mason’s New Hampshire colony. Scott Brown is related to the great-great-grandson of Francis Mathews, Valentine Mathes (a spelling used by many of his descendants), who was born around 1720, in the area that is now Durham. He died there in 1814. Another one of Brown’s ancestors -- Joshua Crommett -- became established in Durham around the same time. Crommett’s family arrived in Durham and Lee in the 17th century, and he served as a Durham selectman from 1765-1772. Brown is also linked with a pair of families who lived in Dover, N.H.: Samuel and Mary Varney, who married in 1736; and William and Hannah Hussey. Their children, Timothy Varney and Abigail Hussey, both wed in New Hampshire, but later relocated to Berwick, Maine. Brown’s own biography If you tally it up, it’s clear that Brown has ancestors who go back nine generations in New Hampshire. This is true of the Mathes and Crommett families. Their descendants can be traced living in the area of Durham, Portsmouth and Newington. But how should we characterize Brown’s relationship with the state? After all, he implicitly includes himself in that unbroken link of nine generations. The reality is that it’s more ambiguous whether Brown or his mother can accurately claim to be "from New Hampshire" themselves, since they spent large parts of their lives living outside of the state. Brown’s grandparents, Philip and Bertha Rugg, left New Hampshire long before his mother was born. They were living in Wakefield, Mass. at the time, and remained there until they were in their 60s. When he was touring the Portsmouth Herald newsroom in 1972, Philip Rugg told a reporter that he lived most of his life in Massachusetts. That also appears to be true of Scott Brown’s mother. Born Judith A. Rugg, she was delivered May 9, 1938 at the hospital in Melrose, Mass., which is now known as Melrose-Wakefield Hospital. Although she lives in New Hampshire now, Brown’s mother confirmed during an interview that she was born and raised in Massachusetts. Brown also documented this in his book, writing that his mother grew up in a family home on Eastern Avenue in Wakefield, Mass. Judith Rugg graduated from Wakefield High School in 1956, then went to work at an Oldsmobile dealership in town for about one year, according to an article published in The Portsmouth Herald. She was working as a hostess and cashier in Hampton Beach, N.H., when she met Brown’s father during the summer of 1957, at age 19. In his book, Brown wrote that his mother was working "in a restaurant along the thin slip of New Hampshire shoreline, with its clam chowder joints and seasonal souvenir stores." His father was stationed at the nearby Pease Air Force Base. The couple wed on Nov. 23, 1957, and moved into one of the rental homes near downtown Portsmouth owned by Brown’s grandfather. Scott Brown was a New Hampshire resident at birth. He was born at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, just over the New Hampshire border, on Sept. 12, 1959. Brown spent the early months of his life in New Hampshire, but was younger than one year old when his parents split up. According to Brown’s book, his mother left Claude Bruce Brown and relocated to Wakefield, Mass. when she began to suspect he was breaking their marriage vows. Scott Brown and his mother lived in Massachusetts for the remainder of his childhood, moving around to 17 homes by the time he was 18. They lived for a time with his grandparents on Eastern Avenue, but left within a year or two and moved into the first of "many anonymous places" Brown and his mother would live, according to Brown’s book. They were living on Avon Street in Wakefield when Brown's mother met her second husband, Dan Sullivan. The family moved to Revere, Mass., but returned to Wakefield by the time Brown was entering junior high school. Brown devoted his time to athletics, playing basketball at Wakefield High School, from which he graduated in 1977. He went on to study Tufts University in Massachusetts, graduating in 1981, and earned a degree from Boston College Law School in 1985. Brown's grandparents eventually left Wakefield and returned to Portsmouth, and his visits with them became less frequent, according to his book. Meanwhile, Brown's biological father lived in Newburyport, Mass., where he remarried and would eventually become a town official. Judith Brown moved back to New Hampshire several years ago, although it’s not clear exactly when. A trust in her name has owned the home in Hampton where she resides since 2004. Our ruling Brown said he is "ninth generation from New Hampshire." For the most part, this is true: Brown’s New Hampshire lineage connects his grandmother to some of the region’s earliest European inhabitants. In fact, one of Brown’s ancestors, Francis Mathews, came to the New World in 1634 specifically to help settle the territory that became New Hampshire. But this isn’t the only relevant fact to consider. Brown’s statement can also be interpreted to mean that Brown counts himself as part of an unbroken line of ancestors who are "from" New Hampshire. It’s clear that Brown and his mother spent much of their lives in Massachusetts. The family connection to New Hampshire weakened after the birth of Brown’s grandmother, Bertha Rugg, who moved to Massachusetts and raised her daughter -- Brown’s mother -- in the Bay State. Brown himself stated in a press release sent this week that "I have lived in Massachusetts for most of my life," and his trademark pickup truck parked outside a GOP fundraiser in Nashua on Dec. 19 still had Massachusetts license plates. Bottom line: It’s clear that New Hampshire is the ancestral home of many of Brown’s relatives, but it’s a stretch to say that Brown and his mother are "from New Hampshire." The statement is partially accurate, so we rate his claim Half True.	None	Scott Brown	None	None	None	2013-12-20T16:42:26	2013-10-28	['None']
pomt-08829	"The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/12/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-illegal-immigration-declining/	After criticizing conservative blogs and Republican lawmakers for perpetuating false facts, Rachel Maddow made an interesting claim on her show on Monday, August 2, 2010. Maddow said that Republicans consistently distort immigration issues to stir up their base during an election cycle. "Illegal immigration always has to be refashioned into a crisis for every electoral cycle that Republicans want to use it," said Maddow. "The overall fact about illegal immigration is that it's not actually getting worse." Maddow then showed a graph of apprehension rates of illegal immigrants from 1978 to 2008 that showed that the rate in 2008 was the lowest in years. We were curious to see if Maddow was right in saying that illegal immigration is not getting worse. The graph that Maddow displayed on the show was from a fact sheet published by the Department of Homeland Security. The graph displays border apprehensions by year. There is no way to know exactly how many people illegally cross the U.S. border every year, but "apprehensions seem to be an indicator of inflows of undocumented Mexicans" crossing the border illegally, according to Jeff Passel, a senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center. According to the DHS fact sheet, "the number of apprehensions made by the Border Patrol declined for the third year in a row to 724,000 in 2008 after reaching a mid-decade peak of 1,189,000 in 2005." However, some immigration experts do not consider apprehension rates to be particularly useful. Although the apprehension rate is usually a good indicator of trends, it is not exact, according to Bryan Griffith, a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in favor of increased border enforcement. "Just because the apprehension rate is down, doesn't mean less people are trying to come. It could mean they're getting better" at not getting caught. Maddow decided to use apprehension statistics to make her point about illegal immigration. However, illegal immigration is about more than illegal border crossings. "Focusing on the number of people crossing the border alone is just inaccurate," said Jim Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Apprehension rates are useful, "but don't tell you the whole story." For instance, it is estimated that as many as 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. entered legally, but overstayed their visas. The whole story is better reflected in the total estimated population of illegal immigrants in the United States. Using monthly Census data, the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that "the illegal population declined 13.7 percent (1.7 million) from a peak of 12.5 million in the summer of 2007 to 10.8 million in the first quarter of 2009." This is similar to DHS estimates, which also saw a downward trend from a peak of 11.8 million in 2007 to 10.8 million in 2009. Even though Maddow didn't use those statistics, they back up her claim. Illegal immigration is not increasing, and by at least two measurements, illegal immigration has actually gotten somewhat better. But don't herald the defeat of illegal immigration just yet. It's important to note that the decline in the number of undocumented workers sneaking across the border may have less to do with a more secure border and more to do with a less secure economy in the U.S. The DHS report speculates that the decrease in inflow may be due to "declining U.S. economic growth and enhanced border enforcement efforts." Passel thinks it has more to do with the former than the latter. "It's not that we're discouraging people," said Passel, "It's because they know they can't get jobs because of the economic downturn." Passel said that his data shows that "from 1992 through about 2004 the U.S. employment rate and the volume of the numbers of Mexicans coming to the U.S. are almost perfectly correlated." This seems to indicate that illegal immigration inflows are primarily related to economic considerations. "It's both economic and enforcement," said Griffith."The more difficult you make the trip, the less people are going to attempt to make that trip." However, if the unemployment rate drops and more jobs are available, it's likely that more people will risk crossing the border, because the benefits are worth the risk, according Carafano. The test is whether the illegal immigrant population will continue to decline after the economy picks up. By two key measurements, the numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the border are not increasing. At least for the time being, the numbers in both counts are going down. But when the economy picks up again, it is possible that illegal immigration will once again increase. Nevertheless, looking at the numbers, we rate Maddow's statement True.

pomt-11568	Says the Texas Department of Agriculture didn’t notify over 700 Texas students about a computer hack releasing critical personal information including Social Security numbers until 32 days after the breach.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/feb/05/trey-blocker/challenger-says-sid-miller-was-slow-reveal-compute/	An activist challenging Sid Miller for the 2018 Republican nomination for Texas agriculture commissioner says the first-term incumbent muffed by not alerting child-victims of a personally exploitative computer hack for more than a month. Trey Blocker, a lawyer and former legislative aide who’s worked as a lobbyist, said in a January 2018 commentary for the Odessa American that in October 2017, a Texas Department of Agriculture "employee’s laptop was attacked by ransomware, releasing critical personal information for over 700 Texas students and their families. "The hack," Blocker wrote, "resulted in a loss of the most personal of information — names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, and more — for Texas students and their families in almost 40 school districts. For reasons unknown, TDA did not notify the families affected until November 22, 2017 — 32 days after the breach." Blocker opined: "Though no organization is immune to cybersecurity attacks, this unnecessary delay in notification shows once again the failed leadership of Sid Miller. This is a matter of trust." We don’t judge leadership. But did Blocker accurately recap the computer hack and timing of notices? Candidate cites news story To our emailed inquiry, Blocker pointed us to a December 2017 Denton Record-Chronicle news story stating the Agriculture Department had notified districts about Nov. 22, 2017 — or 27 days (or 19 business days) after the Oct. 26, 2017, "malware attack" on an employee’s computer resulting in a data breach exposing the personal information of students in 39 school districts. The newspaper said the districts, mostly in North and East Texas, ranged in size from the 138-student Karnack district near Louisiana to the 15,185-student Crowley district near Fort Worth. The Agriculture Department, the story said, "oversees the federal nutrition program that provides school breakfasts and lunches. Because of that, the agency identified more than 700 students whose personal information might have been stolen by an unauthorized person. Officials said that information could include names, home addresses, birth dates, phone numbers and Social Security numbers of students and their families," the story said. A TDA spokesman, Mark Loeffler, told the newspaper: "We have no indication right now that any of this information has been misused. We wanted to make sure we knew exactly what the scope was and how many pieces of personal information were compromised before we sent anything out. We had to go through a manual process to confirm that." Our search of the Nexis news database for coverage of the incident led us to learn that the Longview News-Journal was the first news organization to report the incident. Its Nov. 30, 2017, story was accompanied by a two-page statement from Miller summarizing the "attack incident" and providing a chart specifying the districts at risk. Agency’s response When we queried TDA, Loeffler noted that state law doesn’t set a hard deadline for notifying individuals affected by a computer breach. Section 521.053 of the Texas business and commerce code states the disclosure of a breach "to any individual whose sensitive personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person" shall occur "as quickly as possible." And why did it take nearly a month for the agency to notify districts? "It took a substantial amount of time to identify what happened," Loeffler said in January 2018. "We’re still putting the pieces together." Loeffler said the notification of districts "was made out of an abundance of caution. Commissioner Miller made the decision to notify even though we had no information that any data had left the system." Loeffler said further that it continues to look like no information was illicitly taken from the laptop, which he said was actually probed by malware--not ransomware, which implies an outside party seeking a payment to unfreeze a computer--after the worker clicked on a dangerous link. "This is a very human error. This is the same mistake millions of people make every day," Loeffler said. Also, he said by email that while the forensic analysis continues, "TDA fully expects that no data ever left the device." After the fateful afternoon click, Loeffler said, TDA shortly heard from the Texas Department of Information Resources that malware had been introduced. Elliott Sprehe of the DIR separately told us by email that the agency’s Network Security Operating Center "inspects and potentially blocks malicious internet traffic going to and from state agencies. In this case, Sprehe said, the NSOC’s tools saw what was potentially malware on a TDA computer" on Oct. 26, 2017, and at about 4:30 p.m. that day alerted TDA staff to investigate and resolve the issue. Sprehe said: "The traffic pattern DIR reported was indicative of either ransomware or hidden" click fraud activity, which dictionary.com defines as the "fraudulent practice of clicking many times on an online advertisement to generate the small fee charged to the advertiser per click, thereby harming the advertiser or benefiting the host website." Loeffler estimated to us that the laptop was open to malicious probes on the day in question for about an hour before it was shut down with a copy of its hard drive subsequently made in Austin for "digital forensic review." Most recently, Loeffler advised, TDA determined through a file by file review that out of some 5,000 items on the laptop, less than 200 "could have had any combination of personal identifying information that would matter to anybody who wanted to use it maliciously. Of the 200," Loeffler said, probably less than 50 contained the "perfect storm" of someone’s date of birth, social security number and name. Notice to districts We also scrolled TDA web pages devoted to the federally funded free- and reduced-price school meal programs. That’s where we spotted an undated statement headlined "Security Notice" stating that after the employee’s laptop was compromised by the attack, "some students in school districts throughout Texas may have been potentially impacted by the breach." The statement also says: "The information exposed on the employee's laptop included names, social security numbers, home addresses, birth dates, and personal phone numbers of the affected students and their families. To date, TDA's Information Security Officer (ISO) has identified more than 700 students whose sensitive personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, exposed to acquisition by an unauthorized person. "It is important to note that, to date, TDA’s ISO has not discovered any evidence to suggest misuse of the information that was compromised by the ransomware exploit. TDA recognizes the implications of this breach and continually evaluates agency processes and protocols to reduce future occurrences." Finally, the statement urges potentially affected individuals to contact three major U.S. credit bureaus to activate free fraud alerts on behalf of affected students. Time lag? We asked Sprehe if it typically takes about a month to alert possible victims of malware attacks. Sprehe replied: "Due to the complexity and uniqueness of each security incident, there is no way to approximate this." Sprehe and Loeffler each mentioned the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, authorized by the Department of Homeland Security. Loeffler specified that the center was handling the forensic review of the TDA laptop’s hard drive. When we followed up, the center declined to comment on its review of the TDA incident. But generally, a center vice president told us the center annually conducts 150 to 200 post-incident reviews for state and local agencies. Those reviews, Brian Calkin said, typically take two to four weeks to complete--making the TDA’s notification timeline ordinary. "You’ve got to allow time for them to see what occurred," Calkin said. We also heard back about the timing of the notifications to districts from Lance Hayden, a computer security expert who teaches in the University of Texas School of Information. By email, Hayden told us that according to data/analysis from the International Association of Privacy Professionals, "the average time from an organization discovering a breach to when they report it runs at about 30 days. Using that metric, the TDA’s notification at 27-32 days would be very typical of this sort of incident," Hayden wrote. We told Blocker that the agency had yet to find that any personal data was misused in the wake of the attack. Blocker replied by email that possible victims still should have been informed as soon as possible. "That is the responsible thing to do given the potential harm that could come to these students and their families," he wrote. Our ruling Blocker said the department led by Miller didn’t notify more than 700 Texas students about a computer hack releasing critical personal information including Social Security numbers until 32 days after the breach. This claim has an element of truth in that the agency alerted districts to a malware attack exposing personal information nearly a month after the attack--though that time lag wasn't unusual, experts told us. Most significantly, the agency says it hasn't confirmed the capture or misuse of any personal information from the laptop. As a result, we found no support for Blocker's claim that the incident "resulted in a loss of the most personal of information." On balance, we rate Blocker’s statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-06610	"Wisconsin is broke," and "state government is $3 billion in debt."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/22/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-broke-and-3-billio/	During the summer of 2011, the Republican-controlled state Legislature gave swift approval to the $66 billion 2011-’13 state budget, which was signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker. That budget closed a $3.6 billion shortfall from the previous fiscal year, and also, for the first time in many years, closed the state’s structural deficit. In fact, as we noted in an earlier item, Walker’s budget is projected to leave a structural surplus at the end of the two years. That’s why we were puzzled by a two-page fund-raising appeal that his campaign mailed to supporters Sept. 2, 2011. "Wisconsin state government is $3 billion in debt, spending is too high, our business climate isn’t what it should be and Badger State voters gave me a mandate to turn our great state around," Walker said in the two-page letter. "A fiscal tornado is barreling down on us at top speed. And we simply cannot continue spending, taxing, borrowing the way we have been," Walker added, declaring: "Wisconsin is broke! This is our moment of reckoning. By dealing with our problems head-on and solving them, we’ll win a victory for Wisconsin’s future." Wait a minute. That does sound like something straight out of the campaign office -- but from the 2010 campaign. We called Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to ask about the statement. He said he knew nothing about the letter, and sent us to state Republican Party spokeswoman Katie McCallum. She said she would look into the letter and get back to us. She didn’t. Let’s start with the "we’re broke" statement. That was a refrain used by Walker (and other Republicans locally and nationally) on the campaign trail and in early 2011, when Walker introduced a budget repair bill that called for curtailing collective bargaining for most public employees. In the midst of that debate, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the "we’re broke" statement False, noting that numerous experts said the state wasn’t teetering on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency, and had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by the GOP. We heard from many readers who disagreed with that assessment. But repeating the statement now flies in the face of the many positive statements Walker made after the budget passed. Significantly, the state budget by law must be balanced, so the $3.6 billion shortfall had to be resolved. And the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau -- accepted by both sides as the neutral scorekeeper on such matters -- says the structural deficit is gone for the first time since it started using the calculation to measure the long-term impact of future obligations the state faces. Here’s what Walker said when he signed the budget June 27, 2011: "Through honest budgeting, we are providing an alternative to the reckless tricks and gimmicks of the past." We asked Werwie whether Walker has recently used the "broke" phrase. "He hasn’t said that in eons," Werwie said. Beyond that, the state never was $3 billion in debt -- we rated a statement on that topic by GOP state Senate candidate Jonathan Steitz as False. Why? The state faced a $3.6 billion budget shortfall -- the difference between tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget. But that’s separate from any long-term debt obligations. The contradictory statements in the letter also extend to comments about the state’s business climate, which Walker said "isn’t what it should be." The letter does not specify by what measure, but this also flies counter to what Walker has been stating publicly. He routinely notes Wisconsin’s standing improved from 41st to 24th on the list of business-friendly states compiled by Chief Executive magazine. A Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce survey found "88 percent of Wisconsin business leaders said they are confident the state is heading in the right direction, up from just 10 percent a year ago." And Walker and GOP lawmakers note that their first actions this year came in a special session of the Legislature dedicated to steps aimed to improved the state’s business climate. Here’s what WMC president Kurt Bauer said July 11, 2011 in a column on the group’s website. "Governor Scott Walker set the right tone even before he took office by announcing the state was ‘open for business.’ Walker backed up his slogan by introducing a two-year budget plan that solved the $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes. " Said Werwie: "Certainly our business climate has gotten substantially better." Our conclusion In a fund-raising letter full of urgency, Walker criticizes unions and Democrats in the Legislature while proclaiming the state is broke and $3 billion in debt. But the statement flies in the face of a balanced budget with a structural surplus and the upbeat rhetoric coming out of the governor’s office. Understandable, perhaps. After all, the letter is geared toward getting supporters to contribute money to the campaign in the face of a possible recall attempt in 2012. But in doing so, Walker contradicts his own statements -- and reality. The statements are false and ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

pomt-03299	Says a Justice Department memo "directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jul/31/louie-gohmert/gohmert-charges-justice-department-telling-employe/	President Barack Obama’s administration "has gone out of its way to thump Christians," a Texas U.S. House member said in a July 15, 2013, interview with Fox News. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, went on to say the nation’s top lawyers have been directed to embrace gay marriage, saying: "It's also been true in the Department of Justice right now, directly under this president, his buddy, Eric Holder. There's a memo that directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality. And silence is considered to be disapproval," Gohmert said, according to CQ Transcriptions. The Justice Department required workers to embrace gay marriage and more? Employee group brochure To our email inquiry, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham pointed out a May 28, 2013, blog post by Todd Starnes, a Fox News commentator, headlined: "DOJ Tells Employees to Verbally Affirm Homosexuality." Starnes, citing Liberty Counsel, a law firm that says it’s dedicated to "advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family," wrote that department employees were emailed a brochure, "LGBT Inclusion at Work: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Managers." He wrote too that the brochure was created by DOJ Pride, an association of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender agency employees. The brochure lists about 20 "do’s" and "don’ts" running from appropriate language to dealing with offensive jokes to declaring one’s own sexual orientation and respecting someone who does so. Given Gohmert’s statement, we narrowed our focus to brochure references to gay marriage and to embracing homosexuality. Under the heading "Use Inclusive Language," the brochure encourages recipients to "use inclusive words like ‘partner,’ ‘significant other’ or ‘spouse’ rather than gender-specific terms like ‘husband’ and ‘wife.’" Another section says: "Do acknowledge important events in an LGBT employee’s life--e.g., same-sex marriage, birth of a child, illness of a spouse, or death of a partner’s parent--in the same way you would for a heterosexual employee." A theme of the brochure is respect for an employee’s sexual orientation. A section titled "Come Out" says: "Do let your employees know they’ll be treated with fairness and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, by ‘coming out’ as a straight ally." Recipients are encouraged to display the brochure or a DOJ Pride sticker in clear view or request that their office receive follow-up training on gender identity in the workplace. Also: "Do consider coming out of the closet if you are LGBT and not out at work. The presence of visible LGBT managers communicates that your office is open and accepting." In another section, the brochure says that if an employee "comes out to you," don’t "judge or remain silent. Silence will be interpreted as disapproval. Do respond with interest and curiosity. Asking respectful questions will set a positive, supportive tone." By telephone, Matt Barber, a Liberty Counsel attorney, told us the brochure was sent to agency employees on May 14, 2013. At our request, Barber emailed us what he described as a copy of that email with the name of the whistleblower worker who brought it to the firm’s attention redacted. One agency's distribution The "To" line of the email says, "Global Distribution." The email message, under the subject "LGBT Pride Month," describes the attached brochure as complementing a planned LGBT Pride Month observance. The email expresses hope that the brochure, "drafted with input from key department stakeholders," will be a useful tool "as you work to create an office environment that is welcoming to, and supportive of, all employees, including LGBT employees." The email closes with: "This message has been authorized by Nelson A. Santos, Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Forensic Sciences." By phone, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona told us Santos works for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Talamona initially told us that the publication was distributed to "some employees" by email with the department’s awareness. However, she said, it is not an agency policy or directive. Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson later emailed a statement that seemed to indicate the DEA official sent the brochure to many of that agency's workers. All told, its employees account for some 9,000 of the Justice Department’s 115,000 workers, Iverson said. Iverson's statement said "DOJ Pride, an employee association, sent informational material, on its own behalf, to some DOJ employees. The material was clearly identified as a DOJ Pride product. We have also recently learned one component’s diversity official distributed the information via email to its employees on behalf of DOJ Pride. The single-page document was produced on a DOJ computer and involved limited use of a DOJ printer to make a few dozen copies, in line with the department’s de minimis use policy allowing employees to make minimal personal use of their DOJ computers when the cost to the government is negligible." Barber said that while the brochure was authored by an employee group, not the department proper, "it came under the auspices of the larger Department of Justice." He added that the agency "knows it would be unconstitutional to expressly compel department employees to openly embrace homosexuality and gay marriage." The brochure, he said, delivers a compliance threat that is implied rather than explicit. Diversity policy More broadly, the department says online it has a diversity management policy: "We work diligently to attract and retain a workforce that represents the range of personal and professional backgrounds, and experiences and perspectives that arise from differences of culture and circumstances. This includes persons of varying age, ethnicity, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, political affiliation, socioeconomic and family status, and geographic region." As noted in a May 24, 2013, blog post by WND, a conservative Internet news organization, Holder aired support for diversity in a June 6, 2012, speech marking the agency’s LGBT Pride Month celebration. After mentioning efforts to combat school bullying and to help students who feel unsafe or victimized, Holder said: "It is this same determination that guides the Justice Department’s internal efforts to create a more inclusive work environment, and to strengthen our mission to serve all Americans by attracting a diverse range of qualified individuals; and by providing the opportunities--and the support necessary--for every department employee to develop, to grow, and to thrive both personally and professionally." Our ruling Gohmert said a Justice Department memo "directs that you must openly embrace gay marriage and homosexuality." The department promotes diversity. But there doesn't appear to be a department memo or mandate that employees openly support gay marriage or homosexuality. That said, a subset of workers received a brochure from an agency-sanctioned employee group encouraging managers to respect and support gay workers. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth, as Mostly False.	None	Louie Gohmert	None	None	None	2013-07-31T14:00:06	2013-07-15	['None']
pomt-08120	"I think [a little] less than half of the people in our prisons are in there for less than a year. ... We have people who are check kiters and don't pay child support and we are locking them up in the state pen."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/10/john-kasich/gov-elect-john-kasich-correct-nearly-half-ohios-in/	Gov-elect John Kasich, who will inherit the state’s budget hole next month, has not said how he plans to fill it. But he continues to reiterate that every idea is on the table – except tax increases – and he’s been fielding questions from reporters about various options and proposals. Speaking to a gaggle of reporters on Dec. 3, Kasich was asked to comment on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction’s earlier warning that it would have to close prisons and release some inmates to meet a 10 percent budget cut if such a reduction is required. Kasich, who’s is considering privatizing some aspects of the prison system and other state operations, reacted with his typical candor, glibness and hint of exasperation. "Well, look, this is just ‘rally around the flag,’ boys, right?," he said. "You are going to have everybody complaining and screaming that the skies are falling." He suggested that "instead of people whining," the ODRC should offer some ideas about reducing costs. "I guess the system is just great over at the department of corrections," he said sarcastically. Addressing the substance of the question more directly, Kasich offered this: "We have a system in Ohio where I think [a little] less than half of the people in our prisons are in there for less than a year. ... We have people who are check kiters and don't pay child support and we are locking them up in the state pen." Since the prison system is a major drain on the budget – and the subject of increased attention by Gov. Ted Strickland and the legislature since 2008 -- Politifact Ohio thought it’d be worth checking Kasich’s statements. We started with the claim that a little less than half of the people in state prisons are incarcerated for a year. The ODRC tracks prison intake and turnover in single calendar year to measure its impact on the cost and capacity of the prisons. The figure helps ODRC identify crime and sentencing trends. This, says Kasich, is the context surrounding his comments on Dec. 3. In 2009, 25,000 people were admitted to state prisons and 48 percent of them -- a little less than half -- were there for less than a year, according to the ODRC’s 2009 commitment report supplied by the state. Kasich’s statement – Ohio is locking up check kiters and people who don’t pay child support – has to be measured against the 12-month intake figure, since these low level crimes do not carry long prison sentences. Of the 25,000 people sent to the state slammer in 2009 – just one-third of 1 percent were there for passing bad checks, which ODRC tracks in a broader category of "fraud offenses." Another 2.4 percent of the inmates were there for not paying child support, which is tracked in a larger category called "Crimes Against Persons." The category overall accounts for 24.76 percent but excludes sex crimes, which is its own category. Sex crimes account for 6.78 percent of the 12-month prison population. Drug offenses top the list at 26.8 percent. The prison system also tracks the average tenure of the entire population, which provides a snapshot of why people are in prison. The average stay, computed using the entire inmate population of nearly 51,000 – is two years. Nearly 42 percent of the long-term inmates are locked up for "crimes against persons." Another 14.5 percent are there for sex offenses. We could end our review here but its worth adding more context to Kasich’s point that the state’s sentencing laws are plugging up the system. He’s hardly the first politician to make the charge. Ohio’s prison system is designed to hold 38,389 inmates. That means the current capacity is at 133 percent. The low-level offenders to state prisons take up processing costs and bed space. Alternatives – such as halfway houses and drug treatment and electronic monitoring – need better study to identify the most successful options. Low-threat offenders eat up a disproportionate percentage of probation resources. All these are among issues raised by a study of the state’s criminal system undertaken by the Council of State Government Justice Reinvestment project. The large project had the backing of the governor and legislature. Ohio Senate Bill 22 and its counterpart, House Bill 386, offer opportunities to correct some of the problems. The ODRC supports these and has endorsed other recommendations. If Kasich is looking to place blame, he might look at the legislature – which his party will soon control – because the bills have stalled there. To review, Kasich is correct to say the 12-month prison population accounts for a little less than half the overall prison population. And it’s true there are inmates imprisoned for check kiting and failing to pay child support. And while they represent just a fraction of the population, the governor-elect is basically on point: low-level, non-violent crimes are clogging the system. Kasich is off point when he derides the ODRC for not having ideas on how to become more efficient, given the department’s efforts to support reform and the legislature’s failure to make it happen. But that comment isn’t part of the claim we’re evaluating here. So, where does this leave his comments Truth-O-Meter? We rate his claim True.

pomt-05893	"Most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/06/cecilia-munoz/white-house-official-says-98-catholic-women-have-u/	UPDATE: This item prompted debate about whether we correctly interpreted the Guttmacher study. We explored that criticism, and are confident in our original analysis. The White House, defending a decision requiring many Catholic hospitals, schools and charities to offer contraception coverage to employees, argues that most women — including most Catholic women — use birth control. Cecilia Muñoz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, marshaled this statistic in a Feb. 1, 2012, blog post: "According to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception." The Catholic Church doesn’t approve of "contraceptive interventions" to prevent pregnancy. We wondered: Did a reputable study say that most Catholic women have used birth control anyway? The decision The Obama administration decision, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Jan. 20, 2012, addressed which preventive services must be covered by most insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the patient. Those services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012. But the rule provides an exemption for "certain non-profit religious employers" -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. That’s far too narrow an exemption, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops argues. That's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve Catholics — ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups. The government is giving such nonprofit religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them. The bishops are leading a charge to reverse the decision, but the administration so far hasn’t budged, instead citing statistics in support of its position, such as from the Guttmacher study. The study We found the study. It’s been making the rounds, cited by news organizations when it was released in April 2011, referenced by the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in a January column and underpinning talking points for Obama administration officials speaking on background Feb. 2. (The Guttmacher Institute, named for obstetrician-gynecologist Alan Guttmacher, says it advances sexual and reproductive health and rights with research, policy analysis and education. Not surprisingly, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops routinely objects to its conclusions and analysis, responding on its website, usccb.org.) The study, "Countering Conventional Wisdom: New Evidence on Religion and Contraceptive Use," is based on government data collected in the National Survey of Family Growth. The survey has been conducted seven times since 1973 by the National Center for Health Statistics, with the most recent cycle in 2006-10. The survey includes women ages 15 to 44. Researchers conduct personal interviews to gather information on marriage, divorce, contraception, infertility and health of women and infants. The source is regularly used for studies on contraceptives and religion, including one we found published by the Catholic Medical Association. (The 2001 article found the high rate of contraceptive use by Catholic women "not new or surprising.") Researchers ask women for their religious affiliation, including details about how important a role religion plays in their lives and how often they attend religious services. Guttmacher’s study relies on data from the survey’s interviews with 7,356 women between June 2006 and December 2008, focusing on those who called themselves Catholic, mainline Protestant and evangelical Protestant. The numbers are stark, according to the study: "Among all women who have had sex, 99 percent have ever used a contraceptive method other than natural family planning. This figure is virtually the same, 98 percent, among sexually experienced Catholic women." (Interestingly, the Guttmacher study noted that "attendance at religious services and importance of religion to daily life are largely unrelated to use of highly effective contraceptive methods.") Bishops’ response The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops responded to Muñoz’s blog post with a post of its own Feb. 3, 2012. It didn’t directly dispute the 98 percent statistic. But the post did argue it was irrelevant and used in a misleading way. "If a survey found that 98 percent of people had lied, cheated on their taxes, or had sex outside of marriage, would the government claim it can force everyone to do so?" the post said. The bishops also argued: • The study says 98 percent of "sexually experienced" women, a distinction Muñoz didn’t make. (Sexually experienced women accounted for most of the women in the sample, including 70 percent of never-married Catholic women.) • The more relevant Guttmacher statistic would be use of "highly effective" methods of contraception covered by the new rule, such as the pill, IUDs and sterilization, among sexually active women who don’t want to become pregnant — 68 percent for Catholic women and 69 percent for all women. What the bishops don’t mention is that this statistic looks only at women who have had sex within three months of the survey, and that "highly effective" methods don't include FDA-approved contraception such as condoms, sponges or suppositories. And the number they cite still represents most of the women in that category. But the bishops argued that this smaller group must be a minority of the general public, "yet every man and woman who needs health insurance will have to pay for this coverage." So the bishops are using a snapshot in time and arguing it’s a minority of women. At any given point, women would be excluded because they’re pregnant, postpartum, trying to get pregnant or not having sex. The same women might not be excluded in a different month or year. That’s why the "ever used" question is relevant. Our ruling Muñoz said, "according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception." We read the study, which was based on long-collected, frequently cited government survey data. It says essentially that — though the statistic refers specifically to women who have had sex, a distinction Muñoz didn’t make. But that’s not a large clarification, since most women in the study, including 70 percent of unmarried Catholic women, were sexually experienced. Catholic bishops argue it’s more relevant to note the percentage of sexually active women who don’t want to become pregnant and who currently use hormones, IUDs or sterilization — since the smaller number would provide smaller justification for spreading the cost of contraceptives to the general public. But we think it’s reasonable to note that most women have used contraceptives even if they aren’t currently using them. It means most women would find occasion to take advantage of the new co-pay-free contraceptive rule. Meanwhile, Muñoz used the phrase "have used," which made it clear she meant women who had used contraception before, not necessarily now. It would have been clearest if Muñoz had specified she was talking about women who have had sex — and perhaps that the statistic referred to women ages 15 to 44. But her statement was otherwise accurate. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Cecilia Muñoz	None	None	None	2012-02-06T16:09:58	2012-02-01	['None']
pomt-07984	Says he’s the first Aggie governor of Texas.	true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-aggies-were-kept-out-governors-off/	It’s well known that Gov. Rick Perry, just sworn in to a fresh four-year term, is a graduate of Texas A&M University, where he was a student yell leader. Not so well known: the claim Perry put forth in his inaugural address Tuesday on the south side of the Texas Capitol: "For 154 years, they kept an Aggie out of the Governor’s Office." We don’t read Perry’s remark as a claim that Aggies never even entered a governor’s office -- say, to visit. Still, we were hooked: Is Perry truly the first Aggie governor of Texas since statehood in 1845? News reports from the start of his first term say so. A Dec. 21, 2000, news article in the Austin American-Statesman said that after Gov. George W. Bush resigned that morning, then-Lt. Gov. Perry would be sworn in as his successor that afternoon. The story refers to Perry as "the first Texas A&M graduate to get the job." Likewise, a May 4, 2001 Associated Press dispatch on Perry’s first gubernatorial visit to A&M’s College Station campus opens: "Aggie Rick Perry, the first Texas A&M graduate to be Texas governor..." The AP story said other Aggies had run for governor, including 1990 Republican nominee Clayton Williams, but "no Aggies have been elected." Perry, a West Texan who graduated in 1972 with a degree in animal science, is quoted saying: "Had it not been for my opportunity to get an education at Texas A&M," becoming governor "wouldn't have been possible." We checked the news reports by consulting an online database of gubernatorial biographies kept by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. According to Perry’s biography, he is "the first Texas A&M graduate to occupy the Texas Governor’s Mansion." Two previous guvs established A&M ties after serving in the state’s top elected office. Richard Hubbard, governor from 1876-1879, attended Mercer University in Georgia and then Harvard University, but later joined A&M’s board of directors, which later became the board of regents. And in 1891, Lawrence Sullivan Ross followed up two terms as governor by stepping "immediately into the presidency of the seriously troubled Agricultural Mechanical College of Texas," which later was renamed Texas A&M University. Six governors have attended the University of Texas, most recently Dolph Briscoe, who graduated from from UT in 1942 before serving as governor from 1973-1979. Other governors were connected to UT in some other fashion, like Ann Richards, who graduated from Baylor University before earning her teaching certificate at UT in Austin. Never mind those teasips, as the Aggies call UT students. Hullabaloo, Caneck, Caneck! Perry’s statement is True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-01-19T06:00:00	2011-01-18	['Texas']

pomt-03595	Ohio’s lost more jobs in March than any other state in the nation.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/may/13/mike-foley/state-rep-mike-foley-says-ohio-led-nation-job-loss/	During budget debates in the Ohio House, Democrats portrayed themselves as the defenders of middle-income Ohioans, announcing a plan they called their Targeted Middle Class Tax Cut. The plan, which majority Republicans did not include in the budget, was the brainchild of Reps. Mike Foley of Cleveland and John Patrick Carney of Columbus. The two Democrats announced their plan in the wake of new job figures which they said showed that Republican Gov. John Kasich’s economic policies aren't working. In a news release posted to his House webpages, Foley cited the job figures and claimed that Ohio lost more than 20,400 jobs in March, and that those losses were the largest of any state in the nation. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check his claim. We asked Foley’s staff to support his statement, and also checked ourselves with the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, home of a vast array of jobs data. Foley’s staff provided a news article from The Plain Dealer that relied on data from BLS and the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. In March, according to BLS estimates, the seasonally adjusted estimate for the total number of non-farm jobs in Ohio was 5,176,900 jobs. That represents a loss of about 20,400 from the previous month, just as Foley said. You have to go back to June 2009, the month the recession officially ended, to find a greater monthly figure. That month about 33,000 jobs were lost. In April 2009, Ohio lost more than 44,000 jobs, the worst monthly performance so farin this century. But the March 2013 figure also is small enough that it did not change the unemployment rate. That remained 7.1 percent, just as it was in February, according to the state Department of Job and Family Services. So how did Ohio stack up against the rest of the nation? Foley’s claim cites a raw number (rather than a percentage), which means Ohio’s size could come into play. The Buckeye State is the seventh most populous in the nation. But did it lead the nation in job losses? After all, California, with more than three times Ohio’s population, has a much larger economy. Texas has more than double the people. And New York and Florida, Nos. 3 and 4, each have populations more than 60 percent greater than Ohio. BLS figures show Ohio did indeed lose the most jobs. Nonfarm employment decreased in 26 states and the District of Columbia. It increased in 23 states. New Mexico was unchanged. The largest increases were in Florida, which added 32,700 jobs, and California, which gained. 25,500. The largest decreases were in Ohio (-20,400) and Illinois (-17,800). In Ohio, the industries posting big losses in March included leisure and hospitality (down 6,000 jobs), professional and business services (down 4,300 jobs) and construction (down 3,300 jobs), according to Job and Family Services.Even the category including health services posted a 2,500 decline. "That is extremely unusual. That has been our best growth sector for decades," economic research analyst George Zeller told The Plain Dealer. A bright spot was manufacturing, which has fueled the recovery in Ohio and gained 1,800 jobs. It is also worth noting that the March job losses were preceded by three months in a row of job gains. And so far this year, the state still is showing a net job gain.The state lost jobs during four months of 2012, but nothing on the scale of March’s decline. Foley, in his news release, said that Ohio lost 20,400 jobs in March and that it led the nation in jobs lost. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms both the number of jobs lost, albeit an estimate, and that Ohio lost more than any other state. Foley’s statement is accurate, although he is focusing on a month in which the number of job losses is unusually high. With that point of clarification, on the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.	None	Mike Foley	None	None	None	2013-05-13T11:55:56	2013-04-23	['Ohio']

pomt-00194	"Our unemployment rate is 20 percent higher than the national average."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/oct/18/scott-wagner/scott-wagner-says-pas-unemployment-rate-20-percent/	In an Oct. 11 fundraising email sent to supporters, Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner said his opponent, Democratic incumbent Tom Wolf, "has failed Pennsylvanians," adding, "Our unemployment rate is 20 percent higher than the national average." PolitiFact Pennsylvania repeatedly asked Wagner’s campaign for evidence supporting the claim and got no response, so we decided to mine the data ourselves. And since Wagner’s campaign didn’t place a timeframe on his claim — other than using the present tense — we decided to see if anyone else had. We found a June tweet from Matt Brouillette, current president and CEO of Commonwealth Partners and former president and CEO of the conservative Commonwealth Foundation. In it, Brouillette wrote in response to a tweet from U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus about national economic figures: "Yet under @GovernorTomWolf's tenure, PA's unemployment rate remains upwards of 20% higher than the national average." In an email response to PolitiFact Pennsylvania, Brouillette pointed to April when Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 4.7 percent and the national rate was 3.9. Brouillette said this puts Pennsylvania’s rate at 20.5 percent above the national rate. Here’s the math: (4.7 - 3.9) / 3.9 = .205 x 100 = 20.5 percent Obviously one could also say that Pennsylvania’s rate was, in absolute terms, 0.8 percentage points higher than the national rate in April, but that number is far less impactful, especially if, like Wagner, your intent is to besmirch the sitting governor who also happens to be your political opponent. "Using a percentage change is not that uncommon, especially if it works to make the point more dramatic," said G. Terry Madonna, professor of public affairs and director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College. Erin E. Delaney, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, explained, "It’s usually not necessary to calculate a percent change with percentages because they are already comparable as is (unlike if you were looking to compare unemployment levels)." Delaney added, "... calculating a percent change could be misleading if all of the facts are not presented. Because the numbers are smaller in the first instance, the percent difference is exaggerated — especially confusing since both of the rates would be more favorable than the higher rates with the smaller percentage difference." So, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 20 percent — not 20 percentage points — higher than the national rate in April. But is that still the case, given the present tense used in Wagner’s email? No. Not even close. Based on U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics data, in August 2018 — the most recent month for which state data are available — Pennsylvania’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.1 percent. The national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.9 percent. That’s a 0.2 percentage point or 5 percent difference, not a 20 percent difference as Wagner claims. Seasonally adjusted numbers take into account fluctuations and trends in employment numbers that re-occur each year. This includes winter slowdowns in agriculture, construction and other seasonal industries, the pickups seen every June as students take summer jobs, and the hiring and layoff patterns that coincide with winter and summer holidays. Seasonally adjusted stats are generally considered a more reliable indicator of unemployment trends. Brouillette used them in support of his claim about April’s disparity between state and national unemployment rates. But even by his own account, that disparity has dwindled considerably since, with Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate sitting at 0.2 percentage points or 5 percent higher than the national rate in August. And when looking at not-seasonally adjusted numbers, Wagner’s claim doesn’t fare any better. The not-seasonally adjusted number in Pennsylvania was 4.4 percent in August and 3.9 percent nationwide. That’s a 12 percent difference. In fact, with the exception of April, at no point since Gov. Tom Wolf was inaugurated in January of 2015 has the state unemployment rate been 20 percent higher than the national rate. The closest it’s come is 18.4 percent or 0.7 percentage points in May when Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 4.5 to the nation’s 3.8. Our ruling Pennsylvania did have an unemployment rate that was 20 percent — not 20 percentage points — higher than the national rate in April. But Wagner is wrong to claim it stilldoes. The most recent data shows Pennsylvania’s rate in August was 5 percent above the national rate. For these reasons, we rate this claim False.

pomt-09486	"Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods."	true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/26/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-correct-rubio-supported-gun-restrict/	It's going to be a long summer. It's only February and the barbs are already flying in the Republican campaign for U.S. Senate. (The primary isn't until Aug. 24.) In a recent press release, Gov. Charlie Crist fired off 10 claims about his opponent, former House Speaker Marco Rubio. One statement questioned Rubio's commitment to gun rights: "Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods." A candidate's stance on gun issues can be critical in a Republican primary. Some gun rights groups oppose restrictions such as these. We thought the statement merited further research. The claim stems from a January 2000 Miami Herald article. Rubio, then 28, was running in a special election for his first term in the Florida House. The Herald article profiled Rubio and his opponent and recounted their positions on key issues. It said, "Rubio supports 'reasonable restrictions' including background checks and waiting periods." It quoted Rubio saying, "However, I believe we should spend more time focusing on why people, especially children, are committing acts of violence." Asked about the passage in the article, Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos confirmed that it accurately described Rubio's position and said, "It's basically a restatement of his support for the current law." In 1990, Florida voters passed a law requiring a three-day waiting period to buy handguns. When the Brady Bill was enacted into federal law in 1993, it called for a five-day waiting period, but Florida's earlier law took precedence. The three-day waiting period is still in effect, unless the buyer has a license to carry a concealed weapon. Burgos noted that throughout his time in the Legislature, Rubio had an "A" rating by the National Rifle Association. Rubio voted for major NRA priorities such as a 2005 "castle doctrine" law allowing people to use deadly force if attacked in their home or any place a person "has a right to be." Rubio also supported a 2008 law allowing most employees to bring guns to work, as long as they held a concealed weapons license and kept the gun in their cars. Marion Hammer, a lobbyist for the NRA who served as its national president and has donated money to Crist's campaign, told PolitiFact Florida that Rubio's rating would go down when new grades are released in May. That's a reflection of several compromises in the "guns-at-work" bill that occurred during Rubio's time as speaker, she said. Rubio's record on guns as a House member is clear -- he voted with major NRA priorities and got an "A" rating for each of his elections, at least until now. But Crist accurately claimed that Rubio supported laws that instituted waiting periods and background checks on gun owners. Crist's statement earns a True.

pomt-02696	"Earlier this year, [John DePetro] was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/05/our-daughters-ri/union-groups-petition-says-talk-show-host-john-dep/	WPRO-AM talk-radio host John DePetro has been shown to be factually challenged when he makes statements about others. His record with PolitiFact Rhode Island is two False rulings and two Pants on Fire rulings. So the irony didn't escape us when DePetro wrote to us on Jan. 2 to complain that a group was telling a lie about him. At issue is a petition on Change.org that seeks his removal. It had 6,659 "signatures" as of 2:15 p.m. on Jan. 2. (Supporters are asked to give their names and addresses and click on a "Sign" button, but only the names of commenters are shown on the site.) The petition comes from For Our Daughters RI, a union-backed group created after DePetro, a harsh critic of unions, called union protesters "parasites," "cockroaches," "hags" and "whores." The protesters had been picketing a fundraiser for Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, then an unannounced candidate for governor, accusing her of being a "crook" who "cooked the books" to build support for the overhaul of the state pension system. The petition says DePetro has made other hateful statements against women and "earlier this year, he was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker." The petition started circulating in November 2013. DePetro has taken issue with most of the allegations. We were interested in the sexual-assault claim because it was news to us. "I have never been accused of 'sexual assault,' that is a complete lie," he said in his email. "In July of 2012, I was accused of sexual harassment, but that is far different than 'sexual assault.'" A sexual harassment civil suit was indeed filed against him in 2012, not 2013, as the petition says. We read the complaint. It does not mention sexual assault, a criminal charge that can put someone in prison. In the filing, a former coworker accused DePetro of allegedly making sexual advances to her, showing her images of women that he said he was attracted to, and ultimately asking her if she would engage in group sex with him. DePetro has denied the allegations. (WPRO officials were also named in the suit. DePetro's supervisor was accused of not properly acting against the alleged infractions. However, there is no record in Superior Court that, in the 15 months since the suit was filed, any of the defendants have been officially notified that they're being sued.) We called Maureen Martin, chairwoman of For Our Daughters RI, to ask about the sexual-assault allegation. Martin is also political activities director of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, a labor union. Martin confirmed that the allegation in the petition referred to the 2012 sexual harassment suit. She asked to get back to us. By that night, the petition had been altered. The year had been changed to 2012. As of 2 p.m. Friday, the total was 6,671. However, the allegation of sexual assault was not modified. In a statement emailed that evening, Martin said that in the harassment complaint, DePetro's accuser "alleges that Mr. DePetro made multiple 'sexual advances' toward her. These advances were unwelcome and 'inappropriate,' the complaint contends." "The United States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women defines sexual assault, in part, as: 'any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient,'" Martin said. "We believe the alleged, unwelcome 'sexual advances' referenced in the aforementioned court filing fall under the classification of 'behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.'" We checked the Justice Department's definition. The other half of the definition, which Martin did not quote, says: "Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape." Sexual harassment is not mentioned. Our ruling For Our Daughters RI, in its petition calling for the removal of talk-radio host John DePetro, said, "Earlier this year, he was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker." DePetro was accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in 2012, not 2013. The suit, which has laid dormant according to court records, never alleges sexual assault. Both sexual harassment and sexual assault are serious allegations. But the former is a civil matter and the latter can send you to prison, and relegate an ex-convict to a life of a registered sex offender. We would expect a group devoted to protecting women to know the difference. Yet For Our Daughters RI is standing by its allegation, selectively quoting from a federal definition of sexual assault and neglecting the fact that the definition does not include sexual harassment. We rate its statement Pants on Fire! (With research by Providence Journal reporter Katie Mulvaney.

pomt-13378	"Brock Turner’s early release will be a regular occurrence if Prop. 57 passes."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/sep/28/stop-57-campaign/campaign-uses-mostly-false-specter-brock-turner-ca/	Brock Turner’s brief jail term for sexual assault sparked outcry across California and the nation earlier this year. A judge sentenced the former Stanford University swimmer to just six months in jail even though Turner -- who had been convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman -- faced a minimum two-year prison term, and prosecutors sought six years. On Sept. 2, Turner was released after serving half his jail term, for good behavior. Early release is standard practice in California’s overflowing jails. Turner has since moved back to Ohio and registered as a sex offender. On the day Turner was released, opponents of a California ballot measure to reduce prison crowding seized on the notorious case to make a questionable claim. "Brock Turner’s early release will be a regular occurrence if Prop. 57 passes," claims the headline of a news release on the Stop57.com campaign website. Later in the press release, the campaign expanded on this claim saying Prop 57 "would make reduced sentences and early release for persons convicted of the same sex crimes committed by Turner a permanent part of California law." We decided to fact check the bold claim in the headline, and to keep in mind the context included later in the press release. Opponents of Prop 57 have used the notorious Brock Turner case to argue against the ballot measure, including in this video. Our research Proposition 57 would allow thousands of prison inmates categorized by the state as "nonviolent" to be eligible for early parole. It’s Gov. Jerry Brown’s latest attempt to reform the state prison system. And it’s led to heated debate over which offenders would be eligible for early release if it passes. But would the early release of sex offenders such as Turner really be "a regular occurrence" as the Stop 57 campaign claimed? Technically, no. Prop 57 applies to prison inmates -- not to those sentenced to jail like Turner. Still, we decided to examine the larger question raised by the claim of how prison inmates convicted of the same crimes as Turner would be affected. California's Proposition 57 is Gov. Jerry Brown's latest effort to reform the state's prison system. Background on Turner’s case Turner was convicted on three felony counts: assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, sexual penetration of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration of an unconscious person. Those crimes are considered nonviolent because, according to California law, they do not involve force. State law considers 23 crimes to be violent, obviously including murder and kidnapping. But in California, "nonviolent" is broadly defined. It applies to certain rapes and sexual assaults, such as Turner's conviction, along with vehicular and involuntary manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, domestic violence, exploding a bomb with intent to injure and other crimes. This remarkably broad definition for nonviolent crimes has made Prop 57 one of the most debated measures on November’s ballot. Excluding sex offenders? Experts say there are valid questions about who would be eligible for parole. But Gabriel Chin, a criminal law professor at UC Davis, said the Stop 57 campaign stretched the truth by playing up the Turner case. "It don’t think it’s accurate," Chin said of the claim. "I certainly don’t think it’s likely that people convicted of sex offenses are going to get early release under this ballot initiative." Chin pointed to a 2014 federal court order that required the state to form guidelines to further ease California’s prison crowding. Following that order, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation created a process to allow some second-strike offenders to be considered for early parole. It excluded, however, those who must register as sex offenders. "We see what the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is doing: They’re treating sex crimes as violent crimes. And I have no reason to imagine they would change that policy if Prop 57 passes," Chin said. Another view But just because it’s become practice to exclude sex offenders for early parole consideration, doesn’t mean that practice is codified in California law said Laurie Kubicek, a professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University. "I don’t think the public should be lulled into believing that (an inmate given early release) would never be a sex offender," said Kubicek. "I don’t think that’s what the law says. I think it could be a sex offender." She called the Stop 57 claim both "true and false." She also noted the state is doing its best to keep risky offenders from becoming eligible for parole. We asked the Stop 57 campaign to explain its claim. It connected us with Merced County District Attorney Larry Morse, the campaign’s co-chairman. Morse said because there’s nothing specific in the ballot measure that deals with sex offenders, one must assume they will be eligible for parole. The Yes on 57 campaign, meanwhile, pointed to the state’s current practice of excluding sex offenders from early release to say the claim at the center of this fact check was false. If 57 passes, the state must create additional regulations to further the goals of the ballot measure. Those rules must be certified by the state corrections agency, which anticipates "that the regulations would … disqualify inmates who must register as sex offenders," an agency spokesman told PolitiFact California in an email. The Stop 57 campaign added in another claim that, if Prop 57 passes, it will supersede existing state policies, and will force the state to make sex offenders eligible for early parole. Our ruling The Stop 57 campaign claimed "Brock Turner’s early release will be a regular occurrence if Prop. 57 passes." There are plenty of offenders who could be eligible for early parole under the ballot measure. California has a category of nonviolent offenders, many of whom committed heinous crimes and could be eligible for, though not guaranteed parole. Under its early release policy for second strike prisoners, however, the state corrections department excludes sex offenders from even being considered for early parole. That policy is not a state law. But the state corrections agency says it expects to continue this practice. The Stop 57 claim used the notorious Brock Turner case to argue that early parole "will be" a regular occurrence. At best, there’s a remote chance the state will allow prisoners who committed the same crimes as Turner to someday be eligible for early parole. But past practice says it won’t happen. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-14129	"Closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50,000,000"	true	/missouri/statements/2016/may/06/chris-koster/gubernatorial-candidate-chris-koster-right-about-5/	As part of his campaign to become Missouri’s 56th governor, Chris Koster tweeted a statistic about something he has been working to accomplish during his time as attorney general: closing the tobacco loophole. In his tweet, Koster called upon the legislature to #FixTheLoophole, which he says will save Missourians $50 million. The so-called tobacco loophole is money the state hopes to get from five big tobacco companies if it takes a tougher line with smaller ones. We looked into whether $50 million is really on the line. Tobacco background We reached out to the Koster campaign to find out what closing the loophole entailed. We heard back from David Turner, a spokesman for the Missouri Democratic Party. Turner told us that the tobacco loophole arose in 1998 as part of a master settlement agreement between the attorneys general of 46 states, along with Washington, D.C., and five U.S. territories, and the five largest tobacco companies in the U.S. The states had sued the tobacco companies for selling cigarettes which they knew caused cancer, emphysema and other diseases. The attorneys general wanted to recover the cost of caring for those people. The settlement said that in exchange for dropping the lawsuits, the states would receive roughly $10 billion dollars a year, essentially indefinitely. The annual payment to Missouri is about $130 million. As part of the deal, Missouri passed a law that required all nonparticipating tobacco companies to pay into an escrow fund. This was done in part to ensure that small cigarette makers didn’t gain a market advantage because they would be able to sell cigarettes at reduced prices. But there was a catch. If a state failed to "diligently enforce" the requirement that small companies make escrow payments, and the big tobacco companies lost a set amount of market share as a result, that state would lose a portion of its tobacco settlement money. According to a state auditor, that’s exactly what happened. The big tobacco companies lost an 8 percent market share from 1997 to 2003. As a result, the companies sued Missouri and other states for violating the settlement. In 2013, an arbitration panel found that in Missouri, of the 432 million cigarettes sold by nonparticipating manufacturers in 2002, companies made escrow payments on only $102 million. The panel ruled against Missouri and five other states, meaning the Show-Me State had to pay back $70 million from its 2014 payment. In February, Koster negotiated an agreement with the tobacco companies to return $50 million to Missouri — on the condition the state tighten the rules on the smaller cigarette makers. Which brings us to the loophole. Under current Missouri law, the smaller companies can trim the amount they pay into the escrow fund. Missouri is the only state that has yet to take steps to prevent this. The loophole The way escrow payments are calculated, small tobacco companies can get most of the money they pay back if they restrict their sales to only a few states. In order to close the loophole — and return $50 million to Missouri — the legislature would have to pass Senate Bill 1096. The bill would require all nonparticipating manufacturers to either join the master settlement or be subject to modified escrow rules which prevent the companies from gaming the system to keep their escrow money. SB 1096 has supporters on both sides of the aisle, but it is not without its opponents. Small tobacco companies have been fighting different versions of the bill for more than a decade, calling it a tax on their products and a move on the part of big tobacco to earn more market share at their expense. SB 1096 has yet to pass either chamber of the General Assembly, and the consequences are already being felt. Because the bill failed to pass before April 15, Missouri can no longer receive the $50 million for 2016. In order to receive the money in 2017, the bill must be signed by Gov. Jay Nixon by June 3. Taxpayer impact The loophole is the source of Koster’s $50 million figure, but will recouping the loss actually save taxpayers money? It certainly has cost the state. In October, Nixon withheld $46.1 million of the state's budget, relying on the passage of SB 1096 to fill the gap. Turner said that money would have gone to the Mental Health Department and the Department of Social Services, among others. For these programs to be maintained at their initial levels, Turner explained, taxpayers would be forced to cover the money lost in the tobacco arbitration. Gaining the $50 million dollars would allow those programs to remain uncut without costing the taxpayers any additional money. All things being equal, if the bill passes, taxpayers would win no matter what the state does with the money. If it’s spent on services, citizens get the benefit of $50 million worth of services. If the state cuts spending and lowers taxes, they save money when they file their taxes in April. And that’s just in 2017. If the loophole isn’t closed, Missouri could lose additional money in the years to come. The big tobacco companies have begun arbitration concerning Missouri’s diligent enforcement of the escrow laws in 2004. If an arbitration panel were to find against Missouri again, the state could be forced to forfeit more money. If SB 1096 passes, the companies would not seek arbitration for any of the years 2004 to 2014, per Koster’s agreement. Our ruling Koster said that closing the tobacco loophole would save Missouri taxpayers $50 million. The tobacco settlement and the arbitration that followed is complicated, but ultimately, Koster did reach a settlement to return $50 million dollars to Missouri. If the legislature passes SB 1096 by June 3, that money would come to the state in 2017. If it doesn’t, the state could potentially be on the hook for even more. Any money the state received would be dollars that taxpayers would not have to provide. Taxpayers could get $50 million worth of services or $50 million in tax cuts. Either way, they come out ahead. We rate this claim True.	None	Chris Koster	None	None	None	2016-05-06T11:20:38	2016-04-14	['None']

pomt-11359	"Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/apr/03/jose-carrillo/Austin-150-people-day-growth-hundreds-people-leave/	An activist questioning plans to include a U.S. citizenship question in the 2020 Census warned that if fewer Texans fill out the decennial survey, the state could be shorted government aid and full representation, both tied to population counts. "Additionally, I want to just emphasize the growth of Texas," Jose Carrillo of the NALEO Educational Fund said at a March 28, 2018, Texas Capitol press conference. The fund is part of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. "Just in the Austin MSA alone," Carrillo said, "150 people move here every day. So those folks need resources, and government needs to provide those resources." MSA means metropolitan statistical area. It’s been a spell since we’ve fact-checked how many people flock to the state's capital and stick around. But in 2014, we found Mostly False a claim that 110 people a day were moving to Austin alone. That figure was in the ballpark for the number of people moving to the five-county region, as Ryan Robinson, the city demographer, reaffirmed in a 2018 statement he emailed to our renewed inquiry. We concluded before, though, that Austin alone was netting perhaps 40 to 60 additional residents a day. Carrillo cites net growth So, what’s the latest in population changes in the region encompassing Travis, Williamson, Hays, Caldwell and Bastrop counties? By phone, Carrillo told us he got his tally from the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce. The chamber’s Beverly Kerr subsequently told us she drew on the latest annual U.S. Census Bureau estimate that as of July 2017, the Austin-Round Rock MSA’s population totaled 2,115,827, up 55,269 from 2,060,558 the year before. That breaks out to regional growth of 151 people a day over the 12 months taking into account both people coming from other places and local births continuing to outpace deaths, Kerr and Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, each advised by email. In the MSA, the bureau says, births over the 12 months outpaced deaths by 16,791, with the difference accounting for 46 of the region’s 151 new residents a day. Put another way, net migration into the region occurred at a rate of 105 residents a day. In reality, Kerr wrote, "a good deal more than 105 people or 150 people move to Austin each day, but a lot of people move out, too." Fewer people leave We asked both experts to speak solely to Carrillo's focus on people moving into the region. Kerr noted that the bureau’s 2016 American Community Survey estimated that 129,119 of 2,030,464 Austin-Round Rock region residents over 1 year old had moved to the area in the same year from a different region or from abroad--which breaks out to a (gulp-inducing) 354 incoming residents a day. Potter noted separately that per five-year ACS estimates, 211 people a day moved out of the Austin region to another U.S. locale; the survey doesn’t tally people who’ve left for another country. All told, Potter said by email, the five-year ACS results suggest the region was netting 138 people a day in the period, counting more than 350 new residents a day. It's worth stressing that the approximately 350 new residents a day estimate is one-sided in that it doesn’t take into account people leaving the region. Potter counseled too that the ACS count was based on annualizing responses to surveys and then statistical weighting of responses, meaning there’s sampling error at work, he said. "In sum," Potter wrote, "I think it is most accurate to say there were, on average, 151 additional residents per day between July 1, 2016 and July 1, 2017 and that on average, 105 of the additional residents are the result of net-migration." Our ruling Carrillo said: "Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day." The five-county region’s population grew by 151 people a day in the 12 months up to July 2017, according to the latest annual federal estimate. This growth was mostly due to people moving in outpacing people leaving the region with a third of the net growth tied to local births outpacing deaths. But specific to what Carrillo said, Census Bureau work rooted in surveys taken in the five years through 2015 suggests that about 350 people a day were moving into the region. It's worth stressing, though, that this figure doesn't account for people who (inexplicably) skedaddled. We rate Carrillo’s statement, accurately recapping the region's latest growth, Mostly True.

pomt-05695	"They're paying a less rate of tax -- these richest people in America -- than they have in the last 80 years."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/11/steve-rothman/congressman-steve-rothman-claims-wealthiest-americ/	As U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman recently told workers at a small business in Bergen County, the middle-class must pick up the tab for wealthy Americans paying their lowest income tax rate in 80 years. The congressman pointed to that reduced tax rate during a campaign video posted Feb. 13 on YouTube, where he is seen talking to employees of Lanzo Plumbing in Hackensack. "If these guys and gals making over a million dollars a year...won’t pay their fair share because the Republicans are protecting them, that means working people and the middle-class and seniors have to pick up the tab for them. It’s crazy," Rothman (D-9th Dist.) said. "They're paying a less rate of tax -- these richest people in America -- than they have in the last 80 years." As PolitiFact New Jersey found, Rothman’s claim is off, but not by much. The federal income tax rate for the top income bracket stood at 35 percent in 2011, marking a lower statutory rate than during most of the last eight decades. But for five tax years -- 1988 to 1992 -- the top rates were lower than they are today, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service. Now, let’s trace the evolution of the top income tax rate. In 1931, the top rate was 25 percent on taxable income greater than $100,000. The following year, the top rate increased to 63 percent on income above $1 million, and then grew in 1936 to 79 percent on income greater than $5 million. The top rate remained at 70 percent or greater through 1980 -- and exceeded 90 percent during World War II and from the early 1950s to the early 1960s. By 1988, the top rate fell to 28 percent and stayed there through 1990. For 1991 and 1992, the top rate rose to 31 percent, and then increased to 39.6 percent for tax years 1993 to 2000. In 2003, the top rate reached its current level of 35 percent. So, for most of the last 80 years, the top statutory rate has been higher than it is today, with the exception of tax years 1988 to 1992. Since various tax deductions can reduce an overall tax bill, we also looked at actual taxes paid as a percentage of one’s income. According to a June 2010 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the top 1 percent of households, on average, paid 19 percent of their income in federal income taxes in 2007. That figure was lower than amounts paid in 25 of the 28 years between 1979 and 2006, according to the budget office. It’s worth noting that as a group, the top 1 percent were covering a larger share of federal income taxes in 2007 than they did in 1979. Still, based on taxes paid as a percentage of income, Rothman’s claim is mostly on target. Paul Swibinski, a consultant to Rothman’s campaign, told us the congressman’s statement was "‘close enough.’" But he argued that Rothman was "speaking off the cuff" and said scoring him as "‘partially truthful’" would send the wrong message. "Steve was being completely genuine and completely honest," Swibinski said in an e-mail. "Do we want our politicians to parse every single word they say -- just go around repeating the same words over and over because it's ‘safe’ ??? That would seem to me to contradict the purpose of Politifact." Our ruling In a YouTube video, Rothman claimed the wealthiest Americans are paying a lower tax rate "than they have in the last 80 years." We looked at two measures -- the top statutory income tax rates and taxes paid as a percentage of one’s income. In both cases, Rothman’s statement is slightly off, but his overall point about current income tax rates is solid. The top statutory rate is lower now than during most of the last eight decades, and the top 1 percent of households were paying a smaller percentage of their income in federal income taxes as of 2007 than in nearly all of the previous 28 years. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Steve Rothman	None	None	None	2012-03-11T07:30:00	2012-02-13	['United_States']
pomt-12368	"China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this (Paris) agreement."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-paris-accord-china-and-coal-pla/	Even as President Donald Trump defiantly withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, he described it in contradictory terms. "As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country," he said June 1. An agreement cannot be both nonbinding and draconian at the same time. It’s one or the other. Trump continued to blur the difference when he compared the obligations of China and the United States under the deal. "China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants," Trump said. "So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement." We asked the White House to tell us what part of the Paris agreement gave China permission to build coal-fired plants and what part banned them for America. We did not hear back. What’s really in the Paris agreement The international declaration is big on the word "should" and light on the word "shall." As Boston College law professor David Wirth wrote in 2016, the distinction is crucial. "Even the most cursory review of the text of the Paris Agreement discloses a careful, purposeful alternation between the mandatory 'shall' — indicating a binding obligation governed by international law — and the hortatory 'should' — nonbinding statements of strictly political intent without legal force," Wirth wrote. The agreement says nations shall say publicly how much they will aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and they shall report their progress. It’s up to each country to come up with its own plan, called a Nationally Determined Contribution, to meet the overall goal to limit the world’s temperature to 1.5 degrees centigrade over pre-industrial levels. But then it says signatory countries "should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies." In other words, the public plan and reporting is a must-do, but the actual doing is optional. Of importance to Trump’s comparison, the agreement treats developed and developing countries differently: "Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties." Comparing Trump’s words to the agreement Wirth told us that Trump’s words are technically inaccurate. "Nobody is allowing China to do anything, and nobody is prohibiting China from doing anything," Wirth said. "And the same is true for the United States." The agreement never uses the word coal, much less spells out how many coal-fired plants any country can build. As for China’s blueprint for what it plans to do, it does give itself until 2030 for its greenhouse gas emissions to peak. In contrast, the U.S. blueprint says "the United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below its 2005 level in 2025." Critics of the arrangement point to China’s rising emissions as evidence of a fundamental unfairness. As Trump put it, the Chinese "can do whatever they want for 13 years." Again, Trump’s language gives more legal weight to the agreement than it actually has, but he also overlooks other parts of China’s plan that aim to "control total coal consumption," and to increase the use of renewable energy supplies. China said it would reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 60 to 65 percent below 2005 levels, and increase the share of non-fossil energy to around 20 percent. And to get there, it would start changing its policies today. As a practical matter, China’s carbon dioxide emissions have held steady for the past three years. China just halted the construction of 103 new coal-fired power plants, and its energy agency at the start of the year announced plans to pour more than $360 billion into renewable energy by the end of the decade. Wirth said that regarding coal-fired power plants, the Paris agreement creates diplomatic pressure for countries to move away from coal, but doesn’t mandate it. "Either China or the United States can build as many power plants as they want as long as they are offset in other sectors," he said. "It was framed that way so as to give governments maximum flexibility to meet the goals they set for themselves." Our ruling Trump said that the Paris agreement allows China "to build hundreds of additional coal plants," while the United States can’t. The White House offered no legal argument to back that up, and the text of the agreement fails to support it. The Paris agreement never mentions the word coal, and in Trump’s own words, it is nonbinding. It forces neither China nor the United States to do or not do anything. China’s voluntary plan to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions does allow emissions to rise until 2030, but it also moves the country away from reliance on coal, and the tangible results have been the cancellation of over 100 new coal-fired plants. Neither the law nor realities on the ground support Trump’s statement. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02339	Says some Georgians can get health insurance for $105 a month.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/25/kathleen-sebelius/low-cost-insurance-available-subsidies/	U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius was in Atlanta recently, encouraging young Georgians to join a health insurance exchange before the March 31 deadline and suggesting that reasonably priced plans are out there. In a speech that later made it to YouTube, she said some Georgians can get a plan for as low as $105 a month. "Here in Atlanta, if you’re 27 years old and make $25,000 a year, you can find a plan that would cost you $105 a month," she said. Sebelius acknowledged that some people might be skeptical. After all, she said, it’s hard to get a pair of decent running shoes or a monthly contract for cellphone service at that price. Knowing that what’s affordable to one person might be out of reach for another, we decided to run her statement on premium prices through the Truth-O-Meter. At HealthCare.gov, we were able to confirm that, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, such premiums do exist. We found, for example, that a 27-year-old living in Cobb County and making $25,000 a year can qualify for the lowest bronze plan and $105-a-month premiums. But there are several caveats to consider. The premium we found is after a monthly tax credit of $61. The maximum out-of-pocket expenses for that Cobb resident will be $5,200, which for some can be, or seem, cost-prohibitive. And lastly, plan costs can vary widely across the state. Information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows plans available to a 27-year-old living anywhere in Georgia, in some cases, for as low as $142 a month (basically catastrophic coverage), $179 a month (the lowest bronze plan), $208 a month (the lowest silver plan), $221 a month (second-lowest silver plan) and $242 a month (lowest gold plan). Should that same person qualify for a tax credit, he or she could obtain the lowest bronze plan for $103 a month and the second-lowest silver plan for $145 a month. The lowest bronze plan in the Atlanta area would be $105 after the tax credit, according to HHS. As of March 1, 139,371 people have actually signed up for a marketplace plan in Georgia. Of those, 85 percent qualify for federal subsidies, HHS data show. According to Region IV of HHS in Atlanta, qualifying health plan providers in Georgia are: Ambetter from Peach State Health Plan; Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield; Humana Insurance Co.; Humana Employers Health Plan of Georgia Inc.; and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Georgia. William Custer, the director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, said, by comparison, the average monthly premium for a single person with an employer plan is $490, with 75 percent of the employees paying at least 25 percent, or $122 or more, out of their own pocket. Generally, group plans are richer than plans in the individual market, Custer said. But, he said, according to a Kaiser/HRET Survey from 2013, 43 percent of employer plans with an out-of-pocket maximum have an out-of-pocket max of $4,000 or more. For 12 percent, there is no maximum on the out-of-pocket, Custer said. Sebelius’ statement is "true on the face of it," he said. "There is a plan for $105, and there are other plans that offer more coverage with a modest increase in premiums," Custer said. A single person making $25,000 could buy a silver plan for $144 a month, regardless of where he or she lived in Georgia, even though the full premium could vary considerably and vary more here than in other states, he said. For example, a 25-year-old living in rural Miller County and making $25,000 a year can apply his or her subsidy, which is based on a silver plan, to a bronze plan and have coverage for $78 a month with a $4,000 deductible, he said. The Affordable Care Act limits out-of-pocket costs under any plan to $6,350 annually for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Humana offers a silver plan in the Atlanta market for $128 a month with an out-of-pocket maximum of $4,750, Custer said. But how will it play? "Health insurance is expensive, so the costs of coverage for individuals may seem unaffordable even with the subsidies available," Custer said. John Crew, a health care consultant who primarily works in rural parts of Georgia, said the high deductible creates a plan that is not usable for many consumers. "If someone making $25,000 a year purchases a plan with a $6,300 deductible, 25 percent of their gross income would go toward medical expenses if they ever needed significant health care services," he said. "Basically, they have purchased catastrophic coverage," he said. "Although preventive services are covered at no cost share to the patient, I don’t think that this plan would encourage the patient to get any sub-acute care." Crew also pointed out something that gave us additional pause about Sebelius’ claim. A plan that may cost $105 a month in Atlanta can cost much more in other parts of the state. Why? In the Atlanta area, there are at least three health care companies offering insurance, so there is a consumer-friendly marketplace that drives prices down. In much of Georgia, Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only health care provider, so those seeking health care have to pay its prices, he said. A spreadsheet Crew sent PolitiFact Georgia with federal marketplace health care plans offered in Georgia highlighted the differences. The price for bronze plans in the five largest metro Atlanta counties ranged from $166 to $243 a month. In some counties with one health care provider, the bronze plans ranged from $305 to $360 a month. The top prices for gold plans in counties with one provider were about 50 percent higher than similar plans in metro Atlanta counties. Custer said it would be burdensome for anyone earning $25,000 to have to meet the full deductible. But in that circumstance, a person would likely be facing a serious health condition, he said. "Without health insurance, they may not have access to adequate care at all," Custer said. Last year, HHS estimated that nearly 1.7 million Georgians were uninsured and eligible for coverage through the marketplace. Of those people, about 1.2 million, or 69 percent, had at least one full-time worker in the family, and 671,466, or 40 percent, were ages 19 to 34. Sebelius says, and data from HHS show, that health insurance is available to some Georgians for as little as $103 to $105 per month, with a qualifying tax credit. But for others, the premiums can be much higher. Some of these policies come with high deductibles that experts worry could discourage people from seeking medical attention. That’s something only time may tell. It’s also some context we believe is necessary to fully examine this claim. Sebelius’ statement is accurate but needs some context to be fully understood.

pomt-04959	"Thousands (in China) owe their jobs to Mitt Romney's companies."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/25/priorities-usa-action/pro-obama-super-pac-ad-says-thousands-chinese-work/	This week, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC aligned with President Barack Obama, released an ad that uses the trappings of the Olympics to make snarky attacks on Mitt Romney. Against a backdrop of Olympic opening-ceremony footage -- including shots of Romney when he headed the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City -- the ad knocks Romney for allegedly outsourcing jobs and using offshore accounts. "Welcome to the Olympics," the voiceover says. "There’s Mitt Romney, who ran the Salt Lake City games, waving to China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney’s companies." The announcer continues with claims about countries where Romney has had bank accounts or corporations. In this item, we’ll look at the claim that "thousands (in China) owe their jobs to Mitt Romney's companies." We -- and other fact-checkers -- have looked at some aspects of this issue before. But this claim merely states that thousands of Chinese citizens were employed by companies affiliated with Romney -- a much easier threshold of accuracy to meet, though also an activity that’s not as politically controversial as outsourcing. When we contacted Priorities USA Action, a spokesman provided documentation that cited five companies -- picture-frame maker Holson Burnes; computer chip manufacturer ChipPAC; information technology companies Modus Media and E5; and GT Bicycle. For each company, we’ll ask two questions: Is it accurate to call them "Mitt Romney’s companies"? And did the company have operations in China? Holson Burnes • Was it a Mitt Romney company? Yes, as our friends at FactCheck.org have noted, "Except for a brief leave of absence to run for U.S. Senate in 1994, Romney worked at Bain during the entire time that it owned the Holson Burnes Group, from 1987 to 1995." • Did the company have operations in China? Yes. In a 1993 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company said it "maintains foreign production arrangements with over 35 suppliers located in Far Eastern countries including China." ChipPAC • Was it a Mitt Romney company? Maybe. Romney left in February 1999 to run the Olympics. Bain agreed to purchase the ChipPAC one month later in March 1999; the sale was completed in August. It’s important to note that Romney’s departure from Bain has been a bone of contention between the two campaigns. Romney started Bain Capital in 1984, but did he depart in February 1999, when he joined the Olympics? Or was it in 2002, when he negotiated a retirement agreement that was retroactive to February 1999, according to the Associated Press? In a previous fact check, we took a middle ground. We concluded that Romney was not actively involved in the day-to-day management of Bain after 1999, but his influence at the company didn’t drop to zero. We think that applies to ChipPAC because it was purchased soon after he left for the Olympics. • Did the company have operations in China? Yes. According to a March 16, 1999, article in the Korea Herald, "ChipPAC has factories in Korea and China." Modus Media • Was it a Mitt Romney company? Yes. As FactCheck.org noted, Modus Media "was created in December 1997 as a subsidiary of another Bain-controlled company, Stream International Holdings Inc. Modus became an independent company in January 1998." That was during Romney’s undisputed tenure with the firm. • Did the company have operations in China? Yes. An SEC filing from 1999 notes that the company had a facility in China. The Romney campaign has noted that "many" of the company’s products "were manufactured in the United States and exported as retail packaged products. Others were produced at international locations closer to the end users." GT Bicycles • Was it a Mitt Romney company? Yes. The Romney camp acknowledges that Bain invested In GT Bicycles In November 1993. • Did the company have operations in China? It depends on your definition of "operations." The Romney camp acknowledges that Bain "acquired a company that already had been sourcing certain component parts abroad for years." An SEC filing said that "large orders are shipped in containers directly to these distributors from the company's Taiwan and People's Republic of China suppliers," and that "the company's business is highly dependent on products manufactured by foreign suppliers located primarily in Taiwan and Japan and to a lesser extent the People's Republic of China." But to us, that sounds more like a client relationship than one in which Chinese workers were actually GT employees. This strikes us as a weaker connection. E5 • Was it a Mitt Romney company? No. The connection between E5 and Romney is easily the weakest of any on this list. An article in the trade publication Private Equity Week said the company was founded in October 2001. Bain got involved in mid-2002 when an affiliate, Bain Capital Ventures, invested $4 million, the publication reported. That was toward the end of the 1992-2002 period when Romney may have had a limited role with the company. A Romney adviser told POLITICO that the E5 investment took place "well after the time (Romney) had any input into investments" at Bain: "He didn’t have any involvement in this particular deal." • Did the company have operations in China? Yes, but only after Romney was well out of the picture. Bain’s investment was designed to "develop our China capabilities," E5 CEO Gordon Brooks told Private Equity Week, and could have only happened after Romney was gone from the company. Two more questions • Did these companies collectively employ "thousands" of people in China? It’s plausible. Just counting the three companies where the case is strongest -- Holson Burnes, ChipPAC and Modus Media -- it’s certainly possible that they had employees in the thousands. But nothing we’ve seen reported confirms that, including Priorities Action USA’s backup material. • Do they employ thousands in China today? This is only relevant because the ad says, "Thousands (in China) owe their jobs to Mitt Romney's companies" -- note how "owe" is in the present tense. But this is an even more speculative claim than whether these companies ever employed thousands of workers. Here, too, Priorities Action has not provided sufficient evidence. Our ruling Two of the companies cited by Priorities Action USA employed workers in China during Romney’s active years as CEO. Another employed workers in China after Romney left to work for the Olympics, but before he severed ties with the company entirely. Two other companies are of questionable relevance for proving the ad’s point. It’s plausible that the first three companies we looked at employed "thousands" of workers in China, but we haven’t seen definitive evidence of that -- much less whether they do today. And Priorities USA Action has not provided sufficient evidence to prove the claim is accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True. UPDATE: Shortly after we posted our item, readers informed us that the ad has been taken down from YouTube and from the Priorities USA Action website. It later became clear that it was taken down after pressure was applied by the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. Last we checked, it's still available here, but by the time you read this, it may be gone.	None	Priorities USA Action	None	None	None	2012-07-25T17:38:01	2012-07-25	['China']

pomt-11735	Says "Obama’s deadliest cover-up (in an explosion that killed 29 miners) has been uncovered" by internal government documents.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/11/don-blankenship/convicted-w-va-mining-ceo-falsely-says-government-/	Don Blankenship, the convicted executive in one of the country’s deadliest mining explosions, is running for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia, and his first television ad aims to clear his name. "Obama’s deadliest cover-up has been uncovered by MSHA’s own documents," the ad said. "Documents which say the MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) Upper Big Branch internal report was fixed." Blankenship, running as a Republican, spent a year in jail for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found that under his leadership as CEO of Massey Energy, the company systematically refused to take steps that would have prevented a deadly combination of methane gas and coal dust that left 29 West Virginia miners dead in 2010. He has always insisted that the fault lies with federal mining regulators who forced the company, he said, to use a defective ventilation system. No investigation, and there have been several, has reached that conclusion. "The mine operation, not MSHA, caused the explosion," said one independent report. Multiple inquiries found that Massey Energy knew there was risk that methane gas could build up in an active mining location in the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, W. Va. The company had also been warned that it needed to do more to reduce the levels of combustible coal dust there. The company maintained two sets of records of conditions in the mine. The one it shared with government inspectors listed fewer problems than the one it kept for internal purposes. In one tragic moment, dull blades used to cut free coal created enough heat to ignite gas and coal dust. The explosion that followed killed 29 people. But Blankenship’s ad presents a series of statements to suggest foul play by the government. After saying an internal report was fixed, the ad shows an image of an internal MHSA document that says "MSHA was responsible for a defective ventilation plan at UBB." The ad goes on to say "documents were shredded," and that "government corruption is pandemic." If, as the ad says, the government’s own documents prove that the internal review was "fixed," then those documents ought to be available. Greg Thomas, spokesman for the Blankenship campaign, told us this ad, along with another, refers to internal government emails the campaign received "in the last couple of weeks from a very reliable source." "At this juncture, we’re not going to release the emails," Thomas said. When we asked why the campaign wouldn’t release the emails, Thomas at first said he didn’t know, but later explained that "we want everybody (in the government) to come out and stick to their story." Thomas said the emails might be shared at some point, and when they were, they would show how the government covered up its role in the mine disaster. A search of the government’s internal report, an independent assessment of that report, and the West Virginia governor’s independent panel investigation produced nothing to support Blankenship’s statement. We plugged the key quotes into the Nexis database of news reports. Again, nothing. Davitt McAteer, former head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, led the special investigation team created by West Virginia’s governor. McAteer told us that Blankenship is "incorrect." "I would have known whether the agency report was fixed," McAteer said. "It was not." The agency report criticized agency staff, saying they "did not follow established Agency policies and procedures." Inspectors failed to spot deficiencies in some of the mine operations and didn’t look closely enough at company records of problems that had gone uncorrected. McAteer’s group took a harder line on the Mine Safety and Health Administration. "Despite MSHA’s considerable authority and resources, its collective knowledge and experience, the disaster at the Upper Big Branch mine is proof positive that the agency failed its duty as the watchdog for coal miners," the report said. Another review by the U.S. Labor Department, which oversees the mine safety agency, echoed that, saying "if MSHA had engaged in timely enforcement of the Mine Act and applicable standards and regulations, it would have lessened the chances of -- and possibly could have prevented -- the UBB explosion." None of this points to a whitewash of the government regulator’s contributing role in the accident. However, every investigation put Massey Energy at the center of the conditions that produced the disaster. "Massey, through its subsidiary Performance Coal Company, violated numerous, widely-recognized safety standards and failed to prevent or correct numerous hazards that ultimately caused the catastrophic explosion," the government’s accident report said. "The evidence accumulated during the investigation demonstrates that PCC/Massey promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety, including practices calculated to allow it to conduct mining operations in violation of the law." Our ruling Blankenship produced an ad that said the Obama administration’s internal review of the Mine Safety and Health Administration’s role in a deadly mine explosion was "fixed." The ad said the government’s own documents revealed "Obama’s deadliest cover-up." Blankenship’s spokesman claimed to have emails that proved the point, but said the campaign would not share them. An extensive review of multiple government reports, plus a search through a database of thousands of news articles produced no supporting facts. The head of an independent investigation said he had come across nothing that pointed to a fix. In fact, his group’s report along with one other sharply criticized government regulators for failing to crack down on the abuses of Blankenship’s company. There is no substance to this claim and the campaign did not provide anything that would back it up. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-12545	"When Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/18/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-wrong-voter-turnout-hit-20-year-low/	Was voter turnout in the 2016 presidential election at a decades-long low? Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran in the Democratic primaries before losing the nomination to Hillary Clinton, said so during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union on April 16, 2017. In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Sanders said, "You know, tomorrow afternoon, Tom Perez, who is the chair of the Democratic Party, and I will be taking a nine-state tour all across this country to do what I think is absolutely necessary. And that is to help revitalize American democracy. So many of our people are giving up on the political process. It is very frightening. In the last presidential election, when Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years. And in the previous two years before that, in the midterm election, we had the lowest voter turnout in 70 years." He’s right about the midterm election of 2014, but he’s far off regarding turnout for the 2016 presidential election. We turned to a widely trusted source for voter turnout statistics -- the United States Elections Project -- run by political scientist Michael McDonald of the University of Florida. There are different ways to measure voter turnout, but McDonald tends to favor the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot for the highest office contested that year. In presidential election years, that would mean the president. McDonald has compiled data on voter turnout going back to the 1700s. Here’s the rundown: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com According to this chart, voter turnout percentages have settled into a range between the low 50s and the low 60s since the early decades of the 20th century -- well below what it was during most of the 1800s, but above what it was in the country’s first few decades of existence. But on Sanders’ specific point, the final turnout figure for 2016 -- 59.3 percent -- amounted to a middling result for the past 20-year period, which is the time frame he used. It was lower than the 2004 and 2008 turnout figures, but it exceeded the turnout rate for 1996, 2000, and 2012. Looking back even further, the 2016 turnout rate is actually even more impressive. You’d have to go back to 1968 to find a year other than 2004 and 2008 in which voter turnout was higher than it was in 2016. And 1968 was the last election before a constitutional amendment took effect guaranteeing that all 18-year-olds could vote. So, starting in 1972, millions of teenagers were added to the denominator in the voter turnout calculation, a change that tended to depress the percentage somewhat in the elections that followed. Using the turnout among the voting-eligible population tends to be a more useful measurement than the percentage of the voting-age population that cast a ballot, because the latter statistic counts ineligible voters in the denominator, including noncitizens and felons whose voting rights have not been restored. Because noncitizens and felons don’t have a choice about whether to vote or not, turnout statistics that include them aren’t as enlightening as those about just the voters who have a choice about whether to vote. Still, even if you use voting-age population instead of voting-eligible population, Sanders isn’t correct. In 2016, the turnout rate using that measurement was 54.7 percent. While that trailed the rates for 2004 and 2008, it exceeded the rates for 2000 and 2012. Our friends at FactCheck.org noted that Sanders may have been thinking about preliminary -- but inaccurate -- news reports shortly after the election that indicated that voter turnout in 2016 would hit a two-decade low. The counting of late-arriving ballots, such as those from the growing number of states that rely heavily on mailed-in ballots, rendered such assertions moot. Sanders’ office did not respond to an inquiry. For the record, Sanders' statistic for the 2014 midterm elections was accurate. Turnout among eligible voters was about 36 percent in 2014 -- the lowest since the 33.9 percent in 1942, when the nation was fighting World War II. Here is McDonald’s full data set for midterm elections. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Sanders said that "when Trump won, we had the lowest voter turnout in 20 years." That’s not correct. In 2016, turnout was lower than it was for two of the elections in that span (2004 and 2008) but it was higher than it was for three others (1996, 2000 and 2012). We rate his statement False.

pomt-05748	Rhode Island has the "the second-most heavily deployed National Guard in the United States."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/02/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-rhode-island-has-se/	On Feb. 24 at Quonset State Airport, in a scene that has played out time and again over the last decade, members of the Rhode Island National Guard were given a send-off before being deployed to active duty. Public officials paid tribute to the eight members of an Army National Guard unit leaving that day for Kuwait. Among the officials was U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who praised the soldiers for "serving with great distinction" and then shared a fact about the Rhode Island National Guard. Despite hailing from the smallest state in the nation, he said, "they are the second most heavily deployed National Guard in the United States." We have heard this claim made before about the Rhode Island National Guard -- in Journal stories and in speeches by state officials -- and decided to find out whether it’s really true. To be clear, although he didn’t say it at the ceremony at Quonset, Whitehouse was referring to per-capita deployments. That phrase -- per-capita deployments -- is what he used in a speech on the Senate floor in November, and it is the same language used by other public officials, including former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy. Whitehouse’s office told us they got the information on deployments from the Rhode Island National Guard and directed us to a letter to the editor published Dec. 15 in The Bristol Phoenix to mark the 375th anniversary of the National Guard. "Rhode Island, with slightly more than 3,200 National Guard members, has the nation’s second highest per-capita deployment rate as we have answered the call to more than 5,600 deployment requests," Maj. Gen. Kevin R. McBride, adjutant general of the Rhode Island National Guard, wrote in the letter. Lt. Col. Denis J. Riel, spokesman for the Rhode Island National Guard, told us the information came from a Department of Defense document that looked at per-capita deployments for each of the nation’s 50 states and 4 territories. Specifically, the analysis, which Riel said was released before 2010, divided the number of deployments for each state or territory by its number of Guard personnel. Riel tried to track down a copy of the document for us, but couldn’t find it. "I can assure you that the Senator has heard us repeat this fact multiple times and we were likely the source of it," he said in an email. We called the National Guard Bureau in Arlington, Va., and asked whether it or another branch of the Department of Defense had indeed done a state-by-state analysis of deployment rates. While we waited for a response, we tracked down a per-capita analysis of Army National Guard deployments done in 2007 by the National Journal, a nonpartisan magazine on politics. (Air National Guard troops were not included because they typically deploy for short periods instead of the 12-month or longer deployments normal for the Army Guard, according to a story that explained the analysis.) The analysis used National Guard data to look at overseas deployments from Sept. 11, 2001, onward. It took into account multiple deployments by any individual service member -- if a soldier was deployed twice, he or she was counted twice. Hawaii topped the list with 976 deployments for every 1,000 soldiers in its Army National Guard. Rhode Island came in second with 883 deployments per 1,000, followed by South Dakota, Maine and Washington state. According to the magazine, the 350,000-member Army National Guard had deployed soldiers a total of approximately 190,000 times nationwide, for a national average of about 550 deployments per 1,000 soldiers. Populous states, such as Texas or California, were far down the list of deployments per capita, while smaller states were generally near the top. The reason for the high rates of deployments in some states and not others had to do with the types of units in each state. "National Guard forces in different states have different kinds of units," the National Journal’s story says. "Some states have more infantry brigades or military police; others have more artillery or tank units. ... Historical accident, local tradition, and varying levels of education among a state's population also factor into the mix. Some kinds of units are in high demand for Iraq and Afghanistan; other types are called up much less frequently." Hawaii had a high rate because it has a concentration of combat arms units. South Dakota’s rate was also high because it has engineers, artillery soldiers and transportation units, all of which were heavily needed in Iraq. And what about Rhode Island and its 3,200 Guard members? "... our force structure here in [Rhode Island] is unique in that we have what are commonly known as combat support units which are typically called into the fight with direct combat units," Riel, the Rhode Island National Guard spokesman, said in an email. "These are Field Artillery, Military Police, Combat Engineers, General Purpose helicopters, and on the Air Guard side, Tactical airlift and combat communications units." According to Riel, more Rhode Island Guard members have been deployed since 9/11 than any other individual conflict since the Civil War. Seven Rhode Island Army National Guard units, totaling 540 soldiers, are currently deployed in Kuwait and Afghanistan. Our ruling The National Journal analysis is five years old, but we couldn’t find any new study of deployment rates that had been done since then. (We never heard back from the National Guard Bureau.) If the rates in other states increased in a similar fashion to Rhode Island’s -- and there’s no reason to believe they didn’t -- then the rankings in 2007, in all likelihood, are the same today. Rhode Island then would still have the second-highest number of deployments per capita in the nation. Lacking any evidence to the contrary, we rate Whitehouse’s claim True.

pomt-03480	"We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/13/christine-whitman/christine-todd-whitman-claims-clifford-case-was-st/	New Jersey could be poised to make political history twice in four months. The first historic moment came last week when Gov. Chris Christie appointed state attorney general Jeffrey Chiesa to serve as an interim senator after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg died June 3. Chiesa is a Republican – a political party that hasn’t represented New Jersey in the U.S. Senate in nearly two generations. In the meantime, Christie has scheduled a special primary for Aug. 13. Four Democrats and two Republicans have filed to run in the primary. A special general election is scheduled Oct. 16, when history could be made again if voters send a Republican to the Senate. The historic possibility wasn’t lost on former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who discussed it June 4 during an interview on the John Gambling radio show. "We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator," Whitman said. Whitman’s claim is on target, but she’s not quite correct. Let’s review some history. Democrats have held both of the state’s Senate seats for more than three decades, PolitiFact New Jersey determined earlier this year after Christie claimed during a speech at the libertarian Cato Institute that the state was coming up on the 40th anniversary of the last time voters elected a Republican – Case -- to the Senate. Case started his fourth six-year term in the Senate in 1972 and lost a bid for re-election in the 1978 GOP primary to Jeffrey Bell. Bill Bradley, a Democrat, defeated Bell in the 1978 general election, starting the Democratic dominance of New Jersey’s two Senate seats. But Case wasn’t the last Republican to represent New Jersey in the Senate. That distinction goes to Republican Nicholas Brady, who was appointed to a Senate seat in April 1982. Then-Gov. Tom Kean appointed Brady to fill in for Democrat Harrison Williams Jr., who was forced to give up his Senate seat after bribery and conspiracy convictions stemming from a federal corruption probe called ABSCAM. So Case was the last Republican senator actually elected by New Jerseyans to the Senate, but Brady was the most recent Republican to serve the Garden State in the Senate prior to Chiesa’s appointment. We make that distinction because Whitman didn’t. Brady, who would go on to serve as U.S. Treasury secretary in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, stepped down in December 1982 after Lautenberg won that year’s general election for the Senate, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term. Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before retiring. He returned to the Senate two years later and served until his death. In addition to Chiesa, who said he will not run in the special election, Democrat Robert Menendez also represents New Jersey in the Senate. He was re-elected in November. Whitman spokesperson Heather Grizzle said the former governor declined comment. Our ruling Whitman said during a radio interview, "We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator." Brady was the last Republican to serve in the Senate, for eight months in 1982, prior to Chiesa’s appointment. Before that, Case was the last Republican that New Jersey voters elected to the Senate. Since Whitman referred to the ‘last’ Republican senator to represent New Jersey, that title goes to Brady. We therefore rate the former governor’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-05871	"Nationwide tuition at public universities is up almost 300 percent ... in the last 20 years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/09/joe-biden/joe-biden-college-tuition-rose-300-percent-over/	Vice President Joe Biden spoke at Florida State University in Tallahassee about a proposal by President Barack Obama to make college tuition more affordable. Obama proposed giving less federal aid to students who go to colleges that increase costs. But Florida’s public universities already have some of the lowest rates in the nation, even though state legislators may hike tuition, as they have done in the past several years. College students and administrators fear that Obama’s plan means that Florida schools would be penalized even though they boast low prices -- 45th in the nation. During his visit on Feb. 6, 2012, Biden acknowledged that the problem in Florida isn’t as critical as it is nationwide. "Nationwide, tuition at public universities is up almost 300 percent. You are an exception here at Florida State. But it’s up almost 300 percent in the last 20 years," Biden said. Later in response to a question by a student about tuition Biden said: "We are looking forward to make sure the next 20 years they don’t increase 300 percent again. …FSU has great professors. You started from a very low tuition base, and therefore you have gone up slightly, but that is nowhere compared to other schools that started high and went higher." That figure -- a nationwide increase of 300 percent over 20 years -- is massive so we wanted to check if it was right. Source of 300 percent figure We turn to the College Board’s Trends in College Pricing 2011 report for an answer. (The College Board is a nonprofit association of universities and colleges; it also owns the famous SAT test.) Their report is based on surveys sent to nearly 4,000 post-secondary institutions across the country and historical data from the U.S. Department of Education and National Center for Education Statistics. The prices are averages paid by students for one year of full-time enrollment. For the 1991-92 school year, tuition and fees at a four year public university on average were $2,107. They climbed to $8,244 in 2011-12 -- an increase of about 291 percent. (Figures are for tuition and fees but not room or board.) The College Board also provides data in "constant dollars," which are adjusted for inflation. Those numbers showed an increase from $3,495 to $8,244, or about 136 percent. Biden used the more dramatic figure here -- the nearly 300 percent based on the numbers not adjusted for inflation. (And technically, these figures include 21 years of data, not 20, but we won’t count off for that.) We asked Jennifer Ma, co-author of the Trends in College Pricing report, to explain the difference between current and constant dollars and if one is a better resource. "Numbers in current dollars are not adjusted for inflation and numbers in constant dollars are adjusted for inflation," Ma wrote in an email. "We usually use numbers in constant dollars to show the increases beyond the rate of inflation. The constant dollars numbers make it easier to compare prices over time. … However, people sometimes talk about prices in current dollars." Florida’s tuition Since Biden was discussing national policy while visiting Florida, it’s worth looking at tuition at Florida’s four-year public colleges compared to the rest of the nation. During 1991-92, the state’s tuition for public four-year colleges was $1,484 -- about seven states had a lower dollar amount. By 2011-12, tuition rose to $5,626, an increase of 279 percent. That was a higher rate of growth than about 24 states. (The U.S. Department of Education sent us a chart based on data from the National Center for Education Statistics and the College Board.) We don’t really know yet what the federal plan means for Florida. Biden is right that Florida has lower tuition compared to other states, but even Florida has seen prices go up significantly in recent years. Our ruling Biden said "Nationwide, tuition at public universities is up almost 300 percent ... in the last 20 years." The College Board’s data shows that between 1991-92 and 2011-12, it increased by about 291 percent for public four-year universities in current dollars -- one valid way of measuring tuition hikes. Adjusted for inflation, however, tuition hasn’t gone up quite that fast -- it’s up 136 percent. So we rate Biden’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-14868	Georgia is one of the 10 most tax-friendly states for retirees.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/nov/13/Kiplinger-com/georgia-tax-friendly-state-retirees/	State tax breaks on retirement income from pensions and investments are saving older Georgians about $864 million this year. They also may be adding to the Peach State’s appeal. "Georgia is one of the 10 most tax-friendly states for retirees," Kiplinger.com, publishers of personal finance advice and business forecasts, said in a press release on Monday, October 26th. We know how the state loves a rosy ranking. Remember Gov. Nathan Deal appearing gleeful when, running for re-election campaign, he could point to Georgia’s naming by Site Selection magazine as the nation’s No. 1 state for business climate? Seeing the Kiplinger rankings we wondered: Is the Peach State really giving money-conscious retirees a reason to feel all warm and fuzzy? We decided to check. Kiplinger.com actually says Georgia ranks as the fifth most-friendly tax state behind Alaska, Wyoming, Nevada and Mississippi and immediately ahead of Delaware, Arizona, Louisiana, South Dakota and Florida. Several state tax policies factored into that ranking, including Georgia’s exemptions from estate, inheritance and Social Security taxes, as well as its 4 percent statewide sales tax. Also cited was the state income tax break we mentioned earlier. This exclusion allows a retiree who is 65 year or older to shield from state income taxes up to $65,000 in pension or investment income a year if single, $130,00 a year if married. It helps younger retirees -- ages 62 to 64 -- too. They are exempt from state income tax on as much as $35,000 of most types of retirement income, $4,000 in wages Retirement income includes interest, dividends, net income from rental property, capital gains, royalties, pensions, annuities and the first $4,000 of earned income, such as wages. By comparison, Kiplinger picked Alaska as true tax haven for retirees. Alaskans pay no state income or state sales taxes. Each permanent Alaska resident receives an annual dividend check from the state’s oil wealth savings account. In 2014, the dividend check was $1,884. Real estate is taxed in Alaska, but homeowners 65 and older, or surviving spouses 60 and older, are exempt from municipal taxes on the first $150,000 of the assessed Georgia’s been helping seniors for years In his eight years in office, Gov. Sonny Perdue persuaded lawmakers to cut and eventually eliminate the state income tax on retirement income. Perdue and supporters hoped the move would attract well-to-do retirees to Georgia and away from states, such as Florida, where there is no state income tax. Having 750,000 retirees on his side -- always a powerful voting block -- didn’t hurt. But in 2012, lawmakers decided it would be too costly to go through with Perdue’s plan to wipe out state income taxes for retirees, arguably one of his greatest legacies They settled on the current cap and pushed it through as part of the Georgia Jobs and Family Tax Reform Plan of 2012. Even reduced, it "is one of Georgia’s largest tax exemptions," Wesley Tharpe, senior policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute said."It is a very expensive proposition for the state." Seniors definitely get a good deal in Georgia, especially wealthy retirees with pensions and IRAs, Tharpe said. The exclusion is structured so the benefits "disproportionately go to wealthy retirees," he said. The higher income earners, he said, can draw $60,000 from an IRA in a year and not face any state income tax on that money. But a person trying to supplement his or her Social Security by taking a $10,000-a-year job is only sheltered from state income taxes on the first $4,000 of earnings and has to pay on the other $6,000 in wages, Tharpe said. But does Georgia really have the nation's fifth friendliest tax policy for retirees? On the rankings Norton Francis, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute’s State and Local Finance Initiative, said the ranking is likely "pretty much true," largely because of Georgia's generous pension exemption. But both he and Carl Davis, research director with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said they questioned whether the Kiplinger rankings took into account that local governments in Georgia can levy up to a 4 percent sales tax, including on groceries. Davis said those taxes on groceries could be more significant to seniors than the state's estate tax exemption. He also expressed concern that the most-to-least rankings ignore the diverse nature of retirees. " A low-income senior living on Social Security is impacted by state and local taxes in a very different way than a middle-income person collecting a pension or a very high-income person living off their investments," Davis said. Kiplinger, he said, appeared to have used a subjective process to evaluate the states, something Sandra Block, senior associate editor at Kiplinger’s Personal Finance acknowledged. "The fact that they did not assign formal weights to different tax parameters is problematic and makes a full review of their rankings impossible," Davis said. Block said it’s "precisely because retirees are a very diverse group that we’re reluctant to assign weights to different types of taxes. " Instead, we try to provide as much information as we can on the taxes most seniors pay so that individuals can draw their own conclusions," Block said. Francis and Davis said state tax policies aren’t likely to be a retiree’s primary consideration in deciding where to live. "Other things are going to matter more -- chiefly housing and energy costs," Davis said, adding that those are likely a retirees’ two biggest expenses. Several studies have examined whether these tax breaks motivate senior citizens to relocate. One study, in 2012 by University of New Hampshire economist Karen Smith Conway, found "no credible effect of state income tax breaks on elderly migration." Conway said the research "should give pause to those who justify offering state tax breaks to the elderly as an effective way to attract and retain the elderly." Our ruling: Kiplinger.com, publishers of personal finance advice and business forecasts, said Georgia is one of the 10 most tax-friendly states for retirees. Georgia actually placed 5th on its list, although the ranking doesn’t appear to take into account local sales taxes. Georgia’s tax breaks also do more for higher income retirees than for those in the middle and lower ranks. That’s important context the reader needs. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-06389	"Under Barack Obama's watch, we have expended $805 billion to liberate the people of Iraq and, more importantly, 4,400 American lives."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/31/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-us-spent-805-billion-iraq-lo/	During an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Oct. 28, 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sought to blame President Barack Obama for the costs and lives lost in Iraq. Here’s the exchange: Bachmann: "My main challenger right now is Barack Obama. That's who I'm focused on. His economic policies are a disaster, and his foreign policy is even worse. Under Barack Obama's watch, we have expended $805 billion to liberate the people of Iraq and, more importantly, 4,400 American lives. President Obama just had his hat handed to him by the Iraqis, who have essentially kicked him out and our people out of Iraq while Iran is waiting in the wings. So Iraq is essentially kowtowing to Iran. Iran is seeking to have a nuclear weapon. They want to wipe Israel off the face of the map, and they want to use a nuclear weapon against the United States. And the president said sure, we'll get out. So, the president has done nothing to secure America's safety and security. He's been a disaster on foreign policy." Blitzer: "But as far as Iraq is concerned, the Iraq War, which started in March 2003 -- that was President Bush and the Republicans who launched that war that went on for years. This current president is now withdrawing all of those troops from Iraq. Don't you give him credit for that?" Bachmann: "Wolf, the current president is being kicked out of Iraq. The president of the United States has gotten nothing." Blitzer: "You want those troops to stay there?" Bachmann: "This is a bipartisan effort --" Blitzer: "Do you want those troops to stay in Iraq?" Bachmann: "Wolf, this was a bipartisan effort when the decision was made regarding Iraq. I wasn't in Congress at that time, but this was a bipartisan effort. This was not just a Republican effort. What President Obama has failed to do is secure the gains that America paid for with an extremely dear cost -- 4,400 American lives, nearly a trillion dollars in expenditures, and we have nothing to show for it. And we may look at (an Iraqi) government which has admitted they cannot secure the peace. …" There’s a lot here, but we thought we’d check whether it’s accurate to say that "under Barack Obama's watch, we have expended $805 billion to liberate the people of Iraq and, more importantly, 4,400 American lives." After Bachmann said that, Blitzer pushed back, noting that "the Iraq War, which started in March 2003 -- that was President Bush and the Republicans who launched that war that went on for years." Though Bachmann didn’t acknowledge Blitzer’s point about the timing of the war in the interview, Blitzer was right to press her. From 2003 to early 2009, President George W. Bush was commander-in-chief overseeing Iraq. Only in January 2009 did Obama take over. So how do the statistics for money and lives break down between the two presidents? For dollar figures, we turned to a report by the Congressional Research Service titled, "The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11," published on March 29, 2011. Through March 18, 2011, the cumulative enacted dollars spent on the Iraq war from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2011 was $805.5 billion. So that’s where Bachmann’s figure came from. But that covers at least six fiscal years during the Bush presidency. It's a ridiculous exaggeration to attribute all that spending to Obama. (There’s been additional spending under Obama since March 18, 2011, but not nearly enough to bring his total up to $805 billion.) For deaths, we turned to an independent monitoring organization called iCasualties.org, which is considered a credible source of such data; here’s some background on the group. The group found that a total of 4,482 Americans have lost their lives in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003. Once again, Bachmann is close with her number but way off on attributing responsibility. Of those deaths, approximately 261 came on Obama’s watch, or about 6 percent of the total. Our ruling Bachmann’s numbers are essentially on target, but she errs badly in blaming Obama for all $805 billion spent and 4,400 American lives lost in Iraq "on his watch." Most of the money spent and lives lost in Iraq came during George W. Bush’s presidency. The idea that Obama -- who wasn’t even in the Senate until two years into the war -- is responsible for all the costs and casualties in Iraq is ridiculous. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-00226	Says that Steve Watkins "bragged to voters that he built his company from scratch, but it was all a lie."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/11/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/kansas-dem-attack-steve-watkins-only-partially-acc/	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently aired a tough ad against Republican congressional candidate Steve Watkins, who is locked in a competitive race with Democrat Paul Davis for the House seat in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District. The ad is based on a Kansas City Star investigation that found Watkins did not own and build a business from the ground up when he was in the Middle East, as he had claimed several times on the campaign trail. The ad’s text: "Steve Watkins caught lying again. For months, Watkins bragged to voters that he built his own company from scratch, but it was all a lie." It is accurate that Watkins did not build and own the company— VIAP Inc. — as he has been quoted. However, the Democrats' ad takes the rhetoric too far saying it all was a lie. He did oversee an arm of the organization that had just started, and grew that outfit to several hundred people. What has Watkins actually said? On more than one occasion on the campaign trail, Watkins has said that he started a small business and grew it from "three people to 470 people." "I started an engineering and security company, paramilitary company, that did work strictly for the U.S. government," Watkins said during one June GOP meeting. "This was in Iraq and Afghanistan. We grew to a number of countries. We grew from three people to 470 with me as the principal during that growth period." The business he was referring to is VIAP Inc., a spinoff of Versar Inc., a global project management firm based in Washington. Watkins didn’t own the company, but he did appear to work there during a high-growth phase. He never owned it Versar International Inc. was formed in January 1997, according to incorporation filings in Delaware. Watkins graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point in 1999. Watkins’ federal financial disclosure forms also don’t list VIAP as an asset but do show him earning income from Versar, under which he is listed as a consultant. According to the forms, he received $27,819 as earned income from the company in 2018 and $45,216 in 2017. The Star spoke with several Versar company officials who did not recall or remember Watkins. One Versar CEO from 2000 to 2010, Theodore M. Provic, told the paper he’s "nobody that I’ve heard of." Watkins actually joined the existing company as a contractor in 2004, according to company officials. But he wasn’t off on everything Watkins did, in fact, work for VIAP in Afghanistan and Iraq during dangerous times and helped grow his outfit from a small team to hundreds, according to Brian Arbuckle, a former military colleague of Watkins. Arbuckle, who is is now vice president of engineering and construction management at Versar, sent a response to the Star at the request of the Watkins’ campaign. PolitiFact obtained a copy, which Arbuckle stressed is not an official statement from Versar. He confirmed that VIAP (which stands for Versar International Assistance Projects) was a newly developed name and business line that Versar created between 2004 and 2005, when Watkins joined the team. "The name and organizational structure were new to Versar and were developed by a small team of professionals that set up and grew our business in conflict/post conflict environments," Arbuckle wrote. "The initial core team included me, Steve Watkins, and three other leaders." He said that Watkins started working for Versar in Iraq in 2004 where he and a small team started, developed and grew international operations under the name VIAP and led teams of hundreds of professionals that provided engineering and construction quality assurance services in the Middle East. What the Watkins’ campaign says Bryan Piligra, Watkins’ campaign spokesman said in an email that Watkins helped form a three-man engineering and security outfit to over 470 people operating in two war zones. "Steve has said countless times to media and voters throughout the district that the firm was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded, U.S. company," Piligra wrote. "He helped start it and grow it, operationally. Prior to the involvement of Steve and two other individuals, it did not exist from an operational standpoint." Our ruling The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Watkins’ lied to voters about building a company from scratch. We found that Watkins did not own or build the company, VIAP, from the ground up in the Middle East, as he claimed to voters in the past. He did, however, oversee and expand a small team into hundreds during his time in Iraq and Afghanistan under a new arm of Versar. Watkins did exaggerate his background with the company, but he did work there when it was growing. The DCCC says it was "all a lie," but that’s an exaggeration, too.

pomt-14628	"Last year, there were an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up, it would be a three-story building."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/29/ben-carson/ben-carson-stacked-total-pages-regulations-2015-ar/	There are too many government rules stifling small businesses, said neurosurgeon-turned-Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson at a Fox News debate in Des Moines, Iowa. "Last year, there were an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations," he said at the Jan. 28 debate. "If you stack that up, it would be a three-story building." A few readers asked us if Carson’s claim was accurate, both the number of pages and subsequent height, so we decided to take a crack at it. Ream by ream Carson’s 81,000 pages figure refers to the number of pages that were published in the Federal Register, a daily journal of the U.S. government that contains agency rules, proposed rules and public notices. In each edition, the Register posts a running tally of the pages printed so far the year. The final total at the end of December is often used as a gauge of regulatory activity during the year. The Federal Register’s final tally for 2015 was 82,036 new pages of regulations, just over the figure Carson cited. According to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market-focused policy group, this is a record. So far in Obama’s term, the government has published 555,882 pages of new regulations total. During the comparable period of former President George W. Bush’s term, the Register published 533,593 pages. Carson is right that 82,036 pages stacked up would, in fact, just about reach the height of a three-story building. Using standard printer paper as our gauge — 250 pages per inch — 82,036 pages would be about 330 inches tall, or 27 feet. Carson’s campaign sent us the same arithmetic. But there’s a big catch to these numbers: A large percentage of these pages don’t actually contain regulations or final rules. Deeper meaning The Register also includes notices about agency meetings and public comment periods, presidential documents and other items that are not considered rules. From 2010 through 2014, just 31 percent of pages actually contained rules, according to Federal Register data. Overall Register page counts "may not be an accurate proxy for regulatory activity or measure of regulatory burden for several reasons," the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in November 2014 report. The report noted that many of the pages "typically have little, if anything to do with federal regulations," and many pages dealing with final rules don’t contain any regulatory language but rather explanations about public comments on the rule. The CRS noted, for example, that a 2013 rule enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act filled 137 pages, but only 16 pages detailed the rule itself. The Register page count is often cited because it’s easy to find, Cary Coglianese, a law professor and director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, told PolitiFact Virginia for a similar fact-check. "I wouldn’t use it as an indication of the level of regulation because it’s so prone to having so much else in it," Coglianese said. "The other thing to keep in mind is, just because you know something about the number of pages, (that) doesn’t tell you the wisdom of having those pages. It might be those pages are helping to save people’s lives or keeping banks from failing or airplanes from crashing." Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, was also leery of citing the page count, telling PolitiFact Virginia that it’s his "least favorite" way to measure regulation. Other analysts have said the overall page count gives a general idea of the country’s regulatory environment, including one from the conservative American Enterprise Institute and another from the libertarian Cato Institute. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact Virginia for a 2011 article that the annual page count "as a very broad measure" indicates more regulatory activity now compared to past years. Our ruling Carson said, "Last year, there were an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up, it would be a three-story building." The Federal Register published a little over 81,000 pages in 2015, and this many pages stacked on top of each other would reach about three stories high. However, many of these pages do not contain regulations. In recent years, only about 31 percent of Register pages contain final rules. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09498	"Florida leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/dan-gelber/gelber-claims-florida-leads-nation-elected-officia/	In a blog posting and press conference on Feb. 8, 2010, Florida attorney general candidate Sen. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach, said it was time to take aim at a "culture of corruption in the state of Florida." Gelber said he supports legislation to make the willful nondisclosure of a financial conflict a criminal offense, and said that as attorney general, he would push for more manpower to investigate public corruption. "For those few officials who end up exploiting their public offices for personal gain, it’s time to get serious," Gelber said in his blog posting. "Florida leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes." We asked Gelber where he got the statistic about Florida leading the nation in elected officials charged with crimes, and he referred us to a Dec. 13, 2008, story in the New York Times. The story cited a Department of Justice report that found that in the decade ending in 2007, Florida had the highest number of convictions in federal public corruption cases at local, state and federal levels. We checked out the Department of Justice statistics, and updated the tally to include the most recently available figures for 2008. And over the decade ending in 2008, Florida remained atop the list of states when it comes to the sheer number of public corruption convictions, with 794. Rounding out the top five were California, with 728; New York, 662; Texas, 624; and Pennsylvania, 555. Those also happen to be five of the six most populated states. You might expect the most populated states to have the highest number of corruption cases. So we also compiled a list of the most public corruption convictions on a per capita basis. By that measure, Florida comes in at No. 10. Topping the list was Alaska, followed by North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana and Montana. There are lots of ways to slice and dice statistics, Gelber told PolitiFact, and he was referring to the sheer number, rather than per capita. Florida is fourth in population, he noted, but first in volume of corruption cases. "That suggests we're outperforming our size," Gelber said. North Dakota and Alaska are so lightly populated, he said, that one big prosecution with lots of defendants could greatly skew their rankings. Indeed, Florida ranks higher per capita than any of the other 10 most populated states. When you've got as many people as Florida, he said, "You don't get to be No. 1 unless you’re working every day at it." You have to have a "tradition" of corruption, he said. We think per capita is probably the fairest way to rank states, but our bigger issue with Gelber's statistic is that he said Florida leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes. The Department of Justice report is not just about elected officials, but rather all local, state and federal officials (the great majority of them unelected), as well as private residents, convicted in public corruption cases. The Department of Justice does not compile statistics on just elected officials charged with crimes, said Mark Motivans, a spokesman for the department. Neither does the FBI, said spokesman Stephen G. Fischer Jr.. In other words, no one can say for sure which state leads the nation in elected officials charged with crimes. Gelber, a former federal prosecutor who has handled a number of public corruption cases, said the statistic is still valid. "The corruption of the government is the corruption of the government," Gelber said, whether it be an elected official or a restaurant inspector or building department employee getting a kickback. "It could be anyone who has the public trust." The issue, he said, is how many people do you have looking at public corruption in Florida. And in his opinion, the answer is not enough. "I think we probably need more bodies," Gelber said. The Department of Justice statistics go a long way toward bolstering Gelber's argument about public corruption in Florida. Florida has had a higher number of public corruption convictions than other similar-sized states. That's not good. But Gelber misstates the statistic by saying that Florida has the highest number of elected officials charged with a crime. That's not what the DOJ report tracks. Rather, Florida has the highest number of people convicted of public corruption crimes, only a fraction of whom are actually elected officials. And again, while it's certainly valid to note that Florida leads the nation in the sheer number of public corruption convictions, we think that when it comes to ranking states, it makes more sense to look at per capita rates.

pomt-13555	"One third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/aug/25/lamar-smith/mostly-false-lamar-smith-claim-one-third-federal-i/	A San Antonio congressman, already on record in support of Donald Trump for president, told Texas delegates to the Republican National Convention that Trump’s on target characterizing some immigrants as criminals. U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said at the Texas delegation’s July 17, 2016, breakfast in Cleveland that Trump "knew what he was talking about. One-third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants. They have committed some of the most worst crimes; they have committed the rapes and the murders and everything else." We wondered if indeed one-third of federal prisoners were in the country without legal authorization. Not so, we ultimately found. Smith was citing a slightly outdated figure of individuals sentenced to the federal pen in a given year, not the total federal prison population. Right off, we suspected Smith was off base. Our June 2016 fact check of a different claim took note that as of April 2016, nearly 80 percent of the federal system’s approximately 195,000 inmates were U.S. citizens; 15 percent were citizens of Mexico, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. A bureau breakout up to date as of late July 2016 showed the citizenship percentages to be about the same; so, you’d expect inmates living in the country without legal authority to comprise an even smaller share of the prisons’ population. Yet Smith spoke before that breakout was posted. When we asked his House spokeswoman, Jennifer Pett, the basis of his claim, she said by email that he was referring to "illegal alien" immigration statuses shown for nearly 37 percent of individuals sentenced to federal prison in the fiscal year running through September 2014, as shown in a chart from the U.S. Sentencing Commission. This turned out to be the latest-available breakdown we could find of incoming prisoners by immigration status. According to the chart, 58 percent (43,479) of the 74,911 individuals that year were U.S. citizens. Otherwise, the chart notes 27,505 "illegal" residents sent to prison plus 3,017 foreigners living here with legal permission, 206 people under extradition and 704 individuals with unknown statuses. Of the "illegal" residents, 20,333 — 74 percent of them — were primarily sentenced for immigration violations, not violent crimes, according to the chart. Nine unauthorized immigrants were primarily convicted of murder, 50 of assault, 19 of sexual abuse, the chart shows. Next, we inquired into the share of federal inmates, as Smith put it, who are currently held after living in the country absent legal permission. On behalf of the sentencing commission, which gathers information on federal crime and sentencing issues, spokeswoman Christine Leonard confirmed the validity of Smith’s fiscal 2014 chart. Leonard said the agency hasn’t posted a similar analysis for the fiscal year running through September 2015. But in fiscal 2015, she pointed out, 29,166 noncitizens--not necessarily living in the U.S. without legal permission--accounted for 42 percent of the 70,255 people sentenced to federal prison. According to the fiscal 2015 chart, 19,240 of the sentenced noncitizens, 66 percent of them, were primarily sentenced for immigration violations. Among 9,926 noncitizens primarily convicted of a non-immigration violation, 62 were primarily convicted of assault, 24 of sexual assault, 15 of murder, the chart indicates. We also asked the Bureau of Prisons for the percentage of undocumented immigrants among the entire federal prison population — the group that Smith singled out in his statement. No such data are available, spokesman Justin Long advised us by email. But the bureau does tally the proportion of inmates by citizenship status--and noncitizens have recently accounted for 22 percent of all inmates. We sought a longer view. Long replied with numbers indicating the share of noncitizens among federal inmates has gradually decreased. Noncitizens comprised nearly 30 percent of inmates in September 2000; 27.3 percent in September 2005; 25.4 percent as of September 2012 and 22.4 percent as of September 2015, similar to the 22 percent of late, Long said. Still, could it be there’s been fluctuation with the share of immigrant-inmates spiking some months? Doesn’t look like it. Since January 2016, Long replied, the greatest monthly share of noncitizens among inmates was 21.9 percent, the least 21.6 percent. Next, we asked outside experts why it’d be that noncitizens make up 22 percent of inmates of late despite the fact that "illegal aliens" accounted for nearly 40 percent of the people sentenced to federal prison in fiscal 2014. Their consensus: The standing population of inmates reflects a good number of prisoners serving longer sentences while most noncitizens sent to prison were convicted of immigration crimes, which mostly entail shorter sentences. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration, summed up by email: "With immigration offenders, there is high volume but shorter sentences, so faster turnover, which translates to a smaller percentage of the average daily population" in prison. Meantime, Julie Samuels of the Urban Institute pointed out an institute chart showing that people convicted of immigration violations in fiscal 2014 accounted for a greater share of people sent to prison than they did of the total prison population: SOURCE: Report, "Transforming Prisons, Restoring Lives Final Recommendations of the Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections," the Urban Institute, January 2016 Another authority, Nazgol Ghandnoosh of the Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, pointed out that as of the end of December 2014, some 69,000 of the 1.6 million state plus federal prisoners were noncitizens, per a September 2015 report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, though we noticed that report lacked counts for several states including California. After we circled back to Smith’s office with the figures we’d found, Smith’s deputy chief of staff, Chris Philp, said by email that Smith had meant to tell the delegates that "one-third of federal sentences go to illegal immigrants, not that one-third of federal prisoners are illegal immigrants." Our ruling Smith told his fellow Texans: "One third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants." Not so. Rather, this figure ties to the 37 percent share of individuals sentenced to prison in fiscal 2014 who weren’t legally living in the country--and there doesn't appear to be a more recent breakdown. More to the point, the government doesn’t sort all inmates by immigration status, which leaves us with its guidance that as of mid-2016, 22 percent of inmates weren’t U.S. citizens. It seems logical to conclude that unauthorized residents comprised a smaller share of all the prisoners. We rate Smith’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-05329	On whether humans contribute to global warming	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-and-whether-humans-are-causing-climate/	Do humans contribute to global warming? There’s been a robust debate over whether Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on this question. In this item, we’ll try to determine whether he has. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. Romney’s campaign website is silent on climate change. But in Romney’s 2010 book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, he wrote that "I believe that climate change is occurring — the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to factors out of our control." Then, in a town hall in New Hampshire in June 2011, a voter asked Romney whether he thought climate change existed and was caused by human activity. Here’s part of Romney’s answer (the full exchange can be seen on C-SPAN starting at the 21:00 mark): "I don't speak for the scientific community, of course. But I believe the world is getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don’t know how much our contribution is to that, because I know there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past, but I believe that we contribute to that. So I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." Romney added that he opposed the United States unilaterally adopting a cap-and-trade plan if other countries weren’t taking similar steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. A cap-and-trade plan would require industry to pay for their carbon emissions with new permit fees. There would be a limited amount of permits (the "cap"), but companies would be able to buy and sell the permits among themselves (the "trade"). Later, in an Aug. 24, 2011, event in Lebanon, N.H., Romney said, "Do I think the world's getting hotter? Yeah, I don't know that, but I think that it is. I don't know if it's mostly caused by humans. … What I'm not willing to do is spend trillions of dollars on something I don't know the answer to." And Romney discussed the issue in an Oct. 3, 2011, interview with reporters and editors of the New Hampshire Union Leader. (It was recorded here by C-SPAN; check around the 22-minute mark.) Romney said, "One, I believe what I said before, I think it's getting warmer. Two, I believe we contribute to it. And three, I don't know by how much -- a lot or a little. And so I am not willing to adopt multi-trillion dollar programs to reduce greenhouse gases in America. They don't call it America warming, they call it global warming." Both the book excerpt and the three New Hampshire comments suggest pretty clearly that Romney sees a role for humans in climate change, though he’s less committal about how large an impact humans are having. But at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pa., a few months later, Romney offered a somewhat different perspective. His comments were videotaped and promoted by the liberal advocacy website Think Progress. A voter asked Romney, "What is your position on man-made global warming and would you reject legislation, such as cap and trade, which is based on the idea of man-made global warming?" "My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us. My view with regards to energy policy is pretty straightforward. I want us to become energy secure and independent of the oil cartels. And that means let’s aggressively develop our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear power." Much of Romney’s underlying policy proposals -- reducing foreign oil dependence; increasing the use of natural gas and nuclear power; and opposing cap-and-trade -- remained the same in both comments. But this time he left out human activity as a cause of global warming. Rather than saying, as he had in the past, that we don’t know how much of a role humans are playing in climate, Romney said, "We don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet." After Romney’s remarks were widely reported, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Boston Globe that Romney was not flip-flopping. "This is ridiculous," she said in a statement. "Gov. Romney’s view on climate change has not changed. He believes it’s occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn’t know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor." We were unable to find any remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not. Our ruling In June 2011, Romney said he believed "the world is getting warmer" and that "humans contribute to that." In October 2011, by contrast, Romney said that "we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet." It’s unclear to us whether this was an inadvertent omission or a calculated attempt to say divergent things to different audiences. Because Romney, in our view, is savvy enough to know the difference between suggesting a human role in climate change and leaving it out, we think it’s reasonable to perceive Romney as taking two distinct stances in these two statements. We rate this a Half Flip.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-05-15T16:03:01	2011-10-27	['None']

pomt-09852	"I just want to assure [you] we're not talking about cutting Medicare benefits."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/14/barack-obama/obama-claims-medicare-benefits-will-not-be-cut-und/	"I just want to assure [you] we're not talking about cutting Medicare benefits." Those were President Barack Obama's words to a town hall audience in Portsmouth, N.H; they were meant to ease fears that health care reform will slash Medicare benefits and deprive seniors of the treatments and procedures they need. A "myth that we've been hearing about is this notion that somehow we're going to be cutting your Medicare benefits," Obama said on Aug. 11, 2009. "We are not. AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare, okay? So I just want seniors to be clear about this, because if you look at the polling, it turns out seniors are the ones who are most worried about health care reform. And that's understandable, because they use a lot of care, they've got Medicare, and it's already hard for a lot of people even on Medicare because of the supplements and all the other costs out of pocket that they're still paying." "So I just want to assure we're not talking about cutting Medicare benefits," Obama said. Listening to Obama, you'd think that Medicare will remain intact. Yet, others claim Medicare spending will be trimmed quite a bit. AARP has said about $231.4 billion could come out of Medicare's budget, while the 60Plus Association, a group that opposes the bill, says cuts could top out at $500 billion. Confused? We were, too. There are three versions of health care reform floating around the House, and each dedicates hundreds of pages to Medicare. For this Truth-O-Meter item, we're going to be focusing on the biggest changes to the program. (So far, the Senate Finance Committee, which holds the purse strings to all things health care, hasn't put any ideas on paper.) Before delving into the bill and Obama's claim, a little Medicare 101: There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plan), which are run by private insurers. They typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. We found some disagreement about whether Obama is correct that Medicare benefits would not be cut. The House bill will not cut any benefits, said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "What it will do is cut growth in Medicare spending," Neuman said. Indeed, some of the biggest savings in the bill — about $196 billion — would come from a permanent reduction in the annual payment adjustments for some Medicare services, including inpatient hospital services and ambulatory care, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That doesn't mean health care providers will stop being paid for taking care of the elderly; rather, they won't see pay increases in the future. Obama also wants to save money on the Medicare Advantage program, which covers about one-fifth of all Medicare patients. "We do think that systems like Medicare are very inefficient right now, but it has nothing to do at the moment with issues of benefits," Obama said in his speech in New Hampshire. "The inefficiencies all come from things like paying $177 billion to insurance companies in subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage that is not competitively bid, so insurance companies basically get a $177 billion of taxpayer money to provide services that Medicare already provides. And it's no better — it doesn't result in better health care for seniors. It is a giveaway of $177 billion." Indeed, a June 2009 MedPAC analysis said that the Advantage plan costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. The House bills propose to change the benchmarks that set the payments, making them equal to what the government pays for traditional Medicare services. According to the Congressional Budget Office, those changes would translate to a savings of $156 billion over 10 years. We asked experts from both sides of the debate whether all these changes constituted a cut, and most had the same answer: yes and no. On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, they said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. For instance, the bill would require the pharmaceutical industry to help pay for prescription drugs. That savings will ultimately help the government cover more drug benefits for more patients. But experts told us the cuts in the Advantage program could lead to some changes. The basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same, but the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage could be changed. "The core benefits of Medicare won't change," said Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, an advocate for health care consumers. "Most [Medicare Advantage] plans are solid and resemble traditional Medicare." However, some insurance plans have entered the program "to make a quick buck. They may have to reconsider their budget, which could mean some patients will see changes in the services provided above and beyond traditional Medicare." Stuart Guterman, assistant vice president for the Commonwealth Fund’s program on payment system reform, had a similar view. "People enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) get services that people in traditional care do not get under Medicare," he said. "Insurance companies can afford to cover these services because taxpayer money is subsidizing them. Plans will most likely not offer those extra services, but in no case will [patients] get less Medicare benefits than people in the rest of the program." Another example involving regular Medicare coverage: The House bill proposes a $20 billion cut in hospital readmission subsidies. This has to do with patients who re-enter the hospital to be retreated or have procedures fixed. Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, said this is just one example of how cuts to Medicare payments could ultimately trickle down to patients. "Most of the ways to get money with any certainty is to have it happen quickly, which you do by either raising taxes or whacking prices," said Wilensky, now an economist and senior fellow with Project Hope, a health care advocacy group. "In this case they're whacking prices. ... Are these patients in jeopardy? You can't guarantee they're not." That leaves us with Obama's claim that, under the health care reform proposal, Medicare benefits will not be cut. He's right that the bill does not directly trim Medicare benefits; instead, the government is proposing ways to slow or eliminate some Medicare spending to beef up other aspects of the plan. But experts told us it's conceivable or even likely that those financial changes could lead to reduced benefits, particularly for people in the Advantage program. From that perspective, it's a stretch for Obama say that Medicare patients won't see changes in their plans as a result. We give Obama a Half True.

pomt-09714	When it comes to aid, "the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/30/bono/bono-claims-us-gives-about-half-aid-europe/	With all due respect to the musical prowess of Bill Clinton and Mike Huckabee, we think this is the first time we've checked a bona fide rock icon with our Truth-O-Meter. But U2's Bono is no ordinary rock star. He's also a political activist, using his pop status to advocate for African aid and AIDS relief. Which is how Bono came to be asked by an Associated Press music writer what he thought about President Barack Obama with regard to funding the fight against AIDS in Africa. "The Obama administration is just getting going," Bono said. "(He) has promised to double aid over the next years, because even though (President George W.) Bush tripled it ... the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage, and I think he knows that's not right." We decided to check whether Bono was right that "the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage." This turned into a tricky fact-check because Bono appears to have interchanged two different funding issues in his comment: global HIV/AIDS relief and foreign aid. Bono says Obama has promised to "double aid over the next years." Obama has pledged to increase AIDS funding, but not double. He has, though, promised to double foreign aid by 2015. In the same sentence, though, Bono then says President Bush "tripled it." The "it" there is the U.S. commitment to global AIDS relief (not foreign aid). So when Bono said "the United States is still about half as what European countries give as a percentage," is he talking about AIDS relief or foreign aid in general? The folks at ONE (the organization co-founded by Bono to fight extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa) said Bono was talking here about foreign aid in general — he has used this statistic in the past. And on that front, Bono is on pretty firm ground. The key qualifier there is "as a percentage." Because the U.S. government distributes more in foreign aid than any other country, by far. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international group of the world's 30 leading industrial countries, reports that in 2008, the United States distributed about $26 billion in net official development assistance. The next closest country was Germany, at nearly $14 billion, and the United Kingdom, with about $11.4 billion. But considered as a percentage of gross national income (which is essentially the more familiar gross domestic product plus or minus income from other countries), you'll have to go to the bottom of the list to find the United States. We note that none of the countries gives more than 1 percent of GNI. The U.S. gave 0.18 percent. By comparison, here's how some of the European biggies fared: United Kingdom, 0.43 percent; Germany, 0.38 percent; France, 0.39 percent; Spain, 0.43 percent. In other words, it's fair to say the United States is providing about half as much development assistance as European countries, as a percentage of GNI. There are a lot of other factors to consider when it comes to foreign assistance, though: debt reduction, trade, money from private foundations, to name a few. Suffice to say, you can look at this data in countless ways. And some groups that have attempted to quantify foreign aid on some of these various factors have found the United States to be on par with its European counterparts. But we think it's certainly fair for Bono to cite this statistic from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and had he been clear that he was talking about foreign aid, his statement would have been largely accurate. But that was not at all clear. In fact, based on the context of his comments, most people would probably conclude that Bono was talking about global AIDS relief , and that the United States only gives about half as much as Europeans "as a percentage." And that is not right. In fact, in 2008, the United States accounted for more than half (51.3 percent) of all the the global AIDs relief disbursed by governments around the world, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and UNAIDS. Even when standardized to account for the size of the countries' relative economies, the United States ranked fourth highest, well higher than most European countries. The only ones higher were the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Bono's homeland, Ireland. Again, some make strong arguments against the use of such rankings because, for example, they don't take into account private donations from foundations. When it comes to AIDS relief from foundations, the United States far outpaces Europe. That's because the United States provides generous tax incentives for such largess. So some argue the U.S. government ought to get credit for at least some of that funding. By any measure, though, Europe is not spending twice as much, "as a percentage," on AIDS relief than the United States. The Bush administration deserves a great deal of credit for that. In 2003, Bush initiated a $15 billion plan to address global AIDS relief, mostly for countries in Africa where the AIDS epidemic is staggering. And then in 2008, Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — more than tripled the HIV/AIDS relief budget to $48 billion over the next five years. Obama, meanwhile, pledged to provide at least $50 billion by 2013 for the global fight against HIV/AIDS. "The Bush administration showed real leadership on global HIV/AIDS," said Eric Lief, a senior associate with the Henry L. Stimson Center. "U.S. funding grew exponentially during the last eight years. Since 2001, the U.S. has funded a disproportionate share of global AIDS assistance. But global funding is still far short of anything close to global need. The Obama administration has committed to continuing the upward trend." As for foreign aid, the United States remains the world’s largest funder in terms of dollars spent, said Lief, who served on the State Department's policy planning staff under President Bill Clinton and was once a senior adviser with the U.N. Joint Program on HIV/AIDS in Geneva. "In other ways and by other measures, the U.S. falls short in terms of support for the developing world," he said. "Single-index 'rankings' of governments are overused politically. What we’re buying with foreign aid dollars is a much more important question than how much we’re spending, and the U.S. record is mixed." Now might be a good time to note that Bono appears to be doing wonderful work as a spokesman trying to draw attention to dire poverty and health issues in Africa. And one member of the PolitiFact team gives Bono's performance on the current U2 tour a big thumbs up. But our review of Bono's performance with this comment is more mixed. Again, if Bono had clearly switched gears and said he was talking about foreign aid when he said the United States only gives about half as much as Europe, as a percentage, he'd be right — at least according to one measure from the respected OECD. But in the context of the interview, Bono appeared to be talking about AIDS relief — in which case he'd be wrong. We checked with the AP reporter who did the interview, and it was her understanding that he was talking about global AIDS relief. At the least, by toggling back and forth between statistics on foreign aid and global HIV/AIDS relief, Bono left room for confusion. And so we rate him Half True.

pomt-00695	Texas agriculture is "at 98 percent efficiency" in water use and "just about maxed out as to what we can do on the conservation end of it."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/may/04/sid-miller/sid-miller-says-texas-farmers-just-about-maxed-out/	Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, said at a March 2015 symposium that farmers in the state have little room to save more water. Miller, responding to Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune, prefaced his claim by saying Texas is out of "surplus water." He went on to say that as much as the state has urbanized, agricultural production has surged — and all that with farmers needing less water. "So agriculture is at 98, according to the water development board, we’re at 98 percent efficiency," meaning 2 percent of water used to raise crops isn’t going to its intended purpose. "So we’re just about maxed out as to what we can do on the conservation end of it," Miller said. Luke Metzger of Environment Texas heard Miller’s statement and asked us to check it out. He noted too that a skeptical crowd member at the event asked Miller to explain. In reply, Miller said a lot of irrigation occurs underground, most runoff water is recaptured and most traditional irrigation methods have ebbed. "It’s pretty highly sophisticated," Miller said. Miller's basis To get our grip on his "maxed out" claim, we asked the Texas Department of Agriculture to elaborate. By email, agency spokesman Bryan Black provided a March 11, 2015, presentation by the Texas Water Development Board, whose mission centers on supporting the conservation and responsible development of water for Texas, stating Texas agricultural "producers now achieve up to 98 percent irrigation efficiency." Black later quoted a 2012 report from the Texas Water Resources Institute, based at Texas A&M University, stating: "Irrigation efficiency has gone from 60 percent to 88–95 percent in much of the state today, allowing Texas to get much more value and agricultural output from its water." Black said that according to the report’s lead author, the institute’s associate director, Kevin Wagner, "the most up-to-date number on irrigation efficiency is now around 98 percent." ‘Significant advances’ An institute press release on the report quoted Dana Porter, an AgriLife Extension agricultural engineering expert, saying that in Texas over the past few decades, "significant advances have been made in irrigation efficiency, as many irrigators now use high-efficiency advanced irrigation technologies, such as low-pressure center pivot sprinkler systems or subsurface drip irrigation. "However," Porter said, "challenges remain and there are opportunities for continued improvements in water use efficiency through application of situation-appropriate efficient irrigation technologies and best management practices, including irrigation scheduling, and through use of drought-tolerant crop varieties and integrated crop and pest management practices." According to the report, as of 2008, more than 6 million acres were irrigated in Texas--mostly in West and South Texas--accounting for more than 10 percent of the nation’s irrigated land. Total annual irrigation water use has remained steady, the report said, averaging approximately 9.5 million acre-feet, since the late 1970s. The report presented one path to a "98 percent" statement, saying: "Historically, most agricultural irrigation was applied using flood and furrow irrigation; however, most of the state has undergone a mass conversion from these systems to more efficient irrigation systems" topped by low-pressure sprinkler systems that apply water at or below a crop’s canopy, it said. Key section: "As of 2008, center pivot sprinklers are used on nearly 80% of Texas’ irrigated acres, and 87% of those acres are using low-pressure center pivot sprinklers. Furrow and flood irrigation account for less than 20% of irrigated acres today. Further, the highly efficient subsurface drip irrigation, in which there is minimal evaporative loss, is increasingly being adopted and now comprises almost 3% of irrigated acres. "Because of this adoption, irrigation efficiency has gone from 60% to 88–95% in much of the state today, allowing Texas to get much more value and agricultural output from its water." An accompanying chart indicates sprinkler and drip irrigation was in place for more than 80 percent of the state’s farmland in 2008 with less conservative furrow and flood irrigation used in 19 percent. Best efficiency, subsurface drip irrigation Next, we reached out to the institute’s Wagner, who said by phone he would have added a phrase to what Miller said by specifying that farmers can achieve up to 98 percent efficiency "if they use subsurface drip irrigation" instead of less conservative methods--and drip irrigation was being used by only 3 percent of Texas farmers as of 2008, he added by email. Significantly, Wagner said, it’s harder to adapt subsurface irrigation in parts of the state where water isn’t always immediately available. That’s because drip systems count on a steady supply of water, he said. "We can never get 100 percent of our acres to subsurface drip without significantly changing our water delivery system," Wagner said. Wagner told us 95 percent efficiency can be achieved by using the most efficient center pivot sprinklers "but again, not all farms have implemented the most efficient systems on the market." "Because center pivots have been adopted in much of the state," Wagner wrote, "most irrigation is in the range of 88-95% efficiency. However, we continue to work with producers to improve irrigation efficiency and timing." Going forward, he said, "improvements on the vast majority of irrigated acres are going to be much smaller as we now tweak technology and management. So in a sense, ‘the low hanging fruit’ has been picked." Earlier, we connected with the water development board’s Robert Mace, who also stressed drip irrigation as key to achieving 98 percent efficiency. "We don’t think farmers are maxed out," Mace said. "Everybody can do a little better with some advice." "Individual ag producers are achieving upwards of 98 percent irrigation efficiency," Mace said. "But there is still work to be done." Our ruling Miller said Texas agriculture is "at 98 percent efficiency" in water use and "just about maxed out as to what we can do on the conservation end of it." Farmers are not just about maxed out, experts told us, though those who use drip irrigation may be close. Growers using sprinkler methods may get 88 percent to 95 percent efficiency.

pomt-09065	"The ABA's own criteria for a judicial nominee call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law, and they mean actual practice of law."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/28/jon-kyl/kyl-says-american-bar-association-calls-12-years-e/	As the confirmation hearings began on June 28, 2010, for Elena Kagan's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee made the point that Kagan -- the current Solicitor General, a former dean of Harvard Law School and a member of the Clinton White House staff -- may not be a wise choice because she has relatively little experience as a judge or a practicing attorney. "Ms. Kagan has never served on any bench," said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. "Indeed, except for a brief two-year stint in private practice and one year as solicitor general, Ms. Kagan's entire career has been divided between academia and policy positions in the Clinton administration. Given this lack of experience practicing law, I was surprised that the American Bar Association awarded her a well-qualified rating, since the ABA's own criteria for a judicial nominee call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law, and they mean actual practice of law, like former Justices [William] Rehnquist and [Lewis] Powell." We thought it would be worth checking the ABA's guidelines ourselves to see what they say. First, let's take a quick look at Kagan's resume. While she is perhaps best known as the former Dean of Harvard Law School and as an aide in the Clinton White House, she does have a number of experiences that would qualify as the practice of law. From 1989 to 1991, she was an associate at Williams & Connolly, a Washington, D.C., law firm, doing mix of commercial, First Amendment and white-collar criminal law. And since March 2009, she has been solicitor general, arguing cases before the justices she hopes to join. Meanwhile, some people might also classify her two judicial clerkships -- for Judge Abner Mikva, U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C., and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall -- as "courtroom experience." She also spent three summers working for three private-sector law firms in New York City. And you could also classify her work as associate counsel to President Bill Clinton to be the practice of law, in the sense that she was advising a client, the president. (Her later policy work for the White House would probably fall outside of the practice of law.) Put these all together, and her total time spent pursuing the pure practice of law, as opposed to positions merely related to the law, would come to somewhere between five or six years. As Kyl indicates, that is indeed short of 12. Now for Kyl's claim about the ABA endorsement. We downloaded a copy of a pamphlet published by the 15-member ABA panel that scrutinizes the records of appointees to federal judgeships and rates them as either "well qualified," "qualified" or "not qualified." (The ratings aren't binding, but they carry weight among many of the senators who ultimately vote on federal judgeships. The pamphlet, "The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary: What It Is and How It Works," details the criteria used in the panel's evaluations. "The committee's evaluation of prospective nominees to the federal bench is directed solely to their professional qualifications: integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament," the pamphlet says. It goes on to say, "The committee believes that a prospective nominee to the federal bench ordinarily should have at least 12 years’ experience in the practice of law. In evaluating the professional qualifications of a prospective nominee, the committee recognizes that substantial courtroom and trial experience as a lawyer or trial judge is important. Distinguished accomplishments in the field of law or experience that is similar to in-court trial work — such as appearing before or serving on administrative agencies or arbitration boards, or teaching trial advocacy or other clinical law school courses — may compensate for a prospective nominee’s lack of substantial courtroom experience." So there is some truth in Kyl's statement. The ABA panel's "own criteria" do indeed "call for, among other things, at least 12 years' experience in the practice of law," as Kyl put it. What he said also fits with the idea that the ABA panel "recognizes that substantial courtroom and trial experience as a lawyer or trial judge is important." But Kyl's statement leaves out what we think is an important qualifier -- that "distinguished accomplishments in the field of law or experience that is similar to in-court trial work — such as appearing before or serving on administrative agencies or arbitration boards, or teaching trial advocacy or other clinical law school courses — may compensate for a prospective nominee’s lack of substantial courtroom experience." We realize that distinguished alternate career paths, by the panel's definition, "may compensate" for having less than 12 years of practice -- not "will compensate." But Kagan can make a pretty good argument that she has compensated for not having 12 years’ experience in the practice of law by instead satisfying the standard of "distinguished accomplishments in the field of law." She has, after all, served as U.S. Solicitor General, Dean of Harvard Law School and as a White House counsel -- at least three positions that we think most people would classify as "distinguished" achievements of a lawyer's career. When we called Kyl's office, spokesman Ryan Patmintra argued that these experiences aren't related to the "practice of law" envisioned by the ABA panel. "To the best of my knowledge, Ms. Kagan has not appeared or served on 'administrative agencies or arbitration boards,' nor has she taught 'trial advocacy or other clinical law school courses.' She has, of course, taught traditional law school courses, but those are very different from the trial advocacy or clinical courses that the ABA is referring to — i.e., classes that would demonstrate an understanding of the courtroom process." We didn't comb through her semester-by-semester course loads or pro-bono assignments to track her practical legal work, but we think this line of argument is a red herring anyway. The sentence sets up two alternatives -- either "distinguished accomplishments in the field of law or experience that is similar to in-court trial work." We see no requirement that the "distinguished accomplishments" be directly related to the in-court practice of law. Ultimately, then, Kyl is correct to say that the ABA does "call for" 12 years of practical law experience. But he leaves out an important qualifier -- that there's a way around that through "distinguished accomplishments in the field of law." So we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-11993	"Missouri Votes to Let Employers Fire People Who Use Birth Control."	pants on fire!	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/27/feministing/column-feministing-website-about-abortion-law-pant/	An Internet claim that Missouri employers will gain the right to fire people who use birth control when a state bill becomes law is incorrect. "Missouri Votes to Let Employers Fire People Who Use Birth Control," reads a headline from Feministing. "A new Missouri bill would target abortion providers and sanction employment and housing discrimination against people who use birth control or have an abortion," writes Sejal Singh, Feministing columnist, in the article. A St. Louis ordinance passed in February prohibits discrimination because of reproductive health care decisions. But Missouri Senate Bill 5, or SB 5, which was signed by the governor in July, will overturn that local ordinance when it takes effect in October. Since SB 5 was signed, we’ve seen claims that the bill would allow for employers to fire workers for using birth control. But we found no evidence that that’s true. Where is this coming from? Singh told PolitiFact Missouri she based her commentary on the analysis of news articles. Allure, Refinery29, and Newsweek were just a few among media sources that reported the bill would allow for employees to fire people for using birth control. Newsweek came out with an updated article stating that it, among other publications, had erroneously reported on the bill. Many of these news organizations referenced NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, which ran an ad online and on the radio that read, "Do you think your boss should be able to fire you for using birth control?" This ad only ran for one week, but its interpretation of the bill was influential to many of those articles. According to Alison Dreith, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, it was the rhetoric of Republicans and not the actual language that led to this interpretation. "It still remains to be seen if SB 5 will pre-empt the St. Louis ordinance," Dreith said in an email interview. What’s in SB 5? The bill, signed by the governor in late July, touches on a lot of provisions, such as tissue report modifications, local abortion policies, employee disclosure policies and abortion facility inspections. Under the political subdivision authority part of the bill, it allows property owners to refuse to rent or sell to a person who plans to use the facility as an abortion clinic that isn’t for the sole purpose of saving the mother’s life. Within the same guidelines, it also doesn’t require healthcare providers or employers to provide coverage "that includes benefits that are not otherwise required by state law." Employers in Missouri are already allowed to deny contraceptive coverage in their employee’s health insurance plans. Daniel Wilhelm, with Republican Rep. Andrew Koenig’s office, said the bill does not reference birth control or contraceptives, except under circumstances where employers can refuse health care if they don’t want to pay for birth control. Elizabeth Sepper, a professor of law at Washington University, said in an email that no matter what Missouri does, federal law bars an employer with 15 or more employees from discriminating against employees based on their reproductive choices, such as taking contraception. Even with the passing of the bill, Sepper said St. Louis’ city ordinance still prevents employers from firing employees who use birth control, and SB 5 doesn’t affect that protection. Our ruling A columnist for Feministing claimed that SB 5 will allow employers to fire their workers for using birth control. While the bill will impose higher level of restrictions on abortion providers and allow real estate agents to refuse to sell or rent them land, the bill does not say employers can fire workers for using contraceptives. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Feministing	None	None	None	2017-09-27T10:12:43	2017-06-21	['None']
pomt-01353	"When I go on Letterman" the "ratings go up."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/21/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-lettermans-ratings-increase-when/	You probably wouldn’t describe Bill O’Reilly as humble. The Fox News personality is currently on a publicity tour for his new book Killing Patton, the fourth installment in the Fox host’s nonfiction Killing series. Speaking on Fox News’ Media Buzz, O’Reilly crowed about his ability to draw large television audiences. Kurtz asked O’Reilly if he was ready to stop referring to himself as a "lonely outsider" since he’s appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman and chatting with mainstream news hosts like Katie Couric of Yahoo! News and ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Is he one of them now? "It’s not a matter of being accepted, it’s about success," O’Reilly explained. "And I bring ratings to those shows. So when I go on Letterman or I go on the morning shows, their ratings go up. That's why they have me on." Because we were curious, we wondered about O’Reilly’s rating power when he appears on other shows. We focused on Letterman’s Late Show to make the exercise more manageable. We found 15 O’Reilly Late Show appearances since 2001 using the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and searching transcripts. We then pulled data for the number of estimated viewers for those shows from Nielsen Media Research, a company that tracks consumers patterns and TV viewership. We measured the number of viewers who watched O’Reilly’s appearances against the average of viewers who watched the same day of the week that season, as well as against the Late Show’s annual calendar average. A couple of quirks about the data: CBS provided Nielsen data for average weekday viewers in terms of broadcast years, which run from September to September and include repeat shows. Nielsen provided average viewers for the calendar year, excluding specials and repeats. The show is on five nights a week, including repeats, so we don’t think it’s a huge matter. Also, some ratings for 2014 are not available because Nielsen is still re-evaluating its data following a reporting error for broadcast networks from the last seven months. In the chart below, we shaded appearances in which O’Reilly’s ratings outnumbered either the weekday average for the season or the annual average. As you’ll see, O’Reilly is largely correct: He usually beats the seasonal weekday average of viewers as well as the calendar year average. Date of O’Reilly on Late Show Day of the week O’Reilly viewers Season Weekday average for season Annual average of viewers Feb. 23, 2001 Friday 4.80 million 2000-01 4.26 million 4.27 million Oct. 5, 2004 Tuesday 3.51 million 2004-05 3.85 million 4.45 million Jan. 3, 2006 Tuesday 4.39 million 2005-06 3.63 million 4.16 million Oct. 27, 2006 Friday 4.79 million 2006-07 3.83 million 4.16 million Oct. 27, 2008 Monday 3.77 million 2008-09 3.79 million 3.63 million March 31, 2009 Tuesday 4.06 million 2008-09 3.66 million 3.80 million Dec. 9, 2010 Wednesday 4.08 million 2010-11 3.29 million 3.55 million Oct. 13, 2011 Thursday 3.43 million 2011-12 3.06 million 3.34 million May 23, 2012 Wednesday 2.82 million 2011-12 3.03 million 2.95 million Oct. 24, 2012 Wednesday 3.48 million 2012-13 2.98 million 2.95 million Feb. 11, 2013 Monday 3.07 million 2012-13 2.82 million 2.90 million June 17, 2013 Monday 2.62 million 2012-13 2.82 million 2.90 million Oct. 16, 2013 Wednesday 3.28 million 2013-14 2.76 million 2.90 million March 14, 2014 Friday n/a 2013-14 2.83 million n/a Oct. 1, 2014 Wednesday 2.69 million 2014-15 2.57 million n/a Of 14 appearances with data since 2001, Late Show episodes featuring O’Reilly outperformed the average number of viewers by both measures 10 times. An 11th appearance, on Oct. 27, 2008, drew about 140,000 more viewers than the calendar year average but about 20,000 fewer than the Monday average during the 2008-09 season. Put another way, the shows in which O’Reilly touted a recent book or offered political commentary exceeded the show’s weekday and calendar year average 70 percent of the time. CBS would not comment on whether it invites O’Reilly to boost ratings. Our ruling In a trademark moment of non-modesty, O’Reilly bragged about his effect as a guest star on mainstream broadcast shows. "I bring ratings to those shows. So when I go on Letterman or I go on the morning shows, their ratings go up," he said. Looking strictly at Letterman’s Late Show, to keep things simple, we found he has a point. Using available data, we found O’Reilly beat the average ratings for the comparable day of the week and calendar year 10 or 11 times out of 14 show appearances with data. In this specific case, booking O’Reilly isn’t a sure bet for better ratings. But it’s a pretty safe one. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05209	"Massachusetts is reporting a trend far below the national trend in the escalation of health-care costs in this year."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/10/elizabeth-roberts/lt-gov-elizabeth-roberts-says-massachusetts-health/	As part of the ongoing debate over the cost of medical coverage, Operation Clean Government's State of the State cable television program held a discussion on the pros and cons of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare. Critic Lisa Blais of Ocean State Tea Party in Action quoted a May 2012 Associated Press story from Massachusetts talking about "soaring premiums" in Massachusetts. But Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts, who has been working to implement some of the provisions of the Obama plan in Rhode Island, spoke in favor of the act and disagreed. "Massachusetts is reporting a trend far below the national trend in the escalation of health-care costs in this year," she said. We wondered if the increase in health-care costs in Massachusetts -- where residents are required to have health insurance or pay a penalty -- was really far below the U.S. trend this year. When we asked Roberts for backup for her claim, her spokeswoman, Maria Tocco, sent us to several different sources. The first was Page 16 of a May 2012 study by the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy reporting that total medical expenditures among the state's commercial insurers increased by 3 percent from 2009 to 2010. The second was a table from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showing that health expenses increased across the U.S. by 3.9 percent from 2009 to 2010. "Therefore, national expenditures increased from 2009 to 2010 by 30 percent more than in Massachusetts," Tocco said. Not exactly. Those are two different sets of data, essentially comparing apples to oranges. The first doesn't include Medicare and Medicaid costs. The second does. Medicare and Medicaid covers older and poorer Americans, and people in those groups tend to be sicker, and their health care is more costly. That’s an important distinction. In 2009, for example, the per-person annual cost of the typical Medicare recipient was $9,736 -- three times higher than for someone under 65. In Massachusetts, Medicare and Medicaid account for 37 percent of what the state spends on health care. So we looked for better comparisons. We contacted the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the agency behind the national data cited by Roberts' office, to see if they had state-by-state comparisons. They did, but only up to 2009, three years after then-Gov. Mitt Romney signed health-care reform. We took the data and did some calculations. In 2009, the per-person cost for all health care in Massachusetts (including Medicare and Medicaid) rose by 3.94 percent, compared with the national average of 3.79 percent. Cost increases in Massachusetts were above the U.S. average in the two previous years as well. A third document Tocco sent us -- a March 2012 report from the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation -- provided limited support for Roberts’ statement. The foundation found that the average annual growth rate for family health insurance premiums from 2006 (when Romneycare passed) through 2010 rose by 4.5 percent in Massachusetts and by 5.1 percent nationally. That's lower, but not "far below" the national trend, as Roberts claimed. What about costs for health insurance for individuals? Anna Gosline, director of policy and research for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation, sent us comparable data for that same period showing that individual health insurance premium costs grew a bit faster under Romneycare, by 5.1 percent compared to 4.7 percent nationally. But we did find data points for just one year in the Blue Cross numbers that support Roberts' claim. In 2010, the latest year for which data are available, family premiums in Massachusetts fell by 0.8 percent ($127 per year) versus a rise of 6.5 percent ($844) nationally. For individuals, premiums rose by 2.8 percent in Massachusetts and 5.8 percent nationally. So particularly for family plans, for that one year, Roberts is right on target. But, again, there are problems with the data. The numbers are based on an annual nationwide survey of employers by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. "That doesn't include any out-of-pocket costs," Gosline warned. "What if that dip is caused by everyone doubling their deductibles?" In other words, people might be spending less on their health insurance premiums but paying more out of pocket. The Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy report says there’s evidence that such "benefit buy-down" is occurring. Said Gosline: "I think the longer-period view shows that Massachusetts was growing at about the same rate as the U.S. before reform was implemented in 2007, and about the same rate after, with some evidence of a recent slowdown." PER PERSON COST INCREASES All health costs Mass. U.S. 2007 7.07% 4.81% 2008 4.18% 3.93% 2009 3.94% 3.79% 2010 N.A. 3.10% Insurance - individual 2007 4.36% 3.01% 2008 4.18% 2.92% 2009 8.93% 6.94% 2010 2.75% 5.80% Insurance - family 2007 6.09% 4.03% 2008 5.74% 3.87% 2009 6.78% 5.93% 2010 -0.79% 6.48% Our ruling During a debate in which she argued that the health-care overhaul in Massachusetts has brought down costs, Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts said, "Massachusetts is reporting a trend far below the national trend in the escalation of healthcare costs in this year." We couldn’t find state-by-state numbers for health-care costs for this year, last year, or 2010. But in 2009, three years after Mitt Romney signed the legislation, total per-person spending in Massachusetts was slightly higher than the national average. Only if you look at health insurance costs in 2010 -- particularly family plans -- do you see increases in Massachusetts far below the national average. But one year does not make a trend. Other factors may have been at work to make 2010 a good year for insurance purchasers. And during the other three years when health insurance reform was in effect in Massachusetts, the trend was that insurance rates and overall costs of health care went up faster than the national average. As a result, we rate her statement "Mostly False." (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-10628	"(Ronald Reagan) raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/mike-huckabee/even-the-gipper/	As the candidates fell over themselves in a game of I-loved-Ronald Reagan one-upsmanship during a Jan. 10, 2008, debate in South Carolina, Mike Huckabee had the audacity to note that in Reagan's first year as governor of California, the Gipper raised taxes. A lot. "You know, if Ronald Reagan were running tonight, there would be ads by the Club for Growth running against him because he raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California," Huckabee said. "It would be $10-billion today." Ronald "Send the welfare bums back to work" Reagan? "Basically, yeah," said Kelly Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. In the summer of 1967, during Reagan's first year as governor, and contrary to his campaign promises, Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California — an 18 percent, roughly $1-billion hike. According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar; raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent; and increases in bank, corporation, inheritance, liquor and cigarette taxes. A little context is in order. In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan said he inherited a $200-million deficit from his predecessor, Pat Brown. Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts. But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats, and he wasn't able to muster support for additional cuts. So, he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases. This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself. In a debate on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens. Read our ruling here. Now, Huckabee's math may be a little off on what that $1-billion would translate to today. It's actually closer to $6.3-billion. But the bottom line, Huckabee's statement about Reagan is true.

pomt-08615	"I have given $30,000 of my unused travel expenses over the years to supplement the school system's general budget."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/22/sarah-copelin-wood/dekalb-official-says-shes-no-big-travel-spender/	DeKalb County school board member Sarah Copelin-Wood offered what she considered a reasonable explanation a couple of months ago when she decided not to take a pay cut, although most of her fellow board members agreed to trim their salaries by 10 percent. "I have given $30,000 of my unused travel expenses over the years to supplement the school system's general budget," Copelin-Wood told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. When the AJC reported that it couldn't independently verify how much money Copelin-Wood said she had given back to the school district, the board member asked DeKalb school officials in an e-mail to provide the newspaper detailed information about her travel budget. Copelin-Wood is in a three-way race to stay on the DeKalb school board. She suggested politics was behind the complaints that she didn't take the pay cut. In an e-mail, she wrote "this is a campaign ploy in a vicious, flagrant attempt to 'publicly malign' by 'some - not all,' other DeKalb school board members who 'are not' up for re-election." She was first elected to the board in 1998. DeKalb school leaders ordered furloughs on teachers, administrators, secretaries and other employees to cut the budget by $104 million. The nine-member board adopted a budget of slightly more than $1 billion. Some school board members initially proposed a 5 percent pay cut for themselves in a Clintonesque "I feel your pain" message of solidarity with other DeKalb school employees. Zepora Roberts was the only other school board member who didn't take the 10 percent pay cut. Roberts told the AJC she needed the salary. DeKalb school board members are paid $18,000 a year, which is in line with school board member salaries in Cobb and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta. DeKalb school board members, like most elected officials in the Atlanta region, occasionally travel to work-related conferences and training in other cities and states. The school district budgets $4,000 a year for each of its nine board members for travel-related expenses. The annual travel budget has ranged between $3,500 and $5,000 during the past 10 budget cycles. Board members can spend their own money for travel and get reimbursed by the county. AJC PolitiFact Georgia filed an open records request with the DeKalb school system to find out if Copelin-Wood's numbers are correct. During the past 10 annual budget cycles, Copelin-Wood could have spent $45,957 on travel, county records show. She spent $12,722, but did not spend $33,235, the records show. Copelin-Wood has not spent any money on travel in the current budget year, which began July 1. The unspent funds are kept by the county. "Budgeted travel amounts not utilized by each board member shall remain in the general fund and shall be designated for innovative, educational projects for the subsequent fiscal year," states the county school board's website. School board Chairman Tom Bowen said Copelin-Wood would have been better off if she had said she had "saved" more than $30,000 for the DeKalb district, instead of saying she had "given" those funds back. "There's nothing for her to give back. It's on a reimbursement basis. She's contributing to savings for the district," Bowen said. Copelin-Wood focused on the amount of money she hasn't spent when we asked about how she characterized her travel spending. Copelin-Wood was correct regarding the amount of travel funds that she has not spent in recent years. However, we believe her terminology in describing the process would convey the impression that she voluntarily agreed to give those funds to the county. Her statement leaves out important details, and we rate it as Half True.	None	Sarah Copelin-Wood	None	None	None	2010-09-22T06:00:00	2010-07-03	['None']

pomt-08683	"I can put 10,000 people to work. Electricians, plumbers, sheet metal workers -- by retrofitting all of the state buildings for energy independence or efficiency."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/10/roy-barnes/barnes-ad-claims-he-can-put-10000-people-work-thro/	It is one of the most striking claims of this campaign season. Roy Barnes, former Georgia governor who is hoping to return to the Governor's Mansion in January, said in a televised campaign ad he can put 10,000 people to work. How? "By retrofitting each state building to make them more energy-efficient," he said in the ad, which premiered June 23. "The best part is," Barnes added, "the energy savings will pay for the improvements." Ten thousand jobs is a pretty hefty claim in this sluggish economy, particularly when the state's unemployment rate is 9.9 percent, slightly above the national average of 9.5 percent. So how did Barnes come up with this estimate? Is it accurate? And how soon could it be accomplished? The Barnes campaign said it based its estimate of how many jobs can be created on two findings in two separate reports. One, by the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, suggests the state can create up to 5,000 new jobs. About 6,000 people already employed would also see the benefits by working on retrofitting state buildings. The other is a 2008 study by the Political Economy Research Institute, which describes itself as an independent unit of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The report estimates about 20 jobs can be generated for each $1 million spent on energy-efficiency efforts. Dennis Creech, executive director of Southface, an Atlanta-based company that works with government agencies and others to promote sustainable workplaces, has seen similar estimates of how many jobs can be generated by retrofitting a building. By the PERI calculation, Barnes must spend about $500 million to achieve his goal of putting 10,000 people to work. The GEFA estimate would require a $528 million investment. But is that doable? Georgia government has suffered financially in recent years. State leaders passed a $17.8 billion budget in April that took effect July 1. The budget was about $3 billion less than the 12-month spending plan adopted three years ago. State agencies saw across-the-board cuts. GEFA based its $528 million estimate on financing projects over the span of 15 years. Apparently, Barnes has joined the parade of people supporting the latest hot idea in government: performance contracting. It's the practice of hiring companies to retrofit a building to make it more energy-efficient, saving money on energy bill and water costs. The company typically gets a cut of the money from the energy savings. Many states and cities have entered into performance contracting with companies to produce energy savings. Georgians will vote on Nov. 2 whether to amend the state constitution to allow state agencies to enter into multiyear contracts with companies to improve energy efficiency in state buildings. The state of Georgia has 15,757 buildings, ranging from storage buildings to park cabins to state office buildings to the Capitol, according to Katy Pando, spokeswoman for the Georgia Building Authority. "I think it's the right number," said Jason Rooks, an Avondale Estates resident who recently formed a group, Taxpayers for Energy Efficiency, to support a referendum later this year to fund retrofitting projects. Each state agency is responsible for conducting building assessments and potential cost savings opportunities for any renovation projects, Pando said. Many of Georgia's buildings are old and not energy-efficient, said state Sen. Steve Henson, a DeKalb County Democrat. Gov. Sonny Perdue committed all state agencies to reduce energy consumption per square foot by 15 percent below 2007 levels by 2020. State officials estimate they can save as much as 30 percent on energy and water costs by retrofitting a building. Henson, one of the co-sponsors of legislation to propose a referendum, said the companies would be paid for the retrofitting through a portion of energy cost savings. If there are no cost savings, Henson said, the company would not get paid. Barnes campaign spokesman Emil Runge said the candidate would fund the work through the cost savings. Henson said 10,000 jobs could be created or retained through the plan, but "not in one year." Henson said the number of workers necessary to do the work depends on how much time it takes for the companies to perform the retrofitting and the willingness of state government to fund the program. GEFA estimates the state spends about $225 million annually in energy and water costs in state facilities. A 30 percent cost savings would be about $67.5 million. Perdue's 15 percent energy reduction consumption mandate would be about $34 million a year. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency hailed performance contracting in a 2008 report but warned of some potential pitfalls, such as the complexities of the process to hire contractors. The EPA also noted some early contracts did not deliver the expected results, which created some skepticism. The EPA added that some of the skepticism has declined with familiarity of state needs and procedures. Robert Pollin, who helped write the PERI report, said he and the other researchers used federal government data that outline how businesses operate. From that data, Pollin determined how many jobs can be created, retained or supported through the retrofitting of state buildings. Some who have analyzed the PERI report contend there is at least one flaw in the research. The Institute for Energy Research noted the unemployment rate for workers with the skills needed to do retrofitting is one-half of the national average. The institute, which has offices in Washington, D.C., and Houston, concluded there will be fewer unemployed workers hired. No one we spoke with disputed whether 10,000 people could be put to work by retrofitting state buildings. The research by agencies on this topic shows these positions would be new hires and people who would directly benefit from the work. By Barnes saying he could put "10,000 people to work," we believe he gave the impression that all of these workers would be new hires. Some of those 10,000 would already be employed. The positions could be filled, but as Henson noted, the work will require some political will that will be necessary after the end of a potential Barnes administration. Barnes' statement is accurate, but it leaves out important details that might lead to a different impression. We rate his claim as Half True.

pomt-02643	President Barack Obama’s judicial appointments for Georgia and the region were drafted in secret and not vetted by legal groups among the president’s supporters.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/17/david-scott/scott-claims-secrecy-picking-judicial-nominees/	It’s said the wheels of justice move slowly. So, too, is the process of approving the names of some judicial nominees. The tortoise-like pace of appointing judges to serve on two key courts has resulted in rare public criticism of the Obama administration by some leading Georgia Democrats and civil rights leaders. One such critic is U.S. Rep. David Scott, a Democrat who represents portions of metro Atlanta. "It is an abomination that these nominees for lifetime appointment were drafted in secret, not vetted by any legal groups among the president’s supporters," Scott wrote in a letter to U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. Scott and others, who’ve supported President Barack Obama on so many issues, felt blindsided by the White House, particularly since the nominees were reportedly chosen after consultation with Georgia’s two Republican senators. We wondered if the congressman’s claim was correct. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes was the White House’s pick to serve on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, joining pending 11th Circuit nominee Jill Pryor, an Atlanta attorney. To fill four Northern District of Georgia slots, Obama nominated Atlanta attorney Leigh Martin May, DeKalb County State Court Judge Eleanor Ross, Georgia Court of Appeals Judge Michael Boggs and Atlanta attorney Mark Cohen. The critics say there’s not enough racial diversity among the nominees. They say some nominees have previously sided against the interests of the civil rights community. The Senate confirms presidential nominees, and the White House reportedly had trouble getting some names past the two senators for nomination. "I don’t think (Obama) will nominate anyone without home-state senator support," said Richmond College of Law professor Carl Tobias, who studies the judicial nomination process and has paid close attention to what’s going on in Georgia. U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss had held up Obama nominees for years, until a deal struck several months ago finally broke the impasse, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. A spokeswoman for Chambliss declined comment, referring us to a December statement by both senators thanking the White House for its cooperation through the nomination process. The White House press office and Isakson did not respond to requests for comment. Scott’s chief of staff, Michael Andel, explained that the White House did not discuss the nominations with Georgia Democrats serving in Congress, which is why the congressman described the process as secret. Andel said the White House did not run the names by organizations that typically vet potential nominees, such as the Georgia Association of Black Women Attorneys (GABWA) or the Gate City Bar Association, a prominent African-American attorney group based in Atlanta. Veteran Atlanta attorney and former six-term congressman George "Buddy" Darden chaired a 13-member committee in 2009 that was created by Georgia Democrats in Congress to submit nominees to Obama to the federal bench. The committee took input from GABWA and other groups, he said. A year later, the AJC reported that none of the vacancies had been filled. Why not? Chambliss and Isakson weren’t thrilled with the names being submitted, according to news accounts. In 2013, after Obama’s re-election, Darden said the White House rebuffed their efforts for a meeting. The White House worked with the two Georgia senators and Kenneth S. Canfield, a major Obama donor and Atlanta attorney, according to Darden and some news accounts. "(The White House) wouldn’t let the congressmen know what was happening," said Darden, who served in Congress as a Democrat. Canfield declined comment. Charles S. Johnson III, a former president of the Gate City Bar Association, gave us a detailed account of negotiations with the Obama administration. Negotiators met with the White House in mid-2010, he said, and the Obama administration made two nominations to fill vacancies on the North Georgia court. Chambliss and Isakson, though, did not support the candidates, Johnson said. In August 2013, when rumors surfaced that a deal was in the works, the Gate City Bar Association and other groups wrote Obama to complain they were being left out, said Johnson, a partner at Holland & Knight, one of the most influential law firms in Georgia. The White House met with some Georgia Democrats serving in Congress in October. Andel said names of specific judicial nominees weren’t discussed at the meeting. Johnson said his group and others tried, to no avail, to get a meeting with Chambliss and Isakson. "There was no public process for vetting these nominations before they were announced, unlike previous years, in which the president and the senators typically sought input on judicial nominees from leaders and organizations in the community to be affected," Johnson said via email. "I personally met with one of the individuals who was rumored to be part of brokering this package deal. In my meeting I specifically asked whether it would be possible to seek community input regarding this package. I was told that there was no interest in seeking community input, and that those involved in putting this deal together were aware that the deal would draw significant community opposition." Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said the White House has no formal process when it comes to judicial nominations. Some states, she said, have commissions to vet candidates. Most will seek input from the state’s U.S. senators. Tobias said he thinks Scott’s claim is correct, but he agreed the spoils of victory for U.S. senators include having input on judicial nominations. "It’s not the best way to proceed, but it may be the only way to proceed," Tobias said. To sum up, Congressman Scott claimed he and other Georgia Democrats serving in Congress were left in the dark when the White House came up with the names of nominees to serve on two key benches. He also claimed groups who traditionally support Obama weren’t in the loop as well. This was tough to fact-check because some key people and groups involved in the process wouldn’t talk about it. But it appears Scott and the other Democrats weren’t consulted when the White House came up with its nominees. While some groups weren’t consulted, it does appear some Obama supporters did offer some input. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-03891	"In Atlanta, since 1994 when the ‘Seven Deadly Sins’ (mandatory minimum sentences) took effect, the violent crime rate has dropped 62 percent."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/05/paul-howard/numbers-right-about-sentencing-cause-elusive/	Has being tough on crime gone too far, or are strict sentences for criminals the key to reducing crime? Two decades ago, Georgia revised its sentencing guidelines and established mandatory sentences for a range of serious crimes. Those sentencing laws have led to longer sentences and high prison populations, along with exploding taxpayer costs. Efforts are currently under way to dial back the laws and give the courts some flexibility on mandatory minimum sentences. But some officials, such as Paul Howard, the district attorney for Fulton County, which includes the city of Atlanta, want to keep the strict sentencing rules and touts their benefits. "In Atlanta, since 1994 when the ‘Seven Deadly Sins’ took effect, the violent crime rate has dropped 62 percent," Howard said last month in an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Crime numbers are always a wily topic, and the data can be manipulated in various ways to elicit a desired response. PolitiFact Georgia decided to see whether Howard’s claim was on target. The DA’s support of the mandatory minimums is based on his criticism of sentencing disparities. "Black defendants are at least 30 percent more likely to be in prison for the same crime," Howard said in the AJC article. "Whenever judges are allowed to sentence at their discretion, the disparity increases." One of the best ways to avoid racial disparities is to make the sentences the same, he said. Under then-Gov. Zell Miller, sentencing revisions were approved that implemented sentences of 10 years with no parole for committing one of the "seven deadly sins," which included rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy and aggravated sexual battery. A second conviction mandates a life sentence without parole. Howard provided PolitiFact Georgia with two charts showing Atlanta’s crime rate from 1994 to 2010. The data was derived from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, according to Howard’s office. The FBI data show that the category of violent crime includes four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes are defined as those offenses that involve force or threat of force. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, published annually, are compiled from data voluntarily provided by police departments. About 92 percent of U.S. police departments report their data, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. For Atlanta, the FBI data showed: 1994: population, 411,204 violent crimes: 14,684 violent crime rate: 3,571 2010: population,420,003 violent crimes: 5,749 violent crime rate: 1,368.8 With slight rounding, the decrease in the crime rate - the number of incidents per every 100,000 residents -- was 62 percent. We ran the FBI numbers for an additional year and found that through 2011, the decrease in the violent crime rate was slightly less, at about 60 percent. In the past decade, Atlanta’s population estimates have differed from those issued by the U.S. Census Bureau, which revised the city’s population downward. Howard uses the higher population figures for from 2001 to 2009. But his claim involves the crime rate between two specific years, 1994 and 2010, and his population figures match those census figures used by the FBI. The difference has no impact on his claim. Using the revised lower population for 2009, for example, would have changed the decrease in the violent crime rate to 57 percent. Criminology experts we talked to agreed that the portion of Howard’s statement about the decreased crime rate was true, but that the question lies with causality. "It’s certainly possible that the increase in sentencing has played a role, but you can’t without a lot of confidence say that that is the full reason why crime rates have changed," said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University who has extensively studied the issue. Berman opposes mandatory sentencing. And it’s also notable that violent crime rates dropped not just in Atlanta, but in other places across the country, including places without mandatory sentencing, said Robert Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgia State University. GBI crime data show that from 1994 to 2010 the crime rate for violent crimes decreased in the state by 36.7 percent. And through 2011 the rate decreased 40.5 percent. Nationwide, violent and property crimes decreased for the fifth straight year, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report for 2011. In 2010, the number of violent crimes in the country dropped to the lowest rate in nearly 40 years. So does Howard prove his case? The Fulton district attorney supports strict mandatory minimum sentencing. One of his arguments is the notable 62 percent decrease in violent crimes in the two decades since the sentences have been in place. FBI data support his claim. The violent crime rate from 1994 to 2010 did indeed drop 62 percent; and through 2011, the decrease in the violent crime rate was about 60 percent. On just the numbers, Howard is correct. But criminology and law experts say it is almost impossible to tie the decrease directly to this one issue of mandatory minimum sentencing. Howard’s numbers are accurate, but his statement needs additional information. We rated his statement Mostly True. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.

pomt-05606	Says a Barack Obama "black imposter" joke got a standing ovation at San Angelo rodeo.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/mar/28/chain-email/email-says-texas-rodeo-crowd-gave-standing-ovation/	Rodeo clowns are used to taking a beating. But there’s an anti-Obama email bouncing around Texas that some say unfairly roughs up one cowboy entertainer. We were forwarded a chain email March 2, 2012, that purports to describe an event at the 2012 San Angelo rodeo, which was held February 16-26. Between saddle bronc events, according to the email, a rodeo clown performed a skit with a racially tinged punchline mocking President Barack Obama. And, the letter says, the crowd responded with "an immediate deafening roar and standing ovation -- 6,000 strong. ...It lasted for 3-4 minutes... 100+ db (decibels) at least." Did a crowd of Texans cheer, and did the clown tell, a joke calling Obama a "black imposter"? We talked by phone with Keith Isley of Goldston, N.C., the award-winning rodeo clown who performed the skit, and Boyd Polhamus, a Brenham rancher and professional rodeo announcer who was on horseback in the arena with Isley, serving as "straight man" for the jokes. Rodeo official Tom Thompson told us this skit took place February 22. Isley said his wife had been sent a copy of the email by the time he got home from Texas. "The people, or the person, that started this has definitely misquoted what was said, and I told my wife, ‘I know what I said, I know what took place, and it’s definitely not what this person has seen or heard.’ " Isley said the comedy routine began with him being announced as Carlos Ortega, champion trick roper, and that the skit has to do with "pretending to be someone you’re not." "That’s the way it starts off," Isley said. "There’s a lot to the act. It was quoted in there (the email), me saying about the black president. That’s the main thing; that’s what everybody is getting so bent out of shape about. And that was not said by me." According to the email, after the announcer reveals that the supposed champion trick roper is a phony, the clown says, "Well, actually I was thinking if a black imposter can pretend to be president of the United States, then I ought to be able to pretend I'm a world champion trick roper!" We asked Isley to tell us how the joke did end, and he said, "There’s a lot of punchlines to the whole act. ‘Black president’ was not used in that act." The crowd reaction was also exaggerated, he said: "They did respond; nothing to that amount." Polhamus agreed, telling us by email that the chain letter "question is filled with hyperbole, and sadly, inaccuracy." Speaking about the email’s anonymous author, Polhamus said, "Where he is flat-plain wrong and inaccurate is in his use of the words ‘black imposter.’ Neither of those words were uttered by the clown or yours truly in the skit. In any context. Either separately or together." Other descriptions in the email are also off, he said. "The coliseum in which the event is held barely holds 5,000 people, not 6,000. The introduction used to pretend the clown may actually be a noted trick roper from south of the border is not nearly as extravagant or embellished as the author of the e-mail asserts. The lines about speaking in Spanish and English are relatively accurate, but to call his physical motion a ‘matador flourish’ is a huge embellishment." The crowd response was exaggerated, Polhamus said. "There was no standing ovation, and while I didn’t have a db meter on me, I’ve heard 100 db roars before at football games and rodeos. And I would argue that the audience’s response was nowhere near that loud, and I definitely take issue with the fact that the writer claims it lasted ‘3-4 minutes.’ My best guess is whatever ovation it received was over in less than 15 seconds." Justin Jonas, executive director of the San Angelo rodeo, told us that there was an Obama joke, but it wasn’t exactly the one laid out in the chain email. By Jonas’ recollection, the clown, challenged for posing as world-class trick roper, replied: "If Obama can impersonate a president, then I can impersonate a trick roper." Jonas said too that audience members appreciated the joke, but there was no standing ovation. Thompson, the rodeo’s marketing coordinator, also told us that there was no standing ovation and that the words "black" and "imposter" were not used. "I remember when we made fun of George W. Bush and his vocabulary in our coliseum, and Bill Clinton and his girlfriends," Thompson said. "We don’t choose sides." The rodeo and stock show foundation is a tax-exempt charity, he said, "and we go out of our way not to offend anybody." An editor at the San Angelo Standard-Times, Sandy Rojas, and KLST-TV/KSAN-TV news director David Wagner told us that although their news organizations covered the rodeo every night, they had not heard about such an incident. The version of the email PolitiFact received has at the bottom the name and title of Sheriff Cotton Elliott of King County, in the Texas Panhandle. Elliott told us he had received a version of the email and forwarded it to a friend, and later received a version with his name and title in large type at the bottom. He told us he did not write the email, did not know who had written it and was "not pleased" to learn his name had been attached to it. We found two rodeo-goers who said they saw Isley’s skit, but their recollections differ: One said he remembered hearing part of an Obama joke, the other did not. Don Miller, a precinct chair with the Tom Green County Republican Party who told us he was in the stands with his granddaughter during the skit, said he heard the crowd response but not the Obama joke itself. "I understood from the reaction that it had something to do with Obama and that it was, what’s the right word, it was not in good taste with Obama," he said. Some people laughed and clapped, he said, but others booed and "generally it was not received well." Though Miller told us his recollection was not clear (he was keeping an eye on his granddaughter), he said he thought the objectionable aspect of the joke was respect, not race. "It was just that he (Obama) was pretending to be president, and it was the butt of the joke, like this guy was pretending to be a trick roper," he said. "I just don’t think that’s funny. He is the president. Whether you like it or not, he is the president; he’s not pretending to be president," Miller said. "Even though I don’t agree with anything he has done, he’s still the president, and he deserves your respect of the office if nothing else." Was there any racial content to the skit? Miller says no. "No, I don’t think it had anything -- He could have been blue, and it wouldn’t have made any difference. I don’t think it had anything to do with race at all," Miller said. The description of a standing ovation and a 100-decibel roar was "baloney," he said. "They didn’t like that comment about the president." San Angelo dentist Rudy Izzard told us he saw the clown’s routine -- including his offering proof that he could speak Spanish by saying "Taco Bell." There was no joke about Obama the time he was there, Izzard said. "I would have noticed that," Izzard said. "I just don’t think they’d allow that." Linda Shoemaker, chair of the Tom Green County Democratic Party, told us she had not heard of the incident or the email. We sought video unsuccessfully. Wagner said his TV stations filmed competitive events but not the comedy routines. Mike Oliver, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association’s corporate accounts manager, said no videos were made by his organization because the San Angelo rodeo is not televised. On YouTube.com, several video clips are labeled as being from that rodeo, but we found none with this joke. Our ruling Isley appears to have made a wisecrack about Obama impersonating a president. However, we found no confirmation that the joke included a racial reference or that the audience gave a standing ovation. This chain email has an element of truth; we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00655	"In the last 24 months, 10 rural Texas hospitals have been forced to shut their doors because state leaders" chose not to expand Medicaid.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/may/15/childrens-defense-fund-texas/childrens-defense-fund-texas-says-texas-failure-ex/	Hold up on providing Texas tax cuts, an advocacy group says, because the billions of dollars in play would be better spent on children. Patrick Bresette, executive director of the Children’s Defense Fund-Texas, maintained in an April 28, 2015, statement sent to reporters that more than $4 billion in tax reductions under consideration by the Republican-led Texas Senate and House would serve the state’s wealthiest. "We are further distressed," Bresette said, "that the House is considering such deep reductions to its revenue stream while our state is standing on the brink of a health care crisis. "In the last 24 months," Bresette said, "ten rural Texas hospitals have been forced to shut their doors because state leaders have chosen not to invest in our state’s health care systems by rejecting billions in available Medicaid funds to cover more of our state’s uninsured." Ten country hospitals shuttered due to leaders spurning Medicaid? We confirmed some closings while learning about multiple factors for the closings including GOP resistance to expanding the Medicaid program to many Texas adults as intended by the 2010 Obamacare law. Let’s tally the closings, then cover possible reasons. Children's Defense Fund backup Anat Kelman Shaw of the Children’s Defense Fund-Texas emailed us web links to news stories declaring 10 rural hospitals had closed of late. We also reached the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, which provided its April 2015 list of rural hospitals shut down since 1995. The list showed 10 that closed from February 2013 through December 2014 though we confirmed that within that group, the Central Texas Hospital in Cameron was later succeeded by the Little River Healthcare (its website says it’s Cameron Hospital) and the shuttered Cozby-Germany Hospital in Grand Saline was later converted to the Texas General Hospital Van Zandt Regional Medical Center, which opened April 18, 2015, Suleman Hashmi, president of Texas General Hospital LP, told us by phone. The other TORCH-listed hospitals and their closing dates: Renaissance Hospital in Terrell (February 2013) Shelby Regional Medical Center in Center (July 2013) Lake Whitney Medical Center in Whitney (April 2014) Good Shepherd Medical Center in Linden (April 2014) Cleveland Regional in Cleveland (August 2014) East Texas Medical Center in Gilmer (December 2014) East Texas Medical Center in Mount Vernon (December 2014) East Texas Medical Center in Clarksville (December 2014). Another aspect: While checking these hospital names, we noticed the ones in Terrell, Center, Grand Saline and Whitney had been owned by a legally embattled physician, Tariq Mahmood, who was found guilty in Dallas County in July 2014 of defrauding Medicare by submitting more than $1.1 million in bogus billing claims—making us wonder to what extent his involvement drove those closings. Separately, we asked the Texas Department of State Health Services about the closings. By email, spokesman Chris Van Deusen guided us to an agency chart showing that as of April 2015, more than 660 hospitals were licensed by the state. The list didn’t lead us to identify any additional hospital openings in rural Texas over the 24 months in question. So, did the state’s non-expansion of Medicaid cause the closings? Texas Republican opposition to expanding Medicaid To be sure, Texas Republicans have staunchly opposed Medicaid expansion. The Obamacare law required states to widen access to Medicaid. But after the U.S. Supreme Court found the mandate unconstitutional, the government left it up to each state to widen access with Uncle Sam covering related costs for three years. In July 2012, Texas Gov. Rick Perry rejected the deal, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. In 2013, in turn, the Republican-led Legislature "shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid," according to a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story. Through the first four months of the 2015 legislative session, Shaw pointed out, Democratic attempts to win a reversal didn't get traction. Non-expansion has left many Texas adults uninsured. In March 2015, we found Mostly True a claim by the Texas Democratic Party that more than 1 million Texans lacked affordable health care due to the decision not to expand. That is, around 1 million adults were making too little money to qualify for private insurance subsidies offered under the Obamacare law and they also remained ineligible for Medicaid because Texas did not expand access. Closed hospitals cite various factors Shaw, asked to elaborate on the state not expanding Medicaid causing rural hospitals to close, pointed out a March 2015 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal news story quoting TORCH’s Don McBeath, the former judge of Lubbock County, saying: "Rural hospitals have always operated on a very narrow financial margin and have been hit with a series of payment cuts from Medicaid and Medicare in the past four years." An April 4, 2015, Graham Leader news story quoted Larry Kovar, chairman of the board of the Graham Regional Medical Center, which had laid off 15 workers, saying the hospital had lost significant revenue because Texas opted out of Medicaid expansion. "A lot more people would have been eligible for Medicaid (had Texas accepted the expansion), and the government was paying 100 percent of that Medicaid, certainly for the next several years," Kovar said. "And that would have brought in more money to the hospital, obviously." Kovar also said: "Unfortunately, to the extent that we didn’t accept that Medicaid, the hospital is funding those patients now through indigent care and such programs in lieu of the expanded Medicaid. We still treat those people, but they’re not eligible for Medicaid, so it hurts the hospital to some extent." Earlier, a March 6, 2015, news item in the Quorum Report, a Capitol newsletter, quoted Jack Endres, the administrator of East Texas Medical Center-Jacksonville, saying financial troubles led to its closing the hospitals in Clarksville, Mount Vernon and Gilmer. Endres said cuts in state and federal payments needed to be reversed or more hospitals would close. By phone, Endres told us he doesn’t know if the state’s resistance to expanding Medicaid was the driving factor in the closings. "It was certainly a factor," Endres said. "We’re basically getting death by a thousand cuts, one thing after another." In that vein, a March 20, 2015, Texas Tribune news story declared multiple factors behind such rural shutdowns, stating hospitals were suffering due to unfulfilled promises "of federal health reform, payment cuts by both government programs and private insurers, falling patient volumes and a declining rural population... Add to that Texas’ distinction as the state with the highest percentage of people without health insurance and you get a financially hostile landscape for rural hospital operators." The story, written in partnership with Kaiser Health News, affiliated with the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, quoted John Henderson, chief executive of the Childress Regional Medical Center, taking note of the state’s historically huge uninsured population and saying: "And we took Medicare cuts hoping that we could cover more people." Henderson, the story said, was referring to an agreement negotiated by the American Hospital Association when Democrats in Congress were drafting the Obamacare law. "The idea was that hospitals would take cuts to their Medicare payments, but in return they would have to spend less on ‘charity care’ because most patients would have health insurance," the story said. "But because Texas' Republican leadership has vehemently opposed expanding Medicaid to low-income adults, hospitals say they are paying the price for cost savings they didn't receive." Moreover, the Tribune reported, federal health reform mandated penalties for hospitals, rural and urban, that had too many patients readmitted for follow-up care. Another program, the story said, cracks the whip on hospitals where too many patients get sick during their stay. On top of that, federal sequestration, the fairly new budget-cutting practice, "has meant a 2 percent across-the-board cut to Medicare payments," the story said, with rural hospitals taking a further hit from the Obamacare law’s reductions in "disproportionate share hospital" payments to hospitals with large numbers of indigent and uninsured patients. Meanwhile in Texas, the story said, the 2011 Texas Legislature imposed a 10 percent cut in payments for all Medicaid outpatient care as part of balancing the state budget; that reduction remains. Upshot: It looks like various federal and state actions contributed to reduced revenues. Other views We asked TORCH’s McBeath and a national representative of rural hospitals to discuss Bresette’s statement. By phone, McBeath and Alan Morgan, chief executive of the Washington, D.C.-based National Rural Health Association, each said multiple factors including Texas not expanding Medicaid access have played into hospital closings. Morgan said factors include the Obamacare law reducing payments to hospitals for uncompensated care (services to individuals lacking health coverage)--the wrinkle intended to take advantage of more Americans getting covered by Medicaid. Also, Morgan said, Congress approved reductions in Medicare payments--focusing on outcomes rather than procedures--which reduced income streams. Nationally since 2010, Morgan said, about 50 rural hospitals have closed compared to none the prior decade. "Of the 50 rural hospitals that have closed, I’ve heard 50 different stories. Poor leadership, lack of community support, board relations" plus, he said, a lack of financial support at the state, local or federal levels. McBeath said he sees no single reason rural hospitals have closed in Texas. "In simple terms, those hospitals closed because their revenue did not match up to their expenses," he said. Outside factors, he said, included the reduced federal payments for uncompensated care. Also, he said, there was the 2011 Legislature’s 10-percent cut in Medicaid outpatient payments to hospitals and a change cutting 20 percent from payments for patients treated in an emergency room whose needs weren’t emergencies. It’s worth noting, McBeath said, rural hospitals serve a large share of uninsured Texans. Per the closings, McBeath said, "it’s not correct to blame one thing. But the lack of Medicaid expansion continues to be" a factor. We followed up with Bresette, who said by email that if he had a chance to make his statement afresh, he’d say the decision not to expand Medicaid access was among actions forcing hospitals to shut their doors. Our ruling Children’s Defense Fund-Texas said: "In the last 24 months, 10 rural Texas hospitals have been forced to shut their doors because state leaders have chosen not to invest in our state’s health care systems by rejecting billions in available Medicaid funds to cover more of our state’s uninsured." Ten rural hospitals closed, we found, though different hospitals later opened on two sites. Also, as Bresette acknowledged, the non-expansion of Medicaid wasn’t the only reason for the rural closings. Our sense is they occurred due to various squeezes extending, in a few cases, to an owner’s fraudulent acts. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 2:01 p.m., May 15, 2015: We revised the wording of our ruling to clarify that Bresette acknowledged the non-expansion of Medicaid wasn't the only reason for the hospital closings and to make it clear we found a range of factors.

pomt-10852	In countries that allow gay marriage, the rates of heterosexual marriage "have plummeted to where you have counties now in northern Europe where 80 percent of the first-born children are born out of wedlock."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/06/sam-brownback/marriage-rates-declined-before-same-sex-unions-leg/	In a Republican debate on Sept. 5, 2007, Brownback cited an argument that social-values conservatives have been making for years about gay marriage: that it causes declining marriage rates and more births to unmarried couples. But the trends of declining marriage rates and births out of wedlock started before gay unions were legalized. M.V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the research director of the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA, wrote a detailed study that examined rates for marriage and birth rates in Scandinavian countries. "Marriage rates, divorce rates, and nonmarital birth rates have been changing in Scandinavia, Europe, and the United States for the past thirty years," Badgett writes. "But those changes have occurred in all countries, regardless of whether or not they adopted same-sex partnership laws, and these trends were underway well before the passage of laws that gave same-sex couples rights." In, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, same-sex partnerships were legalized in 1989, 1993 and 1994, respectively. Generally speaking, gay partners in these countries have the legal and financial protections of marriage, but they are not allowed to marry in church or adopt children. The county-level statistics Brownback cites about first-born births are correct, Badgett said, but that trend also started years before the legalization of same-sex unions. Conservative author Stanley Kurtz is a prominent advocate of the argument that gay marriage hurts heterosexual marriage. Kurtz responded to Badgett's study by arguing that marriage rates in Scandinavia and other European countries are still declining, and that the legalization of same-sex partnerships "reinforces and intensifies parental cohabitation." But even Kurtz acknowledges that the decline began before the legalization of same-sex unions. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Sam Brownback	None	None	None	2007-09-06T00:00:00	2007-09-05	['Europe']
pomt-00710	"I'm running for office with much more experience and qualifications than Barack Obama had when he ran."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/29/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-more-experienced-and-qualified-obama/	Marco Rubio focused quite a bit on his past to make his case for a future presidency during a recent visit to Iowa. During an interview with the Des Moines Register’s editorial board, the Republican touted his accomplishments to counter criticisms he is still a first-term senator, just as President Barack Obama was when he was elected president. "I certainly feel I’m running for office with much more experience and qualifications than Barack Obama had when he ran. When Barack Obama ran for president, he was basically a state legislator from Illinois that had served in the Senate for two years," Rubio said April 25. "I, on the other hand, have been a legislative leader from the third-largest state in the country who has served in the Senate four and a half years, and have invested a significant amount of time in national security issues, particularly intelligence." So is Rubio right in saying his résumé is much more impressive than Obama’s was almost a decade ago? We’ll check both candidates’ curriculum vitae. Let’s start with an executive summary: Rubio, if he’s elected, will have spent about 17 years in politics and 19 years working overall. Obama had about 12 years in politics and 20 years of overall political and work experience. When you dig into the details, though, the differences between the two men seem fairly marginal. Rubio’s resume If Rubio is elected president in 2016, he will have the benefit of basically serving almost a full, six-year term in the U.S. Senate, more than the four that first-term Sen. Obama served from 2004 to 2008. During the Register interview, Rubio talked up his time on the foreign relations and intelligence committees, working to fashion himself as a foreign policy wonk. He also has served on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Rubio had 11 years of political experience before that: almost two years as a part-time West Miami city commissioner from April 1998 to January 2000 and nearly nine years as a Florida state representative. He joined the Florida House after a special election in early 2000 and served through 2008 before leaving because of term limits. In the House, Rubio served as whip, majority leader and eventually speaker. Beyond that, Rubio graduated from South Miami Senior High School in 1989, attended three colleges and graduated from the University of Florida in 1993 before getting a law degree from the University of Miami in 1996. When not in politics, Rubio worked as a lawyer for private firms and shared teaching duties for a politics class at Florida International University in 2008 and 2009. Obama’s resume Obama’s history includes 12 years in politics before he entered the Oval Office. He was a senator from Illinois for almost four years from 2005 to 2008, although we’ll note that Obama announced his candidacy in 2006, so that’s really the point to which Rubio is comparing himself. We’re going to stick with the totals when he was elected, however. Obama also served on the foreign relations committee, as well as veterans affairs. He was on the environment and public works committee before that assignment was replaced with the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and also homeland security and governmental affairs. Obama also served eight years in the Illinois state Senate from 1997 to 2004. Democrats only took majority control of the Illinois Senate in 2003, acting as the minority party during the rest of Obama’s years. (He also lost a primary run for the U.S House in 2000.) Obama was a 1983 graduate of Columbia University, then a financial analyst for a year, and a community organizer in Chicago for three years before attending Harvard Law School. He earned his law degree in 1991 and ran a voter registration drive called Illinois Project Vote in 1992. He worked for a private law firm in Chicago and began teaching in 1993, working as a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school while serving as a state senator. Our ruling We find Obama and Rubio’s overall experience to be roughly equivalent. Rubio would have an edge in political experience, although his time as a part-time city commissioner for a town of less than 6,000 people isn’t as rigorous as holding statewide office. Obama’s term as a senator came to a close sooner than Rubio’s would, due to the timing of the elections. But real-life experience outside the bubble of politics counts for something, too. Obama worked for years doing several different jobs, while Rubio spent some time as a lawyer. The time frame has something to do with it -- Obama was 47 when he became president, while Rubio would be 45 if he won election in November 2016. Rubio can claim he’ll have a few more years in political office, but Obama had a wider range of occupations. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01997	FIFA "pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/11/john-oliver/john-oliver-says-fifa-pressured-brazil-lifting-its/	Brazilians are famous for their passion for soccer, though the fervor sometimes is so intense that people die. The country’s lawmakers banned alcohol at stadiums 11 years ago in effort to curb game-related violence. One problem: Budweiser, famous for its beer, is a major sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup being held in Brazil. So something had to give. And according to comedian John Oliver, it was the alcohol ban. "The amazing thing is here FIFA won. They successfully pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums," Oliver said June 8 on his HBO show Last Week Tonight. "And at this point you can either be horrified by that or relieved that FIFA was not also sponsored by cocaine and chainsaws." We decided to investigate the brewhaha. FIFA spokeswoman Delia Fisher said "there is no Budweiser bill," though "it’s true that at the World Cup we will be able to sell beer, and that was part of our requirements." Brazil knew about FIFA’s requirements when it bid to host the World Cup, she said. Indeed, Budweiser and Brahma, owned by Belgian-Brazilian company Anheuser-Busch InBev, are on tap and will be sold in plastic cups at matches, she said. So what happened? Oliver’s research team sent us many news stories to back up his claim, including a January 2012 CNN International story highlighting the controversy and comments from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke. "Alcoholic drinks are part of the FIFA World Cup, so we’re going to have them," Valcke said in January 2012. "Excuse me if I sound a bit arrogant, but that's something we won't negotiate." Valcke was also irritated about the country’s all-around lack of progress for the tournament. His comments, in turn, outraged Brazilians two years ago, with leaders at one point refusing to meet with him. Slowly and controversially, FIFA got what it wanted. A World Cup-related bill passed Brazil’s Senate in May 2012 and President Dilma Rousseff signed it into law in June 2012. Rousseff announced a temporary amendment that allowed beer to be sold at the World Cup and also the Confederations Cup in 2013. The bill that passed actually did not explicitly authorize beer sales at the matches, but government leaders said it allowed Brazil to lift the alcohol ban during the World Cup month, per FIFA’s demand. One senator explained the law simply ratified what the executive branch had already done by agreeing to FIFA’s requirements when it bid for the Cup, according to an Associated Press account. In short, the bill that passed in Brazil set the guidelines for hosting the World Cup. And by not including a ban on alcohol, alcohol effectively is permitted. Oliver referred to the measure as a "so-called Budweiser bill," but we did not find that characterization widely spread in news stories in a Nexis search, though the connection is unmistakable. His research team pointed to the phrase used in a New Zealand study of alcohol consumption at sporting events (referring to FIFA’s lobbying in Brazil over beer) and also on a blog called Left Foot Forward. This probably won’t be the last time we hear about a country bending its alcohol prohibitions to please FIFA. Similar stadium bans exist in Russia, host of the 2018 World Cup, and Qatar, the small Middle Eastern country that will host in 2022. Our ruling Oliver called out FIFA for having "pressured Brazil into passing a so-called Budweiser bill, allowing beer sales in soccer stadiums." There is no doubt that FIFA demanded beer be allowed to be sold at this summer’s World Cup, and that it was part of an agreement to host the World Cup in the first place. That fits a typical definition of pressure. Oliver took a bit more creative license in calling it the "so-called Budweiser bill," but the characterization does not diminish Oliver’s overall point.

pomt-06391	"The Christian Coalition gave (Adam) Hasner an F."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/31/george-lemieux/georg-lemieux-says-adam-hasner-got-f-christian-coa/	Is Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner a failure according to the Christian Coalition? That's what one of Hasner's primary opponents, George LeMieux, wants voters to think. A video we saw on LeMieux's website, www.phonyconservative.com, on Oct. 5, 2011, picks apart Hasner's record as a former state legislator: "In politics talk is cheap. Voting records matter. Career politician Adam Hasner wants you to think he is a conservative," states the sinister voice as images of Hasner speaking in the Legislature appear on the screen. "Small problem. His record. Hasner used to describe himself as a 'moderate' because his support for stem cell research, his attempt to weaken pro-life laws and his opposition to expanding school vouchers. The Christian Coalition gave Hasner an F...." states the voice as the screen flashes to a 2007 report card highlighting that Hasner scored 57.1. In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we looked into LeMieux's accusations that Hasner tried to weaken pro-life laws and opposed expanding vouchers. Here we're wondering about that "F" for Hasner, who is trying to tout his conservative credentials. Ouch. Does this LeMieux claim make the grade? The Christian Coalition of Florida is a conservative organization that takes stances on several social and economic issues -- including opposing abortion, gay marriage and pornography. The organization publishes a report card of state legislators annually and grades them on multiple issues and gives legislators an "x" when they vote against the Coalition's stance and a checkmark if they vote in favor of the Coalition's stance. The Coalition then tallies the legislator's votes and calculates a numerical grade. For example, the 2009 report card evaluated how legislators voted on bills pertaining to bestiality, criminal history screening for sports coaches, Internet safety at public libraries, preventing homelessness and other laws. Hasner was elected in 2002 and served until 2010. As of Oct. 27, 2011, the Coalition hadn't yet posted a 2010 report card so we examined Hasner's report cards for 2003 to 2009: 2003: 83 2003-04: 82 2005: 100 2005-06: 92.3 2007: 57.1 2008: 100 2009: 78.6 Some of the report cards overlap. For instance, the Christian Coalition evaluated legislators in 2003 and then created a two-year scorecard for 2003 and 2004. The same for 2005 and 2005-06. We could not reach anyone from the Christian Coalition by telephone or e-mail for an explanation of the overlapping years. A note about the Coalition's status: It still exists but is for now is operating under the same leadership as the Florida Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Brett Doster, a board member of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Doster founded Front Line Strategies, a public relations firm in Tallahassee that works with conservative candidates and organizations. Because some votes essentially are counted twice, we can't create an average score for Hasner during his time in the Legislature. However, Hasner got a perfect 100 percent twice and scored an "A" in a third year. He has two "B" years, one "C" and one "F." That's the "F" LeMieux is talking about. So what happened that year? The Christian Coalition gave Hasner an "F" for voting in favor of a slew of gambling measures that the coalition opposed. Hasner was at odds with the coalition on six of 14 votes. Hasner voted in favor of these gambling bills in 2007: Senate Bill 134: Allows cardrooms to conduct games of dominoes Senate Bill 500: Provides requirements for operation of instant bingo games Senate Bill 752: Revises hours of operation for card rooms House Bill 1047 and Amendment to House bill 1047: A pro-slot machine gaming measure Amendment to Senate Bill 1376: The bill itself granted the Department of Lottery authority to obtain patents. Hasner adviser Rick Wilson pointed out that LeMieux cannot cast himself as an opponent of gaming. LeMieux, a former chief of staff to Gov. Charlie Crist, helped shape the state's gaming deal with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times reported April 23, 2011. But that's not what we're checking here. The LeMieux video correctly states that Hasner received an "F" from the Christian Coalition. But that only accounts for one-seventh of Hasner's report cards from the coalition. To provide an accurate picture requires examining all of his report cards. Also, the video's statement about the Christian Coalition grade is preceded by claims about Hasner's stances on stem cell research, abortion and school vouchers and it could create a false impression that those are the reasons the Christian Coalition gave him an F. But that wasn't the case. The Coalition flunked Hasner in 2007 due to his pro-gambling votes. And the Coalition wasn't exactly impressed with the rest of the House either -- it gave state representatives on average the equivalent of a D-minus that year. Failing grades were passed out to Republican Reps. Carlos Lopez-Cantera (now majority leader) and Jennifer Carroll (now lieutenant governor).

pomt-05784	Says 21,000 Wisconsin residents got jobs in 2011, but "18,000 of them" were in other states.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/26/kathleen-vinehout/dem-candidate-wisconsin-governor-says-85-percent-n/	A week after announcing she would run against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in a recall election, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, claimed that most of Wisconsin’s job growth under the Republican governor has occurred in other states. Huh? "Did you know that the governors of our surrounding states have done a much better job of creating jobs for Wisconsinites than the governor himself?" Vinehout told a group of Democrats on Feb. 15, 2012. "I did a little bit of math and I compared December (2010) to December (2011) -- 21,000 new jobs were created, 18,000 of them were from the governors of other states." Hmmm. That would mean 85 percent of newly employed Wisconsin residents stayed in Wisconsin, but got jobs in other states. Checking the evidence We asked Vinehout campaign spokeswoman Jamie Rebman for backup. She provided a January 2012 news release from the state Department of Workforce Development. Citing two figures in the release, Rebman said that between December 2010 and December 2011, 21,400 more Wisconsin residents were working, but only 3,200 more jobs had been added in the state. Using simple subtraction, she said, that means some 18,000 newly employed Wisconsinites got their jobs in other states. But the two figures Rebman cited come from different data sets, making them an apples-to-oranges comparison. What’s more, the news release doesn’t reference out-of-state jobs at all. We tried to follow up with Rebman, but instead got a call back from Doug Kane, who said he was with Vinehout’s campaign and was calling to answer our questions. He reiterated that he believed Vinehout’s math was accurate. We then asked Kane about his role with the campaign and he said he is a volunteer, but has a Ph.D. in economics, does some consulting -- and is Vinehout’s husband. Kane is also a former Democratic state representative from Illinois who later did some tax policy consulting for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Asking the experts Kane didn’t offer any additional evidence, so we went to the experts -- the state Department of Workforce Development, which issued the news release Vinehout relies on, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau is the agency that actually produces the employment numbers. Both agencies confirmed that 21,000 more Wisconsin residents were employed in December 2011 compared with a year earlier, and that Wisconsin saw a net increase of 3,000 jobs during that time. But they also said Vinehout’s deduction, that 18,000 of the newly employed Wisconsin residents got jobs out of state, is wrong chiefly because it mixes two numbers that measure different things and are collected differently. 1. The 21,000 more Wisconsin residents employed figure is derived from a wide survey of households that generates the unemployment rate that is frequently reported in the news. The survey covers people in all job categories, including agriculture, the self-employed and people who work more than 15 hours in a week in family-run businesses but don’t get paid. But the survey does not determine how many of the 21,000 got jobs in Wisconsin or in other states. 2. The 3,000 new jobs in Wisconsin figure is based on a survey of employers in Wisconsin -- and it is narrower, in that it does not include farms, the self-employed or certain family-run businesses. The survey does not determine how many of the employers’ workers live in Wisconsin or in other states. In short, the two figures are apples and oranges -- you can’t simply subtract the smaller number from the larger to determine the number of newly employed Wisconsin residents who got jobs out of the state. "It’s a logical conclusion people make; unfortunately, it’s an erroneous assumption to make," said Nelse Grundvig, a Department of Workforce Development official. Similar miscalculations When it comes to confusing jobs numbers, we’re in familiar territory. State Sen. Mark Miller, D-Monona, earned a False when he misused federal figures in a claim about how many jobs have been lost under Walker. And we gave the Republican Party of Wisconsin a False for misusing two sets of numbers to claim that over half of the U.S. job growth in June 2011 came from Wisconsin. Before we close, do we have any idea how much border hopping goes on each workday? The Department of Workforce Development says the most recent figures -- reported by the Census Bureau and based on various sets of data -- show that in 2009, 2.53 million people lived and worked in Wisconsin; nearly 132,000 lived in Wisconsin and worked out of state; and more than 70,000 people in other states held jobs in Wisconsin. But those numbers are from yet another type of survey and from a different period than the one Vinehout addressed in her comments. She as much as conceded her error by removing from her campaign web site a statement that made the same claim she did to the group of Democrats. Our rating Vinehout said she "did a little bit of math" with employment figures and found that 21,000 more Wisconsin residents were working at the end of 2011 than were a year earlier, but that 18,000 of the jobs were in other states. Government experts who compiled the figures said Vinehout is wrong because the numbers she put into her equation aren’t compatible. They said there’s no way to know how many of the 21,000 people got jobs in Wisconsin or in other states. We rate Vinehout’s statement False.

pomt-07881	Georgia has some of the best maintained roads in America.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/07/vance-smith/georgia-roads-are-among-americas-best-state-offici/	Vance Smith, the plain-spoken commissioner of Georgia’s Transportation Department, had an interesting story to tell state lawmakersabout the condition of the Peach State’s roads. Smith said he was at a conference a year or so ago,sitting quietly near the back of the room, when a top transportation official from Missouri told the audience how they are trying to improve their roads -- mentioning that they measure themselves against a certain state from the South. "At the top, there was a long, red line, and as I looked, it had the word ‘Georgia’ besides there," Smith said during a Jan. 19 state budget hearing at the Capitol. "It made me feel pretty good in a conference that this gentleman is trying to reach this baseline and the baseline was the state of Georgia." So are Georgia’s roads really that good? GDOT officials have boasted in some cases, like a January 2010 press release, that "Georgia’s highways have consistently been rated among the nation’s best maintained highways." GDOT spokesman David Spear told us that Georgia’s roads are "some of the best maintained" in America. Other motorists, particularly in the Atlanta area, may raise their eyebrows at GDOT’s claim. Shirley Franklin created a "pothole strike team" during the early days of her first term as Atlanta mayor to deal with the tire nuisance that seemed to be on virtually every city street. WGCL-TV in Atlanta has a reporter, Harry Samler, who searches for potholes and presses the public officials in charge to fill them. So should we really all go out and burn rubber? We asked Smith’s office about what is Missouri using to measure itself that ranks Georgia at the top. Spear pointed to a couple of organizations that conduct research on road conditions by each state. The most recent report was completed in September 2010 by the conservative-leaning Reason Foundation, based in Washington, D.C. The foundation’s report ranked Georgia ninth in overall performance, using data from 2008. Interestingly, Missouri, the state Smith recalled that was trying to catch up to Georgia, finished one spot ahead of the Peach State in the overall rankings. The Reason Foundation researchers used data that compiles how much money each state spends, on average, to maintain its roads and bridges. It used information sent by each state to the federal government about the percentage of its interstate and rural roads in poor condition, traffic congestion, the percentage of bridges in bad shape and fatality rates. The Reason report, and others, focus primarily on road conditions on interstate highways, state roads, bridges and other busy thoroughfares. The lumpy lanes in some subdivisions don’t count. Georgia was tied for first in three categories: rural interstate pavement condition, rural principal arterial condition and urban interstate condition. The Peach State scored its lowest (39th) in capital spending on bridges, was 37th in total disbursements per mile and was 31st in urban interstate congestion -- although the foundation observed that Georgia had improved in that area from the prior year. Georgia was 15th in the percentage of its bridges that were deficient or obsolete. Spear said money for road maintenance has been a problem in recent years. "Frankly, as our financial resources have declined steadily in recent years, it has become problematic for the department to maintain that high level of maintenance, particularly on the secondary road system," Spear said. "We simply don’t have the resources." Georgia fared well in another rating system of road toughness: the International Roughness Index. The index uses a formula created by the United States National Cooperative Highway Research Program that was continued by the World Bank to measure road quality.Each state conducts research of its roads and sends the findings to the Federal Highway Administration. The findings are measured against prior data to measure for consistency. In 2008, the most recent data available, more than 90 percent of Georgia’s rural, urban minor arterial and urban collector roads were considered good or smooth. Georgia was the only state to finish above 90 percent in each category. Frank Moretti, director of policy and research for TRIP, a national transportation research group based in Washington, D.C., believes the research about Georgia. He said one reason why most Georgia roads are in good condition is because of the climate, which damages state roads less than in most states. He added: "The state in the past has tried to use materials and designs that were longer lasting. The challenge is to keep them in that condition with the dollars being stretched further and further." TRIP and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials released a report in 2009 on the nation’s roads. It found Georgia drivers spend less ($44) than motorists in any state on additional vehicle operating costs due to rough roads. Georgia, Moretti said, has fewer urbanized roads, which helps the Peach State score well. Georgia’s population growth, particularly in metro Atlanta, may make it tougher for it to remain high on the list. "I think traffic congestion is the greatest challenge the state faces to maintain a level of mobility that is going to maintain economic development," he said. OK, where does this leave us? Georgia is tops in some road maintenance categories. Its score in the Reason Foundation report was weighed down by data that found Georgia spends less money than most states in some road maintenance areas. Traffic congestion, where Georgia scored lower than most states, does result in more wear and tear on its roads. Spear, the GDOT spokesman, contends that congestion is important but does not address the overall condition of the road. Georgia does rank high in nearly all measures of road maintenance. We rate the commissioner’s comments about Georgia’s roads as True.	None	Vance Smith	None	None	None	2011-02-07T06:00:00	2011-01-19	['United_States']
pomt-12304	"Massive Bumble Bee recall after 2 employees admit cooking a man and mixing him with a batch of tuna."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/26/blog-posting/fake-headline-muddles-real-story-man-cooked-death-/	A news story that said a tuna fish recall came after workers at a canning company cooked a man and added him to the product is mash-up of two real stories under a fake headline. "Massive Bumble Bee recall after 2 employees admit cooking a man and mixing him with a batch of tuna," read the headline on an April 6, 2017, post on BlueLineStrong.net. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The story itself isn’t entirely made up — but it has been repurposed with a bogus headline for a few years. The BlueLineStrong.net post is largely an excerpt from an April 28, 2015, Associated Press article. Here’s what happened. The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office charged two men at a Bumble Bee Foods plant for violating safety regulations in the death of a fellow employee. Jose Melena, 62, was performing maintenance inside a 35-foot-long oven at a plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 11, 2012. He was trapped and died when workers filled the oven with six tons of canned tuna and turned it up to 270 degrees to cook and sterilize the food. Angel Rodriguez, the plant operations director; Saul Florez, the safety manager; and Bumble Bee Foods all faced three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules. Bumble Bee Foods settled the case in August 2015 for $6 million. To be clear, no one chopped up Melena and put his remains in the meat. A website called TheRacketReport.com posted the story excerpt on April 28, 2015, the same day the AP story was published. It carried the headline, "Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna." The story doesn’t mention anyone being mixed in with the fish, despite the headline. The site’s About Us link noted that "the articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways." Fast forward to the following year. On March 16, 2016, Bumble Bee Foods did issue a real recall for "process deviations," and not for the incident related Melena. Fake news site News4KTLA.com recycled the AP story about the workers being charged in Melena’s death the next day. The post also re-used the fake headline "Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna." The site attempts to look like a real media outlet, but does not give an indication it is fake, saying it covers "southern Louisiana and the surrounding area." The real KTLA TV station is based in Los Angeles. The fake headline has been passed around ever since. We rate the headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-11550	"The past president (Barack Obama) brought Al Sharpton into the White House something like 80 times."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/09/glenn-grothman/gop-wisconsin-house-member-sharpton-visits-obama-w/	President Donald Trump ignited an international firestorm when at a Jan. 11, 2018, Oval Office meeting with lawmakers on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, he reportedly said the U.S. should take in fewer immigrants from "s---hole countries" like Haiti, El Salvador and African countries -- and more immigrants from countries like Norway. Trump denied making the comment, tweeting "the language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used." While speaking Jan. 15, 2018, at a Ripon College event commemorating Martin Luther King Jr. Day, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) was asked to comment on controversial remarks that have been made by the president. Grothman was not specifically asked about, nor did he mention, Trump's controversial comments at the Oval Office meeting. Instead, as reported by the Ripon Commonwealth Press, Grothman said some of Trump’s tweets have been "unhelpful," but he sees the president as someone trying to unite the country. "I think he is doing what he can to try to bring people together," Grothman said. "I mean, if you meet him, that is just obvious, and I think he has had to put up with — to a certain extent, it’s self-inflicted — more scrutiny than other presidents." Grothman went on to compare reactions to Trump's actions with those of his predecessor, Barack Obama. "The past president brought Al Sharpton into the White House something like 80 times," Grothman said. "That was kind of stunning to me, but nobody ever made a big ruckus out of it." To some, Sharpton is a lightning rod. But did he really visit the White House that many times? Grothman's evidence Bernadette Green, Grothman's director of communications, said that as of December 2014, Sharpton had made 72 official recorded visits to the White House. "Keep in mind that not all visits were recorded, so that number could be higher and we have no way of knowing," Green said in an email. "Congressman Grothman is correct in saying 'around 80' as he was estimating, and was not too far off the actual number (and again, these are only the visits recorded up until Dec. 2014)." Green said Grothman wanted to note that the reason he has an issue with Sharpton visiting the White House is because of Sharpton’s 1990s activities, specifically the 1991 riot in Crown Heights in New York. Sharpton was widely criticized for remarks he made at a funeral that some said inflamed the situation that sparked the rioting. Sharpton also came under fire in 1995 for helping to sponsor protests during a landlord-tenant dispute that escalated and erupted into a fatal blaze at Jewish-owned Freddy’s Fashion Mart in Harlem. PolitiFact Wisconsin emailed a request for comment from Sharpton to his Harlem-based National Action Network but received no response. The Washington Post fact checker PolitiFact has not looked at this claim before, but our friends at the Washington Post have. In December 2014, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during an interview on CBS News' "Face the Nation," said President Barack Obama "has had Al Sharpton to the White House 80, 85 times" and that made Sharpton a "close adviser." The Post checked White House visitor logs and reported that Sharpton's recorded visits through December 2014 stood at 72: One-on-one meetings: 5 (7 percent) Meetings with staff members or senior advisers, with more than one guest: 20 (27 percent) Events with more than 90 people: 16 (22 percent) Miscellaneous meetings or events, ranging from 3 to 700 guests: 31 (43 percent) The Post concluded that Giuliani picked the high end of the range from 80 to 85 visits that Sharpton made to the White House through 2014 and said "it is correct that the figure Giuliani cites fits within the reported range." But Giuliani earned one Pinocchio for the "exaggeration" of referring to Sharpton as an Obama White House "close adviser." The Post Fact Checker defines one Pinocchio as "some shading of the facts. Selective telling of the truth. Some omissions and exaggerations, but no outright falsehoods." PolitiFact Wisconsin visited the White House Visitor Log site to check the data for Sharpton's visits after December 2014, but the site features this note: "This is historical material 'frozen in time.' The website is no longer updated and links to external websites and some internal pages may not work." Thomas Hayes, archivist at the Barack Obama Presidential Library, noted in an email that the records we needed are not currently available to the public through records requests. The Barack Obama Presidential records are administered in accordance with the requirements of the 1978 Presidential Records Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2209. Under this law, Presidential records are not available to the public through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests until five years after the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) takes custody of the records or until NARA staff has completed processing and organization of an integral file segment of these Presidential records, whichever is earlier. Neither of these terms have been met, therefore the Barack Obama Presidential records that you seek are not available at this time. According to the Memory Hole 2 website: "the Obama White House kept adding its visitor logs to the same spreadsheet file, instead of releasing separate files covering certain time periods. That spreadsheet eventually grew gargantuan. When last updated at the end of 2016, it had become 1.1 gigabytes with 6 million rows. This is a big problem." The site pointed out that "the most popular spreadsheet software -- Excel, a part of Microsoft Office -- maxes out at just over a million rows. Word won't even try to open a file over 500 megs. And even if you had willing software, it's unlikely that a typical computer can handle the job. What good is an important historical record that almost no one can open?" That said, the frozen White House site did have visitor logs posted through September 2016. PolitiFact Wisconsin was able to download the massive visitor log and, with an assist from data wiz Michael Andre come up with this tally of listed names: Alfred C. Sharpton -- 78; Alfred Sharpton -- 27; Al Sharpton -- 13. That comes to a total of 118 visits, through September 2016. For the record, the Trump Administration has not made its White House Visitor Log information available to the public. Our rating Grothman said Obama "brought Al Sharpton into the White House something like 80 times." A December 2014 check of White House visitor logs by The Washington Post found that Sharpton's recorded visits stood at 72 at that time, though most were for large events. Our analysis of logs through September 2016 showed 118 entries. For a statement that is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing, our rating is True.

pomt-09715	The Democrats' health care bill "gives a new Health Choices Commissioner the right to look at an individual's tax return to determine what medical benefits or subsidies that person qualifies for."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/29/concerned-women-america/conservative-group-says-health-care-reform-bill-al/	Concerned Women for America, a conservative group, says the Democrats' health care reform bill could allow the government to peek into your tax records. On its Web site, the group states, "Not only are your medical records at risk under Obamacare, but your financial records too. The proposed bill expressly gives a new Health Choices Commissioner the right to look at an individual's tax return to determine what medical benefits or subsidies that person qualifies for." The CWA statement seems to be referring to the health care bill (H.R. 3200) that was approved in the summer of 2009 by three House committees. That bill — which formed the basis for the version from the House Democratic leadership introduced on Oct. 29, 2009 — would create a health choices commissioner. This new post would wield broad authority over the federal program, including setting minimum standards for health care plans, operating a new health insurance exchange and, most importantly for the purposes of the CWA's claim, determining who will qualify for federal subsidies to buy health insurance. Under the bill, Congress would set income levels to establish who is eligible for "affordability credits," which are designed for people in the lower middle class who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but who don't earn enough to buy their own insurance. The credits would allow them to get insurance on the health care exchange, a new virtual marketplace for people who are currently uninsured or buy coverage on the individual market. The commissioner is assigned to determine who qualifies. H.R. 3200 includes a passage that gives the commissioner authority to get tax records to determine how much people earn: "In carrying out this subtitle, the Commissioner shall request from the Secretary of the Treasury consistent with section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 such information as may be required to carry out this subtitle." In the new House bill introduced on Oct. 29, lawmakers included similar language. We looked up Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code and found that it does indeed cover "Confidentiality and Disclosure of Returns and Return Information." So the passage in the bill does indicate that the CWA is right that the commissioner would have the ability to access information from tax returns in order to run the program that provides individual affordability credits. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee bill — which would also provide health insurance subsidies for qualifying Americans — has language similar to that in the House bills, with the main difference being that it would rely on the Department of Health and Human Services rather than the newly created health choices commissioner. "The bill permits the IRS to substantiate the accuracy of income and family size information that has been provided to HHS for eligibility determination," the Senate bill states. So in this regard, the House and Senate are consistent, and CWA's claim is largely correct. Still, experts we spoke with offered a couple of caveats. • The notion that federal officials would look at tax information to determine "medical benefits" is a significant exaggeration. The bills allow the government to use tax information when determining if someone is eligible for subsidies. But it is incorrect to suggest, as CWA seems to do, that the commissioner might deny a specific treatment for a disease based on something on one's tax return. Our experts could think of only one scenario in which a federal official's use of personal tax information might influence benefits, and that would be indirectly. If someone applied for a subsidy to purchase a private plan, but officials found that their income was too low to be eligible for the subsidy, they would need to apply instead for Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health care for the poor. Presumably, Medicaid and the private plan the person had been looking at would offer a different package of benefits. But even if that happened, there's reason to think that Medicaid would actually offer a better and cheaper package for the beneficiary than private coverage, especially if they have a disability, said Edwin Park, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And in any case, there's nothing included in any of the health care bills that says that federal officials would be determining specific medical treatments based on information gleaned from a tax return. • The group was a bit overbroad in characterizing what private information federal officials could look at. While the CWA said that the commissioner would have "the right to look at an individual's tax return to determine what medical benefits or subsidies that person qualifies for," the commissioner would actually have the right to look at the pertinent information from that return — not the entire return. In this case, that would include such information as a taxpayer's filing status, number of dependents and modified adjusted gross income. • The commissioner would not be looking at everyone's tax information — only the information for people who apply for the affordability credits. (And even then, it's not clear whether the commissioner would request information for every applicant or simply spot-check for audit purposes.) • Finally, this authority to review tax information isn't new. Under existing law, tax returns, or information from returns, can be shared with federal, state or judicial officials for many reasons, including: — Social Security benefits, food stamps, unemployment benefits, and federal housing subsidies — Tracking down people who are behind in child support or are delinquent on their student loans — Various forms of Medicare benefits While we conclude that the CWA is partly right on this one, it has cranked up the hyperbole. Federal officials would be able to look at specific tax information, but they couldn't go through entire returns. And while officials would have the power to see private tax information, they would not be able to use it to decide what specific medical treatments someone would receive. So we find the group's claim Half True.	None	Concerned Women for America	None	None	None	2009-10-29T17:43:17	2009-10-28	['None']
pomt-11464	Michelle Obama Just Received Life-Shattering News from the Doctor	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/07/ny-fox-news-ny-fox-news/fake-news-claims-michelle-obama-has-made-hateful-c/	A fake news story says that former First Lady Michelle Obama has been diagnosed by a doctor with having a habit of making disparaging remarks about America in order to save her husband’s presidential legacy. "Michelle Obama just received life-shattering news from the doctor" read the headline on March 4, 2018 on NY FOX News, a blog with no real affiliation to Fox News, a Fox News spokesperson confirmed. The post was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found many things wrong with this post. The story begins by accusing Obama of staying out of the public eye only to appear when slamming President Donald Trump. It goes on to say that she has been unofficially diagnosed by Dr. Lauren A. Wright, a public affairs professor at Princeton University and a board member of the White House Transition Project. The "diagnosis" referred to is the analysis of first ladies Wright gives in her book, On Behalf of the President. In the book, Wright describes the ways in which Obama helped shape her husband’s legacy from a personal place as a mother and wife, focusing on her use of social media. While Wright notes that Obama has made more speeches and major public appearances in her first six years in office than any first lady in recent history, she writes that they were in support of her husband’s policy agenda, not slams toward Trump and America. The NY FOX News post contradicts itself by claiming that Obama has remained out of the public eye yet tries to remain "the center of everyone’s attention" by making public remarks against America. The article notes that one of the biggest claims made by Obama was that America was a racist nation that needed her husband in office. Obama has spoken out about racially motivated remarks that were made against her appearance while she was in office, but she has never claimed that America is "a racist nation." The other claim made is how Obama was never proud of America until her husband had been elected to the White House, a statement made in 2008 that was taken out of context and was debunked as False by PolitiFact in 2017. The motivations of NY FOX News are unclear. The website appears to have started publishing stories on Feb. 28, 2018, most of which appear to be false. The website includes no contact information, has no "About us" page that we could find, and does list any authors. It does not appear to display advertising. The website is registered in Panama. This claim about Michelle Obama’s diagnosis is a hoax. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	NY FOX News	None	None	None	2018-03-07T12:23:55	2018-03-04	['None']

Jeff Stone (R-Greendale) was a state lawmaker working on transportation issues when he unveiled a plan to put Mitchell International Airport under the control of an appointed airport authority -- and take control away from Milwaukee County government. Now, five years later, Stone is running for Milwaukee County executive -- and his failed attempt to create regional airport control is back in the news. Stone’s campaign kickoff on Dec. 15, 2010 didn’t include any major pronouncements, but in questions from reporters the privatizing claim popped up. "I never proposed privatizing the airport," Stone said, responding to a question. "What we looked at was a regional operation for the airport" to enhance job and business growth in the area. With the executive’s race getting fired up, we decided to look into Stone’s statement. When he pushed for an appointed regional authority to govern Mitchell, Stone and a top aide said he was acting on behalf of some in Milwaukee’s business community. Business leaders have long wanted to ensure that eventual airport expansion could proceed and that day-to-day airport operations could be divorced from Milwaukee County Board politics. More than one-fourth of airports in the country are governed by an independent board. At the time, critics -- notably elected officials representing citizens living near the airport -- hit Stone hard. They revealed the fact airport authority backers, including a Stone aide, secretly met with business officials to draft a plan to spin the airport off from the county. They pointed out the airport’s reputation as a well-run, financially self-sufficient enterprise. County Supervisor Marina Dimitrijevic, in remarks echoed by her then-colleague Richard Nyklewicz, accused Stone of seeking to "privatize" Mitchell "by handing over management to an unaccountable, appointed board." Stone, then and now, vehemently denies that his support for an airport authority constitutes "privatization." So who’s right? The legislation Stone co-authored would have taken Mitchell out of direct public control of county government. Notably, the bill he introduced prohibited the governor and county executive from putting politicians or government employees on the board that would control the airport authority. Around the country, some airport authorities have elected official representation and some do not, three experts told PolitiFact Wisconsin. It’s also clear that the intent was to give airlines -- private companies -- much greater sway over airport affairs. A "business first mentality," is how Stone aide Mike Pyritz described the idea in an interview. Additionally, as head of a 2006 state legislative study committee on airport authorities, Stone invited testimony from Reason Institute transportation researcher Robert Poole, who had just released a study saying that a long-term lease of Mitchell to a private operator could reap hundreds of millions of dollars. But we could find no evidence that Stone ever got behind the notion of leasing or selling Mitchell to a private operator, nor was that approach included in his airport authority bill. It was, in fact, the Milwaukee County Board that, in 2006, launched a study of the privatization possibilities. Even if Stone’s bill had passed in Madison, the airport still would have been owned by Milwaukee County, albeit with greater private influence. The airport authority would have been a government creation run by appointees of elected officials. Similar, though not identical, examples abound in Wisconsin under the general label of quasi-governmental entities, including the Wisconsin Center District, whose political appointees run the Frontier Airlines Center in downtown Milwaukee. Richard Abelson, a top Milwaukee public-sector union official, served on the 2006 state legislative study committee on airport authorities that Stone chaired. Abelson is an opponent of airport authorities, and is wary of moves that could lead to outsourcing of airport jobs. He says Stone’s proposal did not amount to privatization. That, Abelson said, would mean leasing the airport to a private operator. "He got tagged with misinformation," Abelson said of Stone, adding "some people considered an authority a first step toward privatization." Debby McElroy, executive vice president of Airports Council International, the trade association for airports, agreed that privatization was not at issue in the Milwaukee case. Two experienced airline lease negotiators at Leigh/Fisher, an aviation management consulting firm, also said privatization was not the right word to describe Stone’s proposal. Let’s bring this one in for a landing. Stone says he did not support privatizing Mitchell International Airport. Stone’s airport proposal would have created a quasi-public governance structure at Mitchell International Airport. A significant change, to be sure. But his approach stopped far short of turning the airport over to a private concern. Even a leading union official for Milwaukee County employees says calling the plan "privatization" overshoots the runway. We rate Stone’s claim True.

pomt-04383	Says the University of Texas can afford to build a medical school because it has a $7 billion endowment and its football program had a $50 million profit last year.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/19/rob-moshein/austin-resident-says-university-texas-has-7-billio/	Rob Moshein of Austin says he favors a local University of Texas medical school but will vote against a proposed tax increase pitched as vital to fulfilling such plans. "Why?" Moshein said in a letter to the editor in the Oct. 14, 2012, Austin American-Statesman. "Because the University of Texas has a $7 billion endowment, and the football program brought in $50 (million) in profit last year alone." "UT can well afford this medical school," his letter says. "...Find the funding elsewhere. If it’s really that important, I suspect they will. They have the cash." To date, the UT System Board of Regents has committed at least $25 million a year toward the envisioned medical school, plus $5 million annually for eight years to buy equipment. This commitment is contingent on $35 million in annual community funding, which would come from the tax hike proposed by Travis County’s Central Health, along with continued financial support from the Seton Healthcare Family. So, UT does stand to pony up. Still, we wondered if UT could pay for the sought school thanks to its $7 billion endowment and football team profits of $50 million, as Moshein's letter puts it. By email, Moshein told us his endowment figure came from a Wikipedia entry for UT-Austin. We ran the figure past Randy Wallace, the UT System’s chief budget officer, who emailed that one could arrive at such an estimate for the Austin campus’s overall "endowment" by imputing how much revenue it receives thanks to its stake in the Permanent University Fund plus the value of many individual campus endowments built on individual donations. The permanent fund, established in 1876, helps support eligible institutions of the UT and Texas A&M University systems. Its value is rooted in 2.1 million acres of West Texas lands that produces two streams of income -- oil and gas royalties and surface interests such as grazing leases. Annual distributions from the total return on all investment assets is transferred to the Available University Fund, with two thirds going to the UT System and one third to the A&M system. Moshein also noted a story posted on July 2, 2012, by Alcalde, the magazine of UT’s Ex-Students’ Association, which says that the annual distributions depend "on the overall health of the global financial markets, because the return on investment depends on market performance." Wallace pointed out to us the annual distributions cannot exceed 7 percent of the average market value of the permanent fund investments. He said the fund was valued at $14.4 billion in the year that ended Aug. 31, 2011, and will be valued at more than that for the 2012 fiscal year once accounting is complete. In 2011, Wallace said, some $506 million was distributed, with the UT System landing about $350 million. The Austin campus ultimately received nearly $158 million, he said, about 45 percent of what was available. That fits with a regents’ policy that 45 percent of the UT System’s money fielded from the available fund each year must be spent supporting UT-Austin. Wallace said the regents also are permitted to spend such money on system administration; debt service on certain bonds backed by the permanent fund; and initiatives that benefit the system as a whole. For the year that ran through August 2010, the regents forwarded nearly $246 million in fund proceeds to the Austin campus, counting $20 million designated to support faculty recruitment and $5 million for the Center for Technology Commercialization. Wallace said the added dollops were to be spent over several years. The regents budgeted $178.5 million in fund proceeds for the Austin campus for the year that ran through August 2012, according to a December 2011 UT System report to the governor and lawmakers. The report projects the Austin campus to field $166 million in this way in 2013 and $182 million in 2014. So, it looks like the Austin campus can lately count on annual infusions of $158 million or more, thanks to the permanent fund. Next, we turned to Moshein’s claim that the football team reaped $50 million in profits last year, which he attributed to 2009-10 totals described on the BusinessofCollegeSports.com sports business news website. Most recently, UT football has netted some 56 percent more than that. To our inquiry, Nick Voinis, a UT athletics department spokesman, passed along the university’s latest summary of program revenues and expenses as submitted to the U.S. Department of Education. It says that in 2011-12, football program revenues were $103.8 million while expenses were $25.9 million, leaving a football profit of nearly $78 million. And was the $78 million equivalent to loose cash? Negative, UT officials said. By phone, Voinis told us the bulk of football’s profit helped cover the athletic department’s administrative costs and supported other sports programs. On a UT web page, the athletic department says athletic-related income covers its salaries, fringe benefits, utilities and construction plus an administrative fee paid to the university for accounting and payroll costs, among others. The department also pays approximately $15 million a year for other goods and services such as utilities, student-athlete housing, student-athlete tuition, event parking and transportation, the web entry says. Finally, from 2005-06 to 2010-11, the department says, it transferred $14.4 million to various academic programs. A senior associate athletic director, Dave Marmion, said by phone that of the university’s 19 other men’s and women’s intercollegiate sports in 2011-12, 17 drew on football’s gains to cover expenses. During the year, the baseball and men’s basketball teams had more revenue than expenses, UT’s submission to the education department indicates. UT’s unprofitable sports teams ran a little more than $17 million in the red, the report indicates. But this tally does not count $67 million in expenses marked as not attributable to a particular sport or sports. Broadly, Voinis said, "football drives our budget. It pays for a lot of things around here." We asked how UT would fund the unprofitable sports if the football proceeds were applied, say, to launch a medical school. Voinis suggested we ask higher-ups and campus spokesman Gary Susswein put us in touch with Kevin Hegarty, the institution’s chief financial officer, who said that if football profits were redirected to a medical school, programs that currently benefit from the profits would be out of luck. Hegarty agreed the university enjoys around $400 million in combined annual proceeds from the available fund and many endowments established to support specific scholarships, professorships or other projects. But almost all the project-specific endowment funds could not be redirected to a medical school, he said, while shifting revenue tied to the permanent fund would short existing commitments to basic operating costs such as faculty and staff salaries and utilities. "It’s committed," Hegarty said. "I can’t just take it without saying, ‘Don’t teach whatever you’re teaching.’ ...I don’t have any endowments there to fund a medical school." We also asked Wallace of the UT System if UT-Austin could apply its permanent fund-related receipts to a project like a medical school. Legally yes, but practically no, he replied. "The consequences of doing it would decimate the institution," he said. Moshein, asked for further thoughts, did not quibble with UT having existing priorities. He said by email he still intends to vote against the tax increase. Our ruling Moshein said the University of Texas has a $7 billion endowment and its football program had a $50 million profit last year, indications it can afford to fund a medical school. His endowment tally seems about right and he undershoots football’s 2011-12 profits. However, such funds couldn't be siphoned off for a medical school--year after year at that--without socking existing commitments. We rate this statement as Half True.

pomt-15318	Says Carlos Lopez-Cantera "even voiced enthusiastic support for bringing an Arizona-style immigration law to Florida, calling the measure 'common sense.’"	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/jul/16/allison-tant/carlos-lopez-cantera-was-enthusiastic-supporter-ar/	Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera became the first Hispanic candidate to enter the Florida Senate race to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio on July 15. Florida Democratic Party chair Allison Tant leveled a series of charges against the Republican, but the one that caught our attention was this one: that Lopez- Cantera "voiced enthusiastic support for bringing an Arizona-style immigration law to Florida, calling the measure 'common sense.’ " Lopez-Cantera, who was born in Spain to Cuban parents, is hoping to draw part of his support from Hispanic voters. Is it true that he was an enthusiastic supporter for an Arizona-style law, which some Hispanics feared would lead to racial profiling? Tant has omitted the full story about what Lopez-Cantera said about bringing such a law to Florida. What Lopez-Cantera said about the law in 2010 Signed into law by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in 2010, SB 1070 requires police who stop a person to verify his or her immigration status if the officer reasonably suspects the person of being in the country illegally. (The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the key part of the law about police stops but struck down other portions in 2012.) In Florida at the time, two GOP candidates for governor -- Attorney General Bill McCollum and Rick Scott -- both expressed support for the law. Once elected however, Scott broke his promise to bring such a law to Florida. As PolitiFact Florida noted in 2014 after Scott chose Lopez-Cantera as his new No. 2, Lopez-Cantera expressed mixed views about an Arizona-style law between 2010 and 2011. "As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think Florida has a problem like Arizona does," state Rep. Lopez-Cantera told the Miami Herald in May 2010. "I realize there’s a problem in Arizona. They have a serious problem, but I don't think you can compare it to Florida." In August 2010, Lopez-Cantera told the Tampa Bay Times: "I am concerned that this could jeopardize civil liberties." In November 2010, as Rep. William Snyder, R-Stuart, was drafting a bill for the upcoming session, Lopez-Cantera told the Tampa Tribune, "As far as what the House is focusing on for the next year, I can tell you that's not high on the priority list," adding the House's primary concern was about the economy, not immigration. What Lopez-Cantera said about the law in 2011 As House majority leader and Miami-Dade’s delegation chair in 2011, Lopez-Cantera had to deal with two conflicting viewpoints within the GOP: hardliners who wanted a crackdown and Hispanic lawmakers and constituents who viewed such a push as anti-Hispanic. Legislators introduced the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act as HB 7089 and a similar bill in the Senate, SB 2040. The bills were not identical to Arizona’s law, but for immigrant advocates it raised fears that it would increase racial profiling. Some business-backed groups also raised concerns because there was a component that related to employers. The House bill would have required police to check the immigration status of a subject of a criminal investigation if the police had "reasonable suspicion" the person was in the country illegally. Also, employers would be required to check workers’ immigration status. The Senate counterpart didn’t go as far and only let police police check the status of an inmate -- not a person under investigation -- and it gave some wiggle room to employers. In March 2011, the House judiciary committee passed the bill 12-6. Lopez-Cantera wasn’t a member of that committee. But in his press release after the vote -- as Tant noted in her attack -- he spoke positively about the bill. "Chairman Snyder and the Judiciary Committee recognize the unique and diverse history of our state and have worked hard to bring all stakeholders to the table to produce this piece of common sense, Florida immigration reform. This legislation is designed to preserve employment opportunities for Floridians through the use of the E-Verify system. "The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops. It does, however, give law enforcement officers the tools necessary to enforce the immigration laws of the United States. "I look forward to watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process." Lopez-Cantera didn’t state in the press release how he would vote on the bill. Activists opposing the bills turned up the heat and targeted Lopez-Cantera, holding a protest in front of his office. While the attacks were going on, the Herald reported that Lopez-Cantera planned to vote against the bill. "Florida doesn’t need an immigration law," he said in April 2011. While the Senate passed a version of the bill, it never reached the full House, so Lopez-Cantera didn’t vote on it, and the bill died. (A press release from the Florida Democratic Party with Tant’s quote said that Lopez-Cantera "voted" for the law, but when we asked about that party spokesman Max Steele said it should have said "supported.") In 2014, PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a claim by the Democratic Hispanic Caucus Miami-Dade chapter that in 2011 "Lopez-Cantera 'staunchly supported' a Florida bill modeled after Arizona’s immigration law." We rated that claim Mostly False. Steele defended Tant’s claim about Lopez-Cantera’s comments and support for the law. "I can understand why the previous claim that he ‘staunchly supported’ the measure would receive the ruling it got, but our claim is that he ‘voiced enthusiastic support’ and called it ‘common sense,’ " Steele said. "He did voice support. He did call it common sense. The fact that he had other feelings at other times doesn’t change his praise of this measure in his capacity as majority leader." A campaign adviser for Lopez-Cantera had nothing to add beyond our previous findings. Our ruling Tant said that Lopez-Cantera "voiced enthusiastic support for bringing an Arizona-style immigration law to Florida, calling the measure 'common sense.’ " Lopez-Cantera did call such a bill "common sense," and he expressed support for it after a committee voted in favor in March 2011. However, Tant omits that in 2010 Lopez-Cantera said he didn’t think such a law was necessary and by April 2011, after he took heat over it, he said he wouldn’t vote for the bill — and he never had to. Tant has cherry-picked one statement Lopez-Cantera made in favor of the bill while ignoring multiple statements he made opposing it. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-13632	Undocumented immigrants "pay $12 billion a year into Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/10/hillary-clinton/undocumented-immigrants-social-security-contributi/	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reiterated her support for immigration reform at a joint convention of black and Hispanic journalists Aug. 5. One of the event’s moderators, Telemundo national correspondent Lori Montenegro, asked Clinton how she would do it, since it has not been achieved during President Barack Obama’s time in office. Clinton said she would introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform in her first 100 days in office and would take a "very hard look" at deportation priorities. "My priority are violent criminals, people suspected of any kind of connection to terrorism," she said, "not hard-working mothers and fathers and people who go to work, help support this economy, pay $12 billion a year into Social Security." We decided to take a look at her statement that undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion a year into Social Security. Clinton’s campaign referred us to a note issued by the Social Security Administration in April 2013 outlining the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security Trust Funds. The report cited the $12 billion figure, but it also said the calculation is based on contributions from immigrants and their employers — that makes a difference for considering Clinton's statement. The two trust funds are the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), which pays retirement and survivors benefits, and the Disability Insurance (DI), used to pay disability benefits. The note from the Office of the Chief Actuary said its estimates are based on the best available information, but that it is difficult to determine with certainty what portion of total taxes paid and benefits received come from earnings of unauthorized immigrants. Still, the office estimated that in 2010, "the excess of tax revenue paid to the Trust Funds over benefits paid from these funds based on earnings of unauthorized workers is about $12 billion." Here’s how the administration came up with that number. Using Census estimates, SSA said about 12.6 million people were not permanent residents or citizens by January 2009. Nearly 11 million of them were undocumented, the rest had temporary status, such as student visas or temporary work visas. SSA adjusted that pool to exclude kids and other undocumented immigrants who would not be working. That left about 8.3 million "other immigrants" in 2010 who worked in the United States, including people who did not have legal permanent residency, who were not U.S. citizens and who had temporary legal visas. Of that 8.3 million people, SSA deducted the number of visa holders authorized to work (1.3 million) and an estimated number of those in the underground economy (3.9 million) who would not pay taxes. That leaves about 3.1 million unauthorized immigrants who worked and paid Social Security taxes in 2010 — about 600,000 of them at some point had work permits and overstayed terms of their visas, about 700,000 used fraudulent birth certificates to get a Social Security number, and about 1.8 million used a Social Security number that did not match their name. SSA estimated this group of unauthorized immigrants and their employers generated $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010. (SSA estimates workers earned about $34,000, with a 6.2 percent tax rate for workers and employers.) Workers and employers contribute roughly the same amount into Social Security. The administration then subtracted about $1 billion in benefits that could’ve been received in 2010 from earnings in years when workers were unauthorized. SSA analysts said "a relatively small portion" of those who could draw benefits do so. Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, the administration said. Unauthorized immigrants themselves cannot get Social Security benefits, but if they obtain legal status, there are limited ways through which they can collect benefits, said Tom Jawtez, vice president for immigration policy at the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. We looked around and SSA’s 2013 note appears to be its latest available on the effects of unauthorized immigration on Social Security funds. In a 2014 Vice News piece, SSA’s chief actuary Stephen C. Goss affirms the $12 billion contribution. There are other estimates out there. Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pegs the annual amount of tax contributions by unauthorized immigrants at $7 billion. The Heritage calculation is based on a withholding rate of 6.2 percent of earnings, estimated earnings of $31,200, and 3.6 million unauthorized workers. The foundation appears to exclude employers’ payments on behalf of workers. Our ruling Clinton said that if elected president her administration would focus on deporting violent criminals, not "hard-working mothers and fathers and people who go to work, help support this economy, pay $12 billion a year into Social Security." The Social Security Administration estimates about $12 billion was paid into the administration’s trust funds from earnings of unauthorized workers in 2010 (after deducting about $1 billion from possible benefits paid out). This number includes contributions on behalf of employees as well as their employers. Workers and employers pony up about the same amount into the system. A calculation by another group excluded employer contributions and came up with a total of $7 billion paid into the system by undocumented immigrants. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.

pomt-13184	Says Ron Johnson "has essentially done nothing" to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/26/russ-feingold/ron-johnson-has-done-essentially-nothing-heroin-an/	Heroin and prescription painkillers were a topic in the second and final Wisconsin U.S. Senate debate on Oct. 18, 2016, three weeks before election day. It produced this exchange among Republican incumbent Ron Johnson, Democratic challenger Russ Feingold and moderator Mike Gousha. Johnson: "I’ve been incredibly active on this. The fact that Senator Feingold attacked me, saying I’ve done nothing on this -- completely false. And quite honestly, a very disgusting false attack." Feingold: "I didn’t say he did nothing." Gousha: "There was a radio ad that said that Senator Johnson essentially did nothing." Gousha was correct. A Feingold campaign radio ad released Sept. 6, 2016 says: "Heroin addiction and opioid abuse are killing Wisconsin, and yet after six years in Washington, Sen. Ron Johnson has essentially done nothing." Johnson pushed back by posting the video clip of the debate exchange on Twitter and with a digital ad responding to Feingold’s attack. So, let’s check the claim in the radio ad: In the six years since Johnson took Feingold’s seat in the 2010 election, has he "essentially done nothing" to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse? Scope of the problem The lethal power of heroin and opioids (prescription painkillers such as oxycodone) has increasingly drawn the attention of politicians. Prince’s death in April 2016 from fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, led Republican Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel to claim that more people die in Wisconsin from all types of drug overdoses than car crashes. We rated that claim True. A couple of months later, when Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said "we’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak," PolitiFact New York’s rating was Mostly False. Deaths directly caused by AIDS (43,115) were higher at their peak in 1995. Nevertheless, the latest data show 28,647 people across the country died from heroin and opioid overdoses in 2014, a figure that has been steadily climbing. Now let’s turn to Johnson. Johnson actions Johnson pushed back on Feingold’s claim partly because a nephew of Johnson’s died from a fentanyl overdose. (Initially, when Johnson revealed the death in March 2016, it was reported as a heroin overdose, but Johnson has since said it was fentanyl.) Here’s what Johnson’s campaign cited to us in terms of actions Johnson has taken: 1. Voted for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which was approved almost unanimously in Congress before being signed into law by President Barack Obama in July 2016. Obama described the law as modest and complained that Republicans blocked an additional $920 million in funding supported by Democrats. But the law does authorize $181 million in new federal money for opioid and heroin abuse efforts. Moreover, the bill also makes policy changes in what the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts described as the first "multifaceted federal response to the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic." 2. Introduced in April 2016 the Promoting Responsible Opioid Prescribing Act, which is aimed at reducing financial incentives for doctors who over-prescribe pain medications. The bill has been referred to a committee. 3. The same month, as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, held field hearings about the opioid problem in Pewaukee, Wis., and Cleveland, Ohio. He also held a hearing in Phoenix in November 2015 on "America’s heroin epidemic at the border." 4. Johnson also takes credit for a bipartisan investigation done by his committee. A report by the committee, which was disclosed in May 2016, found oversight problems at the Veterans Affairs facility in Tomah, Wis., where the prescription of painkillers to veterans has been under scrutiny. Feingold's campaign has pointed to Johnson's votes against two amendments — the first for $1.1 billion to combat heroin addiction, the second for $600 million in emergency funding to fight the opioid crisis. More specifically, his campaign criticized Johnson for a no vote in June 2016 on a cloture motion (to limit debate). That motion was in regard to an amendment to a defense authorization bill that would have authorized $18 billion for various purposes, including $1.1 billion to fight heroin and opioid addiction. Johnson also voted no in March 2016 on a motion to "waive all applicable budgetary discipline" in order to make appropriations to fight the heroin and opioid problem, which the Feingold said would have provided $600 million. It’s fair to criticize Johnson for what he didn’t do -- but that wasn’t Feingold’s claim. Our rating Qualifying his claim only slightly, Feingold says Johnson "has essentially done nothing" to fight heroin addiction and opioid abuse. Johnson has voted for a major bill aimed at confronting the heroin-opioids problem, introduced a bill aimed at curbing overprescription of opioids and held Senate committee hearings on the problem. That’s more than nothing. We rate Feingold’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9386f55b-2088-4fa9-93b4-627bfdf19a95	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-10-26T05:00:00	2016-09-06	['None']
pomt-11306	"In Congress, (Patrick) Morrisey wrote the health care law giving free health care to illegals."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/18/evan-jenkins/what-role-did-patrick-morrisey-have-writing-health/	In a recent ad, Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., tags his primary rival for a U.S. Senate seat as someone who handed out freebies to undocumented immigrants. In the ad against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a narrator says, "In Congress, Morrisey wrote the health care law giving free health care to illegals." Accompanying this audio is screen text saying, "Morrisey's Law: $1 billion for 'health services ... to undocumented aliens.' " The ad is talking about the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. But the ad leaves out important context about two issues — how much of the law Morrisey wrote, and whether the legislation really gave "free health care to illegals." Morrisey was a House staffer who said he drafted legislation Morrisey wasn’t a member of Congress in 2003. Rather, he was a staff member for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Staff can play an important role in writing legislation, but it would be more accurate to say that Morrisey, along with other staff members and lawmakers, "helped" write the bill collectively. "He could no more dictate the content of legislation than Evan Jenkins’ own congressional staff can," the Morrisey campaign said in a statement. "It defies credulity to claim one congressional staffer wrote all the details of a major 416-page bill." The law would have involved many authors at one point or another. A bill of that complexity goes through many revisions in committee, on the floor, and sometimes (as it did in this case) a joint House-Senate conference committee that hammers out a unified text for both chambers to vote on. The bill ultimately passed with the overwhelming support of House Republicans and signed by President George W. Bush. All of that said, Morrisey has described his own efforts as drafting major health care legislation. When he was running for attorney general, Morrisey ran an ad and said in an interview that he "drafted Medicare and Medicaid laws." Morrisey offered a more nuanced characterization in an official West Virginia government "Blue Book" in 2016: "Between 1999 and 2004, Morrisey served as the Deputy Staff Director and Chief Health Care Counsel to the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, helping draft and negotiate major legislation including the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003." And in a press release when he joined a law firm, a portion of the text said that he "was a principal staff author and negotiator of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." Law did not give ‘free health care to illegals’ The charge that the law gave free health care to people in the country illegally refers to the law’s section 1011, titled, "Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens." This section of the law sets aside $250 million a year for four years to reimburse health care providers for the otherwise unreimbursed costs of providing emergency care to undocumented immigrants. So this section certainly addresses the question of undocumented immigrants. However, the ad’s framing is misleading, several health policy specialists told PolitiFact. The 2003 law didn't give "free health care to illegals." Rather, a previous law did: the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. The 2003 law addresses reimbursements for care that fell under the category of the 1986 law. That brings us to the second complication: The law doesn't give anything to undocumented immigrants per se. Instead, it compensates health care providers. And a third issue: The term "free health care" is overly expansive. Undocumented immigrants did not get full health care coverage from this law. The law’s reach is limited to emergency care. The Jenkins campaign dissented from this analysis, calling it "overly literal." The Jenkins camp argued that the 2003 law went further than the 1986 law by actually committing money. They added that no one doubts that Medicare provides health care to senior citizens even though the payments are made to health care providers rather than the seniors themselves. Finally, they said, emergency care may be a subset of health care, but for undocumented immigrants, it may be the only health care they receive. We should note one additional point: While the provision on undocumented immigrants was indeed part of the 2003 law, the main thrust of the law was to create the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. So Morrisey could easily counter that he helped write a law that provided West Virginia seniors with important prescription drug coverage. Our ruling The Jenkins ad said, "In Congress, Morrisey wrote the health care law giving free health care to illegals." It’s a bit of an exaggeration to say that Morrisey "wrote" the 2003 law, but on occasion, Morrisey himself has used similar language to describe his accomplishments as a congressional staffer. However, it’s misleading to say that the 2003 law gave "free health care to illegals." The law primarily created the Medicare prescription drug program. One of its sections addressed reimbursement for the care of patients who could not afford services (including immigrants) for hospitals that had already been mandated under a 1986 statute. Also, it addressed emergency care only, not a full suite of health care services. We rate the statement Mostly False.

He was supportive of things like assault weapon bans."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/03/mike-huckabee/a-correct-account-of-past-giuliani-positions/	The full quote from Mike Huckabee's interview: "One thing I have to admire about Rudy, and he was I think courageous to go to the NRA, because his past positions -- he's sued gun manufacturers. He was supportive of Brady. He was supportive of things like assault weapon bans, which really is a misnomer, because it's really ridiculous to call a semiautomatic weapon an assault weapon." We find Huckabee's claims are accurate. In 2000, during Giuliani's term as mayor, he announced that New York City was filing a lawsuit against two dozen gun manufacturers. The city alleged practices such as deliberately producing more guns than could be legally bought and ignoring illegal sales by gun distributors. Giuliani has since distanced himself from the lawsuit, recently saying that it "has taken several turns and several twists that [he does not] agree with," but this does not detract from Huckabee's assertion that Giuliani sued gun makers. The Brady Bill, which created a waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks, became law in 1993. The Assault Weapons Ban, which prohibited the sale of some semi-automatic weapons, expired in 2004 after 10 years on the books. In a February, 2007 interview Giuliani was asked about them both and said: "I was in favor of it because I thought that it was necessary both to get the crime bill passed and also necessary with the 2,000 murders or so that we were looking at," annually in New York City at the time. Currently, Giuliani's stance on gun control is "that we need to enforce laws that exist, as opposed to passing new laws that infringe on individual rights." Huckabee's claims, however, deal with Giuliani's past positions rather than his current ones, and as such are accurate.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2007-10-03T00:00:00	2007-09-21	['None']

pomt-05472	Says there is an upcoming vote to preserve benefits of Texas homestead exemption for seniors and the disabled.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/apr/20/chain-email/chain-email-says-voters-must-turn-out-protect-home/	A reader passed along a warning she’d fielded in an email about a so-called proposed constitutional amendment. "You MUST vote in May to keep the Homestead tax cap for 65 and over, even if you are not 65 yet," the chain email says. "If you are a Texas homeowner then this is important to YOU." The email says that state lawmakers who approved a reduction in school property taxes in 2006 failed to share the benefits with senior citizens and people with disabilities. "So an amendment is on the May ballot to correct this error," the email says. "The problem is that most voters who are younger than 65 or not disabled probably won’t even notice the amendment or care." The email closes by saying that early voting runs from April 30 through May 8 and election day is May 12, 2012. Those dates align with the schedule for upcoming municipal elections, according to the Travis County clerk’s office. However, Texans resolved the issue affecting homestead exemptions for senior citizens and people with disabilities in May 2007 -- nearly five years ago. In that homestead-related vote, some 88 percent of voters authorized lawmakers to lower the cap on public school property taxes that may be imposed on residence homesteads of the elderly or disabled to reflect the reductions in rates approved by lawmakers the year before. When the same chain email surfaced in 2009, the Austin American-Statesman quoted Ashley Burton of the Texas Secretary of State’s office saying such emails were fakes. Burton further pointed out that there were no statewide issues on the May 2009 ballot, according to an April 24, 2009, American-Statesman news blog. Similarly, there are no proposed constitutional amendments on the May 12, 2012 ballot. The next statewide elections are the Republican and Democratic primaries on May 29, 2012. Proposed constitutional amendments do not appear on primary ballots. Finally: It’s not uncommon for chain emails to say Texans are voting on an issue not on the ballot. We pointed out a flaming example in 2010, adding that if voters want to check into anything on the ballot, the state recommends an online visit or a telephone call to the secretary of state at 1-800-252-8683.

pomt-08217	"It’s gotten to a point where the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/18/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-federal-workers-make-twice-much-/	House GOP Leader John Boehner talks a lot about the need to create jobs as he prepares to take the U.S. House of Representatives’ helm next year. But the federal government is one entity Boehner thinks shouldn’t create jobs. While talking with reporters Nov. 10, Boehner advocated a hiring and pay freeze on federal workers. "It’s gotten to a point where the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker," Boehner said. Boehner’s office says he bases that claim on an August 13, 2010 USA Today article, headlined "Federal workers earning double their private counterparts." The article uses Bureau of Economic Analysis data from the U.S. Commerce Department to conclude that federal civil servants earned average pay and benefits of $123,049 in 2009, while private workers made $61,051 in total compensation. Although the USA Today statistics back up Boehner’s claim, a BEA spokesman says the newspaper’s numbers don’t account for the different mix of jobs performed by federal and private sector employees. The statistic cited by USA Today also includes benefits, which tend to be higher for federal employees. That’s an important distinction because we think the average person would interpret "makes twice as much" as getting twice the wages. We said as much recently when we examined a claim about federal worker pay by Rand Paul, the Republican senator elect from Kentucky. In that item we found BEA statistics show federal employees earned an average salary of $81,258, when benefits were stripped out, compared with $50,464 for private sector employees. That’s nearly 40 percent short of double. A statement on BEA’s website explains that the private sector workforce includes a broader range of jobs than the federal government, from minimum wage positions to CEOs. Federal civilian jobs focus on professional areas like law, accounting and economics that require higher education. The federal government has also contracted out many of its lower-skilled, lower paid positions to private industry, which makes the federal average go higher. John Berry, director of the federal Office of Personnel Management, says it’s untrue that federal workers are paid double the private sector. The USA Today article, he says, compares "apples to oranges." OPM maintains that federal workers actually make 24 percent less than their private-sector counterparts. "The federal workforce today is highly specialized," he says. "Thirty years ago, over 22 percent of our workforce was in blue collar jobs. Now that percentage has dropped by half while the percentage of IT and health professionals has doubled. Data clearly shows that many of these highly specialized workers – doctors, nurses, cybersecurity professionals – are paid less than their private sector counterparts and are making a significant sacrifice in pay to serve their neighbors." OPM spokeswoman Jennifer Dorsey did not respond to repeated requests for data that would show lower federal pay for those workers. She did send an email that said the average federal salary is $65,000, and "the figure that was used by the USAToday reporter was and is inaccurate." So we looked at some federal statistics ourselves, using Bureau of Labor data for mean annual salaries from May 2009. Those statistics list a $43,460 mean yearly salary for the nation’s 130.6 million private sector workers, and a $71,500 mean salary for its 1.9 million federal employees. That’s about 35 percent short of double. Just as the BEA data does, the labor data’s private sector average also incorporates hundreds of jobs for which there’s no federal counterpart. So we looked at some specific examples -- the doctors, nurses and cybersecurity professionals that Berry mentioned. Federally-employed doctors make about the same ($173,400 a year) as their private sector counterparts ($173,860). Federal registered nurses actually make more: $77,830, compared with $66,530. BLS didn’t have a "cybersecurity professionals" category. We found federal "computer specialists" made $88,920, compared to $78,010 for their private-sector counterparts. So where does that leave us? Using the BEA data, the average federal worker salary is considerably short of the "twice as much" level Boehner claimed. Using the Bureau of Labor’s data, the gap is a little wider, but the average federal worker pay still is considerably short of double. That’s why we rate Boehner’s claim False.

pomt-05915	Since President Barack Obama took office, "2 million more Americans are out of work."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/01/phil-gingrey/spin-jobs-data-leads-partisans-opposite-conclusion/	Minutes after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last week, the Washington chattering class spun like a cartoon Tasmanian Devil. Republicans took to the airways, grumbling that Obama offered no real solutions to the country’s problems. Democrats cheered and said he had the answers. Then came the spin typical of any major political event, whirling with facts and figures. The economy’s better off since Obama took office, said U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat. "Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent during the president’s first year in office to 8.5 percent today," Johnson said in remarks posted on Patch.com’s local news site for Stone Mountain-Redan. No, the economy’s worse, said U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican. Three years into Obama’s presidency, "2 million more Americans are out of work," Gingrey said in a news release posted on Rome Newswire, an online news site covering the Rome area. Can these both be true? Is it possible for unemployment to drop as the ranks of people who are out of work grow? Because of this conundrum, we’ll depart from our usual Truth-O-Meter format and do a special doubleheader. We’ll check both stats and tell you whether one of them is wrong or whether it’s possible for both to be correct. First, let’s consider Johnson’s unemployment statistic. In January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, unemployment stood at 7.8 percent. It peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, eight months later. In December 2011, the rate stood at 8.5 percent. Johnson’s numbers are accurate, but he runs into trouble when he said that "it is remarkable what President Obama has achieved in his first three years." Labor economists have repeatedly told PolitiFact that it’s hard for any political leader to take credit or blame for something as complicated as the economy. Johnson spokesman Andrew Phelan offered proof to bolster the congressman’s claim that Obama deserves credit for lower unemployment. He cited a November report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews bills that will have an impact on the federal budget. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the stimulus legislation that Obama backed, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points during the third quarter of 2011, the office determined. Phelan also cited a 2010 report by a Princeton professor and the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics saying the Recovery Act and monetary policy reduced unemployment. Still, other factors are at play. For this reason, Johnson’s statement earns a Half True. Now on to Gingrey’s statement, where he says "2 million more Americans are out of work." Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber pointed us to a July check by our PolitiFact Ohio colleagues. It analyzed a television ad by the Republican National Committee criticizing Obama’s economic policies. Since he took office, it said, "2 million jobs. Gone." PolitiFact Ohio found that the drop in employment was actually more severe than the ad said. The economy lost 2.5 million jobs between January 2009 and May 2011, according to employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment and other economic data. But the ad was missing a crucial piece of context. It neglected to mention that the economy gained 1 million jobs in the year before the ad came out. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a Mostly True. Six months have passed since PolitiFact Ohio’s story ran, so we checked the latest employment statistics to see whether the figures were still correct. We found that the country’s employment outlook is sunnier. In December, there were nearly 132 million nonfarm employees in the U.S., down 1.66 million from January 2009. This means that Gingrey’s 2 million figure is some 20 percent too high. We found a few other problems with Gingrey’s use of employment data. When the economy loses nonfarm jobs, it does not mean that "2 million more Americans are out of work," as Gingrey said. The Bureau of Labor Statistics did not design this metric to measure how many people have become unemployed. It’s likely many did get laid off. But others might have chosen to return to school, become stay-at-home parents or leave the workforce for any number of other reasons. It’s also worth noting that while payrolls have declined since January 2009, they’ve been rising since October 2010, according to BLS data. Because Gingrey’s claim cherry-picks unflattering data and his numbers could use some freshening up, we rate his statement Half True. Now we come to the larger issue at hand. Gingrey and Johnson used valid data to give opposite impressions of the state of the economy. Their interpretations had some shortcomings but weren’t wholly incorrect. So how is this possible? Can unemployment decline under Obama if payrolls shrank? Yes. The reason is that Gingrey and Johnson used data from different time periods. Gingrey chose to consider nonfarm payroll numbers starting in winter 2009, while Johnson started his unemployment count in October 2009. The economy didn’t post its worst numbers until the latter half of 2009. Between January 2009 and December 2011, the economy lost jobs. Nonfarm payrolls decreased by some 1.7 million jobs. As you’d expect, unemployment increased during the same time period from 7.8 percent to 8.5 percent. But from October 2009 to December 2011, the economy gained jobs. Nonfarm payrolls actually rose by about 2.4 million. Unemployment dropped from 10 percent to 8.5 percent. It’s easy to cherry-pick data that give opposite impressions of the nation’s economic health. With statistics, the devil’s in the details.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2012-02-01T06:00:00	2012-01-25	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-07077	There is a Republican "plan to end Medicare."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/27/sherrod-brown/us-sen-sherrod-browns-campaign-warns-there-republi/	Some claims are so popular that no matter how often they get debunked, politicians or their campaigns can’t stop using them. A current favorite: Republicans plan to end Medicare. U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s re-election organization, Friends of Sherrod Brown, is the latest group to utter this claim. In a fund-raising solicitation sent by e-mail June 20 on behalf of Brown, Sarah Benzing, campaign manager for the Ohio Democrat, said exactly that: there is a Republican "plan to end Medicare." In fairness, this was but one small part of her e-mail to potential donors. Benzing spent far more time criticizing Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer who has filed candidacy papers to run against Brown. She noted that Mandel, a Republican, recently had a private fund-raising reception with Washington lobbyists. Mandel avoided talking with the press on this trip, as he has on other occasions, and this was the gist of Benzing’s fund-raising e-mail. Writing in a guy-walks-into-a-bar style, she began her pitch: "A guy walks into a DC lobbying firm... While he’s in town, he stands up an Ohio reporter and continues to refuse to discuss his position on the Republican plan to end Medicare or allegations that he used taxpayer money to campaign." By the end of her e-mail, she said, "Ohioans won’t stand for his stonewalling, and when he tries to drown out their concerns with attacks bought and paid for by these shadowy operatives and DC lobbyists, we’ll be ready to respond." She asked for "$5 or more to help us fight back against Josh Mandel’s corporate lobbyist friends." Perhaps we should be flattered that Benzing based much of her e-mail on our reporting about Mandel. The Plain Dealer provided details of Mandel’s Washington trip in its political blog on Cleveland.com, and Benzing repeated them and credited the newspaper. The Plain Dealer also operates PolitiFact Ohio, and in the interest of full disclosure, the reporter writing this very PolitiFact item is the same reporter who wrote the Cleveland.com piece on Mandel. We’re just calling ‘em as we see ‘em. And we see a problem with the Brown campaign’s claim, because Republicans have not said they want to end Medicare. PolitiFact has noted this several times, and many political operatives are aware of the issue and its broader debate. About that debate: House Republicans and many in the Senate support a proposal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to convert Medicare into a "premium-support payment" program starting in 2022. In other words, people retiring then would sign up for private health insurance plans, with Medicare paying those plans to provide coverage. There would be a middle man rather than direct payment from the government to the doctor, as Medicare is currently structured. Proponents and critics disagree as to whether a voucher system would be good or bad and about the perils of doing nothing. The Congressional Budget Office says the Ryan plan would end up costing seniors more out-of-pocket for health care than they pay now. But we are dealing here with the more basic issue of Benzing’s claim: that Republicans plan to end Medicare. If you are 55 years or older already, it would not change. And if you are younger, the Ryan plan would leave you with a different Medicare system, but one in which the government still played a big role in your health coverage. This has been rehashed repeatedly. From our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin on June 10: "Moreover, we’ve established that, although it’s expected that senior citizens would pay more for health care under Ryan’s plan, they would still have health care." From PolitiFact Virginia on June 9: "Would the plan really end Medicare? The Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and future seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. But to say it would end Medicare, as the DCCC e-mail does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors -- current and future -- would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year." From the national PolitiFact on May 25: "Seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year although at a rate not expected to match the rise in medical costs. The government would still play a critical role in directing the program and setting standards." From PolitiFact Wisconsin on April 11: "To be sure, the plan would change Medicare, significantly, starting in 2022. But for those who turn 65 before then, there would be no changes at all, even after 2022. And for the others, Medicare would change -- dramatically -- but it would still exist." Why, then, did the Brown campaign say that the Republican plan would end Medicare? Benzing sent us three sources for the statement. The first was a Wall Street Journal article on April 4 that, according to Benzing, said the Ryan plan "would essentially end Medicare." The Journal article, however, didn’t quite say that. It said: "The plan would essentially end Medicare, which now pays most of the health-care bills for 48 million elderly and disabled Americans, as a program that directly pays those bills." Changing the payment method is not the same as ending the entire program. Her next source was a Kaiser Health News article from April 4 that said, "A premium support model would fundamentally change the way that Medicare works by limiting the amount of money the federal government spends on medical services for seniors and the disabled. Currently, Medicare is an entitlement program, which means that the government must help finance every doctor visit and medical service that an individual needs." There’s little question about a fundamental change -- but that, too, is not the same as killing Medicare, especially since the program would remain unchanged for people who retire before 2022. Finally, she listed a Kaiser Health News article from April 5 that said seniors would pay sharply more for their Medicare coverage under Ryan’s plan. It provided estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. "For example, by 2030, under the plan, typical 65 year olds would be required to pay 68 percent of the total cost of their coverage, which includes premiums, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs, according to CBO. That compares with the 25 percent they would pay under current law, CBO said." Benzing cited the article accurately. It should be mentioned, however, that Medicare trustees don’t see the current rate, generous though it may be, as sustainable past 2024. Some other form of savings, cost sharing or revenue-raising methods may be inevitable. "Ask anyone who will pay twice as much out-of-pocket under the Republican plan if it's still Medicare," Benzing told us when we asked about the plan-to-end-Medicare claim. "Ask anyone who thought they were going to have guaranteed coverage and now won't if it's still Medicare." Those are questions of degree. Change of some kind is likely -- so will that mean death to Medicare? Certainly not for millions of current retirees and baby boomers now over age 55. For everyone else, the Ryan plan might better be defined by using another political chestnut, namely, the end of "Medicare as we know it" -- a cliche, perhaps, but one with enough qualification to keep the claim out of the hot seat. The Brown fund-raising pitch had no such qualification. No matter how often it's said, this still remains true - that the unqualified end-of-Medicare statement is not accurate. And on the Truth-O-Meter, that means the statement still garners a rating of False.

pomt-02967	"I never was in favor of shutting down the government. … (I) voted to fund the government fully."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-he-never-favored-government-shutd/	Now that the federal government shutdown is over, the blame game is well under way. On Fox News Sunday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., emphasized that he didn’t favor a government shutdown even though many observers have accused his party of instigating the shutdown as a way of defunding or delaying President Barack Obama’s health care law. On Oct. 20, 2013, host Chris Wallace asked Rubio whether he was "really prepared to keep the government shut down" when he voted against the final deal to re-open the government and avoid hitting the debt ceiling. "Well, let me be clear," Rubio responded. "I never was in favor of shutting down the government. I was never in favor of defunding the government. I was in favor of funding the government fully, voted to fund the government fully, made efforts to fund the government fully." Later in the interview, Rubio reiterated, "I never wanted there to be a government shutdown. … The people who shut down the government were the president and the Democrats in the Senate, who basically said that unless you fund … Obamacare, we are unwilling to fund the entire government. They took that position, and they forced this situation that we've just gone through." Rubio has a point that Democrats, including Obama, ought to shoulder some of the responsibility for the government shutdown. Democrats decided that voting to continue funding the government on the Republicans’ terms was too bitter a pill to swallow, and ultimately that turned out to be a successful negotiating position. But that doesn’t absolve them of all responsibility for the government closure. In this item, however, we are looking at the flip side -- namely, whether Rubio is right that "I never was in favor of shutting down the government. … (I) voted to fund the government fully." We’ll take the two parts of this question separately. (Rubio’s office did not respond to inquiries for this story.) "I never was in favor of shutting down the government." It’s true that on multiple occasions, Rubio stated publicly that he didn’t want to shut down the government. On Sept. 27, 2013, he told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News that "I don't know of any Republicans in favor of a government shutdown. … The truth is, this isn't about shutting down the government. This is about shutting down Obamacare." In a Capitol hallway interview with reporters the same day, Rubio said something virtually identical. He has frequently deflected blame on Democratic leaders for pushing a shutdown. However, we found two examples of Rubio stating support for positions that made the shutdown possible, even inevitable. • At a July 11, 2013, Washington breakfast sponsored by the Concerned Veterans for America and The Weekly Standard, Rubio advocated stripping Obamacare funding from the next temporary government spending measure, known as a "continuing resolution." "We should not pass a continuing resolution, and I will not vote for a continuing resolution unless it defunds Obamacare for the period of time of the continuing resolution. I'd like to see it permanently repealed, but at a minimum, we should agree to do that." Preventing passage of a continuing resolution would deny operating funds for the federal government and effectively shut it down. • Along the same lines, Rubio was quoted in the Washington Times on July 24, 2013, as saying, "The argument I’ve made to my colleagues is that there are some issues that are so fundamental that we have to be willing to go all the way on them. I think Obamacare is one of them." In this context, going "all the way" meant opposing a continuing resolution. We know this because the set-up to that quote in the Washington Times paraphrased Rubio as saying, in the Times’ words, that "Republican opposition to President Obama’s health care law is so integral to the party’s principles that his colleagues should be ready to reject any spending bills that fund the reforms." So these two sets of comments show that Rubio said he was comfortable pursuing a strategy that could lead to a government shutdown. Rubio "voted to fund the government fully" In numerous Senate votes immediately before and during the shutdown, Rubio sided with Republicans in opposing Democratic bills that would have implemented a "clean" continuing resolution -- that is, a bill to resume funding the government that didn’t include other conditions, particularly those backed by Republicans that would have defunded or delayed Obamacare. • Senate votes 206, 207, 208 and 209 on Sept. 27. In each of these votes, including both procedural and substantive votes, Rubio joined most Republicans in voting against a "clean" continuing resolution. He did so because the measure in question continued to fund Obamacare, a policy he opposed. Still, had he voted for these bills, they would have funded the government "fully." • Senate votes 210 and 211 on Sept. 30. In both votes, Rubio sided with Republicans in opposing a Senate Democratic move to strip anti-Obamacare provisions from a continuing resolution that had been passed by the House and that would have otherwise funded the government. • Senate vote 216 on Oct. 12. Rubio voted against another Democratic effort to pass a "clean" continuing resolution. The vote failed to reach the required 60-vote threshold because the Democrats couldn’t persuade any Republicans to break ranks. (Senate votes 213, 214 and 215 were not directly related to the shutdown.) • Senate vote 218 and 219 on Oct. 16. Senate leaders from both parties crafted a deal designed to end the shutdown, and it passed, 81-18. But Rubio was one of the Republicans who voted against it, both on a procedural vote and on the measure itself. (Senate vote 217 was unrelated to the shutdown.) The Rubio vote that comes closest to qualifying as one to "fund the government fully" was Senate vote 212 on Oct. 1. Rubio joined Republicans in voting against tabling (that is, setting aside and ignoring) a House request to convene a joint House-Senate conference committee to consider the bill the Senate had rejected on Sept. 30. The House-backed bill that failed in the Senate would have funded the government but delayed the individual mandate in the health care bill, eliminated employer premium cost-sharing for congressional workers forced to purchase plans on the Obamacare marketplace, and requested the bicameral negotiating conference. By voting not to table this request, Rubio did effectively keep alive a legislative vehicle that would have ended the shutdown, only with conditions that Democrats considered unacceptable. So that’s one vote that might be used to support this half of Rubio’s claim. But it’s outweighed by nine other votes in which Rubio opposed measures to re-open the government or opposed advancing such a bill through the legislative process. We shared our findings with Rubio's office and asked for their comments, but we didn't receive a response. Our ruling Rubio appears to be making the case that he would have liked to have achieved his goals without having to shut down the government, and that he would have been happy to fund the government fully if doing so was paired with provisions defunding or delaying Obamacare. He may have felt that way, but both of the specific claims he makes are problematic. His claim that "I never was in favor of shutting down the government" is undercut by two separate comments in which he supported a strategy of opposing Obamacare even if that meant rejecting a bill that would have kept the government open. And on the question of whether he "voted to fund the government fully," he arguably may have done so once, but took the opposite position nine times. Given the political realities of the budget battle, Rubio's words and actions suggest he wanted Obamacare defunded more than he wanted to keep the government open. As we noted, where responsibility for the shutdown is concerned, it takes two to tango. But in this case, there’s very little to support Rubio’s twin claims. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-07711	In 2011, "the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/04/maciver-institute/maciver-institute-says-average-annual-salary-and-b/	Tea party Republican Rand Paul raised some eyebrows in February 2011 when he said in two national TV interviews that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin "is making $89,000 per year." But the claim by the U.S. senator from Kentucky, which we ruled to be False, was not as surprising as one made nearly a year earlier by the conservative MacIver Institute. Speaking about Milwaukee public school teachers, the Madison think tank declared in a March 3, 2010, news release: "For the first time in history, the average annual compensation for a teacher in the Milwaukee Public Schools system will exceed $100,000" in 2011. In light of Paul’s comments, which were made during the heat of the nationally watched Wisconsin budget debate, we decided to take a closer look at MacIver’s claim. It has resurfaced in the budget debate in comments on websites such as the Huffington Post and TheNation.com. In announcing the $100,000 figure, the institute produced a video that included brief clips of an MPS administrator reciting salary and fringe benefit numbers during a school board meeting the previous day. The average total compensation figure for teachers exceeded $100,000. We asked MacIver spokesman Brian Farley if he had any additional evidence. He cited a February 2011 posting from the School Zone blog on JSOnline.com, which reported slightly different numbers than those in MacIver’s video. The posting quoted MPS’ budget manager as saying that in 2011-2012 (the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2011), the average MPS teacher would receive total compensation of $101,091 -- $59,500 in salary and $41,591 in benefits. We double-checked with MPS spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin and she confirmed the figures. We wanted to compare the $101,091 for MPS teachers to other teachers, but the latest figures compiled by the state Department of Public Instruction are for 2009-2010, two years earlier. Those figures show for 2009-2010, MPS teachers earned, on average, $56,095 in salary plus $30,202 in benefits, for a total of $86,297. That was lower than eight other school districts in Milwaukee County, including Greendale, Greenfield, Shorewood, Cudahy, Fox Point, South Milwaukee, Franklin and Nicolet, which was highest at just over $103,000. Let’s return to the MacIver Institute claim. The conservative think tank said the average annual compensation for a Milwaukee Public Schools teacher would exceed $100,000 in 2011. As of July 1, 2011, according to the school district, that figure will be $101,091. MacIver’s claim is True.	None	MacIver Institute	None	None	None	2011-03-04T12:00:00	2010-03-03	['None']
pomt-06121	On instances when abortions should be allowed.	half flip	/texas/statements/2011/dec/28/rick-perry/has-rick-perry-toughened-his-abortion-stance/	At a Rick Perry presidential campaign event in Iowa on Dec. 27, 2011, a pastor told the Texas governor that he saw a contradiction in Perry's abortion stance. Pointing to a conversation he had with Perry at an October event, the Rev. Joshua Verwers of Full Faith Christian Center in Chariton, Iowa, said the governor had characterized his position as in favor of banning abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is in danger. "But just about a week ago, you signed the Personhood USA pledge, which ... states that abortion and the innocent killing of all life should always be prohibited and that it's never acceptable," Verwers said. "So to me it seems kind of like a contradiction (from) where you were a month ago." Perry responded by telling the pastor that he had undergone a transformation. Afterward, many news outlets reported that Perry had shifted his position on abortion rights. We decided to put that question to the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter. Has Perry toughened his stance on abortion? First, we checked whether Verwers had accurately characterized Perry's established position on abortion. We should note that Perry said, "Yes, sir," several times while Verwers was speaking to him at the Iowa event, including after the pastor's statement that Perry had previously expressed support for the three exceptions to any abortion ban. In a search of news articles, we found support for Verwers' description of Perry's position going back to 1997. An Aug. 31, 2011, Texas Tribune story said Perry "opposes abortion except in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother's life is in danger." A Jan. 12, 2007, Austin American-Statesman article reported that Perry, in an interview with a reporter, said he was amenable to a proposal that would trigger a state ban on abortions if the U.S. Supreme Court were to reverse the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Perry told the reporter that he favored exceptions to the ban to save a woman's life and in cases of rape and incest. A year earlier, when Perry was running for re-election, the Dallas Morning News published responses from the candidates to questions about abortion issues and contraception. Among the questions was: "Should abortion be legal in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the woman?" Perry's response was listed as "yes." Jumping back nearly 10 years, a June 19, 1997, news article by the American-Statesman — reporting on the announcement that Perry, then the state agriculture commissioner, would run for lieutenant governor — said Perry told reporters that he was opposed to abortion except in cases involving rape, incest or a threat to the life of the woman. So, has Perry's position on "exceptions" changed? On Dec. 27, 2011, during the Iowa event, Perry told Verwers that his transformation came after watching the film Gift of Life, whose website says it "looks at the lives of individuals who were nearly the victims of an abortion," and talking with Rebecca Kiessling, a woman who was conceived during a rape. "I really started giving some thought about the issue of rape and incest," Perry said. Later that night, Perry participated in a teleconference sponsored by Personhood USA, the group behind the pledge that Verwers mentioned in his question to Perry, and other anti-abortion organizations. Perry acknowledged that his position had changed. "This is something that is relatively new," Perry said, again citing his conversation with Kiessling. "We had a fairly lengthy and heartfelt conversation about how she was conceived in rape, and looking in her eyes, I couldn’t come up with an answer to defend the exceptions for rape and incest," Perry said. In a phone interview, we asked Verwers how he had interpreted Perry's response to his question. Verwers said he believed that Perry was telling him that he no longer believed in any of the three exceptions he had expressed support for previously. "My interpretation is that he is wholeheartedly in support of the Personhood USA pledge that says there is never an acceptable case for abortion," Verwers said. "I think he's truly committed to that, no matter the case, no matter the exception." The pledge, which Perry signed Dec. 15, says: "I believe that in order to properly protect the right to life of the vulnerable among us, every human being at every stage of development must be recognized as a person possessing the right to life in federal and state laws without exception and without compromise." However, it also says this, suggesting some ambiguity when it comes to the "life of the mother" exception: "I recognize that in cases where a mother's life is at risk, every effort should be made to save the baby's life as well; leaving the death of an innocent child an unintended tragedy rather than an intentional killing." On Dec. 28, a day after talking about his transformation with Verwers, Perry told reporters outside a restaurant in Indianola, Iowa, that he continues to support one exception to an abortion ban: in cases in which a woman's life is threatened. "So the lone exception is now for the life of the mother?" a reporter asked. "That's correct," Perry said. Our ruling Perry has long maintained his opposition to most abortions while supporting exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when a woman's life is threatened. Now, he says he is in favor of only one exception. That's a change in position, but it's short of a Full Flop. We'll call it a Half Flip.

But in remarks in Borden, Ind., Cruz tried to take some solace by looking at the numbers a different way. "I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York," Cruz said. Is that right? We took a closer look. Here’s the final results of the April 5, 2016, Wisconsin Republican primary, according to the Associated Press: Candidate Wisc. votes Percentage Delegates Ted Cruz 531,129 48.2 percent 36 Donald Trump 386,370 35.1 percent 6 John Kasich 155,200 14.1 percent 0 Marco Rubio 10,569 1 percent 0 Ben Carson 5,608 0.5 percent 0 Jeb Bush 3,153 0.3 percent 0 And here are the final results of the April 19 New York Republican primary: Candidate N.Y. votes Percentage Delegates Donald Trump 524,932 60.4 percent 89 John Kasich 217,904 25.1 percent 4 Ted Cruz 126,151 14.5 percent 0 So Cruz did win more raw votes in Wisconsin (531,129) than Trump did in New York (524,932). It’s a modest edge -- Cruz won about 1.1 percent more votes in Wisconsin than Trump did in New York -- but an edge nonetheless. The discrepancy owes much to two factors: Wisconsin’s turnout rate, which was two and a half times higher than New York’s, and the Republicans’ greater strength in purplish Wisconsin than in solidly blue New York. In Wisconsin, about 24 percent of the voting-age population cast a Republican primary ballot. In New York, it was just 5.6 percent. That helps explain why Cruz eked out more raw votes than Trump even though Trump won the much bigger state and almost three times as many delegates. Our ruling Cruz said, "I earned more votes in the state of Wisconsin than Donald Trump did in New York." This is certainly a glass-half-full way of looking at the results, but factually, Cruz is on target.

pomt-03036	Says her actions as Wisconsin commerce secretary brought the state "84,000 more Wisconsin jobs than we have today."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/09/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-had-84000-more-jobs-when/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s bashing of his predecessor’s record on job creation was on Mary Burke’s mind when the Madison Democrat officially announced her 2014 gubernatorial candidacy. Unsurprisingly, Burke was not content to let Walker tag her as responsible for the 133,000 jobs lost during Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s second term. The former Trek Bicycle executive was Doyle’s commerce chief from February 2005 to November 2007, overlapping Doyle’s two terms. In her announcement, Burke pointed to where Wisconsin stood at the end of her Commerce tenure compared to where it stands now, after two years with Walker at the helm. "After Trek, I spent a few years as Wisconsin’s Commerce secretary, focused every day on creating jobs," Burke said in a video on Oct. 7, 2013. "We reopened the mill in Park Falls, brought Uline to Kenosha and helped entrepreneurs and new businesses start up and grow." She concluded: "All in all it meant 84,000 more Wisconsin jobs than we have today." Burke brought up the number to claim that politicians in Madison (she didn’t name Walker) are more hung up on arguing than solving problems. As she begins a campaign that no doubt will focus on Walker’s promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, let’s examine her 84,000-job claim. To check state employment figures, we’ll use the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a thorough jobs count used by economists and state and federal jobs officials. The figures are gathered by the state, then adjusted and published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. A technical note: Because the quarterly jobs data is not seasonally adjusted, it’s not useful to compare the jobs picture for Burke’s last month (October 2007) to the latest-reported Walker month (March 2013). But we can look at three different apples-to-apples measurements. --The annual averages for 2007 (Burke’s last year) and 2012 (the most recent full year under Walker) show Wisconsin’s total employment was 85,520 persons higher in 2007 than in 2012. Note: Burke used total public and private employment, while Walker’s pledge is for private-sector jobs, but that distinction made little difference in this instance, we found. -- Comparing December 2007 to December 2012, the gap is 81,912. -- The gap when comparing October 2007 (Burke’s last month) to the same month in 2012 is 79,436. So Burke’s 84,000 figure fits in that range. How is it possible that 133,000 jobs were lost in Doyle’s last term, but the total employment figure in 2012 under Walker is lower than the 2007 figure cited by Burke? The answer lies in what happened in the last three years of Doyle’s term, which essentially ended in December 2010. Until mid-2008, monthly employment in Wisconsin was rising, as it had for years. In June 2008, seven months after Burke departed, the total employment count started a big slide that was part of the Great Recession that swept the United States. The slide ended in mid-2010 in Doyle’s final year, and the monthly gains that started then have generally continued under Walker. Who gets the credit? Part of Burke’s claim is that her actions as Commerce secretary and those of the Doyle administration explain why employment was higher then than now. Burke highlighted two major instances when her agency provided state help in adding jobs. The paper mill in Park Falls she mentioned, Flambeau River, reopened in 2006 with millions in aid from Burke’s Commerce Department under Doyle. It had closed earlier in the year, a victim of the digital era that has meant hard times in the printing business, the Journal Sentinel reported. Historical note: As the Journal Sentinel reported, the loans to Flambeau River were the largest among more than $12 million in loans to state businesses that Walker’s new jobs agency failed to track systematically, forcing major changes at the agency. The other firm Burke mentioned, Uline Inc., was offered millions in incentives and aid from Wisconsin to move its headquarters from northern Illinois and build a major new distribution center in Pleasant Prairie. There were other factors, though, behind both success stories. The paper mill was rescued by a local buyer with high financial incentive to rescue the plant. At Uline, a company official said at the time that Wisconsin got the nod because it had a "huge shovel-ready site" that was close to an expressway and to Uline's existing Waukegan headquarters. Burke campaign aide Joe Zepecki told us that Burke deserves credit for economic success because her job was to focus on creating jobs. As we’ve noted in past items, though, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor’s control, much less a Commerce secretary’s. "The economy is a big thing and it is ridiculous for one person to take sole credit, or to be assigned sole blame, for anything that happens," Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank and lecturer at Wisconsin Lutheran College, told us. "They can help or hurt matters, but we should really evaluate the merits of the policies they propose to implement." Looking at the numbers, Wisconsin’s private-sector grew more slowly than the nation’s under Doyle before the recession, including in the 2005-2007 period Burke refers to, the Journal Sentinel reported. So that further limits how much credit Burke can claim. Similarly, the 2012 jobs total under Walker was necessarily affected by the same recession that dragged job growth well into negative numbers in Doyle’s last term. Subsequent growth under Doyle in 2010 beat the U.S. average, while the growth rate has lagged that mark under Walker. Finally, we note that in 2007, shortly before announcing she would resign, Burke issued a harsh criticism of her agency. She said the Commerce Department, which ought to be among the state’s most influential economic players, has sat on the sidelines while other states vie to recruit new businesses. "We are not out there selling the state and attracting the companies," Burke said in 2007. Our rating Burke said her years as Wisconsin commerce secretary meant the state brought "84,000 more Wisconsin jobs than we have today." The numerical part of the claim is on target -- Burke’s tenure was pre-recession and despite gains Wisconsin has not yet rebounded to 2007 levels. But Burke overstates the credit that she and Doyle deserve for the 2007 figure, and skips past the recession that helps explain the statistical truth. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-06167	Says King Street Patriots held a fundraiser featuring an author who believes that registering the poor to vote is un-American.	true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/16/boyd-richie/texas-democratic-leader-says-author-who-believes-r/	In an email, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Boyd Richie appealed to supporters for donations so the party could continue "fighting against the King Street Patriots," a Houston tea party group that the Democrats sued last year. The Nov. 15, 2011, email blast added to the party’s charges against the Patriots: "Yesterday, in an almost gleeful admission that folks who tend to vote Democratic should be denied their fundamental right to vote, this tea party group held a Houston fundraiser featuring Matthew Vadum. Yes, the ultra-right-wing author who believes that 'registering the poor to vote is un-American.' " We wondered whether Richie was right: Did the King Street Patriots throw a fundraiser featuring an author who espouses such a view? Some background: The King Street Patriots was launched in 2009, according to its website, "to battle the most brazen attempt by liberals in the last 50 years to further an agenda which Patriots consider diametrically opposed to the welfare of all Americans." The Patriots are "committed to freedom, capitalism, American exceptionalism, constitutional governance and civic duty," the site says. The group has made voter fraud its signature issue and launched an initiative in 2010 called True the Vote that trains poll-watchers. The state Democratic Party and the Patriots group have been embroiled in a legal dispute since October 2010, when the party accused the Patriots of illegally aiding Republicans — through its poll-watcher training — without registering as a political committee. In a countersuit, the Patriots denied the allegations and challenged some state election laws cited by the party, including the limits on corporate campaign contributions. Back to Richie's Nov. 15 email. To back up the first half of its claim — that Vadum spoke at a King Street Patriots fundraiser — party spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña sent us the online invitation to the third installment of the Patriots' "visiting author series." According to the invitation, the Nov. 14, 2011, luncheon was to feature Vadum talking about his 2011 book, Subversion Inc.: How Obama’s ACORN Red Shirts Are Still Terrorizing and Ripping Off American Taxpayers. Vadum is an editor at the Washington-based Capital Research Center, whose website says it "analyzes organizations that promote the growth of government and identifies viable private alternatives to government regulatory and entitlement programs." The price of admission to the luncheon was listed as $100, which the invitation said would entitle attendees to a four-course meal and an autographed copy of Vadum's book. Catherine Engelbrecht, president of the King Street Patriots and a resident of Richmond, southwest of Houston, confirmed that the event was a fundraiser, telling us that about $40 out of every $100 ticket sold for the author series went to the Patriots. The invitation also included a blurb about Subversion Inc.: "America is under siege by radicals who are determined to pulverize the U.S. Constitution, deliberately bankrupt the nation, destroy the electoral system, and drive the economy into the ground. Subversion Inc. isn’t just the story of ACORN. It’s the story of how community organizers just like President (Barack) Obama are undermining American from within — and it’s a story we must understand if we are to save our nation." ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in March 2010 after a video sting showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The 40-year-old, liberal-leaning group, which sought more affordable housing options, a universal health care system and increased voter access, was also accused of committing fraud in voter registration drives. In his book, Vadum says that "rumors of (ACORN's) death have been greatly exaggerated" and that the group's leaders have acknowledged that they are building a network of activist groups to continue ACORN's work. As backup for the second part of its claim — that Vadum believes registering the poor to vote is un-American — the Democratic Party pointed us to an opinion article by Vadum that was posted Sept. 1, 2011, on the conservative website American Thinker. The headline: "Registering the Poor to Vote Is Un-American." Vadum begins his piece by writing that "left-wing activist groups" are eager to register the poor to vote because they always support politicians who want to expand government benefits — which Vadum objects to and views as a coercive redistribution of wealth. Besides the headline, the word "un-American" appears in the piece's third paragraph: "Registering (welfare recipients) to vote is like handing out burglary tools to criminals. It is profoundly anti-social and un-American to empower the nonproductive segments of the population to destroy the country." Later, Vadum expands on his point: "Encouraging those who burden society to participate in elections isn't about helping the poor. It's about helping the poor to help themselves to others' money. … It's about moving America ever farther away from the small-government ideals of the Founding Fathers." In his article, Vadum attacks the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, known as the "motor voter" law, for encouraging more poor people to register to vote, saying the law "turned welfare offices into voter registration centers and encouraged nonprofit groups to conduct registration drives." According to a summary on the Justice Department's website, the 1993 law required most states to give citizens the opportunity to register to vote at offices that provide public assistance and when they apply for or renew their driver's license. In an email, Vadum told us that he stands by his article but has had regrets about his wording. "In retrospect, I believe that calling it 'un-American' to register the poor to vote was rhetorical overkill," Vadum said. "I continue to believe that actively encouraging welfare recipients to vote to enlarge the existing welfare state apparatus and move America farther down the road to European-style socialism is a terrible idea. It is, in the American context, anti-social in that it promotes dependency and the social pathologies associated with it." According to a video posted on the Patriots' website, Engelbrecht asked Vadum about the article at the Nov. 14 event. She said: "You wrote an article for American Thinker, and I'm not sure if any of you (the audience) have seen this, but the left has already come out swinging against the fact that you wrote the article, that we had you here after you wrote the article. And, you want to speak to that?" Vadum responded: "I wrote an op-ed, perhaps indelicately worded, called 'Registering the Poor to Vote Is Un-American,' but I wasn’t saying that people shouldn’t have the right to vote if they’re poor. I was talking about the — and I’ll just be a little bit more careful when I write op-eds in the future; it's mostly the tone that some conservatives objected to, and I can appreciate that." He went on to criticize the motor-voter law. Engelbrecht told us in an interview that Richie's statement — that her group held a fundraiser featuring an author who believes that registering the poor to vote is un-American — was not true. Engelbrecht said that she was unaware of his American Thinker article at the time that Vadum was invited to speak and that the point of his appearance was to discuss his book. In his email to us, Vadum said his American Thinker article was drawn from material in his book. We checked Subversion Inc., and although we didn’t find the title of Vadum's American Thinker article in the text, Vadum makes essentially the same argument as he does in the article. On page 102, he writes: "There's no way to overstate just how profoundly anti-social and un-American the Cloward-Piven voter registration strategy is. It is akin to the government handing out taxpayer-purchased burglary tools." In that sentence, Vadum is referring to Richard Cloward, a Columbia University social work professor who died in 2001, and his wife, Frances Fox Piven, a professor of sociology and political science at the City University of New York. They have been described as driving forces behind the 1993 motor-voter law; Cloward’s obituary in The New York Times noted that he and his wife were invited to the White House when President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law. The Times story also mentions a 1966 article that the pair wrote for the Nation magazine calling for a massive drive to recruit the poor onto the voter rolls as a means of forcing radical welfare reform. The Times describes the article as "perhaps (the couple's) most controversial writing," saying it "helped to foster the emergence of a more militant welfare rights movement, including the occupation of welfare offices in many cities and other acts of civil disobedience." Our ruling: The guest speaker at the Nov. 14 King Street Patriots event wrote an article suggesting that registering the poor to vote is un-American, further likening the registration of welfare recipients to offering burglary tools to criminals (though Richie did not mention this aspect). We rate Richie’s statement True.	None	Boyd Richie	None	None	None	2011-12-16T06:00:00	2011-11-15	['None']
pomt-00244	"For decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/oct/07/bruce-rauner/rauner-ad-rewrites-property-tax-history/	Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has run numerous re-election ads attempting to tie Democratic rival J.B. Pritzker to high taxes, public corruption and powerful Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. In Rauner’s telling, Madigan is the ultimate puppet-master of Illinois politics, controlling Pritzker and everyone and everything the governor deems bad. Now Rauner has yet another ad that not only hits on the same themes but dispenses with all subtlety by using actual puppets to deliver his points. "For decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them," the talking puppets claim as they ask viewers to take it from them that Madigan is pulling Pritzker’s strings. Madigan, a Chicago Democrat who has served as speaker for all but two of the past 35 years, undeniably wields considerable power. On the side, he also is a partner in a law firm that, like many others, does lucrative work contesting appraisals for commercial and industrial property to secure real-estate tax reductions for clients. So the ad’s reference to the money he’s made in the field is clear. But property tax levies are set at the local level, not by lawmakers in Springfield. That makes the main beat of Rauner’s contention a head-scratcher. How could Madigan, as a state lawmaker, take action to ensure local property taxes remain high? And what about his work suggests his clients are "cronies" out to game the system? A property tax primer Understanding the thrust of the ad’s claim requires a brief journey into the weeds of property taxes in Illinois. The state itself stopped taxing property a decade before the 76-year-old Madigan was born. Since then, the taxing of property has been largely a local affair, with municipal and county officials determining assessments, tax rates and levies. The state isn’t totally divorced from the process, however. During Madigan’s lengthy tenure as speaker, lawmakers and the governor imposed a cap on how much most local governments in the state could raise property tax levies in a given year. Last decade, Springfield responded to soaring home values in Cook County by temporarily imposing limits on the growth of assessments for tax purposes. Despite that history, Justin Giorgio, a Rauner campaign spokesman, said Madigan had "consistently" opposed legislation that would prevent local officials from increasing their levies. During a two-year state budget standoff between Rauner and Madigan’s Democrats, both backed property tax freeze plans, though the speaker’s was not as sweeping. Neither plan became law. But the biggest impact the state has on the size of property tax bills is what it doesn’t do. Few states chip in as little to cover school costs as does Illinois, forcing school districts to rely on local revenue streams to cover more than 60 percent of education costs. "In just about every other state in the union, the state itself puts more into local public schools than we do in Illinois," said Charles N. Wheeler III, a state budget expert and director of the Public Affairs Reporting program at the University of Illinois-Springfield. That practice has been reinforced for decades by the spending policies set by state Republicans and Democrats alike, despite a goal laid out in the Illinois Constitution for the state to assume "primary responsibility" for funding K-12 schools. Two decades ago, then Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, pushed to change that. He proposed a "tax swap" that would increase the state income tax, using the extra funds to support schools and provide property tax relief. That plan passed Madigan’s chamber with the speaker’s support, but was spiked in the Senate by members of Edgar’s own party. Commonplace practice The ad also accuses Madigan of capitalizing on high property taxes in order to line his pockets by helping "cronies like Pritzker" avoid them. Madigan has been elusive about his personal wealth, but he once said that he makes at least $1 million "in a good year." And in 2015, his practice ranked second among law firms for total property tax refunds in Cook County, according to a Reuters report. Giorgio, Rauner’s spokesman, pointed us to county records showing a lawyer from Madigan’s firm has represented a company owned by the investment group Pritzker co-founded, securing reductions in its property value assessments. But there are tens of thousands of property assessment appeals filed in Cook County each year by a multitude of law firms, so it is unclear what makes the clients of Madigan’s firm "cronies." When asked, Giorgio pointed only to why the campaign pinned the term on Pritzker. "It has been shown that Madigan's law firm has received a large number of tax reductions from (Cook County Assessor Joseph) Berrios. Berrios is the head of the Cook County Democratic party, former Democratic State Rep. and an ally of Madigan," Giorgio wrote in an email. "Pritzker has been a donor to Madigan and Berrios. Pritzker has received successful reductions through hiring Madigan's law firm from Berrios. That's clearly a ‘crony’ connection." That’s besides the point, however, because state lawmakers do not set property assessments. Our ruling A recent Rauner ad stars puppets that declare "for decades, Madigan kept property taxes high and made a fortune helping cronies like Pritzker dodge them." That claim suggests Madigan, the powerful House speaker, took action as a lawmaker to ensure Illinois property taxes remain some of the nation’s highest. For support, Rauner’s campaign said Madigan has kept property taxes high by "consistently" opposing legislation to provide property tax relief, even though Madigan’s record says otherwise. The claim also ignores the reality that state lawmakers play no direct role in the assessment process, which takes place at the local level. There is a glimmer of truth in the ad’s contention that Madigan is a partner in a law firm that conducts property tax appeals work for those who can afford it, including a Pritzker-owned company. And it’s a lucrative business because property taxes are extraordinarily high in Illinois. But skyrocketing property taxes are part of a long and bipartisan legacy in Springfield of foisting the lion’s share of public school funding on to local property tax payers. The responsibility for that phenomenon is broadly shared by decades of governors and lawmakers, Madigan included. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-01044	The Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline "has already created 4,800 jobs in just the year it's been up and running."	false	/texas/statements/2015/jan/23/john-cornyn/cornyn-says-keystone-pipeline-through-texas-create/	After a Republican senator revisited his disagreement with President Barack Obama on the government permitting completion of the Keystone XL pipeline to deliver crude oil from Canada to Southeast Texas, a reader called for the Truth-O-Meter. In a Jan. 20, 2015, post on his Senate website, John Cornyn of Texas noted the newly majority-Republican Senate was starting the year by taking up "bipartisan legislation, like the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. But the President has already threatened to veto this economy-boosting bill and prevent it from becoming law," Cornyn said. The White House earlier announced Obama’s veto threat, saying congressional intervention would circumvent a required federal review to determine if the project crossing an international border serves the national interest. Cornyn continued: "It’s unfortunate that the President would shut down this bipartisan legislation. In Texas, we’ve seen the direct positive impact of the pipeline on the local and state economy. The Texas leg of the project, which delivers more than 400,000 barrels of crude oil from Cushing, OK to Southeast Texas each day, has already created 4,800 jobs in just the year it's been up and running." That many jobs since the pipeline started flowing oil through Texas? Cornyn cites TransCanada To our inquiry, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie said the senator’s jobs count came from the owner of the pipeline, TransCanada. A December 2013 Associated Press news story said the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, from Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast, was built and would begin shipping oil Jan. 22, 2014. The story quoted TransCanada spokesman Davis Sheremata saying construction of the leg began in August 2012, ultimately involving more than 11 million hours of labor by 4,844 U.S. workers. Sheremata said the number of workers employed in the operational phase of the leg had not been established, the AP reported. According to an October 2013 TransCanada press release, the 4,844 workers who helped build the southern leg included heavy equipment operators, welders, laborers, transportation operators and supervisory personnel (including environment, safety and quality control inspectors). TransCanada confirms construction jobs gone With construction ended more than a year ago, we wondered how many jobs on the Oklahoma-through-Texas pipeline remain. Brandewie suggested we ask TransCanada whose spokesman Matthew John answered our inquiry in part by saying Cornyn separately made a clear reference to the "4,800 individuals who found work as a result of its construction" at a January 2015 celebration of the pipeline held in Beaumont, near Nederland, which is where the pipeline ends. That said, none of the jobs mentioned by Cornyn remained in place after the pipeline was built, John told us. Generally, John said, laborers "work themselves out of a job every time they clock in. Like any infrastructure project, the majority of jobs are created during construction. This doesn’t mean those jobs never existed or didn’t have any lasting impact on the economy or the lives the American men and women that work those jobs to support their families." Asked how many people were employed by the pipeline in Texas at the time Cornyn made his statement, John emailed: "TransCanada has approximately 6,000 employees in North America; about a third are located throughout the U.S. across 32 states. In-service pipelines require maintenance, monitoring and operations jobs that may be directly supplied by TransCanada. However we spend millions of dollars every year with third-party contractors that provide services, (road repair, snow removal, inspectors etc.) in the communities where our infrastructure exists." We asked for a precise count of jobs created after the pipeline was up and running. TransCanada spokesman Shawn Watson said by email: "We have almost 750 employees and full-time contractors based in Texas alone – and many of them will provide some level of support to our oil operations and maintenance there. That doesn’t include people in other parts of the U.S. who would provide support or expertise to pipeline operations in Texas, or who may be considered ‘corporate overhead.’" A national analysis If the entire pipeline is built, the U.S State Department has said, the result would be 3,900 jobs in place for two years and a total of 42,100 positions, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. has noted, though the definition of a job in this sense is a position filled for one year. This total reflects both jobs created directly as a result of construction and manufacturing for the pipeline -- about 3,900 annual positions over two years -- as well as spin-off jobs supported by construction workers who purchase materials for the project or spend their wages in the economy. Much of the construction work would come in four- or or eight-month stretches. After full construction, the pipeline would employ a lesser number, primarily for maintenance. The total number of projected long-term jobs: about 50. Finally, we asked Cornyn if it makes sense that the jobs he described as resulting from the pipeline's first year of operations existed only during construction. Via Brandewie, Megan Mitchell, Cornyn’s communications director, said: "Our office was correct in noting that 4,800 jobs were created as a result of the Gulf Coast leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Unfortunately, we erred in the timeframe." Our ruling Cornyn said the Texas leg of the Keystone pipeline project "has already created 4,800 jobs in just the year it's been up and running." We didn't learn how many jobs were created in the pipeline’s first year of operations. But Cornyn’s figure reflected the workers who built the pipeline’s southern leg over 15 months--and those jobs no longer existed by 2014. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14914	Says Ohio Gov. John Kasich "got lucky with a thing called fracking," which "is why Ohio is doing well."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/02/donald-trump/donald-trumps-fracked-claim-shales-economic-impact/	In the third Republican debate, Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich got into a fracas over fracking. It started when debate moderator John Harwood asked Kasich whom he was talking about when Kasich said he’s been hearing "crazy" things on the campaign trail. Kasich didn’t name names but listed proposals from the two outsiders leading the GOP field, specifically Trump’s plan to deport 10 million people and Ben Carson’s tithe-based tax policy. "Folks, we’ve got to wake up. We cannot elect somebody who doesn’t know how to do the job," Kasich said on Oct. 28. Trump fired back that Kasich’s record in Ohio wasn’t so good. "First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, okay?" Trump retorted. "He hit oil. He got lucky with fracking. Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well." "Ohio does have an energy industry, but we’re diversified," Kasich said in response. Who was right? We reached out to the Trump camp but didn’t hear back. The data suggests and experts told us, however, that Trump is grossly exaggerating fracking’s role in Ohio’s economy. The numbers To refresh, fracking or hydraulic fracturing is the process of blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals to extract natural gas from shale rock miles underground. Ohio, the birthplace of Standard Oil and the leading producer of crude oil a century ago, sits on parts of two major shale formations. Drilling began in the Utica and Marcellus shales in eastern Ohio in 2010, when the state was facing a projected budget shortfall and when Kasich was elected to office. Ohio is now running a $2 billion surplus. Statistics show that fracking contributed to both jobs and tax revenues in Ohio, but the numbers aren’t overwhelming. Kasich’s spokesperson Rob Nichols pointed to data showing that fracking was responsible for just 2.6 percent of the 278,150 total jobs created in the state during that time period. As for revenue, Nichols said data from Ohio’s Department of Taxation shows that oil and gas industry brought 0.017 percent ($19.89 million) of all state revenue ($118.3 billion) between fiscal years 2014 to 2015. Our own analysis produced similar results. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that fracking accounted for 2.3 to 2.5 percent of all jobs created in Ohio between 2010 and 2014. Factoring in jobs created in related industries (i.e. petrochemical engineering or pipe manufacturing) brings up the figure up to 6.9 to 7.9 percent of all jobs. As for revenue, we looked at Ohio Department of Taxation’s annual reports and found that the severance tax imposed on the oil and gas industry contributed to less than 1 percent of tax revenue in Ohio from 2010 to 2014. Policy Matters Ohio, a Cleveland-based liberal think tank, estimates a slightly lower impact. According to their analysis of BLS data, shale jobs represented about 0.26 percent of total employment in Ohio in the first quarter of 2015, and about 2 percent of total jobs added between 2010 and 2015. By comparison, the auto industry added about three and a half times more jobs. "I’ll admit that I tweeted in outrage at (Trump’s) statement since both parts of it are inaccurate and not borne out by the data," said Amy Hanauer, the think tank’s executive director, who also contends that Ohio is actually not doing well. Shale dreams deferred At the beginning of the fracking boom, the oil and gas industry hailed it as "the biggest thing economically to hit Ohio since maybe the plow," in the words of one executive. Shale development, according to industry officials, would bring an estimated $500 billion and 200,000 jobs to the state. But fracking wasn’t as profitable in Ohio as expected, thanks to a slump in the oil prices coupled with low production. "I would say the growth has been slower than we originally anticipated," an oil refinery official acknowledged in 2012, according to Reuters. "Nothing like those numbers had been seen," said Hanauer. "Employment even in the drilling counties was, at that time, below pre-recession levels. Sales tax revenue was up significantly, a good thing, but many of those who have found jobs were from out of state." A 2012 economic analysis sponsored by pro-industry entities — the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio Shale Coalition — estimated that shale development would, by 2014, result in an additional 65,000 jobs and just a 1 percent improvement to the state GDP. The 1 percent estimate was "pretty much on target," according to report co-author Douglas Southgate, a professor emeritus of environmental economics and public policy at Ohio State University who says he’s pro-fracking. The overall employment impact, meanwhile, "has been small enough that not even OOGA — the Ohio Oil and Gas Association — has been talking about it," Southgate told us. Even if oil prices pick up again and fracking’s impact grows, its role in Ohio’s economy wouldn’t be as large as Trump is trumpeting it to be. "Ohio has a far more diverse economy than, say, North Dakota or Oklahoma," said Andrew Thomas of Cleveland State University’s Energy Policy Center, the principal investigator of the 2012 report. "I am skeptical that all growth in the state can be attributed to the oil and gas industry alone." Kasich’s campaign forwarded us a report from JobsOhio, the state’s privatized economic development agency, to that point: For the record, not even the drillers themselves back Trump’s claim. Here’s a statement Shawn Bennett, the executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, provided to PolitiFact: "While we appreciate Mr. Trump acknowledging the significant and positive economic impacts that oil and gas development has had on Ohio, we can not take credit for all of the economic growth that has taken place during Gov. Kasich's tenure." Our ruling Trump said, "John (Kasich) got lucky with a thing called fracking," which "is why Ohio is doing well". Though Ohio underwent a fracking boom in recent years, Trump is overstating its impact on Ohio’s economy. By all estimates, fracking jobs account for 2 percent of those added in the state during Kasich’s tenure. Shale development has improved GDP by about 1 percent and contributed to less than a percent of the state’s tax revenue. Not even the drillers themselves back Trump’s claim. We rate it False.

pomt-09509	"The current (agriculture) commissioner allowed tainted beef to be sent to school cafeterias."	false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/19/kinky-friedman/kinky-friedman-says-texas-agriculture-commissioner/	Kinky Friedman, seeking the Democratic nod for state agriculture commissioner, suggests the Republican incumbent, Todd Staples, let down his guard a couple years ago. Responding to a question from the League of Women Voters of Texas, Friedman said: "The current commissioner allowed tainted beef to be sent to school cafeterias." His stomach-churning charge drew our attention. The candidate’s campaign pointed us to a February 2008 press release issued by Staples giving clearance to school districts to comply with a nationwide recall of more than 765,000 pounds of tainted beef. The release states: "Currently, 462 Texas school districts and other entities enrolled in the school breakfast and lunch programs have reported to have meat on hold and now can begin the disposal process." The release doesn’t say if or how Staples allowed the tainted beef get to Texas schools. But Friedman spokesman Jason Stanford said it shows "this was allowed to happen on Staples’ watch." We wondered what role the Texas Department of Agriculture plays in determining what foods get delivered for school meals. Staples’ spokesman Bryan Black confirmed that the Texas department distributes food commodities purchased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Black conceded too those deliveries would have included the beef that was later targeted for disposal. Yet Black insisted that nothing in state law permits the commissioner to tell districts what foods to order or not. His point: Staples couldn't have stopped--or disallowed--schools from taking the beef; the state department is responsible only for ensuring that food ordered through the USDA's commodity program--whatever the foods are--gets delivered. Spokeswoman Jean Daniel of the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, which administers USDA's food nutrition programs, echoed Black's claim. Daniel said state officials such as the Texas agriculture commissioner don't determine which suppliers provide food either through federally purchased commodities, which account for 15 to 20 percent of the food in school meals nationwide, or local purchases from commercial suppliers, handled by school districts. Daniel said she didn't know of any instance of a state-level official intervening in school district food purchases unless they were alerted to a recall. In 2008, Black said, Staples acted because the federal government told states that the beef was unfit for human consumption. The state agency helped ensure the disposal of the beef and reimbursements to districts. It's true that the Texas agriculture commissioner is responsible for overseeing the distribution of federal commodities for school meal programs. But we found no evidence that Staples had the authority to allow districts to get the bad beef. We rate Friedman's statement as False.

pomt-12662	Says U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said, "It’s better for our budget if cancer patients die more quickly."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/21/blog-posting/fake-quote-tom-price-did-not-tell-cancer-patients-/	A fake news story pegged to a real forum with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price falsely quotes him as saying it’s better for cancer patients to die than to waste taxpayer money. "Tom Price: 'It's better for our budget if cancer patients die more quickly,' " reads the headline on a March 16, 2017, post on USPOLN.com. The post was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fake news, but it still has been shared on the site more than 75,000 times. USPOLN.com is a site that we’ve written about in other fact-checks, and identifies itself as "a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." Other than that, there’s no indication the story is almost entirely fabricated. The domain is registered to an address in Kosovo. The site didn’t respond to our attempts to contact them via email. The story — which again, is fake — is actually from a March 16 post on Politicops.com, a different fake news site. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The Politicops.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, at an address in Israel. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know. In this case, the disorienting details are compounded because the "facts" of the Politicops.com story are plagiarized directly from a news article on RawStory.com. That piece recounted an exchange about Medicaid between Price, who is a former GOP congressman from Georgia, and a man at a CNN town hall event. Brian Kline, who said he voted for President Donald Trump, noted he was using Medicaid, the federal health program for the very poor, to be treated for cancer. Kline asked Price why he wanted to stop the expansion of Medicaid as outlined in the Affordable Care Act. Price said he considered the entire program to be riddled with problems. The back-and-forth illustrated that Price does want to draw back access to Medicaid. The fake comments in the made-up story, however, echo a real accusation made in 2009 by former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, a Florida Democrat, during debate on the Affordable Care Act. Grayson admonished GOP opposition to the bill by saying on the House floor that "If you get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly." But Price did not use the words Politicops.com attributed to him by saying the budget would benefit more from cancer patients who gave up and died. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-09292	The Banking Committee voted a 1,336-page bill "out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/25/bob-corker/corker-claims-financial-regulation-had-speedy-vote/	Financial regulation reform was the topic of the day on the latest edition of ABC's This Week. Among the guests was Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who has played a key role in negotiating the Senate version of a bill meant to crack down on Wall Street. Corker said that, before the bill goes to the Senate floor, lawmakers still need to work out some major disagreements over the details of the legislation. "So if there is no bipartisan agreement, Republicans will block the motion to proceed to debating this bill?" This Week host Jake Tapper asked Corker on the April 25, 2010, show. "I think that's very likely," Corker responded, adding that the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs voted the 1,336-page bill "out of committee in 21 minutes with no amendments, with the understanding that before the bill came to the floor, we would reach this bipartisan agreement." In a chamber notorious for being slower than molasses, a 21-minute committee passage for a major bill is unheard of. Could Corker be right? Indeed, news reports of the March 22 Banking Committee vote all noted its unusual speed. According to Congressional Quarterly, the panel "approved the legislation in less than 30 minutes." A Fox Business article noted that debate "lasted less than 20 minutes." And a reporter for the Atlantic wrote that consideration started at 5 p.m. and ended at 5:22 p.m. So, Corker's pretty accurate with 21 minutes. And he's right that the Democratic leadership promised to negotiate further with Republicans before the legislation hits the floor. Sticking points include new regulatory authority over consumer financial products, such as credit cards and mortgages, as well as regulation of derivatives. Here's what Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd had to say the day his committee passed the bill: "The legislation I present today contains bipartisan ideas and is the result of a bipartisan effort. It does not, as of yet, enjoy bipartisan support. And so, while I will continue to work with my colleagues to build support and make the case for reform, I am moving forward today. " Sen. Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the committee, also acknowledged further bipartisan work, according to Congressional Quarterly. "By coming out today, working in a spirit of, down the road, a bill we can both be proud of, we’re not polarized," he said. (He didn't exactly complete his thoughts in that sentence, but his point was clear that he expected more bipartisan talks.) In fact, on the same day Corker appeared on This Week, the Associated Press reported that bipartisan talks were continuing on Capitol Hill. So, Corker is on solid ground when it comes to his claim that the mark-up was short and that he and other Republicans were promised another attempt at a bipartisan bill before the Senate takes up the legislation. But Corker's comment that the bill passed with "no amendments" is not entirely true. When it came time to actually debate the bill in committee, panel members first approved something called a "manager's amendment," shorthand for an updated version of the bill that serves as a legislative blueprint for lawmakers to discuss and amend. That version included some important changes. For instance, Dodd scrapped his original idea to create an entirely new agency to regulate consumer financial products. Rather, he opted to establish a new regulator inside the Federal Reserve. Furthermore, the manager's amendment included more than 20 Democratic amendments. One, for instance, would give a new council looking for emerging threats to the financial system the authority to decide what events are likely trigger a liquidity crisis. It's also important to note that Republicans had many amendments of their own in addition to the ones in the manager's amendment. GOP members "had queued up hundreds of amendments before abruptly withdrawing them," said an account in Congressional Quarterly. Dodd said his committee "held an open markup. 401 amendments were filed with the committee, but my Republican colleagues did not bring up a single amendment and declined my offer to include some of their amendments in the manager’s amendment." So, while it's unclear why GOP members decided to withdraw their amendments, it appears they had the opportunity to offer them. For his part, Corker lamented his leadership's decision not to offer amendments, telling the Huffington Post it was "a very large strategic mistake. We had an opportunity to pass out a bill out of our committee in a bipartisan way, and then stand on the Senate floor and hold hands and say that we would keep amendments that were unnecessary and improper from coming onto this bill." Corker's spokeswoman, Laura Herzog, told PolitiFact that in his comment on This Week, Corker wasn't trying to insinuate that the Republicans were somehow blocked from offering amendments but simply saying that he expected bipartisan talks after the bill passed the committee. But to say that no amendments were adopted at all is incorrect. So Corker is correct that it only took the committee about 21 minutes to debate and vote on the bill, and he's also right that Democratic leaders promised more bipartisan negotiation before the legislation comes to the Senate floor. But he's wrong that the bill was passed without amendments. Dodd rolled more than 20 Democratic amendments into the final version of the bill. And Republicans had the opportunity to offer their own, but declined to do so. As a result, we find Corker's statement to be Mostly True.

abbc-00219	Australia's new Prime Minister and Treasurer have both been keen to trumpet good news about the economy in the wake of recent political turmoil.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-24/fact-check-are-profits-growing-five-times-faster-than-wages/10287356	There is more to the story than Dr Chalmers's claim suggests. A commonly quoted measure of wages included in the National Accounts — average compensation per employee — increased 1.6 per cent over the year to the June quarter in seasonally adjusted terms (a widely-used adjustment to iron out standard seasonal influences). Using the bureau's trend measure (which applies a rolling average to smooth out statistical volatility), average compensation per employee increased 1.7 per cent over the year. A commonly used measure of profits included in the national accounts — gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations — grew 9.7 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms (or by 8.8 per cent in trend terms). The National Accounts figures showed gross operating surplus of private non-financial corporations grew more than five times faster than average compensation per employee over the year to the June quarter. However, the claim requires context. First, as experts contacted by Fact Check pointed out, profits tends to be more volatile than wages. This is partly a function of the fact that profit — a measure of what is left from revenue after costs — is critically influenced by fluctuations in input prices, commodity prices, exchange rates and consumer demand, all of which can fluctuate significantly. In the face of such volatility, comparing a single quarter of data has the potential to paint a misleading picture. Second, the measure of profits in the national accounts provides a snapshot of the total pool of profits across the economy. This pool grows over time as the economy and output expand. As a consequence, Dr Chalmers is comparing an economy-wide pool of profits, with a per capita measure of wages. As one expert noted, this is not a "like-for-like" comparison. A "like-for-like" comparison involves examining the total pool of profits against the total pool of wages. According to the bureau, the total pool of wages — referred to as total compensation of employees — grew by a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent over the year to the June quarter, partly reflecting rising employment. On this measure, profits grew at roughly twice the rate of wages.

pomt-08819	Kathryn Starkey "only attended half of those meetings."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/13/committee-protect-florida/kathryn-starkey-missed-just-over-half-meetings/	A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks State House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax. The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.) "Taxin’ Kathryn," says the mailer sent in early August 2010. "With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?" We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item tackles her attendance at meetings. Other items are here on her voting record for river board tax rates, and here on her actions involving the Pasco sales tax. We looked at the claim that "As a member of the Pinellas-Anclote River Basin Board, Kathryn Starkey had the opportunity to fight for lower taxes in 14 separate budget meetings between 2002 and 2008. But ... She only attended half of those meetings!" Pennington said he based that claim on minutes from the basin board’s meetings. We took a look, too. We looked at two budget meetings each year: June, when the basin board typically sets its preliminary tax rate, and August, when it takes a final vote. (In 2007, the final vote was taken in July.) Starkey served on the board from June 2002 through April 2008, so we looked only at the 12 budget-related meetings that fell within that period. (Pennington, who put together his mailer a month ago, said he wasn’t sure why we came up with different counts for the meetings.) Of 12 budget meetings she could have attended, Starkey attended seven (five of those seven were the final votes). That attendance record is more than half — by a hair. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08744	"The IRS filed an $11,000 lien against (Allen) West for back taxes. Three liens were placed on his home for unpaid bills, and a judge ordered West to pay over $5,000 for past due credit card bills."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/30/ron-klein/ron-klien-says-allen-west-late-paying-bills/	Primary election night was barely over when U.S. Rep. Ron Klein released his first general-election campaign ad against Republican challenger Allen West in the heated race for Florida’s 22nd congressional district. In the 30-second TV spot, Klein juxtaposes a video clip of West at a public appearance talking about "individual responsibility and accountability," with claims that West has faced numerous liens for unpaid taxes. (Check out the ad here.) "The IRS filed an $11,000 lien against West for back taxes." In the ad, West says: "Individual responsibility and accountability is the No. 1 cultural problem we have in America." A narrator then says: "If so, then Allen West is part of the problem." The ad goes on to list the following claims against West: "The IRS filed an $11,000 lien against West for back taxes." "Three liens were placed on his home for unpaid bills." "A judge ordered West to pay over $5,000 for past-due credit card bills." We decided to check out all three claims, but focused most of our attention on the $11,000 lien. Not only was it the largest debt listed, but it was the one charge that West’s camp immediately challenged. The other two have not been refuted by West campaign manager Josh Grodin in interviews withMiami Herald political reporter Amy Sherman. We asked Klein’s camp to provide us with documentation supporting their claim, and they provided us with a copy of an IRS Notice of Federal Tax Lien filed against "Allen B West & Angela M Graham West." The document, filed on Nov. 17, 2005, with the Marion County Recorder’s office in Indianapolis shows an "Unpaid Balance of Assessment" for $11,081.05. The Marion County Recorder’s office was able to provide us copies of the same document, showing the lien was against the couple’s personal income, not against a home. The recorder’s office also provided a copy of an IRS Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien issued to the couple on March 22, 2006, about four months later. The certificate shows that the lien was removed following a payment on the complete balance of the lien. Almost immediately after the ad was released, Grodin released the following statement: "Allen West, and his wife Dr. Angela M. Graham-West have never resided, nor owned property in Marion County, Ind., and there was never a valid IRS lien placed upon them." Still, West’s residency or whether he owned property in Indiana was not in question, since the lien was not against a property but the couple’s personal income. The paperwork was filed in Indianapolis because the IRS paperwork lists West’s address as "DFAS-IN", which stands for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, based in Indianapolis. DFAS handles military payroll for servicemen like West, who is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel. Grodin said West was working in Afghanistan at the time, training Afghan soldiers as a private contractor. West’s campaign said that they would release documents proving that the IRS lien was an error, but later backtracked. Grodin told The Palm Beach Post on Aug. 26, 2010: "I spoke a little too soon as far as having all the documents. I jumped the gun. I’m still confident that was a mistake by the IRS." As for the other claims listed in the advertisement -- liens being placed against West’s home and being ordered by a judge to pay more than $5,000 in credit charges -- we checked court and county tax records for proof of those claims. West had the following liens placed on his Plantation, Fla., home according to documents from the Broward County Records, Taxes and Treasury Division. The liens -- we found five, not three as the ad says -- were brought forward by his Homeowner’s Association (Fountain Spring Master Homeowners Association, Inc., and Fountain Spring II Homeowners Association, Inc.). We list them according to the date they were filed with the Broward County Clerk of Courts, and subsequently when they were paid off. May 5, 2010 - $964.50 for overdue maintenance fees and attorney costs. * lien released on June 22, 2010 March 13, 2009 - $611.66 for overdue maintenance fees and attorney costs. * no release record found on file Feb. 19, 2007- $995.00 for overdue maintenance fees and late charges. * lien released on March 30, 2007 Sept. 14, 2004 - $295.00 for overdue maintenance fees and late charges. * lien released on Nov. 16, 2004 Sept. 7, 2004 - $366.00 overdue maintenance fees, late charges and attorney fees * lien released on Sept. 13, 2004 On the credit card issue, according to documents from the Broward County Clerk of Courts and the Broward County Tax Collector’s Office, a judge ordered West to pay $5,541.43 on Sept. 1, 2006, to American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. On June 12, 2009, he was ordered to pay $ 2,832.26 to Midland Funding LLC, a representative of Citibank. We searched Broward County records for "Satisfaction of Judgment" documents that normally indicate a debt has been paid in full, but none came up. However, that does not automatically mean the debt hasn’t been paid, even though those documents are not on file, said Lloyd Comiter, an attorney who serves as the chairman of the Palm Beach County Bar Association’s small claims committee. "Just because there is no Satisfaction of Judgment on file, it doesn’t necessarily mean it hasn’t been paid," Comiter said. "As an attorney, if my client paid their full judgment I would make sure to file the Satisfaction of Judgment so it’s recorded. But there are cases where people do not." West campaign manager Grodin said that the candidate’s financial woes stemmed from his time overseas. He gave this explanation on Aug. 25 in an interview posted on the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog: "Allen West was serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. [His wife] Angela was putting herself through grad school and caring for two young daughters. Like countless young families, the Wests found themselves with a financial burden." West himself released the following statement on Aug. 26, 2010, regarding his finances, acknowledging struggling with "financial hardship." "...like many of you, my family has struggled with financial hardship," West wrote. " And also like many of you, we have honestly resolved every issue, and both my wife and I are working hard every day to honor all of our obligations, while ensuring our daughters' future." So back to the question: Did the IRS file "an $11,000 lien against West for back taxes" as Klein’s ad states? It's important to remember that income tax records are private and we won't know what the IRS dispute involved. West says the lien was filed in error, but his campaign isn't able to provide us with any documentation showing that. If the campaign offers it later, we will review this item then. What we do know is that an IRS lien was filed, so Klein's ad is accurate on that score. The Broward liens and the credit card accusations also are accurate descriptions of public records. But we think the ad lacks context because Klein fails to mention that the IRS lien was settled within a few months, as were most of the other judgments filed in Broward County. So we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Ron Klein	None	None	None	2010-08-30T18:16:47	2010-08-24	['None']

pomt-04385	Says he "is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/oct/19/gerald-daugherty/gerald-daugherty-says-he-reason-mopac-drivers-dont/	For many South Austinites in 2004, a proposal to charge a toll on MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) at William Cannon Drive was a bridge too far. Gerald Daugherty, then commissioner for Travis County’s Precinct 3, heard from quite a lot of those folks. And in his bid to retake that job Nov. 6, 2012, he has said he served them well: Daugherty "is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon," according to a campaign flier. That bridge was at the center of debate over the region’s 2004 toll road plan -- a debate so heated it launched an effort to recall two Austin City Council members and the mayor. Road wrangling in Precinct 3 hasn’t calmed down much since then; the fight over Texas 45 Southwest underpinned a fact-check we recently wrote about Daugherty’s Democratic opponent, incumbent Karen Huber. In fact, Daugherty bumper stickers in his 2012 race read, "Want SH 45 SW built? Vote for Gerald Daugherty." So we wondered: Was he the reason the toll at William Cannon didn’t happen? It’s a "bold" claim, Daugherty said when we called him. "We probably shouldn’t have used that definitive a position versus saying, ‘I was one of the people that led the charge against’ " the toll, he said. Campaign manager Kathy Pillmore told us by email that the flier was mailed out May 10, 2012, in advance of the May 29 primary vote. Daugherty bested two fellow Republicans in the primary and now faces Huber, who defeated him for the seat in 2008, and Libertarian nominee Pat Dixon. Pillmore said the campaign stands by the statement. Daugherty’s website features a slightly different version: "William Cannon Toll Bridge - working with State Representative Terry Keel we were instrumental in stopping TxDOT from tolling the overpass at Loop 1 South and William Cannon Road." The Texas Department of Transportation was in a fix at the time, Daugherty said, lacking sufficient money to build new roads while maintaining existing roads. Tollways were one option. A Dec. 27, 2004, Austin American-Statesman transportation column recapped the opening salvos of "The Great Turnpike War of 2004": (I)n April, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority and Bob Daigh, the Austin district engineer for the Texas Department of Transportation, unveiled a toll road plan of eye-popping scope: ... a $1.8 billion, seven-road plan. … The reaction locally was subdued at first, and even a well-attended public hearing in May was relatively low-key. But then state Rep. Terry Keel of Austin and Travis County Commissioner Gerald Daugherty, Republicans with a history of supporting roads, unexpectedly came out against parts of the plan, especially levying tolls on a short stretch of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) at William Cannon Drive. "Double taxation," they called it, because the project, already under construction, was being built with (state) gasoline tax dollars. … (Circle C neighborhood resident Sal) Costello began a recall petition campaign against Austin Mayor Will Wynn and two other council members who voted for the plan … (B)ehind the scenes, talks continued about how to change the plan and quell the uproar. A Sept. 20, 2004, Statesman news story referring to the uproar said, "The spark that lighted that still out-of-control blaze was the state's plan to charge people a half-buck to stay on MoPac and avoid the light at William Cannon Drive." Daugherty said, according to a Statesman news story from May 4, 2004, and transportation column from May 31, 2004, that he got 600 phone calls in three days objecting to the toll plan and more than 200 messages in the first week and a half after it was announced. What got Austin drivers hopping mad was the fact that a toll was going to be charged on a road that had already been paid for. Drawing on state gas tax revenues, work had started on the 1.45-mile overpass earlier in 2004. Until MoPac traffic could sail above William Cannon, drivers were funneled through the stoplights there. Daugherty recalled: "They were just about ready to lay the columns across those pillars that had been there forever, and we all knew that, ‘Wow, we’re just about to get this road, this bridge put across. And man, won’t that be great, because everyone’s not going to have to get off.’" The plan unveiled April 24, 2004, included a toll there precisely because the overpass was incomplete. Daigh, the TxDOT engineer who drafted the plan with the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, told us in a recent telephone interview that few Austin roads were eligible for tolls because tolls could not be charged on an existing road or a road that had no alternative route. The 2004 plan, he said, included every option in the area. When the plan was announced, Daugherty recalled, "You talk about people coming unhinged." He said he heard opposition from both residents and businesspeople in his precinct, which covers southwestern Travis County and contains the overpass site. A Nov. 28, 2004, Statesman transportation column said Keel and Daugherty had held a press conference in May of that year condemning the toll road plan. The column said residents’ opposition and elected officials’ work got the William Cannon toll dropped. Daugherty told us, "I think I probably was the lead person on it. But Terry and I did the press conference together and said, ‘OK, well, hey, we’re just not going to be supportive of this.’ " He said he believes his opposition was influential in part because "I was so well-known for being supportive of roadways." But yes, he said, it was not a one-man show: "I guess if someone wants to say technically, you weren’t the only guy... Anybody that knew anything about it knew that I was the energy behind fighting this like the dickens." The toll plan was added to the region’s long-range transportation plan by a July 12, 2004, vote of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization board. At that meeting, we learned via email from CAMPO assistant director Bubba Needham, Daugherty moved to delete the toll from the MoPac overpass after he and other members of the board (which is composed mostly of local elected officials) spoke against the plan. His motion failed 17-6, according to the minutes. Voting with him to delete the toll were Keel and fellow Republican state Reps. Todd Baxter and Jack Stick; Democratic state Rep. Elliott Naishtat; and Austin City Council Member Daryl Slusher. Afterward, according to the minutes, the board voted 16-7 to add the toll proposals to the long-range plan; the seven opposed were those who voted for Daugherty’s motion plus Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez. Six months later, the board reversed course by adopting a resolution to remove the overpass from toll consideration. According to the minutes of the board’s Jan. 24, 2005, meeting, board chair Gonzalo Barrientos told the board that although that toll had been seen as an essential source of money to improve MoPac, he, Mayor Will Wynn and Precinct 2 commissioner Karen Sonleitner had gotten financial backing from the Texas Transportation Commission to go ahead with the MoPac work without those toll revenues. Barrientos said, according to the minutes, that an engineering concern with the overpass had come up. Asked to explain that issue, Daigh said that the mobility authority had decided drivers would end up in a traffic jam. According to the minutes, Barrientos moved to "de-toll" the overpass, citing the traffic jam concern and noting the toll revenue was no longer an issue. The motion passed. We called Barrientos to get his take on who was most responsible for getting the overpass toll dropped. No single person makes such a decision happen, he told us, but Daugherty was key. The commissioner’s consistent opposition to the overpass toll, "speaking up every time the issue came up," surely helped, he said. Barrientos characterized the discussion that he, Wynn and Sonleitner had with the Transportation Commission as the type of negotiations needed to reach any agreement and said "there might have been others" helping to reach the agreement. "I think probably everybody" gets credit, he said, "but Daugherty was in the forefront." Daigh, who is now senior director of infrastructure for Williamson County, told us he believes there would be a toll on that road if not for Daugherty. "He was the leader of the effort not to have MoPac tolled," Daigh said. Our ruling Daugherty told us he overstated in claiming that he "is the reason we do not pay a toll every time we pass over the bridge at MoPac and William Cannon." He was an early and prominent opponent. But his claim leaves out the many residents and public officials who spoke, lobbied and voted against the overpass toll and worked to find an alternative.

pomt-01893	A statewide poll showing 76 percent support and other surveys are a "strong indicator" of broad public support in Milwaukee County for a $10.10 minimum wage	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/07/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-polls-show-strong-support-milwauk/	Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele backs an increase in Wisconsin’s minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. But he thinks it’s a waste of taxpayer dollars to ask Milwaukee County voters whether they agree. The County Board voted 13-4 on June 26, 2014 to place a non-binding referendum question on the Nov. 4 ballot to gauge support for the state to enact a $10.10 minimum wage. Some board members say a referendum will drum up support for that level at the state and federal levels. Critics say the referendum is aimed more at driving up turnout on the left in order to help Democrats running in November. Days before the County Board vote, Abele was lobbying supervisors against the move, saying that, when combined with three other referenda, it could cost the county $75,000 to $120,000 in administrative costs. In a June 24, 2014 email and letter posted the next day on Facebook, Abele wrote: "I am worried that we are spending much needed tax dollars on a question that we already know the outcome. One poll conducted by UWM earlier this month shows broad support for raising the minimum wage." According to that poll, Abele wrote, "76% of registered voters support raising the state’s minimum wage. That poll is another strong indicator of what citizens think and it does not require us to dip into our emergency fund to pay for it." Statewide polls, including the one Abele cited, clearly have shown broad support for some increase in the minimum wage. But what do these survey say specifically about $10.10, and about the opinions of Milwaukee County residents? To the numbers As one piece of backup, Abele cited the UWM Wisconsin Economic Scorecard poll, which found the 76 percent statewide figure. And he pointed us to a Marquette Law School poll in March that found 63 percent support statewide for the general notion of an increase, vs. 33 percent opposed. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee poll was conducted by the university’s Center for Urban Initiatives & Research from June 2 to June 5 with a statewide sample of 569 registered voters. It also polled on the issue in March 2014. The Marquette Law School polls on the issue were conducted in January and March 2014, also among registered voters. There is a strong suggestion in the June UWM statewide poll result that a strong majority of Milwaukee County residents would back some increase. A raise won support from 61 percent of Republicans statewide, 70 percent of independents and 94 percent of Democrats. Milwaukee County tilts strongly Democratic. Still, the results Abele references from those polls weren’t specific to $10.10, or to Milwaukee County. Peeling back the layers So let’s peel back a few layers in those and a couple other polls to get to the core. More than three-quarters of Milwaukee County respondents (77 percent) backed some bump in the wage in the UWM June poll, according to Joseph Cera, survey center director at UWM. The margin of error for the county subsample is 10.7 percent. In the MU poll, 69 percent in Milwaukee County supported an unspecified raise. The margin of error there was 6.2 percent. And here’s the key finding: Among Milwaukee County respondents, the March UWM poll found that 56 percent of registered voters would support a state minimum wage of $10.10, according to Cera. The margin of error is large (11.6 percent), however, due to a small sample size. That result mirrors the statewide picture. In the March UWM poll, 57 percent supported $10.10 when asked specifically about that amount. We found two polling questions that asked about increases in the minimum wage within certain ranges. In June, the UWM survey asked an open-ended question asking what the minimum wage should be. The answers were reported in 25-cent groupings. Among Milwaukee County respondents, the single most common was in the $9.76-$10.00 range; the median response for Milwaukee County fell in the $9.26-$9.50 range. Here’s the breakdown for Milwaukee County: -- 44.5 percent said $9.76-10.01, or higher (including 17.1 percent over $11.00) -- 35.4 percent said $8.01 to $9.75 -- 6.9 percent said $7.26 to $8.00 --12.6 percent said $7.25 or less A January MU poll showed a similar result for Milwaukee County: 49 percent want an increase of about $10 or more. While those results show a big majority for a sizeable boost in the wage, they don’t suggest a majority for $10.10. How is it that 56 percent supported $10.10 in one UWM poll, but in another UWM poll and in the MU poll, when asked to pick the ideal increase, less than 50 percent chose the $10 or higher range? Cera wasn’t surprised at the apparent contradiction. Many of those who ideally would want an increase to something less than $10.10 still back $10.10 when that is the only option presented, Cera said. That, of course, is the situation in the referendum question, so the March UWM poll result is instructive, Cera said. Cera told us that as a statistician, his conclusion is that it’s very likely a majority of Milwaukee County voters would support $10.10. He offered an additional caveat beyond the large margin of error: A referendum is not a survey. Election turnout can vary depending on the intensity of races on the ballot. It can also skew to wealthier residents, who might be less inclined to favor a large bump in the wage. That could slightly bring down the numbers in favor of $10.10 when voters cast ballots on the question, Cera said. Our rating Abele said a statewide poll showing 76% support for a minimum wage hike is a "strong indicator," along with other surveys, of deep public support in Milwaukee County for a $10.10 wage. The poll number he cites is out of context because it’s a statewide result and didn’t refer specifically to $10.10. If given a choice to set the wage wherever they want it, a majority might not back $10.10, two polls of county residents show. But there’s some survey evidence that in a referendum specifically on $10.10, a solid majority in Milwaukee County would back that idea. Foolproof conclusions can’t be drawn because of the small size of the sample at the county level. On balance, we rate Abele’s claim Half True.

pomt-10454	Obama thinks the national anthem should be "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/30/chain-email/obama-e-mail-its-not-the-real-thing/	(Published April 30, 2008) Opponents of Barack Obama seem to have found a new reason to dislike him: he wants the national anthem to be an old Coca-Cola jingle. Well, not really, but that's the rumor that's going around. Although it seems ridiculous on its face, we heard from enough PolitFact readers who wondered if it was true that we decided to do a little digging. What we found was another example of satire being mistaken for the truth. A widely circulated chain e-mail attributes the following quote to Barack Obama: "As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides," Obama said. "There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all? It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.' If that were our anthem, then I might salute it." (You can read the full text of the e-mail here .) But Obama never said it. It's satire written by syndicated columnist John Semmens, whose columns are posted on the Web site The Arizona Conservative. The above quote was part of a short item Semmens wrote in October 2007, imagining a rationale for the oft-emailed photo of Obama not having his hand over his heart during the national anthem . ( We wrote about the anthem issue previously here, which was part of a chain email falsely claiming Obama refused to say the pledge of allegiance .) The song "I'd like to teach the world to sing," ought to be a tip-off that the email isn't for real, but credibility can get pretty elastic in the Internet age. The song actually started as a TV jingle for Coca-Cola commercials during the 1970s. They lyrics are: I'd like to buy the world a home and furnish it with love, Grow apple trees and honey bees, and snow white turtle doves. I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, I'd like to buy the world a Coke and keep it company. It's the real thing, Coke is what the world wants today. The song first appeared in a Coke ad called "Hilltop" that aired in 1971, and again in a Christmas ad aired in 1978. The jingle was so popular that eventually it was re-written to omit the Coke references, and versions were recorded by the musical groups the Hillside Singers and the New Seekers. The copies of the email we've collected have a familiar trick: They claim to be forwarded from a retired military officer. But the unattributed quote is clearly taken from Semmens' column. This is not the first time a conservative commentator's make-believe quote has been attributed to Obama in emails as if he really said it. In February, we reviewed this one, in which Obama was supposed to have said he liked America but wanted to change it. We asked Semmens what he thought about his work taking on a new life on the Internet. "The quotes are a creative take on possible unexplained rationales for public actions," he wrote in an email to us. "They are not actual recountings of what Sen. Obama has publicly said. Whether they do or don't reveal an inner truth is a matter of opinion." A spokesman for the Obama campaign called the chain email "clearly false." We call it Pants on Fire!

pomt-12181	California and New York are "the two biggest polluting states in the country."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/jul/28/chris-sununu/nh-governor-calls-new-york-california-biggest-poll/	Gov. Chris Sununu says he’s proud of his state’s record of environmental stewardship. The Republican says New Hampshire will take care of its natural resources with or without a demand from Paris or Washington, D.C. When he was asked whether he’d sign onto the United States Climate Alliance – a state-level agreement to uphold the objectives of the Paris climate accord developed after the U.S. withdrew from the latter – he bristled. In an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio, Sununu said the climate alliance is "quasi-meaningless" and "more of just a political statement than anything." He specifically called out its founders, the governors of California and New York, saying their motive in championing the U.S. Climate Alliance was to distract from their states’ shortcomings. "That piece of paper that folks wanted me to sign – think about where it came from," Sununu told the public radio station. "It came from the governors of New York and California, the two biggest polluting states in the country." PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to take a closer look at the biggest polluting states in the country. Clarifying the statement Sununu made the statement in response to a listener’s question about climate change and the Paris accord, which suggests that his "biggest polluting states" remark was a reference to carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. But he also discussed other types of pollution. Before he was the CEO of a ski mountain or the governor, Sununu received a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in civil and environmental engineering and worked as an environmental engineer cleaning up waste sites. He said he brings "more environmental experience to the governor’s office than any governor in the history of the state." His work cleaning up hazardous waste sites in California showed him first-hand, he said, "It’s deplorable what they’ve done in parts of that state – or New York up in some of those rivers." So what exactly is the measure he’s using to define the "biggest polluting states?" Carbon dioxide? Greenhouse gases in general? Other air pollutants? Water pollutants? We asked his press secretary, Ben Vihstadt, for data to support the claim. Vihstadt cited a study by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Energy, that specifically looks at energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The data The study that Vihstadt cited shows state-by-state data collected as recently as 2014. In his email, he softened the governor’s original claim, saying instead that the study showed California and New York "are two of the top polluting states in the country" – not the top two. With its 642 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2014, Texas is head and shoulders above the rest of the country. It was responsible for 11.9 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions covered in the study. And Texas had nothing at all to do with the Climate Alliance letter. California, one of our subjects, comes in at No. 2 with 358 million tons, or 6.6 percent of the total. New York is No. 9 with 170 million tons, or 3.1 percent. By comparison, New Hampshire is 46th on this list, with a measly 15 million tons that represent less than 0.3 percent of the total. It’s worth noting that California and New York have been effectively reducing their carbon dioxide emissions over time, according to the EIA study. Texas’s annual emissions are 14 percent higher than they were in 1990, but California and New York each emitted lower amounts of carbon dioxide in 2014 than they did in 1990. New York’s 2014 emissions were 21 percent lower than the state’s 2004 peak. So both the states we’re investigating are near the top on this scale. But we reached out to a handful of researchers and professors in environmental science who urged us to consider the question in other ways. "In general, California and New York are among the largest states, so the absolute numbers will be large for them," said Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist for the MIT Energy Initiative and MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. Brian Soden, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami, suggested analyzing carbon dioxide emissions per capita or per gross domestic product to equalize population and production differences between states. Per capita The same Energy Information Administration study also breaks down the data on a per-capita basis, as the scientists recommended. In this view, California and New York – the first and third most populous states – are at the complete other end of the spectrum. Of the 51 states, including Washington, D.C., California and New York have the second and third lowest per-capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The EIA study notes: "Many factors contribute to variation in the amount of emissions per capita, including climate, the structure of the state economy, population density, energy sources, building standards and explicit state policies to reduce emissions." Wyoming earns its No. 1 per-capita rank by being the least populous state and the second-largest energy producer, the EIA study says. New York, on the other hand, had fewer than one-tenth the carbon dioxide emissions per-capita compared with Wyoming. "A large portion of the population is located in the New York City metropolitan area where mass transit is readily available and most residences are multi-family units that provide efficiencies of scale in terms of energy for heating and cooling. The New York economy is oriented towards low-energy-consuming activities such as financial markets," the study says, adding, "New York's energy prices are relatively high ... which in turn encourages energy savings." In addition to being low carbon dioxide emitters per capita, California and New York are also among the lowest carbon dioxide emitters relative to gross domestic product. New Hampshire, by comparison, is the 12th lowest emitter on a per-capita basis and 11th lowest relative to GDP. Our ruling Sununu said California and New York are "the two biggest polluting states in the country." His press secretary tried to soften the claim, but no matter how you look at it, that’s not accurate. In terms of absolute carbon dioxide emissions, California and New York rank No. 2 and No. 9. Texas is No. 1. Adjusting for population and GDP, California and New York are actually among the most effective states at reducing their impact on the atmosphere – beating even Sununu’s home state of New Hampshire. It turns out, Sununu was just blowing smoke. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Chris Sununu	None	None	None	2017-07-28T15:38:59	2017-07-10	['California', 'New_York_City']
pomt-03609	On support for gay marriage	full flop	/florida/statements/2013/may/09/charlie-crist/after-voting-ban-crist-now-backs-gay-marriage/	Charlie Crist, Florida’s once (and future?) governor, posted a note on his Facebook page congratulating two states for legalizing gay marriage. "Some great news: On Tuesday, Delaware became the 11th state to allow marriage equality. And just a few days ago, Rhode Island adopted a similar measure, which followed victories last fall in Maine, Maryland and Washington. I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here," he posted on Facebook on May 8, 2013. That doesn’t sound like the Crist we’ve always known. He’s a former Republican who turned independent who turned Democrat. He backed John McCain in the 2008 presidential contest but last year endorsed Barack Obama’s re-election. In other words, flip-flopping is in his past. At PolitiFact, we put politicians’ consistency on issues on our Flip-O-Meter, rating them from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gaging whether they did. So what’s the history of Crist’s position on same-sex marriage? Crist, who is believed to be planning another run for governor in his new party, "most certainly" supports it now. Let’s see whether he always has. 2006 governor’s race Back when Crist was a "Ronald Reagan Republican," he led a field of GOP candidates vying to be governor. (He went on to win.) During that race, an effort was gaining steam to put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot defining marriage as a union between "only one man and one woman." Early in the campaign, Crist said he thought such an amendment was unnecessary because state law already forbids gay marriage. But as the primary rolled on, Crist signed the petition for the ballot initiative and sent mailers declaring his support for traditional marriage. By the time the measure went to voters in 2008, Crist was a popular governor whose more socially conservative election opponents were in his rear-view mirror. Crist made it clear he wouldn’t stump for the cause. "It's not an issue that moves me," he said in late 2007, when it was clear the effort had enough signatures to get on the ballot. "I'm just a live and let live kind of guy." And yet... On Election Day 2008, Crist supported the ban. "I voted for it," he said. "It's what I believe in." The measure passed with 62 percent of the vote. 2010 Senate run When one of Florida’s U.S. senators decided not to seek re-election, Crist, who probably would have cruised to re-election as governor, pounced on the Washington opportunity. He ended up in a bare-knuckles battle that forced him to leave the Republican Party and run as an independent. He lost to Republican Marco Rubio. During that campaign, he released a position paper on issues affecting gays and lesbians. There, he declared support for civil unions that "provide the full range of legal protections" including "access to a loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights, the fundamental things people need to take care of their families." He also expressed support for anti-discrimination laws that protect gay people, repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell in the military and gay adoption. He did not mention same-sex marriage in the statement. 2014 run for ... ? Crist’s exuberant Facebook post, which looks forward to "the day it happens" in Florida, certainly isn’t unique among Democrats this year. Notably, Florida’s Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson recently pledged his support for gay marriage. And Crist, as a newly minted Democrat, has been under pressure from advocates for gay rights to "come to amends with LGBT Floridians." Our ruling We’re considering whether Crist has flip-flopped on his position on gay marriage. Looking back through his political career in Florida, we found that Crist’s opinion has traversed the spectrum. As a Republican gubernatorial candidate in 2006, Crist signed a petition to help get a gay marriage ban on the Florida ballot and said he supported "traditional marriage." While governor, he appeared to soften on the subject, saying he was a "live and let live" kind of person. But he voted for the ban nonetheless. As a Senate candidate, he stopped short of endorsing gay marriage, saying he supported civil unions that afforded the legal benefits of marriage. Now, out of office but potentially eyeing a comeback, Crist has made his flip-flop complete, offering full-throated support for gay marriage. That’s what we call a Full Flop.

pomt-00882	Says Hillary Clinton "sent a memo" to all State Department staff that said "you should not do State Department business on personal email."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/10/joe-scarborough/scarborough-clinton-told-state-department-staff-no/	The furor over Hillary Clinton’s emails during her time as secretary of state has only grown since the New York Times reported she used a personal account for official business. At a press conference at the United Nations March 10, 2015, Clinton said she wished she had handled her email differently but that she complied with federal rules. Clinton’s office has turned over more than 55,000 pages of emails and documents to the State Department for review and ultimately some type of public release. Meanwhile, details on those government rules concerning email continue to emerge. Joe Scarborough latched on to one recent disclosure -- a 2011 State Department memo that went out under Clinton’s name. "She sent out a memo that says ... you should not do State Department business on personal email," Scarborough said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on March, 9, 2015. "She sent that memo out to every employee at the State Department." For this fact-check, we wanted to dig into the details of Scarborough’s claim that Clinton sent this sort of memo across the entire department. Scarborough’s staff sent us links to several articles. Fox News posted the actual memo dated June 28, 2011. It was sent to diplomatic and consular staff worldwide in response to a warning from Google that hackers had targeted the Gmail addresses of government workers. It began with "Department of State users are encouraged to check the security settings and change passwords on their home email accounts because of recent targeting of personal email accounts by online adversaries." Under the heading "What can you and your family members do?" the memo covered such familiar steps as changing your password and making sure you choose a strong one. It also said, "Avoid conducting official Department business from your personal email accounts." This memo had a bit of history. In 2005, a department manual covered transmitting information that is "sensitive but unclassified." That is a broad category that covers anything from meeting schedules, to visa applications, to ordinary emails to other federal agencies. The manual basically said that department-related email should go through servers authorized by the department. As a point of reference, we don’t know if the State Department had signed off on the private server that carried Clinton’s emails (she didn’t use Gmail or Yahoo! or another commercial provider) or if the server met government security standards. Caveats to Scarborough’s claim Scarborough twice said Clinton sent the memo, which ascribes a more personal touch than was actually the case. In the strictest literal sense, Clinton neither wrote nor sent the memo in question. In a March 6 briefing, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said this was a routine memo, or cable. "Her name is at the bottom of the cable, as is practice for cables coming from Washington," Harf said. "Some people think she wrote it -- which is not accurate." Steven Aftergood directs the project on government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, a group that promotes transparency in government. "It seems unlikely that the secretary of state would have written or even seen this kind of housekeeping memo," Aftergood told PunditFact. "Still, it went out over her name and she is in some sense responsible for it," he said. Scarborough also summarized the memo as saying "you should not do State Department business on personal email." That is a bit off target. There’s a difference between a guideline and a requirement. The memo itself makes the distinction, Aftergood said. In the list of things staffers can do, the final point used stronger language. It said, "Do not auto-forward department email to personal email accounts, which is prohibited by department policy." "It's interesting that the memo says that employees should ‘avoid’ conducting official business via personal email, but it says that auto-forwarding department email to a private account is ‘prohibited’," Aftergood said. "The clear implication is that use of personal email for conducting official business is discouraged, but not strictly prohibited." In that light, Scarborough's term "should" goes a little further than the memo. Security vs. retaining records Clinton was secretary of state before there was a law that would have required her to use a government email address or share copies of her communications with the government. That came in 2014. Two significant topics remain unresolved. First, it would make a difference if any of her emails contain classified information. We don’t know if they do. Second, there is a long-standing state department policy on using email for sensitive but unclassified information. That policy speaks to the need to send email through a server that meets department standards. At her U.N. press conference, Clinton said the server she used was set up for former President Bill Clinton’s office and that it had "numerous safeguards." That said, we don’t know the security protections in place on that server. If that server passed muster by government standards, security would not be as important as concerns over retaining official records and ensuring full access to Clinton’s emails during her time as secretary. Our ruling Scarborough said that Clinton sent a memo to State Department staff that said they should not use personal email accounts for department business. Scarborough pushed a bit too far on two points. Clinton had no direct role in sending the memo, even though it went out under her name. And while the memo encouraged staffers to avoid using personal email accounts, it fell short of prohibiting their use. These points diminish the accuracy of Scarborough’s statement, but not critically. We rate the claim Mostly True. Update: We’ve added some additional context provided by Clinton at her March 10, 2015, U.N. press conference.

pomt-08589	State government spending will be increase 10.7 percent this year.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/24/john-kasich/john-kasich-accuses-strickland-administration-rais/	Ohios first gubernatorial debate of the campaign season focused heavily on the state budget and which candidate would best manage it. Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat, said he has been prudent with the states money, cutting taxes and spending for the current two-year cycle. Republican challenger John Kasich, however, repeatedly declared that the current budget actually increased spending by 10.7 percent this year. The charge prompted Strickland to call for the fact checkers to examine Kasichs statement. PolitiFact Ohio couldn't pass up the invitation. When lawmakers and wonks around Capitol Square talk about the state budget, they are almost always referring to the general revenue fund budget, or the GRF, which contains virtually all of Ohios tax revenues. The GRF is on pace to be $50.6 billion for the 2010-11 fiscal years, according to state spending reports available through mid-July. Thats down from $52.5 billion for the 2008-09 budget, a reduction of about $1.9 billion. So Strickland is correct when he says spending is down. Kasich, however, instead was talking about the states all-funds budget, which includes the use of billions in federal stimulus dollars outside the GRF. The all-funds budget is estimated at $112.3 billion in the current budget, up from $102.1 billion in 2008-09. Thats an increase of about 9.9 percent from Stricklands first budget to his second budget. The all-funds budget also includes general revenue fund money, billions in pass-through money for state and local governments such as the piggy-back sales tax that counties are allowed to add to the state tab plus state and federal fees that are slated for specific programs. The all-funds budget also includes some double-counting, as money is shifted within line items in a state agency. So how does Kasich get to that 10.7 percent figure? With an apples to oranges comparison. He uses actual all-funds spending in 2010 compared to projected all-funds spending in the 2011 fiscal year, which is only about three months old right now. The state did not spend $3.3 billion that was appropriated for use in fischal 2010. But by using actual spending for that year, Kasich's comparison actual makes that count against the administration because it inflates the percentage greatly. While Strickland says thats an inaccurate and misleading way to look at the budget, Republicans argue that the all-funds budget is becoming more relevant because the GRF is shrinking, representing about 54 percent of the entire budget a decade ago and about 45 percent in the current fiscal year. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, for example, was moved from the GRF budget to the all-funds budget under Gov. Bob Taft. Strickland chose to move the Department of Public Safety and the Department of Commerce completely out of the GRF budget during the most recent budget. And the current all-funds budget does include several new fees attached to it, including a new hospital assessment fee worth $708 million and $390 million worth of new nursing home franchise fees. So let's cut to the chase: Kasich is picking something other than the usual budget figures by choosing an all-funds number to make his claim. And by comparing actual spending in 2010 to proposed spending in 2011, he gets a result that punishes the Strickland administration for doing what taxpayers want -- not spending $3.3 billion that had been allotted for 2010.

pomt-07749	"We don’t have bars on campus in Texas. It’s against the law... no alcohol allowed."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/feb/26/jeff-wentworth/state-sen-jeff-wentworth-says-texas-universities-d/	State Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, played hardball with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews last week, when the pair scuffled over whether suds are allowed on college campuses. Wentworth, discussing his legislation that would allow concealed handguns on college campuses, balked when Matthews wondered whether "booze and guns" are a healthy combination. "We don’t have bars on campus in Texas," Wentworth said on the Feb. 22 segment. Matthews: "You don’t?" Wentworth: "It’s against the law in Texas. That’s exactly right." Matthews: "It is?" Wentworth: "Yes, sir. No alcohol allowed." Wentworth went on to clarify that he was limiting his characterization to public colleges and universities. When Matthews said he knew a lot of colleges that have campus bars, Wentworth said: "They don’t in Texas. We’re talking about Texas." We decided to check whether bars and alcohol are allowed on college campuses in Texas. When we asked Wentworth for backup, he pointed us to a section in the state’s Alcoholic Beverage Code about alcohol sales near schools. According to the code, a county commissioners court or the governing body of an incorporated city or town can prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within 300 of a private or public school or within 1,000 feet of a public school at the school district’s request. Carolyn Beck, a spokeswoman for the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, told us that the code doesn’t specifically define "public school" so "there are some cities that interpret schools to include colleges and universities." The Alcoholic Beverage Code also cites a section of the Education Code, which requires a school district’s board of trustees to prohibit alcoholic beverages at "school-related or school-sanctioned activity on or off private property." Yet Andy Kesling, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, told us that the words "school district" in the Education Code indicate that the provision is limited to public schools through high school. Debbie Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, later agreed that the law does not apply to higher education. Next, we contacted some Texas universities to gauge whether they have campus bars. Rhonda Weldon, a spokeswoman for the University of Texas at Austin, told us the university’s Texas Union building houses both the Cactus Cafe, which has a liquor license, and the Underground, which is licensed to serve beer and wine. She said other campus venues where alcohol can be served, such as the Frank Erwin Center and the AT&T Executive and Education Conference Center, are run by contractors who are licensed to sell alcohol. Wentworth called UT-Austin an exception. He said too that alcohol was prohibited on campus when he attended the Texas Tech University School of Law. Wentworth earned his law degree there in 1971. Texas Tech spokesman Chris Cook confirmed that students aren’t allowed to have alcohol on campus and no campus establishments serve alcohol. But, Cook said, alcohol is sold in suites and club areas where university donors often sit in the football stadium and basketball arena, and is available during special events, such as receptions. Next we tried Wentworth’s undergraduate alma mater, Texas A&M University. Spokesman Jason Cook said: "We don’t have bars on campus, in the common term, but alcohol is allowed on campus and is served on campus under special circumstances." The University Club, a campus dining facility, hosts a happy hour; the 21-and-older crowd can enjoy a $2 scotch or $3 sangria, among drink specials, from 4-7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, according to A&M’s web page about the club. Cook said too that the Zone Club, an exclusive seating area in the football stadium, serves alcohol. According to A&M’s athletic department’s website, the Club includes a full-service bar. In San Marcos,Texas State University spokesman Jayme Blaschke told us that George’s, in the student center, serves beer. When we asked whether George’s is a bar, he said it’s "an establishment that serves alcohol" that isn’t a full-service restaurant. Next, we looked north, learning that The Pub on the University of Texas at Dallas campus serves wine and beer during certain hours Monday through Friday — with a limit of two drinks per person, according to the university’s website. John Walls, a UT-Dallas spokesman, said the university doesn’t consider The Pub to be a bar because it has a full food menu. Lastly, we looked for a legal definition of a bar. Beck told us that as far as she knows, none exists in state law. For what it’s worth, the online Merriam-Webster dictionary slaps the "bar" label on "a counter at which food or especially alcoholic beverages are served." Time to close our tab. We found two Texas universities that have bars on campus while other schools we contacted routinely serve alcohol in campus facilities. Wentworth’s claim appears to have no legal or on-the-town grounding. It’s not just wrong — it’s Pants on Fire.	None	Jeff Wentworth	None	None	None	2011-02-26T06:00:00	2011-02-22	['Texas']
pomt-11458	"Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a (firearm) registry."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/mar/08/perry-thurston/does-florida-prohibit-gun-registry-law-yes/	In the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, a Florida senator called for the reversal of a key restriction in current law over gun purchases. Florida's ban on a statewide gun registry "leaves law enforcement in the dark" as they try to figure out if a threatening person has a weapon or not, said Sen. Perry Thurston, D-Fort Lauderdale. "Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a registry," Thurston said at Senate Rules Committee meeting where members discussed a school security and gun safety bill. PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into his statement. Florida law does prohibit a firearm registry, based on Florida Statute 790.335: "No state governmental agency or local government, special district, or other political subdivision or official, agent, or employee of such state or other governmental entity or any other person, public or private, shall knowingly and willfully keep or cause to be kept any list, record, or registry of privately owned firearms or any list, record, or registry of the owners of those firearms." The rule was added in 2004 when former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush signed HB 155 into law. Then-Rep. Lindsay Harrington, R-Punta Gorda, sponsored the bill because of concerns from the National Rifle Association, according to a July 2004 St. Petersburg Times (now Tampa Bay Times) article. The story said Harrington was troubled when he heard that law enforcement agencies were collecting data on gun transactions at pawn shops, saying "I don't think we, in America, want that type of thing." The law echoes this concern. It says such a registry could "become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm." The statute also says if a registry fell into the wrong hands it could be a "shopping list" for criminals. The rollout of the law, however, was a bit shaky the summer after it passed. Spokesmen for law enforcement agencies in Tampa Bay told the Times they had many questions about the broad ban on any "list, record or registry," and said they may need to hire additional workers to go through various paper and electronic records for deletion. The law required agencies to delete electronic data of pawnshop sales within 60 days, which could also make searches for gun information more onerous. "It's a mess," Sherman Smith, the St. Petersburg Police Department's legal adviser, told the Times. "This has really got me flummoxed." There are exceptions to the gun records ban. Records can be kept on firearms used in a crime or people who have been convicted of crimes. Aaron Keller, a Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services spokesperson, wrote in an email these records would likely be kept by local law enforcement. Even in cases where firearm records are kept by dealers, those records are prohibited from being compiled into any list by any state employee or private person, according to the statute. So how does Florida’s ban on private firearm records compare to the rest of the country? A Thurston spokeswoman said his information came from the Giffords Law Center. The center, which supports gun restrictions, says seven states, including Florida, prohibit any registry of private firearms. The seven states are Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Vermont. Pennsylvania prohibits registries of long guns. Only one state, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia require registration of all firearms. Our ruling Thurston said, "Florida is one of only 10 states that totally prohibit a registry." Florida law does explicitly say a registry of firearm purchases cannot be maintained. Thurston was close but not precise about the number of other states that prohibit registries. It’s seven, not 10. We rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Perry Thurston	None	None	None	2018-03-08T12:06:10	2018-02-26	['None']
pomt-04564	Says Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/26/afscme/afscme-says-thompson-backs-big-tax-cuts-companies-/	Employment boomed in Wisconsin during Tommy Thompson’s 14 years as governor, ending in early 2001. But as the Republican tries a political comeback in his bid for the U.S. Senate, his opponents want voters to look at Thompson’s post-gubernatorial career when evaluating his job-creation proposals. That’s the focus of a TV ad funded by the political arm of AFSCME, a major public-sector labor union. It features an animated bobble-head motif. "Tommy Thompson’s changed all right," the ad says, making a series of allegations after a short video snippet. Among them: "Tommy even went to work for companies that ship American jobs overseas," the spot says, showing a smiling "Thompson" shoving a boatload of jobs off shore from the California coast. The ad’s kicker: "Now Thompson supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." AFSCME wouldn’t talk to us about the ad. But the spot cites two pieces of evidence in the footnotes to support the claim that Thompson "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." That’s the claim we’ll evaluate here. One is Thompson’s speech at the GOP state convention on May 12, 2012. The other is a March 22, 2012, analysis by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice of the budget plan pushed by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan. Let’s start with the Ryan budget plan, which has received greater scrutiny since Mitt Romney elevated Ryan to the GOP presidential ticket. In analyzing Ryan’s budget, Citizens for Tax Justice touches on two issues that, as best we can tell, AFSCME is relying on to back up the ad. Ryan, the group notes in its analysis, wants to cut the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, and exempt the offshore profits of multinational American corporations from the income tax. (Romney does too.) This, the group contends, would "increase the existing incentives for U.S. corporations to move their operations offshore or use accounting gimmicks to make their U.S. profits appear to be ‘foreign’ profits generated in offshore tax havens." OK. But what does this have to do with Tommy Thompson? In the May 2012 convention speech cited by the ad, Thompson endorsed Ryan’s budget plan as a whole, unequivocally. That plan does contain those tax proposals. "I will pass Paul Ryan’s budget plan in the U.S. Senate," he said. "It is the right plan, at the right time, for America." Let’s take a closer look at AFSCME’s claim. First, the terminology in the ad needs clarification. The AFSCME ad depicts cartoon Tommy as supporting tax cuts for "outsourcers" in Wisconsin. But, the Citizens for Tax Justice report makes no mention of "outsourcing." The group’s report focuses on "offshoring," which the National Academy of Public Administration defined as "U.S. firms shifting service and manufacturing activities abroad to unaffiliated firms or their own affiliates." "Outsourcing" can involve offshoring, but it often refers to firms contracting out service and manufacturing activities to unaffiliated firms in the United States, according to the academy. The two terms, we should note, are sometimes used interchangeably despite the key differences. We asked academic experts about the potential effect of exempting offshore profits from taxation, an approach known as "territorial" taxation. We found little dispute of the increased incentive to move jobs overseas under a territorial system, but a very unsettled debate over the ultimate effect on jobs of such a change. A scholar cited by Citizens for Tax Justice, James Repetti, professor at Boston College Law School, is in the camp that believes more production will move overseas, but said that the real-world impact of such a change is very hard to predict. William McBride, chief economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, cites studies to show that investment abroad is associated with investment domestically. "So it is not a zero-sum game, it is additional growth, and some of the benefits come back to the U.S. in the form of dividends and high-paying management and R&D jobs, for instance," McBride told us in an email. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have cited a July 2012 study by Reed College economist Kimberly Clausing. She calculated that low-tax countries would gain 800,000 jobs under the incentives in a "territorial" tax system. (Clausing noted the number would fall if the U.S. corporate tax rate was cut -- as Ryan has proposed -- and that in a good economy, jobs abroad need not displace jobs at home). At the same time, a bipartisan commission appointed by Obama recommended a territorial tax system in 2010. "The U.S. is one of the only industrialized countries with a hybrid system of taxing active foreign-source income. The current system puts U.S. corporations at a competitive disadvantage against their foreign competitors," said the report of the commission popularly known as Simpson-Bowles. Overall, we found no dispute that the tax rewards from a rate cut and exemption of offshore profits could be very significant for corporations. Currently, companies can defer taxation until returning those profits to the United States -- and studies estimate those profits at more than $1 trillion. That approach has been criticized as providing a disincentive for firms to bring profits back home. Firms, as Ryan’s plan notes, have to pay foreign taxes on income earned abroad, then U.S. taxes when they "repatriate" those profits -- bring them back home. There’s a final factor here. Thompson has put forward his own specific proposal on corporate taxation, as part of his "Restore America" plan. He says it’s his attempt to address the "perverse incentives that cause companies to reinvest foreign profits oversees (sic) rather than repatriating those profits." His campaign declined to discuss it, but Thompson’s plan calls for a permanent tax break on profits "repatriated" to the U.S. He wants zero taxation on those profits -- a lower rate than in some similar plans by conservatives -- but attaches the condition that they must be used for investment in plant and equipment, job training or research and development. Thompson’s plan pertains to future profits -- but he also wants to encourage companies to repatriate, at zero taxation, that $1 trillion in foreign profits that have built up over time. The impact of that approach is uncertain, but Thompson is in the camp that believes injecting some of that money back into the U.S. would create jobs back home. Our rating AFSCME contends that Thompson "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." Despite the confusing use of "outsourcing," the claim is partly on target, in that Thompson would completely exempt from taxation U.S. companies’ profits from overseas operations under certain conditions. There are two important caveats here. Researchers differ on whether U.S. employment would decline under this "territorial" tax approach, with some arguing that businesses would invest more at home as a result of the tax break. And part of Thompson’s plan provides incentives that could convince companies to bring profits back home. This rates a Half True.

pomt-02756	"Oregon leads the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/13/econorthwest-economics-finance-planning/does-oregon-lead-nation-number-jobs-capita-manufac/	It’s been nearly six years since the start of the Great Recession and, finally, hiring is on the rise. But with more Oregonians living in poverty now than before the bottom dropped out, politicians around the state are debating how best to create new jobs. Talk of jobs was on everyone’s mind at the 10th annual Oregon Leadership Summit Dec. 9 at the Oregon Convention Center. The Oregon Business Plan -- a collaborative effort involving business leaders, business associations and the state’s elected leaders -- commissioned a paper called "Path to Prosperity," which was released at the daylong session’s opening. The paper, written by ECONorthwest, an economic consulting and planning firm, focused on four strategies aimed at reducing poverty. One, touching on the need to bolster manufacturing, included this statement: "Oregon leads the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing." It’s an impressive claim but seemed at odds with a 2012 finding by PolitiFact Wisconsin, which awarded that same honor to the Badger State. In hopes of heading off any inter-state squabbling, PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called Josh Lehner, a senior economist with the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. "I saw that, too," he said. "Let me check some numbers and I’ll call you back." Lehner’s own calculation took Oregon’s annual Census Bureau population estimates and divided them by the number of manufacturing jobs in Oregon, as represented by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Things did not compute. "Our manufacturing jobs per capita actually rank 22nd nationally,’’ Lehner said. He said he respects work done by ECONorthwest, but added, "As for us being number one in that category, the math just doesn’t add up." (Asked about Wisconsin, he said his figures show that state does, in fact, lead the country in manufacturing jobs per capita.) We called John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest and co-author of the paper, to ask about the apparent discrepancy. He immediately cleared up any confusion. "You caught a flaw in our report," he said. "In the same way newspapers have to run corrections sometimes, we need to run one with this." Two words, Tapogna added, turned the claim from true to false. "We said Oregon leads the nation in the number of jobs per capita in manufacturing," he said. "What we should have said is that Oregon leads the nation in manufacturing output per capita. It was just a mistake. There’s no other way to say it." Lehner verified that Oregon does indeed lead in manufacturing output per capita. Tapogna went on to provide information with which many Oregonians may be unaware. It all started, he said, with Gordon Moore, Intel’s co-founder, who predicted in 1965 that semiconductor industry innovations would enable twice as many transistors to be crammed onto an integrated circuit every two years or so. Known as "Moore’s Law," the prediction has proved true. In the real world, it’s continued to dramatically increase the value of the output, thus allowing Oregon to rank first nationally in manufacturing output per capita. David Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added a cautionary note in an email. "Not all manufacturing jobs are great jobs, and certainly not all great jobs are manufacturing jobs. But if Wisconsin or Oregon have manufacturing industries in which they have the skills, expertise and productivity needed to compete on the national and international market, that’s a valuable thing -- something many states would surely like to emulate." The Oregon Business Plan, in aiming to reduce the state’s poverty rate from the current 17.2 percent to 10 percent by 2020, makes job creation a centerpiece of pursuing that goal. Public- and private-sector leaders, at last week’s Oregon Leadership Summit, said building on existing strengths such as manufacturing will be critical to long-term success. ECONorthwest, in preparing a paper delineating that success, wrote that "Oregon leads the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing." The sentence needed to be rewritten to say the state leads the nation in manufacturing output per capita. That would have made the claim true. But regardless of the correction that followed, PolitiFact Oregon makes its rulings based on original claims. Not to detract from the success Oregon is having in semiconductor manufacturing, but we rate the original claim False.	None	ECONorthwest	None	None	None	2013-12-13T17:44:02	2013-12-09	['None']
pomt-04965	The health care law includes "a 3.8% sales tax" on "all real estate transactions."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/25/chain-email/3-8-percent-tax-real-estate-transactions-health-ca/	Did you get the chain email that claims the health care law will institute a new tax on home sales? Here’s the email many readers have forwarded to us: "Under the new health care bill — did you know that all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax? The bulk of these new taxes don’t kick in until 2013 (presumably after Obama’s re-election). You can thank Nancy, Harry and Barack and your local Democrat Congressman for this one. If you sell your $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Is this Hope & Change great or what? … "Oh, you weren’t aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren’t alone. There are more than a few members of Congress that aren’t aware of it either (result of clandestine midnight voting for huge bills they’ve never read). AND, there are a few other surprises lurking." The email’s claims are wrong, but that hasn’t stopped people from pressing the forward button. We’ve received copies of this email regularly since 2010. We’ve debunked it before, but since it’s still out there, we’re going to review the facts again now. The distortion sprouted from Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled "Unearned income Medicare contribution." Legislative wonks might remember that this was the second part of the health care bill, passed via reconciliation so that it only required 50 votes. Democrats had to do it that way after they lost their 60-seat majority due to a special election for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. It is a new tax, but it’s not on real estate transactions. Let us explain. Right now, workers pay Medicare hospital taxes on wages. Workers and employers split a 2.9 percent tax; the self-employed pay all of it. The health care law imposes a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income, but it only applies to couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000. That investment income could include the profits from real estate transactions. But it would only apply to those high earners, who make up less than 5 percent of all taxpayers. The new tax marks the first time investment income will be subject to Medicare taxes, said Clint Stretch, the managing principal for tax policy at Deloitte Tax LLP, when we asked him about in 2010. We should point out that the government currently taxes investment income in various ways and could have simply raised current rates. But lawmakers wanted to link the new revenues to health care, Stretch said. "The point of doing it as a Medicare tax was to have the money go to the Medicare trust fund and have it act like a tax that is paying for health care. So there is additional complexity," he said. We’re not sure why the email extrapolates this tax to all real estate transactions, but that’s the only 3.8 percent tax we could find in the new law. We ran this by two tax policy experts who confirmed our analysis. If you’re an empty-nester of any means, and you’re thinking of downsizing, part of your profits are already tax-free thanks to long-standing tax exemptions on the profits from home sales. In general, if you sell your own home, individuals are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit and married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit. Again, that’s profit, not the sales price. If you’re wealthy and sell your home at a substantial profit, it’s possible you might get hit with the new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Most Americans won’t have to worry about this, though. The chain email doesn’t acknowledge any of those pesky facts. It says that a 3.8 percent tax applies to all real estate transactions as a sales tax. That is not the case. The email seems intended to scare people, particularly older Americans thinking of downsizing. For that, we award this chain email a Pants on Fire!

pomt-07261	"Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. . . .taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/26/sergio-marchionne/ceo-says-chrysler-group-now-square-american-taxpay/	In an announcement reminiscent of one made by GM around this time last year, Chrysler Group LLC boasted this week that it had paid back money lent to it by the American government, with interest, six years ahead of schedule. President Barack Obama, who is expected to highlight the milestone in a visit to a Toledo, Ohio, Chrysler plant on June 3, called the repayment "a significant milestone for the turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and families who rely on the American auto industry." He and other Democrats adopted an I-told-you-so stance, with some Democrats taking the opportunity to remind the public that many Republicans opposed the auto bailouts. In a press release from Chrysler Group LLC announcing the loan repayment, the company's Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne stated, "Less than two years ago, we made a commitment to repay the U.S. and Canadian taxpayers in full, and today we made good on that promise." For this item, we're going to focus on whether the company repaid U.S. taxpayers. Chrysler Group LLC repaid $5.1 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loans and formally terminated its ability to draw from a remaining $2.1 billion line of credit extended through TARP. Together with interest and fees, Chrysler Group has now paid $6.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury. It borrowed $5.1 billion from the U.S. government when it began operations under new ownership in June 2009. In addition, the U.S. Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. So is Chrysler now really square with the American taxpayer? The press release doesn't mention it, but there's more to the government's investment in Chrysler than the loans to Chrysler Group LLC. In its own press release about Chrysler's loan repayment, the U.S. Department of Treasury lays out a more complete picture of taxpayer support of Chrysler: "Treasury committed a total of $12.5 billion to Chrysler under TARP’s Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP)," the release states. "With today’s transaction, Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of that amount to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments. Treasury continues to hold a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler. As previously stated, however, Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler." In an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on May 24, 2011, Ron Bloom, assistant to President Obama in charge of manufacturing policy, broke it down more plainly: "Today, Chrysler is reducing their obligation to the U.S. taxpayer by $8 billion. They have previously provided us with $2.6 billion of funds. So, that $10.6 (billion) stacks up against $8.5 billion that the president invested in Chrysler and $4 billion from the prior administration. So, that's over 100 percent of all monies that this administration invested and about 85 percent of the total invested funds by the United States government." So how can the Chrysler Group LLC claim to have squared its obligation to the American taxpayers when only 85 percent of the taxpayers' investment in Chrysler has been recouped? Notice how we keep writing Chrysler Group LLC. There's a reason for that. That's the "new" Chrysler company that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009. We'll let Gualberto Ranieri, head of communications for the Chrysler Group LLC, explain. Ranieri likened the generic use of the word "Chrysler" to a fruit salad, which is made up of lots of different fruits: apples, strawberries, blueberries...you get the idea. When you talk about Chrysler, there's not just one company. There's the "old Chrysler," the company that was liquidated in bankruptcy. There's the "new" Chrysler, aka Chrysler Group LLC, the newly formed company that purchased most of the assets of Old Chrysler in a bankruptcy sale. There's also the financing firms Chrysler Financial and GMAC. "We are not responsible for the old Chrysler," Ranieri said. "We are not responsible for Chrysler Financial. I am not responsible for my brother's loans, even though we have the same last name." Chrysler Group CEO Marchionne can only speak for the new company, Ranieri said, and the government money extended to Chrysler Group has been fully repaid, with interest. That's technically true, Edward Niedermeyer, editor-in-chief of The Truth About Cars website wrote this week. "It does, however, fail to account (again) for the $1.9 billion Debtor-in-Possession 'loan' which financed Chrysler during bankruptcy and was conveniently left to die with the remains of 'Old Chrysler.' Nor does it account for the $1.5 billion loaned to Chrysler’s suppliers to keep them afloat amidst the bailout chaos." Chrysler and its "political bedfellows" should be "forgiven for a little cheering," Niedermeyer wrote. The loan repayment is a positive sign of hope for a once seemingly doomed company. "It’s just that taxpayers still deserve a full and transparent accounting of 'every penny' (to borrow a phrase) that actually went into Chrysler, not just 'loans made in the last two years' or 'loans made by the Obama Administration' or other weasel-wordings employed to make the bailout seem more successful than it is," Niedermeyer wrote. "Though bailout supporters will doubtless argue that 'it doesn’t matter' because Chrysler is alive today and 'that’s what matters,' this doesn’t justify a lack of transparency. In fact, if the bailout was successful because GM and Chrysler survived, that’s all the more reason to not fear the truth about what the bailout actually cost." James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said there was nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money that "went down with the ship with the old shell" of Chrysler. Technically, he said, Chrysler Group LLC is a different company. But from a taxpayers' perspective, there's little distinction. "If the taxpayers were a bank, they wouldn't stay in business very long," he said. "The taxpayers took a loss, or they are still in the red at least." Now, the U.S. Treasury still owns a 6.6 percent common equity stake in Chrysler Group. That has an undetermined value, as the company has not yet gone public. But as the Treasury itself acknowledged, "Treasury is unlikely to fully recover its remaining outstanding investment of $1.9 billion in Chrysler." We asked Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University what he made of Marchionne's statement. "This certainly appears to be another instance of careful language, where all of Chrysler's statement is focused on loans to Chrysler but not the other Treasury investments," White said. "Yes, this appears to be an incomplete statement." As we noted earlier, the statements made by Marchionne were similar to those made by General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre last year. But the situations are different. For one, the government took a much larger equity stake in GM. For more details, see our fact-check related to Whitacre's claims last year. Again, there may be cause for celebratory comments from Chrysler. But Marchionne's statement, while technically accurate, doesn't tell the full story.

pomt-07296	Department of Education officials investigating Virginia Tech shootings "have not once gotten into the car and driven down to Blacksburg to talk to the police chief or the university president or to anyone else."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/20/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-doe-officials-never-visited-virgin/	Announcing Virginia Tech’s appeal of a fine linked to the 2007 massacre there, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli took the U.S. Department of Education to task in late April, calling its investigation and decision "appalling." After a four-year probe into the tragedy -- in which student Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded 25 before taking his own life -- the DOE fined Tech $55,000 for failing to issue a timely warning during the shootings and not following school policies. The penalty is the stiffest allowable under the federal Clery Act, which requires rapid reporting of crimes on college campuses. But officials also sharply rebuked the school, writing "Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute." Cuccinelli plans to appeal the fine. In a scathing written response, the Republican took exception to the department’s ruling and painted the investigation as shoddy. "It is not just that federal bureaucrats are engaging in Monday-morning quarterbacking — it is that they have had four years’ worth of Monday mornings," Cuccinelli said in a news release. "Yet, in all that time, they have not once gotten into the car and driven down to Blacksburg to talk to the police chief or the university president or to anyone else who had to deal with these events in real-time. Their investigation — if you can call it that — appears deeply flawed, and their indifference to the facts on the ground is shocking." Is it true that no department officials visited the scene of the massacre before reaching their decision? We decided to check. Asked how the attorney general came to make such a claim, spokesman Brian Gottstein said that University Counsel Kay Heidbreder was the only member of the school’s policy group to speak who to anyone from DOE. "It was over the phone and DOE did not visit the campus or speak to anyone else," Gottstein said in an email. "All Kay and the DOE representative discussed were procedural investigative issues. He asked no questions about what happened [on April 16, 2007]." The easiest way to get started was to ask the Department of Education if anyone had visited Blacksburg during the investigation. We did that on April 29. Two weeks later, after asking a second time, we got a response. "We had several conversations, interviews and email exchanges with school officials in the process of conducting this review, and there were numerous opportunities throughout the process for Virginia Tech to provide input – most notably as the school did in its official 72-page response to our draft report," wrote Sara Gast, a spokeswoman with the DOE. "The lines of communication were certainly open, and they had multiple chances to respond and communicate with us throughout the entire process. However, because of the sensitive and legal nature of the proceedings, we did not meet with officials face-to-face," she added. Called for comment, Virginia Tech spokesman Larry Hincker said that school officials did contribute to the report submitted to the DOE, but added that they were never asked to be interviewed or even submitted questions relating to the incident. We should note that a state commission investigating the shootings interviewed 34 Tech officials before releasing a 2007 report that also concluded the university failed to issue a timely campus alert about the violence, which occurred over 2-1/2 hours. Virginia reached an $11 million settlement with many of the victims’ families. Two families have filed a $10 million suit against Tech officials that is scheduled for trial this fall. Let’s review. Cuccinelli said DOE officials never visited Virginia Tech while probing the university’s response during the 2007 shootings that left 32 dead. He said the DOE investigators never conducted face-to-face interviews with the Tech officials making decisions that dreadful day. A DOE spokeswoman acknowledged both points, although she said it did not taint the examination. She said there was plenty of communication via email and telephone. We’ll let others debate Cuccinelli’s opinion on the integrity of DOE’s probe. But his claim that DOE investigators never visited Tech to conduct interviews is True.

pomt-14159	Kelly Ayotte "has voted to defund Planned Parenthood" six times.	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/apr/29/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-has-record-voting-/	Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces a competitive reelection bid in New Hampshire and Democrats are already taking aim at her record on abortion and women’s health. Gov. Maggie Hassan, the only Democratic candidate in the race, is one of the latest to lob those criticisms. "She has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides healthcare to about 12,000 Granite State women," Hassan said in a recent interview with the Concord Monitor, referring to Ayotte. "She’s voted to defund them six times." Planned Parenthood, a women’s health care provider that also offers abortions, has become a lightning rod in recent years as elected officials in Washington and in New Hampshire have taken steps to cut the organization’s funding. The organization is no fan of Ayotte: Planned Parenthood’s political arm took out its first ad of the 2016 cycle this month targeting New Hampshire’s junior Senator. We decided to take a closer look at Hassan’s claim. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England runs five health centers across New Hampshire -- in Manchester, Claremont, Derry, Exeter and Keene. And roughly half of the patients who visit a Planned Parenthood clinic across the border in Vermont -- in White River Junction -- are from New Hampshire. The Planned Parenthood centers in New Hampshire all provide contraception, annual exams, STI testing and treatment, and pregnancy testing. The Manchester location, which saw 4,779 patients in 2014, provides surgical and medical abortions. The Keene location, visited by 1,871 patients in 2014, offers medication abortions, according to Kayla McCarthy, with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Altogether Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire served just over 11,000 patients during 2014, according according to Vice President for Public Policy Jennifer Frizzell. Another 1,750 were seen in the White River Junction, VT clinic. That would mean Planned Parenthood clinics together saw roughly 12,000 New Hampshire patients in 2014, in line with Hassan’s claim. Now let’s look at how many times Ayotte has voted against Planned Parenthood funding. Ayotte, elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, has been a consistent opponent of abortion and critic of Planned Parenthood. We checked with Hassan’s campaign and they pointed us to six votes. Three votes took place all on the same day, Dec. 3, 2015. 1) That day the Senate voted 52-47 to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in one bill. Ayotte voted for it. 2) Ayotte voted against an amendment that would have stripped a provision from the bill to defund Planned Parenthood. (The amendment was defeated.) 3) Another amendment, proposed by Democrats, sought to continue federal funding for Planned Parenthood, but it was tabled (that is, set aside) and Ayotte voted in favor of tabling it. (President Obama ultimately vetoed the bill.) 4) Ayotte voted to advance a bill last August that sought to prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood. But the legislation failed to get the 60 votes it needed to move forward. 5) Ayotte voted in April 2011 for a resolution to prohibit federal dollars from funding Planned Parenthood. It failed, 42 to 58. 6) And in March 2011 Ayotte voted for a bill to fund the federal government, that included dozens of other spending items, but blocked federal funding to Planned Parenthood. The bill failed, 44 to 56. Ayotte said at the time: "Our country is in a fiscal crisis… Everyone is going to have to make sacrifices, including many private organizations that have relied on federal resources," according to her office. In all, these six votes show some level opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood. However, some of them were procedural, and not all offered a clean up-or-down funding decision, as Hassan’s statement suggests. Ayotte’s office said she supported several other government spending bills that did not defund Planned Parenthood. And in September 2015, Ayotte voted not to move forward with a temporary government spending bill that sought to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte said at the time she supported defunding Planned Parenthood, but didn’t want to shut the government down to do it. "Kelly Ayotte has voted to direct federal funding away from Planned Parenthood in an effort to better use federal dollars to fill gaps in women's health services for low-income women and preserve access to women’s health services," spokeswoman Liz Johnson said. Our ruling Hassan said Ayotte voted six times to defund Planned Parenthood. Ayotte has been a consistent critic of Planned Parenthood and has shown support for defunding the organization or opposition to continued funding in at least six votes. It’s worth noting that some were procedural votes and several were much larger bills that included a provision on Planned Parenthood funding. Hassan’s claim is accurate, but needs clarification.

pomt-06851	"There’s actually 600 abortions done after the 20th week of pregnancy every year in Ohio."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/04/peggy-lehner/state-sen-peggy-lehner-abortion-foe-says-600-year-/	Abortion rights have been among the top priorities so far this year for the GOP-controlled Ohio legislature -- the governor recently signed a late-term abortion ban and several other abortion-related bills are under consideration. Republican lawmakers’ focus on the issue has drawn criticism from Democrats and others who say the bills do nothing to create jobs, the very platform Republicans across the state campaigned on last year. A pair of Republican lawmakers appeared on a Cleveland radio program recently to discuss the abortion bills and why they are important. Ohio Sen. Peggy Lehner, a Republican from the Dayton area, sponsored the late-term abortion ban requiring doctors to test whether a fetus can live outside the womb when a pregnancy is at least 20 weeks’ along. An abortion is prohibited if tests determine the fetus is viable. "There’s actually 600 abortions done after the 20th week of pregnancy every year in Ohio," Lehner said July 18 on "The Sound of Ideas," a program that airs on 90.3 WCPN. With numerous abortion-related bills pending in the legislature, including the controversial "heartbeat bill," which bans abortion as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lehner’s claim. When we contacted Lehner, she directed us to statistics from the Ohio Department of Health. Lehner also pointed out that the late-term abortion ban, if it had been in effect in past years, would’ve prevented about 200 abortions – the number of abortions in Ohio when the woman was at least 23 weeks’ pregnant, the length of a pregnancy when viability typically sets in. The Ohio Department of Health produces a report each year on abortions in Ohio. The report is based on forms doctors are required to file with the state when an abortion is performed. The forms are confidential; they contain no identifying information about the women who receive the abortions. The report backs up Lehner’s claim. When a pregnancy was at least 20 weeks along, there were 613 abortions in Ohio in 2009, the most recent year data is available. In 2008, there were 603 abortions; there were 690 in 2007, and 694 in 2006. From 1997 to 2005, the number was between 731 and 961. We also checked Lehner’s follow-up point and it also was accurate. In 2009, there were 216 abortions when the pregnancy was at least 23 weeks along. Lehner slightly understated the number of abortions that occurred in the timeframe she referenced during the radio program. Still, her understatement does not undercut the argument she is trying to make. We rate the statement True.	None	Peggy Lehner	None	None	None	2011-08-04T06:00:00	2011-07-18	['Ohio']
pomt-07162	The average person "will pay $6,000 more a year" under Rep. Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal.	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/13/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-rep-paul-ryans-medicare-proposal/	Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Niles, Ohio, shares a last name with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, but the pair don’t share the same vision for Medicare, the U.S. government’s health insurance program for the nation’s elderly and chronically disabled. Republican Paul Ryan’s budget blue print suggests retaining the current Medicare system for people who are currently over age 55 but giving future retirees a "premium support payment" they could use to purchase private insurance, prompting Democrats to accuse the GOP of attempting to dismantle Medicare. Those on the House Energy and Commerce Committee even put out a report that purports to outline the amount of extra Medicare costs that the new program would require taxpayers in every congressional district to pay. Tim Ryan, whose office frequently gets phone calls meant for the other Ryan, took to the House floor on May 24 to denounce the GOP plan. He argued that the value of the proposed vouchers would not keep pace with heath care costs because they’d be linked to the Consumer Price Index, which hasn’t risen as fast as health care costs. "The average person going into this Medicare proposal will pay $6,000 more a year," Ohio’s Ryan said in his speech. Would the GOP plan escalate yearly out-of-pocket health care costs for the elderly as significantly as Tim Ryan claims? The budget by Wisconsin’s Ryan -- which he dubbed "The Path to Prosperity" -- argues that Medicare won’t be able to meet the needs of current seniors or future generations without reforms. It aims to balance the federal budget by slicing $5.8 trillion in government spending over 10 years, reforming taxes and trimming the growth of entitlement programs including Medicare. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that Ryan’s plan would accomplish its budget balancing goals, putting the budget into a surplus by 2040, and reducing federal debt to about 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2050. Much of that would be accomplished by reducing the government’s costs for Medicare. Currently, Medicare is a "fee for service" program, which pays health care providers for each procedure or visit. Instead, Paul Ryan wants the government to issue a subsidy that will pay part - but probably not all - of the cost of a person’s health insurance. The size of that subsidy would depend on the beneficiary’s income and health status. Ryan’s GOP "Path to Prosperity" document calls Medicare a "top-down, government-run system" marked by unnecessary tests, redundant treatment and an inefficient bureaucracy that bungles billings and misplaces records. It contends the system’s "open-ended blank-check commitments to reimburse health-care providers for services" creates incentives for them to bilk the government. Such flaws drive up costs, threatening to "bankrupt the system - and ultimately the nation," the budget document says. Starting in 2022, Paul Ryan’s budget blueprint calls for enrolling new Medicare beneficiaries in a program that would pay "a Medicare premium-support payment" to an insurance plan "chosen by the beneficiary, subsidizing its cost." Existing Medicare beneficiaries could stay in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan, or enroll in the new program. The age for Medicare eligibility would ratchet up by two month increments each year, until it reached 67 in 2033. Analyses by the Congressional Budget Office, which does budgetary analysis for both parties in Congress, and by the Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that Medicare beneficiaries coming into the system after 2022 would spend significantly more for health care under the proposal from Wisconsin’s Ryan. Pegging the growth of the federal government’s Medicare payments to the Consumer Price Index will save the federal government money, but "expose beneficiaries to increasingly larger out-of-pocket costs and risks over time," the Kaiser report says. "First, private plans would cost more than traditional Medicare because of the net effect of differences in payment rates for providers, administrative costs, and utilization of health care services," said CBO’s report on Paul Ryan’s plan. "Second, the government’s contribution would grow more slowly than health care costs, leaving more for beneficiaries to pay." The CBO estimates the net federal premium support payments for a typical 65-year-old would be $8,000, or 39 percent of Medicare spending per enrollee, under the program that would be established by the GOP’s "Path to Prosperity." That means the total cost of providing health care benefits (premium and other costs) to a typical 65-year-old in such a plan would be about $20,500 in 2022. The beneficiary would pay $12,500 in out-of-pocket costs. Using CBO projections, the folks at Kaiser did the math, and determined that if a person who turned 65 in 2022 were to remain in the traditional Medicare system, the out-of-pocket costs would be just $5,630 - a full $6,870 less than it would be under the new program. Kaiser explains it would cost more money to provide benefits under the Republican proposal "because private plans have higher administrative costs and typically pay higher fees to providers than Medicare." "While private plans may be able to achieve lower utilization through tighter costs and care management practices, the CBO believes the total costs of providing a similar benefit package would be higher under private plans than Medicare, and that the differential between the costs under traditional Medicare and the costs under private plans would widen over time," the Kaiser report says. Paul Ryan’s proposal would reduce federal spending for Medicare by providing future beneficiaries with a fixed amount of money they could put towards an insurance premium, leaving them on the hook for significantly greater out-of-pocket payments than they’d pay under the current Medicare system. In his speech, Tim Ryan said said that those new out-of-pocket costs would amount to $6,000 each year, a bit of less than what the CBO calculated. So although perhaps undersold, Tim Ryan’s claim is accurate with nothing significant missing for an understanding. On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates as true.

pomt-06374	Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on gun control.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-accuses-mitt-romney-flip-flopping-gun/	Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey to make fun of Mitt Romney for flip-flopping in a new Web ad. In another item we checked whether the ad's claim that Romney had flip-flopped on abortion was accurate. In this one we're checking the claim that he has switched his position on gun control. In one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, "We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them," and then saying, "And I would protect our Second Amendment rights to bear arms." Clearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on gun control. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate. First, let’s look at some of the things Romney has said about gun control. • In 1994, when he was challenging Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney supported two gun control measures -- the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. Both were strongly opposed by most gun-rights advocates. In a July 1994 question-and-answer session with voters arranged by the Boston Herald, Romney "reaffirmed" his support for both measures, the newspaper said. "I don't think (the waiting period) will have a massive effect on crime, but I think it will have a positive effect," Romney said. In a subsequent interview published on Sept. 23, 1994, Romney said, "I don't want special-interest groups making this their campaign. I don't want their money. I don't want their help. This is my race." In the interview, Romney specifically mentioned gun-rights advocates, acknowledging that his stands on the two gun-control measures would put him at odds with such groups. "That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA," he said, referring to the National Rifle Association. "I don't line up with a lot of special interest groups." • Then, in his 2002 race for governor, Romney said during a debate against against Democrat Shannon O'Brien, "We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them." Fast-forwarding to the present, we couldn’t find much on Romney’s 2011 positions on gun control. The issues section of his website has nothing about it, and the one time the topic came up in a debate -- an attack by Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Sept. 22, 2011, in Orlando, Fla. -- Romney didn’t take the bait. Perry said, "I think Americans just don't know sometimes which Mitt Romney they're dealing with. Is it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment?" But Romney instead chose to respond to Perry’s subsequent charge about his position on health care. So we turned to statements Romney made during the 2008 presidential campaign, when he ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination. • Addressing a group of National Rifle Association members by video on Sept. 10, 2007, Romney said, "Let me speak very directly and candidly about where I stand. I support the Second Amendment as one of the most basic and fundamental rights of every American. It's essential to our functioning as a free society, as are all the liberties enumerated in the Bill of Rights." He repeated that message later that month at a meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. • In a candidate questionnaire published by the Washington Post during the 2008 primary campaign, Romney said this: "Q: Do you think gun control has an impact on crime rates in the United States?" "Romney: The Second Amendment protects the individual right of lawful citizens to keep and bear arms. I strongly support this essential freedom, and I applaud the recent federal appeals court decision in Washington, D.C., which concluded that the Second Amendment protects an individualized right to keep and bear arms. As president, I will support that interpretation and protect the right of every law-abiding American to keep and use firearms. With respect to gun control laws, I believe we need to distinguish between law-abiding gun owners and criminals who use guns. Those who use a firearm during the commission of a crime must be punished severely. The key is to provide law enforcement with the resources they need and punish criminals, not burden lawful gun owners." "Q: Do you think tighter restrictions should be in place for those buying a firearm?" "Romney: No. I believe we need to focus on enforcing our current laws rather than creating new laws that burden lawful gun owners. I believe in safe and responsible gun ownership, and that anyone who exercises the right to keep and bear arms must do so lawfully and properly. I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all federal approach to gun ownership because people keep and use firearms for different reasons. Law-abiding citizens have a right to protect their homes and their families and as president, I will vigorously defend that right." • According to the Boston Globe, Romney appeared on an Internet podcast, "The Glenn and Helen Show," and said that he hoped states would ease regulations on gun owners. He also expressed enthusiasm for guns and hunting. "I have a gun of my own," he was quoted as saying. "I go hunting myself. I'm a member of the NRA and believe firmly in the right to bear arms." • On the Oct. 21, 2007, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer challenged Romney on the evolution of his gun-control position. Schieffer said, "You once said, ‘We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts, I support them, I won't chip away at them. I believe they protect us.’ Now you say you are a gun owner. You have joined the National Rifle Association, after saying at one point, ‘I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.’ Why would you join that group?" Romney began by stating that he had the endorsement of the National Rifle Association during his run for governor, a claim he later had to back away from. He continued, "I support the NRA. I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine. But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. ..." It’s worth noting that between his 1994 and 2002 campaigns and the 2008 presidential campaign, Romney served a four-year term as governor of Massachusetts, during which he signed a major firearms-related bill. A bill he signed in 2004 enacted a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. "These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense," the Globe quoted Romney as saying. "They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people." Despite that provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. The Globe reported that during the 2008 campaign, Romney described the bill as a "consensus measure" and a "positive step." Our ruling The evidence largely supports the contention that Romney has flip-flopped on gun rights, particularly in his tone. Romney’s message during the 1994 and 2002 campaigns was that he was a strong supporter of gun control measures, while in the 2008 president campaign, he played up his pro-Second Amendment credentials and actively sought support from the National Rifle Association and other gun-owner groups. Substantively, the gap -- at least as of the 2008 campaign -- was somewhat narrower. He’s been vague about specific legislation he’d support, and in the interview with Schieffer, Romney acknowledged that "I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine." Still, between his early campaigns and his 2008 presidential run, Romney does appear to have shifted his views. On balance, we rate Huntsman’s claim Mostly True.	None	Jon Huntsman	None	None	None	2011-11-02T17:33:58	2011-10-28	['None']
pomt-05906	"We got [the Quonset Business Park] for free and we’re getting zero dollars out of it into the state coffers … other than the fact that it produces the jobs."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/03/joseph-trillo/rhode-island-state-rep-joseph-trillo-says-quonset-/	State Rep. Joseph A. Trillo wants someone to build a "super-casino" in the Quonset Business Park. It’s a can’t-miss proposition, the Warwick Republican says. Cruise ships could dock at the Port of Davisville, bringing visitors from afar to a 7.5-million-square-foot facility that would include such amenities as an indoor amusement park and an aquarium. In recent weeks, Trillo, the House Minority Whip, has been touting his plan through the media, arguing that developing a casino at the former Navy base would maximize the potential of what he sees as an under-performing state asset. During a debate with state Sen. James Sheehan on Rhode Island PBS’ "A Lively Experiment" -- a portion of which aired Jan. 20 -- Trillo voiced his criticism of the state-owned business park. "We put $45 million into Quonset Point," Trillo said. "We got the place for free and we’re getting zero dollars out of it into the state coffers." "That’s not true," said Sheehan, a North Kingstown Democrat who opposes a casino in Quonset. "Zero dollars other than the fact that it produces the jobs," Trillo countered. "We don’t get any money or any profit from 3,300 acres of land that we got given to us." We wondered whether Trillo’s claim was true. Does the general fund -- what Trillo refers to as "state coffers" -- really get no revenue whatsoever from Quonset? When we called Trillo, he said he was referring specifically to the operation of the business park, which is actually 3,204 acres and is managed by the Quonset Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency under the authority of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation. "There is no profit," he told us. "Every dollar they take in goes into operating the industrial park." We checked the QDC’s annual financial statements to see for ourselves. For the most recent fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2011, the QDC had revenues of $8,314,944 and expenditures of $8,310,750 for a net gain of $4,563. The bulk of revenues -- $5.2 million -- came from rental income on 403 acres that the QDC leases out to private companies. Another $1.9 million was raised through utility sales to tenants of the park. That includes water and sewage treatment services. Earnings for the 2010 fiscal year and the three prior fiscal years followed a similar pattern. The QDC had either a small net gain ($369 in 2010 and $4,347 in 2008) or a small net loss ($50 in 2009 and $2,713 in 2007). In other words, expenditures and revenues have been nearly equivalent in recent years. No profits were channeled into the state’s general fund in all those years -- except one. In 2008, the General Assembly required the QDC to pay $3.5 million into the general fund to cover debt service on $48 million in bonds for road projects and other capital improvements that were approved in 2004. (The amount of the bond issue was incorrectly referred to as $45 million by Trillo in the debate with Sheehan.) That was the only year that the legislature made the QDC contribute to the general fund. We contacted David Preston, spokesman for the QDC, who said that the agency generally pours any profits back into improving the park with better roads, railways and piers. For example, in 2011, the agency spent $1.3 million on capital projects. He also pointed out that in terms of operating expenses the QDC is self-sufficient. It has, however, received taxpayer support for capital projects in the form of the 2004 bond issue and a $22.3-million federal stimulus grant in 2009. Preston also said there is a reason why the QDC does not generate profits: that’s not its purpose. "The mission of the QDC is to create jobs and their record of creating jobs is unmatched in the state," he said. Under the 2004 legislation that created it, the QDC is defined as a "real estate development and management company" whose objectives are encouraging business development, attracting jobs and promoting "the economic development of the state and the general welfare of its citizens." If the agency does what it’s supposed to do, companies are brought into the business park, jobs are created and revenue flows to the state in the form of taxes. That’s not money coming from the QDC itself but it’s money nonetheless. According to a five-year progress report released by the QDC in 2010, there are now 168 companies operating in the business park. They include Electric Boat, Toray Plastics America, Ocean State Job Lot and Hexagon Metrology. The 168 companies collectively employ 8,800 workers. A third of those jobs were created between 2005 and 2009. In the same period, $142.6 million was invested in the park by private companies. The businesses at Quonset pay corporate income tax to the state and their employees pay personal income tax. Preston said that no studies have been done totaling those revenues, but there are snapshots of the amounts of money that come in through taxes. When the Gateway project -- a retail and hotel development at Quonset -- was approved in 2007, construction was expected to generate $9 million in sales tax revenue and $3 million in payroll tax revenue for the state, according to the Economic Development Corporation. In 2008, a consulting firm hired by the QDC estimated that the businesses and workers at the 290-acre Port of Davisville, which is situated inside the park, annually pay the state a total of $3.7 million in corporate income tax, personal income tax, sales tax and excise tax. When Galaxy Nutritional Foods moved to Quonset from Florida in 2009, the EDC projected that the personal income tax revenue to the state for 26 of the company’s positions would total $261,558 between 2010 and 2012. Our ruling During the debate with Sheehan, Trillo was very specific in his criticism of the Quonset Business Park. He said the state doesn’t get "any money or any profit from 3,300 acres of land." On that point, he is technically correct. While the Quonset Development Corporation does collect rent on land in the park, it uses that money for operating expenses and passes none of it on to the state. Trillo also qualified his statement about the business park by adding that the state gets "zero dollars other than the fact that it produces the jobs." That’s a huge qualification. Although the QDC does not contribute directly to the state’s general fund, the state does benefit financially from the businesses in the park. Quonset is home to 168 companies that employ a total of 8,800 people. Those companies and their employees pay millions of dollars in taxes to the state. Trillo chose his words carefully in criticizing the performance of the Quonset Business Park, but he left out important information about its benefits to the state. Because the claim fails to give those details and because it takes things out of context, we rule it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Experts told Fact Check there was no evidence to support the claim that crocodiles were killing people every three months in Queensland. Long-term figures from the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection show a rate of one fatal crocodile attack every three years from 1985 to now. These figures accord with data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which is only available to 2016. The department's data shows fatal crocodile attacks in Queensland have increased in recent years, but not to the rate Mr Katter claims. In the past 10 years there were six deaths, a rate of one every 20 months. There was one death per year in the past three years. And even if Mr Katter was only considering very recent deaths in making his claim, the two most recent fatal attacks occurred in March and October of this year, seven months apart.

pomt-05523	Sen. Sherrod Brown’s vote helped pass "Barack Obama’s job-killing health care law, which slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/12/national-republican-senatorial-committee/national-republican-senatorial-committee-says-heal/	With Congress out for its Easter-Passover break, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown started making the rounds with constituent and factory visits in early April. One of those stops was at the Nucor steel plant in Marion, where the Democratic freshman discussed what he calls the unfair trade practices of China. The National Republican Senatorial Committee meantime had a list of other subjects it thought Brown, who faces reelection in November, should discuss during his local visits. Making suggestions in a pointed news release, NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox said, "One of the things we expect that Brown will not be discussing is his 60th vote for Barack Obama’s job-killing health care law, which slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase." This single statement had several elements that made us say, "Huh?" Was Brown the 60th vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act? That’s a point of dispute, because the NRSC had already said that Montana Democrat Jon Tester had that honor (though Tester’s staff debunked it with a videotape showing him as the 52nd "yes" vote, Politico reported). The NRSC or its affiliates have also accused Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Claire McCaskill of Missouri of casting that crucial vote. Taking heat for being the 60th senator to actually commit that he would vote "yes," thus assuring passage regardless of the order in which the actual roll call went, was Ben Nelson of Nebraska. But Brown certainly voted for the health care bill, so let’s not get hung up on which senator had the ultimate vote. More intriguing than that was the NRSC’s claim that the bill "slapped small businesses throughout Ohio with a $500 billion tax increase." That would be a heck of an increase, were it true. But it is not. Every piece of information the NRSC sent us to back up its $500 billion claim pertained to a national figure, not a figure for a single state. And it applied to all taxes and fees associated with what both parties are now calling Obamacare, not just the portion that would be paid by small businesses. The NRSC’s sources for this included testimony and supporting documents from the Congressional Budget Office, submitted to the House of Representatives’ Energy and Commerce Committee’s health subcommittee on March 30, 2011. PolitiFact recently examined another claim based on this figure and its supporting documents, after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce used the number in an ad criticizing Tester. There’s no need to repeat that examination at length, but we’ll note that PolitiFact found that the $500 billion number was "a fair number for total revenue raised by the 2010 health care law as estimated when Tester voted — but the number for just taxes is lower, likely between $400 billion and $465 billion." The rest was for various other fees and revenue enhancements, which opens a debate as to whether they should be called taxes. But there’s no need for that here. Yes, some businesses will pay higher taxes if the law is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The NRSC sent us plenty of examples from news stories as well as a recent editorial from the Columbus Dispatch. Among the companies already preparing for this are medical device manufacturers like Invacare, based in Elyria, which has estimated a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices could cost it anywhere from $12 million to more than $20 million annually. Backers of the health care law suggest that medical device companies will make up at least some of the revenue because more people will have health insurance and buy medical products. Industry officials are skeptical. Invacare is a global company, however. There are certainly small, Ohio-based companies that will be taxed more under the law. But will these small Ohio businesses be slapped with a $500 billion tax hike, thanks to Brown and others who supported the bill, regardless of their order? No. We are not aware of a good analysis to show the exact share that small Ohio businesses would pay of that $500 billion in new revenue that the government will raise, or whatever the figure will prove to be. We could try to extrapolate, but what’s the point? The NRSC figure is off by a factor of, well, we can’t tell you. We just know that there are 50 states and the CBO figure was for all new revenue nationwide, not just for the share to be paid in taxes by small businesses in Ohio. The NRSC conceded this when we talked it over. Plenty of people dislike the Affordable Care Act. That is a fact. Brown voted for it, and that’s a fact, too. But to pick a national number and apply it to one segment of one state is not accurate and is simply ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter, ridiculous claims get a rating of Pants on Fire!

pomt-10920	"Even the CBO numbers show now that the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/31/larry-kudlow/wh-economic-chief-kudlow-wrongly-says-cbo-agrees-t/	With the economy growing at 4.1 percent in the last quarter, the White House sees vindication of its policies ahead of the midterm elections. Larry Kudlow, top economic adviser to President Donald Trump, pressed a point about the Republican tax cuts in the closing seconds of a CBS interview Sunday. "Even the CBO numbers show now that the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP," Kudlow told Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan on July 29. "These are all good things, Margaret." In light of the Congressional Budget Office’s forecast that deficits will continue to grow, Kudlow’s statement that CBO now projects that the tax cuts will pay for themselves bears a closer look. Key takeaways When the CBO looked at the impacts of the tax cut law, it found that it increased the deficit by a total of $1.8 trillion between 2018 and 2028. That included the economic growth effects of the tax cuts. The CBO’s latest long-range forecast predicted lower revenues than it had before passage of the tax cut law. In the 2018-28 period, the government would collect $884 billion less than the CBO previously forecast. Economists, including a member of CBO’s Board of Economic Advisers, could not identify the source in CBO reports that supported Kudlow’s claim. Tax cuts and tax revenues The central argument for tax cuts is that with lower rates, companies will invest more in plants and equipment, which will make workers more productive. And individuals will have more incentive to work because Uncle Sam will get a smaller slice of their paychecks. A growing economy will, the argument goes, make up for the money the government would have collected through higher tax rates. It would be a big deal if the CBO agreed with this argument. The agency is the nonpartisan budget arm of Congress. The problem for Kudlow is that the CBO hasn’t. "I am quite familiar with the CBO analysis and have no clue what Larry Kudlow is talking about," said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley and a member of CBO's board of economic advisers. The CBO pointed to its April 2018 report. It devoted an appendix to the tax law alone. In this key table below, the section on "macroeconomic feedback" is where the CBO puts its estimate of how higher economic growth from the tax cuts is expected to increase revenues. Tax analyst Nicole Kaeding at the conservative Tax Foundation said Kudlow had exaggerated. Citing the table, she said the CBO expects the tax cuts to reduce deficits by a total of $461 billion over 11 years. "This is well below the $1.5 trillion in static cost of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," Kaeding said. The foundation ran its own analysis that assumed the economic impact would be greater than the CBO predicted. It still came up short. "We estimated a net cost of approximately $450 billion," Kaeding said. Overall, the CBO estimated that the tax cuts would add $1.8 trillion to the nation’s debt. Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw, former chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, told us, "I do not know what numbers Larry (Kudlow) is referring to." "A reasonable rule of thumb, in my judgment, is that about one-third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped via faster economic growth," Mankiw told PolitiFact in 2017. That is pretty much what the CBO estimated. It’s not as though the tax cuts don’t juice the economy. The CBO said they would boost growth by 0.3 percent in 2018 and by 2022, the level of GDP would be a full 1 percent higher than it would have been. The trouble is, the growth alone doesn’t close the revenue gap, and with deficits higher than they would have been, interest rates would also edge up as government borrowing rose. Higher interest rates means Washington will pay more for its borrowed money. That further undercuts the ability of tax cuts to pay for themselves. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Our ruling Kudlow said the CBO agreed that "the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP." The CBO reports do not reach that conclusion. The CBO pointed to its analysis showing the growth impact of the tax cuts reducing deficits by a bit less than a third of the cost of the tax cuts themselves. Economists who know the CBO’s work told us the congressional budget forecasters did not say what Kudlow asserted. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11312	"Obama Announces Bid To Become UN Secretary General"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/blog-posting/no-barack-obama-did-not-announce-bid-un-secretary-/	A website calling itself USA NEWS uses outdated and unfounded information to falsely claim that former President Barack Obama has announced a bid to become the United Nations’ secretary-general. An April 12 post on the website usanews24h.tk said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "reportedly is planning payback for President Obama’s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu’s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year." "Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year," said the story posted in April, more than a year after Obama left office. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Several other elements in the story show that the post is not rooted in current events or facts, including a line that says "U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility." Ban, the UN’s eighth secretary-general, ended his term Dec. 31, 2016. The claim that Obama sought to or intended to become the UN’s secretary-general has been around for several years. USA NEWS’ post includes several sentences that first appeared in a Jan. 8, 2016, post on the Washington Times. That 2016 story attributes its information to a Kuwaiti newspaper, Al-Jarida. A Jan. 12, 2016, editorial in the Washington Times also references the Kuwaiti newspaper, adding that "rumors are floating back from the Middle East" that Obama "is sounding out Democrats, Republicans and friends of the United Nations in the United States to help him get the job of secretary-general of the U.N." The editorial acknowledges that the rumors "might be just another imaginative fairy tale of the Arabian night. The Arab media is addicted to such tales. But Mr. Obama was once described by Bill Clinton as a fairy tale, too, and here he is, completing his second term, and Mr. Obama does not suffer excessive modesty." In January 2016, Israeli media also reported on the Kuwaiti newspaper’s claim, but not without casting doubt on the information. "The report, which admittedly appears somewhat far-fetched, has not been confirmed by any other news outlets and does not name any of its sources," israelnationalnews.com reported. The UN General Assembly appoints its secretary-general, on the recommendation of the Security Council. Any of the Security Council’s five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) can veto the selection. António Guterres, the UN’s ninth secretary-general took office Jan. 1, 2017. The term is for five years. Our ruling USA NEWS claimed, "Obama Announces Bid To Become UN Secretary General." The post includes outdated information and is based on unfounded claims. We rate USA NEWS’ statement Pants on Fire!
